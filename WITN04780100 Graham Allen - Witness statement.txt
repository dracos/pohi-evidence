POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GRAHAM ALLEN

|, MR GRAHAM ALLEN, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | am the Operations Manager for Post Office Account at Fujitsu Services Limited
(‘Fujitsu’), a position that | have held since January 2022. This role incorporates part
of my previous role in managing most of the teams that deliver application changes
to the Horizon Online applications.

2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office Horizon
IT Inquiry with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to Fujitsu on 11
March 2022 and a series of further questions provided to me by the Inquiry on 1 July
2022 (the “Request”), to the extent | have direct knowledge of such matters.

3. The topics set out in the Request relate to events that took place more than 12 years
ago. These topics relate to the initial and high-volume pilots of Horizon Online in the
period 2007 to 2010, and the robustness of Horizon Online. In preparing this witness
statement, | have provided information to the best of my ability where my recollection

is strong; however, there are questions and events where my recollection is limited.

4. In preparing this statement, | have refreshed my memory by reviewing
contemporaneous documents relating to the questions asked by the Inquiry in the
Request. Where relevant to the Request, these documents are referred to using
references WITN0478_01/1 — WITN0478_01/17 and are listed in the index
accompanying this statement. To the extent that these documents have not already
been provided to the Inquiry, they are exhibited to this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. | joined ICL Retail in 1991 as a Graduate Developer, later progressing and becoming
an Application Development Manager. In 2007 | started working on the project to
implement Horizon Online (the “Project”). From about 2012 to 2017, | did not work
on the Post Office Account at Fujitsu, and | was not involved in any projects or other
work relating to Horizon Online. In 2017, | returned to the Post Office Account and
started again working on matters relating to Horizon Online.

6. The Project had two parts:

a. developing a brand new branch application, called ‘the counter’; and
b. migrating the datacentre applications to a new datacentre.

7. When | joined the Project, it was halfway through its delivery and the initial pilot was
due to commence. | recall that the architecture for Horizon Online was nearing
completion, the design and development of the applications was underway, and the
installation of hardware in the datacentre had commenced. Alan D’Alvarez had
completed a review of the delivery challenges the Project was experiencing at the
time, and had made recommendations concerning how the Project could be

improved. My development teams would have been involved in implementing the

Page 2 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

recommendations from the review that were taken forward, but | do not recall what
these were.

. The development teams that | oversaw had approximately 100 to 150 staff. | was
responsible for ensuring these teams had enough resources to support the Project,
and helping to resolve conflicts in resourcing or technical challenges. My teams only
worked on Horizon Online. The resources | was responsible for were the people
working on the design and development of software, including any amendments to
the software. In terms of other resources relating to staffing, there were multiple other
disciplines including project and programme managers, hardware and software
architects, hardware engineers, and release specialists among many others. Other
resources not relating to people and staffing included facilities and space, hardware,
software tools and all things required to deliver an IT programme. Whilst this was my
primary role, my role changed over time and my experience in applications
development and the understanding | gained of the Horizon Online system allowed
me to assist with understanding, describing, communicating and resolving issues as
necessary.

. My team and | reported into the Head of Applications, Barbara Perek, who reported
into the Programme Director, who at the time | joined was Martyn Hughes. The
members of the Project team changed for various reasons until Alan D’Alvarez, who
was the Programme Manager of the Project at the time of the pilot and rollout of
Horizon Online. Fujitsu is a matrix organisation and so the Head of Applications,
myself and all my team worked for Application Services, which was part of Core

Services and were on assignment to the Project. | recall observing that there was

Page 3 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

generally good interaction between all teams involved in the Project, including teams
from Fujitsu and the Post Office, and | am not aware of any technical or operational
issues that could not be resolved due to poor interactions or relationships amongst
individuals or teams working on the Project. | was also involved in Fujitsu’s internal
‘weekly programme boards’, where the team managers and project managers
reviewed the progress of the Project, and any challenges being faced, with the
Project’s senior management. | cannot recall any of the specific discussions in these
weekly programme boards in relation to the Project but they were mainly focussed on
the many issues that occurred and needed to be resolved.

10.The Project also involved a team from Post Office Limited (the “Post Office”), and
there were communication mechanisms in place regarding project progress and
about which Post Office branches were to be migrated from the existing Horizon
system (now referred to as “Legacy Horizon”) to Horizon Online, as well as success
markers for those Post Office branch migrations. This process was planned and
operated by the implementation team. | do not recall being responsible for any
specific communication mechanisms. Having reviewed the ‘Notes of Horizon Next
Generation Joint Progress/Release Board Meeting of 25 February 2010’
(WITN0478_01/1) and ‘HNG — Post Office Highlight Report (for Joint Release Board)’
dated 3 March 2010 (WITN0478_01/2), | do recall being involved in a weekly joint
steering board meeting, which is an example of a communication mechanism
involving Post Office and Fujitsu during the pilot and rollout of Horizon Online where

the progress of Post Office branch migrations was discussed.

WITN04780100
WITN04780100

11.Post Office staff were often on site in Fujitsu’s office in Bracknell (“Bracknell”) and at
the time, the Post Office were operating a joint test team with Fujitsu based at
Bracknell and so Post Office employees were always present. Based on my
experience, the relationship between Fujitsu and the Post Office was a typical
customer and supplier relationship, which was naturally challenging if project
timelines were running later than anticipated for example. Whilst | do not recall
specific issues that occurred at the time, | do recall that when | joined there was an
expectation the Project would be completed in approximately six months, which as
we know now took approximately three years. This gives an indication that there were
significant challenges to overcome.

12.1 was not involved in any contractual matters relating to Horizon Online, nor aware
with any certainty of Fujitsu’s or the Post Office’s contractual obligations in relation to
Horizon Online.

TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING THE INITIAL PILOT

13.Horizon Online initially experienced many issues, which in my experience, were
typical of large IT projects, both in terms of the volume and types of issues. As | was
responsible for overseeing the development teams, technical issues would only be
escalated to me if the issue was complex or serious. An example of a complex or
serious issue is where the issue is affecting Post Office branches, likely to cause a
delay to project timelines, or needs particular focus from one or more of my teams.
Given how long ago these events took place, my recollection of specific technical

issues that were identified during the initial pilot of Horizon Online is limited.

Page 5 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

14.1 can recall that the first night of the Horizon Online pilot was problematic. The
mechanism of migrating a branch from Legacy Horizon to Horizon Online was
complicated; the branch could not trade on a mixture of the two systems and was
therefore designed to ensure that sufficient counters switched over or the whole
branch rolled back automatically. | cannot recall the cause of the failure, how serious
the technical issue was, or the impact of the technical issue on those first branches;
| only recall being woken early on a Saturday morning to join calls to help support the
people diagnosing the problem. However, having reviewed the documents which |
reference below at paragraph [14(b)], | am able to provide the following information:
a. The initial technical issues experienced during the initial pilot related to the

upgrade mechanism for migrating Post Office branches from Legacy Horizon to
Horizon Online. These technical issues resulted in some branch migrations being
unsuccessful and two Post Office branches not being able to trade for part of the
first day following their migration to Horizon Online until those branches were
rolled back to Legacy Horizon. As the initial pilot was a significant step for the
Project, | was part of the team involved in co-ordinating teams to investigate and
resolve the issue.

b. Following the resolution of the initial technical issues noted at paragraph [14(a)],
there were some further issues with three Post Office branches, which required
significant attention and hence my involvement. Two of these issues would have
resulted in discrepancies in Post Office branch accounts, which were resolved
and the root cause of the issues fixed before the initial pilot was continued. ‘Root

Cause Analysis’ reports were produced at the time which indicated what occurred

Page 6 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

for two of the issues, for example, the ‘Issue of Duplicate Settlements found at
Derby’ (WITN0478_01/3) and ‘Rollover Issues at Warwick’ (WITN0478_01/4). At
the time, these issues were monitored jointly by Fujitsu and Post Office in an
‘HNG-X Daily Issues’ report, which was discussed during meetings concerning
‘Horizon Next Generation Implementation’. Examples of these documents are the
‘HNG-X Daily Issues’ report (WITN0478_01/5) and notes of the ‘Horizon Next
Generation Implementation’ meeting on 8 February 2010 (WITN0478_01/6),
which were emailed to Post Office and Fujitsu employees, including myself, on 8
February 2010 (WITN0478_01/7).
15.1 can also recall the following issues:

a. There were constraints which made it harder to deliver the technical solutions.
For example, the newly developed counter application still had to work on the
Microsoft NT4 Operating System (“NT4”), as it was viewed as too expensive to
upgrade to more current technology. This created challenges for the architecture
and development of the application. | do not recall being involved in the decisions
concerning whether to upgrade the operating system in Post Office branches
from NT4, and | do not have knowledge of which persons or entities considered
such an upgrade as too expensive, however | assumed that it was the Post Office
at the time. | cannot recall further specific instances of other constraints that
related to the Project.

b. The work required to deliver the Project was greater than what was expected
when the work was proposed and contracted, and therefore took longer to deliver.

As the Project progressed in detail, a lot of additional work was uncovered. As |

Page 7 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

was not responsible for any aspect of the commercial agreement between Fujitsu
and Post Office, | have no knowledge as to whether Fujitsu charged Post Office
for this additional work. | recall that there was a ‘Capped Time and Materials’
arrangement, however | cannot explain what these arrangements were. | can
recall that there were three specific reasons why the work required was greater
than expected, and in my experience these three issues occur on many projects:

i. | When contracts relating to large IT projects are entered, the exact detail of
how something will be achieved is not always known and assumptions
have to be made regarding how it will be done. If those assumptions prove
false, work and costs may increase.

ii. Work can simply take longer than originally thought; this can also have
knock-on effects and delay the next part or stage of the project, causing
costs to increase.

iii. Products that are relied upon or otherwise important to the operation of the
system do not do exactly what is expected, or detailed development work
uncovers unknown problems.

There were challenges around explaining the requirements to the development

teams in a way that allowed them to understand what they needed to do. For

example, the Horizon Online counter application needed to be functionally
equivalent to the Legacy Horizon application but to ensure no infringement of
intellectual property rights, developers were not allowed access to the Legacy

Horizon application. Hence, if requirements were not very detailed (which they

were not in my recollection in all cases), it was much harder to develop the

Page 8 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

application. My understanding is that Post Office set the requirements in a system
called ‘Doors’, which was managed by Post Office. Fujitsu had a Requirements
Manager who managed the requirements on behalf of Fujitsu, and who would
have distributed the requirements to the relevant Fujitsu teams. | recall that there
was a mechanism to trace that requirements had been met and have this agreed
by Post Office, but beyond this, | cannot recall being involved in the process day
to day nor recall any more detail as to how this operated or how the requirements
were provided to the development teams.

16. Other technical issues would have been in relation to specific Post Office branches,
involving matters such as printers not working, or an issue with the connection
between the network and the counter at the branch. | recollect an awareness of these
technical issues but no specific details, however | would have made aware of such
technical issues as | received information typically via email about the volume of
incidents affecting Post Office branches. For example, on 27 May 2010, | received an
email from Graham Welsh (Migration Governance Manager for the Royal Mail Group
Account at Fujitsu) (WITN0478_01/8). The email was sent to a number of Fujitsu and
Post Office employees, and attached to the email was a ‘HNGX trends and restarts’
report dated 27 May 2010 (WITN0478_01/9), which contained information concerning
incident trends relating to the migration of Post Office branches from Legacy Horizon
to Horizon Online.

SUSPENSION OF THE HIGH-VOLUME PILOT

17.The high-volume pilot was suspended due to a problem involving Horizon Online’s

databases. Shortly before the high-volume pilot was suspended, approximately one

Page 9 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

thousand Post Office branches had been migrated to Horizon Online. During this time
an issue occurred that caused the database to crash, due to a bug in the Oracle
database management software (the “Oracle Database Issue”).

Horizon Online’s databases

18.The Horizon Online database in the datacentre is designed to be resilient; the
database is a four node cluster that balances the load from the Post Office branches.
The database is designed to work at maximum load with only three of these nodes
operating.

19.The Post Office branches need the database to be able to operate. The technical
issue was that one of the database nodes had a problem; instead of the other nodes
being able to take the load, the communications layer in the Oracle database
management software between the four nodes exhibited a problem which caused the
other three nodes to crash as well.

20. In going through this | am conscious that | cannot fully explain the cause of the issue
that broke the first node. | have some recollection that the interaction of the ‘Branch
Access Layer’, which sits between the counters and the database, was placing undue
load on the database and causing the initial failure. However, | note that Oracle
prepared a ‘Root Cause Analysis’ report (“Oracle RCA Report”) for Fujitsu in relation
to the Oracle Database Issue dated 5 July 2010 (WITN0478_01/10), which explains
the cause of the issue.

21.The Horizon Online system is reliant on the database. The counter application was in
effect directly accessing the database, and without it, the counter could not process

transactions and could not work, and | do not believe the Post Office had a manual

Page 10 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

back-up system. In my experience, the decision not to have a manual back-up system
is a business decision based on the likelihood of the risk occurring, the impact of
having a Post Office branch shut down and the cost of having a manual back-up
system. | do not and would not have had access, at the relevant time, to the
information necessary to determine if Post Office should have had a manual back-up
system. In my professional experience, in the case of Post Office, many of the
transactions are complicated by their nature, as they require a connection between
the Post Office branch to systems outside of the branch in order to complete the
transaction, and a manual back-up system would only cover certain transactions such
as selling stamps, which are simpler in that they do not require a connection outside
the branch to complete the transaction. For this reason, whilst there is benefit in a
manual back-up system to keep a branch open, such a back-up system would not
allow the full range of transactions to occur. | do not recall there being any discussions
between Fujitsu and Post Office about whether Post Office should have had a manual
back-up system. However, | believe that at the time, Post Office had the architectural
understanding of how the Horizon Online system was reliant on the database and the
consequences if that database experienced failure.

22.Consequently, the Post Office had to close those branches that were affected by the
Oracle Database Issue as they could not trade. There were several repeated
incidents, which occurred over multiple weeks, where Post Office branches had to
close.

23.The Subpostmasters of Post Office branches affected by the Oracle Database Issue

would have generally received an ‘error message’. The type of error message would

Page 11 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

depend on the stage of the transaction. An example would be that the transaction
‘timed out’.

Escalation of the issue and suspension of the high-volume pilot

24. The escalation process that was followed in response to the Oracle Database Issue
was the same as any ‘Priority 1 Incident’ at Fujitsu. When Post Office branches
experience and report system failures, the matter is referred to Fujitsu’s service team,
and a communication is sent to all relevant technical staff and management. A ‘bridge’
is then set up, which is a conference call with all of the people who might be able to
resolve the problem.

25. Independently of these reports from Post Office branches, Fujitsu’s technical support
teams could also see that there was a problem as part of its ongoing monitoring.
Technical support staff could see that something was going wrong on the system
before it happened. | cannot categorically say how this specific issue was identified
by the technical support staff as | was not present with them at the time that the
problem was identified. However, | do recall that the general process for system
monitoring involved issues being flagged to technical support staff, such as memory
or disk space being utilised beyond expected levels. If one or more of these monitored
areas were flagged as operating outside of the normal or expected levels and
worsening, this indicated to the technical support staff that an issue was likely to
occur. After seeing a chain of events occur once or twice, the technical support staff
would learn the pattern and predict that the problem would reoccur shortly. In many
instances, this monitoring would allow technical staff to fix issues before they

impacted Post Office branches, however in this instance, they could not.

Page 12 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

26.Soon after the issue was identified, it was escalated to the Project's senior
management, and | was part of a team who assisted in managing the issue.

27.1 was not involved in the decision to suspend the high-volume pilot, which involved
the Project’s senior management. Once it was identified that the problem was causing
Post Office branches to close, the high-volume pilot would have been suspended. |
cannot recall who was involved in the decision to suspend the high-volume pilot,
however | do recall that from Fujitsu, Alan D’Alvarez was involved in the discussions.

28.Following the suspension of the high-volume pilot, the Post Office Account was put
on ‘Corporate Red Alert’. Fujitsu has a standard Corporate Red Alert process, which
involves a daily call with senior staff from the relevant programme and Fujitsu to
provide updates, try to resolve the problem, and then escalate the matter within
Fujitsu or to any third parties. | do not recall being involved in the ‘red alert’
discussions relating to the suspension of the high-volume pilot, but | recall assisting
with the process of resolution.

STEPS TAKEN TO RESOLVE TECHNICAL ISSUES PRIOR TO ROLLOUT

Fujitsu’s processes for resolving technical issues

29.The implementation and development teams involved in the Project followed the
processes described in Fujitsu’s technical documents for resolving issues. These
documents outline the steps that are to be taken by Fujitsu employees to resolve
technical issues, which were followed in the case of the issues identified during the
Horizon Online pilots and rollout. An example of a technical document specifically
relating to my team and the interactions for resolving issues is the ‘Operational Level

Agreement for 4" line support of HNGX’ dated 14 January 2010 (WITN0478_01/11).

Page 13 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

30.Where technical issues were raised as part of the implementation process (i.e., the
migration of Post Office branches as part of the Horizon Online pilots and rollout),
Fujitsu dealt with those issues in the usual way: PEAKs would have been raised, and
the development teams would have been involved in resolving the PEAKs. Higher-
level issues would have also been discussed at the weekly programme board
meetings. | do not recall being concerned in relation to the volume of PEAKs that
were raised at the time, and | do not recall being concerned that PEAKs were not
being addressed effectively, including in relation to Fujitsu communicating with Post
Office about the existence of PEAKs. However any PEAKs that were identified as
causing a discrepancy in branch accounts, such as the PEAK relating to the issue
noted at paragraph [14(b)] above, would have caused me concern at the time.
31.Once a Post Office branch was ‘live’, any issues — technical or otherwise — would
have fallen into standard support procedures. This generally involved the branch
raising the issue with the helpdesk, which could then refer the issue to the support
teams. However, as my role at this time was concerned with the implementation of
Horizon Online, | was not involved with the helpdesk or support teams and my work
did not involve the standard support procedures beyond my teams being 4" Line
Support, as detailed in the operational level agreement document that | mentioned
above (WITN0478_01/11). For this reason, | cannot provide further details about how
issues were raised or the standard support procedures based on my own knowledge.
Resolving technical issues identified during the initial pilot of Horizon Online
32.As | have explained in this statement above at [13], Horizon Online experienced a

number of technical issues that are typically experienced in large IT projects. These

Page 14 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

technical issues were resolved by following the normal processes that were in place
at that time to identify, diagnose and resolve these types of issues. | was not generally
involved in resolving these types of technical issues unless they were complex or of
particular significance. For these reasons, | cannot recall what steps were taken to
resolve specific technical issues identified during the initial pilot of Horizon Online.

33.Whilst | was involved in resolving certain technical issues during the initial pilot, as |
have noted at paragraph [14] of my statement above, | cannot recall if any of these
technical issues remained unresolved through the rollout of Horizon Online. It is
common practice in any IT project for technical issues that are typically experienced
to remain unresolved during rollout, as long as each technical issue is assessed as
not causing unexpected business impact. These issues would be resolved in further
releases at a later date. In my experience, it is common for parties involved in a large
IT project to agree to such arrangements.

Resolving technical issues identified during the high-volume pilot

34.The Oracle Database Issue was a complex and significant technical issue, which
required detailed data from log files and an in-depth understanding of the workings of
Oracle software. The issue was extremely difficult to diagnose and the resolution
involved many technical support staff from many teams. For these reasons, | was
more directly aware of this issue and part of the team involved in helping the teams
resolve it. At the time, | recall that the occurrence of the issue was not predictable,
and finding the trigger and the cause for the Oracle Database Issue within the log
files required highly specialised staff. There were multiple strands of investigation and

many different resolutions and changes applied to resolve the Oracle Database Issue

Page 15 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

and its associated problems, which in my experience, indicates it was not a simple
problem to identify and resolve. In the end, it was the resolution provided by Oracle
that allowed the high-volume pilot and rollout to complete.

35.Fujitsu increased the number of staff working to identify the cause of the Oracle
Database Issue. The development teams considered the problem related to Oracle,
and Fujitsu then raised the issue with Oracle.

36. Fujitsu engaged Oracle’s support team and then Oracle’s professional services team,
and paid for their senior staff to come on site at Bracknell. The issue was eventually
escalated to Oracle’s senior management. This process took a number of weeks.
Fujitsu managed the escalation of the issue with Oracle. As far as | can recall, the
Post Office was not involved in the escalation of the issue with Oracle, but | recall that
Post Office was aware of the Oracle Database Issue.

37.Oracle maintained for some time that the way Fujitsu was using their product was the
cause of the issue, and Fujitsu argued it was using Oracle’s product in accordance
with Oracle’s technical documents. Following further investigations by Oracle and a
robust conversation between Fujitsu and Oracle, Oracle agreed that the cause of the
problem was within Oracle. Examples of the correspondence between Fujitsu and
Oracle, which involve individuals who were involved in the liaison between Fujitsu
and Oracle, include:

a. an email from Richard Watt (Oracle) dated 26 May 2010 (WITN0478_01/12)
attaching version 1.7 of the Oracle RCA Report (WITN0478_01/13);
b. an email chain involving Fujitsu and Oracle employees dated 30 May 2010

(WITNO478_01/14);

Page 16 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

c. an email chain involving Fujitsu and Oracle employees dated 1 June 2010
(WITN0478_01/15); and

d. an email from Richard Watt (Oracle) dated 7 June 2010 (WITN0478_01/16)
attaching version 1.8 of the Oracle RCA Report (WITN0478_01/17).

38.The emails noted in paragraphs [37(a)] and [37(d)] above also indicate that feedback
from myself and Jim Singh caused Oracle to adjust the wording in the Oracle RCA
Report as to the root cause of the Oracle Database Issue, which is noted at page 4
of versions 1.7 and 1.8 of the Oracle RCA Reports.

39. It had become apparent that Horizon Online was using Oracle’s product in a way that
was pushing an element of Oracle to its limit, which had not been done before. Oracle
diagnosed the problem and then developed a software fix (known as a ‘software
patch’) (the “Oracle Fix”), which was provided to Fujitsu. Fujitsu then took steps to
prove the effectiveness of the solution, test it, and roll it out.

40.Before the Horizon Online system went ‘live’, volume and performance testing was
completed on the volume testing environment, which was built on the hardware that
would make up the live system. However, once Horizon Online went live, the Project
did not have a separate volume testing system to test the Oracle Fix. To test the
effectiveness of the Oracle Fix and prove that it would resolve the Oracle Database
Issue, the teams created the Oracle Database Issue in another test environment by
expanding it sufficiently to create an environment which was sufficient to replicate the
issue and demonstrate that the fix would resolve the problem. Fujitsu then applied
the Oracle Fix to the live solution, which resolved the issue, and continued monitoring

the matter.

WITN04780100
WITN04780100

41.Following this, an agreement was reached between Fujitsu and the Post Office to
start the rollout again. The migration of further Post Office branches then resumed,
and | do not recall there being further problems concerning the database.

42. Following the resolution of the Oracle Database Issue, there continued to be technical
issues of a more individual and typical nature, however | cannot recall any specific
technical issues nor how they were resolved. These technical issues would not have
been generally raised with me, for the reasons | outline in [13] in this statement.

THE ROBUSTNESS OF HORIZON ONLINE

43.During and after my involvement with the Project, | did not have any concerns
regarding the robustness of Horizon Online. In my opinion as an IT professional, all
IT systems have issues and | have highlighted that two of these issues caused
discrepancies in Post Office branch accounts during the initial pilot of Horizon Online,
and that these issues were identified, communicated and resolved. Whilst | cannot
recall any other specific issues affecting the accuracy and integrity of the data
recorded and processed by Horizon Online, it is likely there would have been other
such issues, however | do not recall being made aware of any issues that were not
identified, communicated and resolved appropriately. At the relevant time, | was and
continue to be aware of the importance of data accuracy and integrity in relation to
causing discrepancies and shortfalls, and | recall that this understanding of the
importance of data accuracy and integrity was shared within Fujitsu.

44.| am aware that Horizon Online has processes to reconcile and audit transactions
and that these processes are designed to identify errors in data and identify

discrepancies and shortfalls but | am not an expert in this so cannot be more specific.

Page 18 of 21
WITN04780100
WITN04780100

45.1 am aware that Horizon Online has a number of built in back-up mechanisms,
resilience and dual-running systems that are designed to allow Horizon Online to
continue to operate in adverse conditions. For example, the Branch Access Layer
that | mentioned at paragraph [20] above has several instances (or copies) running
that work together and Horizon Online is designed to operate if one or more of these
fail. Another example is the four node cluster | described at paragraph [18] above.
And ultimately, there is a Disaster Recovery site for the Data Centre.

46.| have no awareness of any specific communication concerning the information that
was provided to the Post Office or the government by ICL Pathway concerning the

matters discussed in paragraph [45] of my statement.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
