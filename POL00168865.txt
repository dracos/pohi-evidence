Dear Sirs,
Re: Damion Peter Owen

We write to your firm as being the solicitors on the file representing this defendant in the
proceedings which resulted in him being sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 months
duration for an offence of theft.

On the 8 July 2013 a report into the operations of the Horizon system was published by
an independent organisation which had been commissioned by our clients, Post Office
Ltd. The report is known as the Second Sight Interim report.

We have thoroughly reviewed both the prosecution case and that of your client in the light
of material contained within the Second Sight Interim report. We have also reconsidered
our disclosure duties under the CPIA 1996 and the Code of Practice enacted thereunder,
and the A-G’s Guidelines on Disclosure. We are also alive to our duties under the common
law relating to cases which have been concluded.

We have formed the firm view that, had the prosecution been possessed of the material
contained within the report during the currency of the prosecution of your client, we
should and would have disclosed that material to you in compliance with our disclosure
duties.

The prosecution recognises its obligation post conviction to disclose any information
which may affect the safety of a conviction. Accordingly we now disclose the Second Sight
Interim report to you so that you are able to consider whether your client may have
grounds for an appeal against his conviction.

We would also remind you of your duty not to disclose this material to any third party
other than your client.

Yours faithfully,

Simon Clarke
Barrister
