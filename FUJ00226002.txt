Hi Andy,

Apologises, I thought I'd emailed you previously.

Our Barrister has advised and we have agreed that it is not in the public interest to continue the prosecution. (This was
‘hinted at’ by the Judge when we attended for the previous trial)

At the hearing last month we offered no evidence so the case has been closed.

Thanks for your assistance in this case.
Regards,

CK

Andy,

I've just heard that the trial is being held at Magistrates Court not the Crown Court.
The Barrister suggests you arrive by 13:00hrs on Monday. The aim is to get you on by the end of the day.

Can you also bring a Keypad as an example. And a copy of the CD with your evidence on please.

Any problems please give me a call. Can you also acknowledge the receipt of this email.
