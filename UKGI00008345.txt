1.3 Disclosure was completed on 18 May 2018:

1.3.1. Post Office disclosed more than-200,000 documents, compared to less than 5,000

3.1.1

4. Security for Costs

4.1 On 16 February 2018 Post Office applied to the Court for the Claimants to provide
“security for costs”, so that there is a source of funds available to Post Office should it be
successful in the litigation and the Claimants ordered to contribute towards its costs. This
application can nowsbe progressed following the Court's approval of Post Office’s budget.

4.2 The Claimants ‘seem to accept the principle that some form of security should be provided.
There is however dispute between the parties over the:

Amount of Security - the Claimants have offered £2.5m, when a conservative
“estimate against Post Office’s Court-approved budget is c.£6.5m; and

4.2.1

Form of Security - the Claimants have revised the wording in the insurance policy
taken to cover their exposure to Post Office’s costs. We are considering whether
this adequately addresses the risk that the policy is avoided due to fraud by the
Claimants. Adequate security should take a form “as good as cash”.

4.3 The Court will be asked to rule on security in the absence of any agreement between the
parties. A hearing to determine this issue will likely take place in mid to late September
2018.
