Jason -

Following our recent call and emails, I am sending you without prejudice a draft of the report I am working
on, to indicate better to you the direction of the work, and to explore further whether we could usefully
collaborate in any way. Perhaps we can schedule a further call to discuss that.

Best wishes

Robert
