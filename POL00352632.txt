I suggest we say - we have made the position clear in our report and in our statement. We have published very detailed
update. It is regrettable that a misleading impression is being created.

Inevitably R5SLive are asking, on the back of our statement — are we saying Mr Arbuthnot is

wrong? Since he’s standing down I am tempted to just go back with “yes” but I guess that’s
unacceptable! Also it’s semantics re the word “sacking”

I was going to say: “Mr Arbuthnot’s question could create a very inaccurate impression because we are
not suppressing Second Sight’s report or destroying documents”

or something like that.

Would appreciate advice re how far to go (although we need to stay measured to avoid a story on PO
calling him a liar!)

Thanks
