Dear Mrs Palmer

1am writing following our meeting on 9" March 2006 in which you put
forward reasons why your contract for services should not be summarily
terminated.

I have reviewed the papers relating to this case very carefully and have taken
into account the points you have put forward.

After consideration I have decided to summarily terminate your contract for
services as Subpostmaster of The Grange from the date of your suspension,
on the grounds that you used Post Office Ltd funds for private purposes in
contravention of your Contract for Services Section 12.3 and did not
complete accounts in a form prescribed by Post Office Ltd in contravention
of your Contract for Services Section 12.4.

You may, if you wish, appeal against my decision. If itis your intention to
appeal, you should notify me, in writing by 7° April 2006. The format of the
appeal can be either be a personal interview or written submission. Should
you wish to progress this avenue, I will arrange for the appeal to be heard by
amember of Post Office Ltd Appeals Authority.
