0.1.4 CHANGE HISTORY

The first issue was a snapshot of the position as at 27/11/98
comprising 46 entries.

Version 0.2 included a second table for entries where the review was
complete: the first will hold items that are new or remain in review; the
second will record items where the review is complete.

Version 0.3 populated the second table. It included items originating
up to circa 3/12 and the categories of OPEN, where items are in
course of evaluation, and NOFIX, where a conscious proposal is made
not to fix a problem

The tables included a column showing whether items constitute
Acceptance Incidents for population during the Live Trial phase and a
column to show when items are planned to be cleared.

Version 0.4 added a status column (OK?) and changed the function of
the second table to hold those items which are removed from
consideration typically because they are problems that have been
solved or were judged not to be problems. Items where review is
complete are to be noted in the Status column and entries that are

unchanged from the previous version are to be shown using a shaded
background. Because of the revised presentation all entries are left
unshaded at Version 0.5. Several have been transferred to the second
table usually because they have been judged as “no fault” by the
Authorities or because Pathway has Closed them.

Some Problem Descriptions were changed to improve understanding.
Where applicable these described the probability of occurrence and
the workaround. The PinlCL / Ref was expanded to show the version
of the KPR in which an item first appeared.

A number of problems for which resolution was originally scheduled at
BOLT were cleared by BMOT.

Version 0.5, corresponding to the end of MOT / start of Live Trial, was
substantially prepared during 12-19 March as planned. Unchanged
entries were distinguished by a shaded background. Changed entries
are not otherwise marked. New entries are distinguished by the
version field within the PinICL / Ref column.

The item for PinICL 17586 has been significantly revised following
Colin Oudot’s letter of 9 February 1999.

Version 0.51: At the plenary review on 19/3/99 the EPOSS, TIP and
Reference Data categories were reviewed and dispositions made.
These were recorded in Version 0.51, 19/3/99. Some descriptions
were revised. These are character-highlighted (in yellow).

20115, 21669

Deleted as of Pathway interest only:

Removed as to be the subject of Targeted Testing:
22348, 22495, 18348

Version 0.52: At the plenary reviews on 22 and 23/3/99 the BPS, Audit,
Reconciliation, Security, Infrastructure and APS categories were
reviewed and further dispositions made.

A number of additional candidate problems arising from POCL analysis
of MOT, E2E were tabled on 19-23/3/99. All such candidate problems
with Pathway for progressing have now been Closed or presented for
Closure, or recorded on the KPR.

Descriptions, where revised, were character-highlighted (in yellow).
Highlights made at Version 0.51 were also retained.

All entries were updated where possible to be current as at close of
play 26/3/99.

PinICL references 15064 and 15658 have been removed from multi-
entries as now Closed. A number of entries are now ready for transfer
to the Cleared Items Table.

At Version 0.52 there were approximately 139 live entries, allowing for
items awaiting transfer to the Cleared Items table.

Version 1.0 was a baselined version to document the position as at the
entry to Live Trial. It takes account of comments received on Version
0.52, closures and late new or recidivist PinlICLs from the run up to
closing the Live Trial baseline, and documenting issues remaining
after targeted test.

All highlights were removed.

The following PinICLs were Closed and transferred to the Cleared
Items Table:

19503, 20665, 17398, 22202, 13284, 14986, 16998, 19336, 22779,
16645, 16235, 21030, 18961, 22337, 22566, 22370.

The following were added to document Targeted Testing incidents:
23530, 22677, 23631, 22171, 22224, 23716, 23717, 23718

The following were added to document current Work In Progress:

PinICL 22536 was renumbered as 23750.

At version 1.0 there were 146 live entries allowing for items Closed
within Pathway.

Closures were achieved. In addition several closures that were
planned for NR2+ were brought forward to CSR. The Release for
closure has been updated to CSR in the first table.

Version 2.0 records the position at completion of BIT Regression of
Release CSR. Of the Closures recorded at Version 1.1 three were
tested as unsuccessful. The affected entries contain updated
descriptions and where necessary have been transferred to the Items
Under Review table. The PinlCLs are:

e 11259, impact remains None
e 27467 (was 16193), impact raised from None to Low
¢ 26049 (was 22799), impact unchanged at Low

Of these the first is a POCL Reference Data responsibility affecting
Help Screen texts; the other two involve back office printer error
message handling.

As before, this Version employs the following colour coding:

Yellow items are DSS specific items that have been closed. (RGBH
items are DSS-specific items that were not formally closed on 24/5/99,
when the DSS withdrawal became known. These items were in course
of Closure at the point the host rigs were turned off. Blue items are
general or POCL-specific items closed. [Ba items are general or
POCL-specific items awaiting closure.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSES OF THE KPR

This document, the Known Problem Register (KPR), records those
known problems which are not intended to be resolved by means of
product change in the target Release.

It provides visibility of such problems for evaluation of the business
risk to DSS/POCL and/or Pathway of their presence in the target
Release, for developing suitable risk containment measures and for
tracking a problem’s subsequent resolution.

It is anticipated that most problems of this kind will originate from
PinICLs raised and reviewed during the later phases of systems
testing. Such PinICLs are categorised by the Pathway PinICL Impact
Assessment Team (PIAT) to distinguish whether a fix by way of
product change is required in the target Release, or whether, in the
light of the attendant business risks, it is reasonable to defer such
fixes.

Fixes for certain problems of a minor or cosmetic nature will be listed
in this KPR. This is for “supply side” reasons: as a generality it is
advisable not to open up modules unnecessarily both to avoid the
possibility of introducing instability and because resources should be
concentrated on essential fixes as a release date approaches.

Some problems originate from the operation of DSS and POCL
systems and procedures.

The PIAT membership is drawn from Customer Requirements with
access to Quality, Security, Development and Test.

The KPR records the PinICL Call or other Reference; the problem, its
effects and any possible circumventions at a level of description that is
accessible to business analysis; and an assessment of the business
impacts on the parties.

1.2 HOW TO INTERPRET THE TABLES

There are two tables: The KPR table is sorted into PinICL / Reference
within clearance plan event. The Cleared items table is sorted within
PinICL / Reference.

1.2.1 KPR TABLE

The points in time at which items are scheduled for clearance are
described using terms that will collate correctly and that are capable of
being modified to take account of changes in Release plans:

e BMOT — NR2 Beginning of MOT

e BOLT — NR2 Beginning of Live Trial

e EOLT - NR2 End of Live Trial

e NOFIX — Not to be fixed for NR2

e NR2+- At some point during the introduction of NR2+
e NR3- At some point during the introduction of NR3

e OPEN — Under (probably lengthy) evaluation

¢ CSR+ - At some point during the introduction of CSR+

Where an item constitutes an Acceptance Incident it is categorised as
High, Medium, Low or None (H, M L, N) corresponding to the expected
deficiency severity level.

The status column, headed “OK?” uses a “* ” to denote that Pathway
and the Authorities have concluded review of the item and that the
KPR entry is now unlikely to change while not cleared. This does not
prejudice any issues the Authorities may have regarding the severity or
date of fix for any Acceptance Incidents arising from these entries.

Drafting notes have Authorities’ text in italic and Pathway text in
Roman. Pathway does not necessarily agree with the statements
contained within Authority DNs.

The Business Impact descriptions None, Low, Medium, High (N, L, M,
H) are conventionally defined.

1.2.2 CLEARED ITEMS TABLE

The Reason Cleared description may in addition be:
e NOPRB - Nota problem.

e USEFUL - What was thought might be a problem is, on analysis, a
useful feature.

DN: Clarification is needed as to what is
meant by “...does not populate ... field ...” as
there are a number of options (temp lock is a

- Event recorded at outlet and record sent

DN: Improved wording.

DN: The events being reported to TIP as 938
events are not in fact Time Out Temporary

has now been agreed that the TIP AIS will be
changed to define Manual and Time Out

e.g. “Nat Lot Instant Win Game” instead
of, say, “Instants £1”.

Either the long names need to be made

When an OB Cheque to DPC encashment I L
is made, the stock unit and office balances
show the associated fee value of 5.00 as a
negative figure in the Payments section.
This is correct, but the volume figure for it
is also shown as negative. It should be
positive.

However, the meaning of the negative
volume figure on the office balance report
is unambiguous, and there are no totals
into which the figure adds.

When BES detects a digital signature verification
failure it (correctly prevents payment and) writes a
Security Error event to the message store. This is
harvested overnight for Pathway Security
attention. Arguably this should be notified sooner.

DN: Specify parameters of final sentence e.g. This
should be notified immediately as an alert.

The event is logged immediately and is available
for analysis the following day; the ability to report
the specific condition (i.e. corrupt payment) should
arguably be notified at the time of occurrence (e.g.
to the counter clerk to allow telephone access to
the PCHL to check correct payment status).

DN Please provide extract/quote from Pathway
procedures to ensure that valid payments can be
collected once alert received

DN: This is provided for in procedures as follows.
Customer will be advised to go to the benefit
office, taking with them their BES receipt, if they
believe they are missing payments at the PO
(PPD: BES e.g. 4.2.1.1 step 8). The benefit office
will make a PAS enquiry via PCHL. If the benefit
office finds that there is an uncollected payment,
which should be available at the PO, but is not, the
benefit office procedure is to report this to COLS.
The benefit office may stop and re-issue the
payment (urgent) to enable the customer to collect
the payment without further delay. Alternatively,
they may advise the customer to return to the post
office and make a fallback encashment via the
PCHL. COLS will alert Pathway SSC who will
investigate. This problem has not occurred in

NR2+ 10337 If an encashment is performed for two or more
beneficiaries using manual input of the card details

unnecessary card renewal. Encashment following
swiped input is not so affected.

At NR2+ the manual counts are capped at one per
day and this problem no longer occurs.

DN: BA to provide volumetrics of Permanent
Agents and Appointees with more than one
beneficiary. Pathway to provide details of 1c
failure rates.

DN: The current operation is not in direct conflict
with the Requirements (R715); the effect is that
where a card cannot be read, the Cardholder is
provided with a replacement earlier than would
otherwise be the case. The cardholder can
continue to collect payments.

Experience at Pathway Release 1C is that
transactions where the card details are keyed are
running at about 0.6%, but this will decrease
markedly at NR2 with the introduction of high
coercivity tape. Note also that Release 1C does
not automatically prompt the counter clerk that a
new card is available, with the result that the
cardholder will tend to continue to use a failing
card longer than is necessary.

Failures of the magnetic stripe reader itself, which
will also lead to cards having to be keyed, is
significantly less than projected, with only 17
failures being experienced in 10 months across
334 installed counters.

accept an impounded PUN to activate a
card in fallback. The counter will not. The
Help Desk cannot distinguish between the
several PUNs that may be issued for the
same card as it does not have the CANs
in the PUN impound messages.

Circumvention: The Help Desk procedures
will be enhanced to give additional
scrutiny to such cases.

DN: Include reference and extract from
PPD.

DN: On further analysis the existing Help
Desk procedures do not need to be
enhanced. The PPD:BES, Section 8.8
requires the clerk is to write “Impounded”
on a PUN when that PUN is impounded.
Section 8.8.2 also states: “Impounding a
PUN involves the clerk retaining the PUN,
recording the impound on the system (with
the exception of a PUN whose number
cannot be read (see Section 8.8.2.3 Clerk-
initiated PUN impound: manual
procedure), and issuing a receipt to the
customer (unless they have left the office).
At the end of the current cash account
period, the retained PUNs are checked
against reports: PUNs where fraud or
counterfeiting is suspected are forwarded
for subsequent investigation otherwise
they are destroyed.”

There is additional protection against
fraudulent use of an impounded PUN to
collect an activated card via a Help Desk
call in that EVP is always invoked (ref.
PPD:PCDF, section 9.3).

where there is an Appointee.

However, a change in the business rule is now
sought by DSS for implementation at NR2+. This
is to allow the original Alternative Payee to collect

EOLT 17586 (Revised for BOLT changes) An agent or L
alternative payee at an office which is not the NPO
(0.1) of the beneficiary does not collect a payment

available to a beneficiary, either because he
declines it, or cannot collect it because he would
cause the beneficiary's foreign encashment quota
to be exceeded, or is not equipped with the
requisite AtP. That payment is then not available
for 20 minutes at the beneficiary's NPO. This is a
side effect of payment locks needed to prevent
near simultaneous dual encashments.

Where the agent or alternative payee then
changes his mind and desires encashment at the
same foreign office no delay will be encountered.
The agent or alternative payee may withdraw these
payments from their NPO (or that of the
beneficiary, if acting as an agent), but will be
subject to the 20 minute payment lock if still in
force when they arrive there.

At EOLT the customer will be advised that another
customer is currently accessing the payments.

The probability of occurrence is extremely small

When recovering a BES transaction within I N
EPOSS the NINO is not format-checked.
The strict requirement is for the NINO to
be entered as it appears on the receipt,
even if this is, in fact, wrong.

Format-checking the NINO could possibly
be used to warn that the manual receipt
had been incorrectly written.

Unmatched payments will be matched by

A Carded Casual Agent transaction being
conducted via the Help Desk displays a
payment which the beneficiary can collect
as Alternative Payee. (Under current
business rules such payments may not be
collected by a Carded Casual Agent.) The
Help Desk is notified that the encashment
is not permitted when attempting to effect
the encashment, but not before.

Circumvention: The Help Desk procedure
will be ordered so that effecting the
encashment is attempted before notifying
the payments to the post office.

DN Please supply extract/quote from HD
procedures.

DN: The Help Desk encashment screen
enforces the rule that a casual agent

If the Help Desk is called upon to activate a card
the system assumes that an immediately
succeeding encashment would be Help Desk
executed. Pending payments which become
active when the card is activated are not sent as
priority messages. The counter if immediately
operational will not receive them for a number of
minutes. If a counter payment is then attempted
the payment will probably not have reached the
counter and will be handled as not available.

Design will be reconsidered for NR2+.

DN: What duration is “a number of minutes”? If
agreed then PPD and user guides will need to be
annotated.

DN: On average 15 minutes. The Help Desk can
view all payments and can immediately authorise
any payments due for encashment against the new
card. Under normal circumstances the post office
clerk would be expected to request encashment of
any outstanding payments in this way. The
PPD:PCDF will have a note added at the end of
section 9.3: “If benefit encashment using the
activated card is required proceed as directed in
the PPD:BES section 9.5.2.”

DN: Do not believe there are any circumstances
where this scenario can occur;

PC failure — encashment will have to be made via
HD.

ISDN failure — likewise as card activation message
cannot reach counter.

Card read failure — manual input of details, HD not
involved.

DN: It is where the PC or line is returned to
service at the very moment that the customer
completes the Help Desk card activation, makes to
move off, then changes his mind starts a new
session seeking encashment. Not likely to occur
by in real life. An entry will be made in the User

When a replacement card has been left
uncollected beyond the collect-by date no
renewal card is ordered. The presumption
is the customer is housebound. However,
the replacement card might be “optional”,
for example if the replacement card was
issued for a minor name change and the
current card is still active and in use.

The order of a renewal card should be
suppressed when the customer does not
collect a replacement card only if there is
no current active card.

There is no impact until normal card
expiries/renewals occur circa September

(Revised) This PinICL has been further
investigated and the root cause of the
denial of an APS reversal was that a
system logon had been performed and
APS not started. Opportunities for not
restarting APS have now been removed
and are in retest. Pathway may decide to
apply some of these changes via Tivoli to
the Live Trial system.

EPOSS formats an ONCH declaration
incorrectly in both the declaration and
print event messages, although the ONCH
report is correctly printed. (ONCH
messages are not used in balancing.)

This is another manifestation of that
reported on Closed PinICL 21861 - use of
the Edit button on the screen to enter
values was resulting in truncation of
values greater than 999.99.

The problem is now fixed for Live Trial and
cannot be reproduced using the current
software. Left open pending confirmation
of previous use of Edit.

DN: MO personnel say they think that this
was not done using the on-line edit
screen. Further investigation.

DN: This is diagnosed as consistent with
PInICL 21861, already Closed, and is now
Closed.

If a customer moves post office while a
replacement card is in preparation and
moves back to the original post office in
time to collect it PCDF demands a card to
effect renewal rather than the PUN. In
fact renewals will also be prevented.

The card should be stopped and
reordered by PCDF when it detects that
the customer no longer has that office as
his NPO.

DN: This is where a customer, who has a
card on order, changes his NPO to
another PO and then promptly changes
back again. PPD: PCDF section 6.2.1
states in these circumstances the
customer is advised to return when he
receives a new PUN for a new
replacement card which is automatically
ordered.

The same condition arises where a card is
stopped before it can be collected. The
local NINO check can be added during
batch reconciliation.

the same payment in NR2 form, was then

might be.
