06 AM (UTC)

As promised, I attach a word doc (so you can see what I have done) of your draft note to PV

Shall we meet early today, so that you can get it out of the way ? I have a view on the way forward I'd like to test.

Best wishes

Patrick

Can you let me know whether you happy by 9am Tuesday (sorry)?

was at times rude and certainly inappropriate. Oliver Letwin was more measured and constructive

conducted herself in a way which befitted the values of the Post Office

would not be able to hold off the media: this came across in a very unfortunate manner

last week.

assumption"

>

> - there are several reasons for this. It would make the working group, which was set up with TOR agreed by the JFSA,
redundant as we would simply be waving cases through. This would be outwith the balancing nature of the working group.
It would also force us to mediate in criminal cases where the legal processes have not been exhausted. We have strong
legal advice suggesting we should not take this course.

>

> - this is unlikely to be welcomed by the MPs so we are preparing for every eventuality. We could expect media
coverage, at a low level but are well prepared for this. We are also proposing that our letter setting out our position to the
MPs could be released to the media, given the MPs point about media pressure. This gives us a chance to set out our
position and the "Clapham Omnibus" position.

>

>-we are also making contact separately with Oliver Letwin to impress upon him the nature of our position. We have a
number of channels open to us here.

>

> - given the potential collapse of the working group, we have also taken the precaution of seeking further legal advice
from a leading QC at Blackstone Chambers. While we know that as a public body, we are susceptible to judicial review,
we wanted to test the position further around the nature of the Scheme and the cases submitted to it

>

> - this is important as unlike in the summer, where we were considering closing the scheme ourselves, the Scheme
could collapse through the actions of others, who might then seek JR

>

> - the view is that (Patrick to fill in)

>

> - this is clearly important and good news. We are well positioned. The strategy we set out in the summer is working.
We have a strong media position and public narrative, while the legal backstop suggests that our risk of JR is low
(perhaps lower than we thought)

>

> - so the recommendation of the Exco is that we hold our nerve on this. We will complete all the investigations by
Christmas and continue to work as part of the Working Group.
