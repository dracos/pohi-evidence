Hi Cecilia

Thanks for this. In terms of a line about why Paula stepped down I would suggest:

Paula Vennells’ decision to step down as chief executive of Post Office had nothing to do with the High Court
trial. After 12 years with PO and seven as chief executive, during which the business had a period of
unprecedented success, Ms Vennells is moving to chair a high profile NHS trust and take on a non-executive role
with the Cabinet Office, in addition to her non-exec directorship at Morrisons.

Having turned Post Office from a business losing £120m of taxpayers money to one making a profit while also
improving services for customers, we are sorry she made the decision to move on and wish her well in her new,

demanding roles.

In relation to the issues raised in the High Court it is worth noting that it was Ms Vennells who set up an
independent review and a mediation scheme.

Mel are you ok with this?

Hi Mark/Melanie,

Hope you are well. As you know, with the litigation judgement imminent, we are preparing a UQ pack for the
Minister.

Might be a long shot but any chance you have some off the shelf lines to rebut claims that Paula stepped down as
POL CEO due to the trial?

If not I'll draft something, yet I'd be grateful if you could have a look at what I come up with before we send it
up to the Minister.

Thanks.

Annabelle, Chris,

Mark Davies at Post Office (cc’d) has informed me that they will be announcing the departure of Paula Vennells
as CEO tomorrow. They will NOT be announcing the identity of the interim CEO, which as you know has not
yet been cleared by ministers.

Mark, would you be able to send materials direct to Chris and Annabelle?

I’m not in the office on Monday and am likely to be unreachable for much of the morning. Tom Cooper is also
out tomorrow.

If you need to speak to the shareholder team, please contact Steve.
I will email separately to inform private offices

Tom
