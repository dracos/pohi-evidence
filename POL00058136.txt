Subject: POL v. Lynette Hutchings
CaseNo: 22796
CompName: Cartwright King

Hi Martin

Will has just called me with the outcome of Hutchings. He added a second count of
False Accounting to the indictment, leaving the 1st count untouched. Hutchings
pleaded not guilty to the 1st count, but guilty to the 2nd count on a basis that Will did
not accept. It was a basis of plea that we are familiar with ie, I didn't steal the money,
I'm just not very good at accounting and I don't know where the money is.

The case has been listed for sentence on 24th August 2012, Will has asked if we are
seeking confiscation in this, as it doesn't appear as though she has made any payments
back to POL. I told him that with the loss being circa £10k, POL may not bother, but it
may be enquiring about this anyway.

Graham Brander is the Investigator, should I ask him about confiscation or will it be
Graham Ward? As the first count has been left open, would you like Will to let that
count lie on the file or will we offer no evidence on it?

Regards

Rachael
