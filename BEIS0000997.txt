Subject: Minister Hollinrake teach-in & intro calls

ollinrake,

Hi all,

Emailing from the new inbox! We welcomed Kevin Hollinrake MP as Minister today, so I just wanted
to flag a few things to you:

* We will be looking to set up a post office teach-in, next week if diary allows (week 1). You will
just need to refresh the slides that you prepared for Minister Russell and bring along a copy for
the Minister to keep.

* We will be contacting Nick Read’s office to set up an intro call, after the Minister has had the
policy deep dive (week 1 if possible, if not early week 2)

* We will also be looking to set up intro calls with Alan Bates and Lord Arbuthnot (mid-late
week 2)

Please could you let me know if the sequencing looks ok to you/ if we are missing anything?

Also I wanted to share the new template and style guide for submissions. The new SoS will be
reviewing every submission, and wants to see submissions only once JM and SpAd comments have
been added.

* Use the attached template (do not change the margins or font size)

* Keep the submission to a maximum of 2 pages

¢ Ensure that all acronyms are spelt out

* Do not assume background knowledge

* SoS is very comms focused so ensure you have engaged with comms colleagues

lam on leave w/c 31% October — John (locum1 on teams) will be covering for me, so get in touch with
him if you need anything.

Best wishes,
Cora
