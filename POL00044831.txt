friend being present.

3.30 PW states that just as the last set of tapes finished he had shown DB last weeks
cash account from the office ( Week 7 2004/2005) and DB had admitted that it
was false. PW asks DB when was the last true account submitted DB states that
he cannot remember specifically but it was some time ago. PW asks again a
round about date for the last true account from the office. A discussion ensues at
which a date is sought for the last true submitted account. During his perusal of
the cash accounts DB states that he prepared and signed them all.

10.00 DB responds to HD's question in relation to how much he inflated the figure in
the first false cash account he submitted by stating that it was £5,000. that he
thought was possibly an error in Girobank work but he did not pursue this as an
error with Girobank as he had covered the figure up in his cash account.

11.10 In relation to the last true account, DB states that it was probably a year ago.

Again he cannot specifically remember when and states that a lot has been
playing on his mind , and for the last few months he has dreaded every Thursday
until he could get something sorted out.

13.20 DB looks through a number of cash accounts
14.40 DB states that it is week two.
14.50 PW So you've been false accounting since week 2
DB Yeah
PW Right I need to go through this with you...So I've got a cash account here it's dated

9" of the 4"" 2003 week 2 of the financial year 2003 /2004. Its date stamped Riby
Square Grimsby and it's signed by..

DB Yeah by me

PW ...your signature On this document the cash on hand is declared at £51,494.56,
was that the true figure at the time.

DB I believe possibly not

PW Well was it or not

DB (laughs)..... I really can't remember. I'm guestimating that's about the time it was
so if that is the case I will have to say no that is not the figure.

PW Right so this is a false cash account

DB Yes

PW Right you..when you submitted this cash account did you know it to be
false...obviously if you. ..

DB Yes

PW you knew it to be false, and you know that that’s a dishonest thing to do...

DB Yes

PW fe To submit a false cash account

DB Yes I do, although to be honest I didn't realise it was quite as serious at the time
...but I do yes

PW But you know it was wrong to do it

DB Yes I knew it was wrong to do it

PW Yes so that's week 2

DB Yes

PW So we've got week 7 that you've admitted is false, week 2 that you say is probably

round about the start of it and you are prepared to say that that one is a false one

DB Yes

PW If I can take one from......lets have a look I'll just take week 28 because it's one
that I have put my finger on. Is that your signature?

DB No it's my wife's that one

PW How often does she do the cash?

DB She doesn't

PW She doesn't

DB No she doesn't, she's probably signed that spare one and put it in the drawer, I
think if you check the original, that went away its probably got mine on it.

PW I'll put that to one side and we'll try week 27

DB She might have taken it off the printer and signed and date stamped it but that's
about it.

PW Right week 27 of the year 2003 / 2004 week ending 1* of the 10" 2003, cash
account here office name Riby Square, is that your signature?

DB Yeah

PW So you prepared this cash account

DB Yeah

PW The cash on hand figure there is £87, 286.63. Is that an accurate figure of what
was at the office at the end of that accounting period?

DB No..no

PW Right, so did you inflate that figure or did you inflate the figure to make it £87,000

DB Yes..Yes

PW So you submitted this account and you knew it was false,

DB Uh-uh

PW And you knew it was wrong to submit the account falsely

DB Yes

PW You knew you were committing a dishonest act

DB Yes yeah

PW O.K Right so that's the false accounting bit out of the way, shall we say.

18.20 PW states that throughout the year £60,000 has gone in general on a weekly
basis. Over the year knowing the cash had to be repaid DB has not raised the
issue with anyone, not the retail line, not other departments such as Girobank or
NSB, not Chesterfield where the cash account goes, not with his members of staff,
and that he has just kept it to himself. DB states that he has and that he has

altered the account every week to cover up the loss.

19.50 PW Can you hear what I'm saying?
DB (laughing) I can yes
PW Can you hear how ridiculous it sounds
DB Yes absolutely
PW Because I still don't believe you
DB I don't know if I believe myself but it’s the truth

Discussion in which PW states that if he is to believe that it is not DB, and at this
time he does not, it must be another member of staff who has stolen the money in
the last 12 months.

22.10 PW I think it's a case of you perhaps, might be the wrong term, but your twisted logic is
you've coughed to the false accounting but...! think you have convinced yourself
that you haven't stolen it. I don't know where the moneys gone, I don't know
whether its something that you've kept secret from your wife or whether your in
financial trouble..

DB No

PW ..-or whether. ...whatever..you've got a mistress on the side...1 don't know what
ever whatever it is it's something that your wife doesn’t know about or it's
something that you want to keep from your wife.

22.50 Discussion regarding financial position of DB at which he states that he had a
redundancy payment of £30,000 when he left Kimberley Clark and they are not
struggling financially. DB states that no other business ventures have turned sour
and the Subpostoffice was to be the couple's retirement package.

24.26 DB I honestly do not know where this money has gone. The only thing that I know for
sure is that I haven't taken it, and my wife hasn't taken it.

PW Well hoe do you know your wife hasn't taken it. Your wife didn’t know you were
covering up the accounts until this morning.

DB No...No ....No way on this earth would my wife take it. My wife is...

PW Well hoe can you say that

DB Because I know my wife.

PW And I bet your wife says that she knows you.

DB Yeah but I know that there is a difference.....you would know if your wife had taken
it wouldn't you

PW I would like to thinks so but I'm sure she would like to think.. know..she would

know if I'd been false accounting for the last 12 months.
DB My wife knows the only thing I am guilty of is false accounting, and I know that the
only thing that she is guilty of is being naive and trusting me.
25.20 HD explains that if this is DB's retirement plan, because he did nothing to stop the

losses he would have had nothing left. DB agrees and states that sat here he feels
a prat. HD states that DB is showing tremendous loyalty in his staff if he is letting
them get away with discrepancies that he is liable for. Db states that he trusts his

staff.
26.30 PW Well where's the money gone then

DB I really wish I knew, I really honestly wish I knew..

PW I wish you knew as well.

DB Yeah I really don't know

PW I think you do know. I’m still not convinced. I'm still not convinced at all David. I
can't believe the set of circumstances that your expecting us to believe.

DB I know

PW I don’t think anybody in their right mind would

DB No

PW 60,000 quid it's not a drop in the ocean, and I think the only reason whereby you

wouldn't draw that to anybodies attention is because you've had it, and you want to
... you don’t want to draw your own dishonesty to their attention.

DB No that is not true, I have not had the money. I really have not had the money.
PW Is that your last word on it
DB It's the truth that's all I can say on it.
PW Right we'll have to make further inquiries because somebody's had the money
DB Yes
27.38 DB agrees that further inquiries are needed.
28.00 PW states that to finish off the auditors have given him a figure of £64, 874.98
shortage at the office, which may fluctuate slightly.
28.32 PW You say you haven't stolen that
DB No
PW You still say you haven't stolen that
DB I still say I haven't stolen it
PW However you're admitting to putting in false accounts for the office
DB Yes

PW For round about the last year
DB Yes
PW Yes I mean I gave you the
DB Yeah round about that time
PW ...we looked through the individual cash accounts. Every cash account that's come
out of the office basically for the last year has been a false account.
DB Yes
29.10 DB confirms that his wife does very little back room work. DB confirms that today

is the first his wife know about any of this. DB states that he has done every cash
account for the office and when he and his wife was in Cyprus in March of this year
the office had a 2-week cash account.

31.20 DB agrees to complete a CS045 bank disclosure form which he agrees to
complete off tape.

32.10 DB is shown and signs tape seal, 059899. He is given a notice explaining what will
happen to the tapes.

32.30 PW I have to inform you that you may have rendered yourself liable to prosecution, you

do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention
now something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Do you wish to clarify anything you have said or add anything before
the end of the interview

DB No the only thing to clarify is that I didn’t take the money
