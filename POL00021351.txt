POST OFFICE LIMITED v ALISON LORAINE HALL
CASE NO: POLTD/1011/0095

1am again returning this file.
Before I advise could the Officer deal with the following:-

It is said in the Officer’s report that there were no calls to the Helpline. The report
recently forwarded contradicts this. Could the Officer please clarify.

Could the Officer also confirm:-

1 Whether the report would have related to or affected the discrepancy at the
Office.
2 In addition whether or not there is any record of an audit being requested by

the Defendant (previous request at 6).

3 Could a copy of the Transaction Corrections during the relevant period be
forwarded (previous request 2).

The file should be returned as soon as possible.
