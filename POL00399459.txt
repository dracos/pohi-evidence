Summary:

a. Security is a key component of systems/services

b. Security must be planned throughout the life cycle of the

7.1 Physical and Environmental Security Control
Implementation

Atos employs various physical security controls at all its sites, in the form of either
Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) or swipe access, additionally where
appropriate Personnel Identity Number (PIN) number entry systems (i.e. all Data
Centres have RFID and PIN Systems). There must also be a sanctioned change
request to gain entry to any Atos data centre.

7.2 Physical Security Perimeter

Atos Facilities Management will take steps to ensure the site perimeters of its
locations are controlled and monitored in a manner suitable to the buildings
operations. This covers features such as CCTV implementations, 24/7 security
guard monitoring and regular patrols and monitoring of all boundaries and entry
points.

The Atos Global Physical Environmental Security Policy [Doc Ref: ASM-SEC-0011]
and the Baseline Physical Environmental Security [Doc Ref: UKSEC-STD0902]
documents the requirements for Atos owned and managed locations.

7.3 Physical Entry and Other Controls

Physical access controls are in place at Atos sites to restrict access to key areas
based on an individual’s requirements and clearance levels. This is controlled at
Atos sites by keypads, proximity access tokens and mantraps (mantraps are limited
mainly to Data Centres, but are also deployed where needed for other secure sites).

The Atos Global Physical Environmental Security Policy [Doc Ref: ASM-SEC-0011]
and the Baseline Physical Environmental Security [Doc Ref: UKSEC-STD0902]
documents the requirements for Atos owned and managed locations.

7.4 Working in Key Rooms/Areas

This is achieved by standard Atos procedures, requiring change approvals for
access, as well as signing for token access and approval to enter the restricted
area.
