28 — Drop and Go

Summary

PC0260269

PM processed £100 top-up but the amount didn’t go through. They did it again and this time the
amount showed on the card but the office were showing a loss of £100.

Looking at the logs, the first transaction failed due to timeouts but a success message was displayed.
The clerk settled the transaction and received the money from the customer. The customer checked
the balance and the card had not been credited so the clerk performed another Drop & Go
transaction which was successful. The effect of this was that the customer has paid £100 but the
branch were debited £200.

Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the Accenture CDP system identified that only one top-
up had been received by CDP but two were being shown it the Horizon Batch Feed. The second
Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction.

Impact
Without reconciliation the branch would suffer a loss.

Root Cause

Fujitsu are not aware of the Drop & Go business process so are unable to comment on whether this
was a user error or fault with the ATOS APADC script so call PCO260269 was routed for ATOS
investigation.

Fujitsu are unaware of any further updates against this call, however, subsequent call PC0237234

raised August 2018 with the same symptoms would suggest that the issue may still remain
unresolved.
