Martin,

| would prefer to present the docs as Exhibits, so can the wording of section 3 be changed accordingly.

Jarnail,

I have read through the proposed statement - I have deleted the first paragraph of Section 3. If the
report is served in its present form the Defence will undoubtedly ask for copies of the docs. However
if Gareth, as an expert, feels that the docs should be provided, he will need to give them exhibit
numbers, refer to them as such in his statement and attach copies.

Could I ask you please to clarify the position with Gareth before we ask Sharron to put the statement
into s9 format for e-mailing to him.

Many thanks,

Martin.

Jarnail,
Sorry for the delay. I’ve been in other meetings all afternoon.

’'ve made some changes — mainly to tidy up the formatting and add in some text below the diagrams — mainly pasted
from the Referenced Docs.

In the doc you sent me you were asking what the 2 doc referenced in Section 3 were, They are the 2 brief documents on
Horizon Integrity and Horizon Online Integrity | set you on Tuesday. | think it is clearer to keep these as separate stand
alone docs which can presumably also be presented as part of the witness statement. | also note that you have
removed my explicit reference to the Misra witness statement. Presumably this will also be available since that is were
the main rebuttal of Prof McLachlan’s hypotheses is covered.

Hope that covers what you need.

Happy to discuss further tomorrow if needed.

Regards

Gareth
