Dear Colin

“ OBCS Failure — 8 November 2001 py
an essential part of everyday life

As you are aware, there was a failure of the OBCS system on 8th November
2001 which occurred as a result of invalid Reference Data.

We have calculated that the loss to Post Office Ltd for which Pathway is
responsible amounts to £22,236.36, which comprises lost income of
£5,867.11 and the additional costs at the National Business Support Centre
of £16,369.25. This is in addition to any liquidated damages which may be
payable to Post Office Ltd in connection with OBCS transaction times during
the relevant Service Level Measurement period. If you require further details
of these costs, Liz Tuddenham will be able to provide these.

Please could you confirm that you accept the liability for these losses.

Yours sincerely,

Keith Baines
