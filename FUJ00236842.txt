Hi James, Got side tracked yesterday — apologies, I have now been through the paper and stripped a fair amount out
(detail and prior questions). I have shared amongst the team and once I get comments back, will come back to you.

The only questions I had left to ask FJ was

1) Are the three circumstances described the paper, the ONLY ways to affect branch accounts

2) Some further detail around the pilot that took place in 2010 — number of branches involved, over what time

period etc

But we can run through these over the phone once I get the paper back from the team.

Hope that is ok

Mark
