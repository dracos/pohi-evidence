Symptoms

Bureau Quotation receipt is printed on Welsh Counter. According to a DES/GEN/SPE/0004 document section 4.2.1.5
Layout of Welsh/English text:

Line 20 should start around 15 column ar gyfer £99999999,99
but instead on Welsh Bureau Quotation receipt starts around column 20.
This is how it looks in a document:

yn 61 cyfradd o rrmrrrrrrr iii / ggg
ar gyfer £99999999.99

Instead looks like this on recept:

yn 61 cyfradd 0 rerrrrmmmrr iii / ggg
ar gyfer £99999999.99

Please amend accordingly.
