FALLBACK INCIDENT
e Areconciliation incident arising as a result of agreed ‘Fallback’ procedures being invoked by the Postmaster in order to
facilitate the collection of benefit during times of ICL Pathway system failure.

FRAUD INCIDENT
¢ Areconciliation incident arising following fraudulent activity within the DSS, POCL or ICL Pathway system / service.

INCOMPLETE TRANSACTION
e Transactions resulting in the payment of benefit to a customer without the associated authorised payment being
processed and marked as ‘Encashed’, due to ICL Pathway system failure or clerical error within the post office, resulting
in a possible duplicate encashment when collecting subsequent benefit payments. (NB. Incomplete Transactions,
although technically falling into either the PO Incident or POCL Incident categories, have been classified separately due
to their high profile).

NON-COMMITTED TRANSACTION
e Transactions resulting in the payment of benefit to a customer without the associated authorised payment being
processed and marked as ‘Encashed’. This can be due to the transaction being wilfully voided or any other clerk action
which prevents transaction committal when the system is working correctly.

PAS INCIDENT

e Areconciliation incident occurring within the ICL Pathway PAS with possible DSS, POCL or ICL Pathway system /
service implications.

PO INCIDENT
e Areconciliation incident identified (usually at the time) by the Postmaster.

2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

2.1. KEY POINTS —- JANUARY 1999

e The overall incident rate has decreased slightly to 0.03% in January, with 27 incidents being received against 79k encashed

payments. ‘Incomplete transactions’ account for 55.5% of exceptions received by BSU in January.

e There was a reduction in the number of ‘Non committed’ transactions to 9 this month, all being due to the clerk voiding the

transaction after paying the customer, equating to 0.011% of the total encashment stream.

INCIDENT REVIEW Version: 1.0
Date: 01.02.99

¢ The number of ‘Incomplete Transactions’ received in January increased slightly to 15, which is 0.019% of the total encashment
stream. Six ‘Incomplete transactions’ this month were caused by the system freezing, these are classified under the three
descriptions of ‘system freeze’, ‘system freeze cause unknown’ & ‘system freeze double input’. A further two ‘incomplete
transactions’ arose due to an ‘invalid transaction reference’ being generated. This latter category been raised as a high priority
within ICL Pathway and is being progressed at the Incomplete Transaction Workshop.

e The number of transactions which have been forcibly committed are slightly lower this month with there being 29 occurrences,
where clerks are still leaving the system without finishing the transaction. The total value of transactions saved over the
January period is £2024.10, which is greater than the December figure of £1536.50. Therefore an increase of £487.60 has
occurred.
