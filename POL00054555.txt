Andrew,

Thanks for your email below.

In respect of this case where the SPMR was precautionary suspended on 18/9/08 when a loss of £46,049.16 was
identifed. The outcome of the contractual case was that the SPMR was reinstated with a warning and an
arrangement put in place for repayment of the debt as follows:-

- cheque received for £7049.16

- deductions from remuneration arranged for 30 montly instalments of £1300 which commenced in Dec 08 and
are due to be completed in May 11.

We therefore have in place recovery of the outstanding debt - I hope this arrangement is acceptable to yourself?

The only one thing I am not sure of is whether the assistant was debarred in this case - could you arrange for
this to happen if the form has not been completed.

Regards

John

Ged,
following our discussion thanks for this.

Andrew/Robert,

given that we will now be seeking recovery via the spmr can you ensure you liaise with the Contracts team as
there may be obvious impact/ repercussions.

Cheers,
Andy

I have reviewed this case and find that we have dropped the theft charge and successfully prosecuted the 3
counts of false accounting. As this defendant is a sub-postmasters assistant (office manager) and his contract is
with the sub-postmaster and not us I find it difficult to quantify the benefit figure in this case. I believe that we
should withdraw from the confiscation process and that recovery for POLTD should be through the sub-
postmasters contract and for the sub-postmaster through the civil courts for compensation based on any contract
that they believe is enforceable.

Please withdraw from the confiscation process.
