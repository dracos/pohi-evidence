Jarnail,

Here is the final version of my statement. Do you need me to resend
the

4 attachments I sent you yesterday? They probably need to be
included

in what is submitted as I refer to them in the statement.

I think I've now done everything I need to so I'll see you on
Monday.

Regards
Gareth

Warwick,

As discussed, here is version 0.3 of the Witness statement which
should
contain responses to all your comments.

I'll now go through it and remove all the strike out and colours and
boxes and check through for any remaining typos to provide a clean
version 1.0 which can be submitted.

Dear Gareth,

Thank you very much for your 2nd draft. You are quite right to
rebuff me

when I have been asking too much! I have added a few more comments,
this

time in green. There are naturally enough some typos, some of which
I

have pointed out. Obviously please do a careful typo check before
completing the document. Is it possible within the framework of the
FUJ00224967
FUJ00224967

statement to put in paragraph numbers? It will help when you give
your
evidence.

I received the Professor's final version last night. I have not yet
had

a chance to read it in detail. I will try to speak to you late
morning.

I anticipate that it should be possible to serve your completed
statement by 4pm today.

As ever, many thanks.

WwW
