Emily / Sabrina

Re my action from the meeting last week please see attached file for all cases that | have and the recommendations
made to progress.

Can you confirm your availability for a teleconference either Tuesday or Wednesday am to discuss next steps and agree
what is needed by case

We can then also discuss what is needed to progress via Susan and the IC

Regards Alison

Update at JFSA meeting last week

| have reviewed all the cases but believe that a sensible way forward would be to hold a meeting with Emily, Sabrina, Rod
and Myself just to confirm we are happy with the recommendation and if we have any concerns with evidence, we also
need to consider cost and which Solicitors to use then a paper will need to be written for Susan to gain authority to
proceed

Of the 533 live cases there are 23 known cases that are Horizon challenges totalling £751k.

Breakdown of what | believe could be next steps :-

£268,517.88 £ 218,386.52 £ 264,352.93 £ 751,257.33
losed Proceed hold write off
