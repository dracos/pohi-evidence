Emily / Sabrina

Re my action from the meeting last week please see attached file for all cases that I have and the recommendations
made to progress.

Can you confirm your availability for a teleconference either Tuesday or Wednesday am to discuss next steps and agree
what is needed by case

We can then also discuss what is needed to progress via Susan and the IC

Regards Alison


Update at JFSA meeting last week

I have reviewed all the cases but believe that a sensible way forward would be to hold a meeting with Emily, Sabrina, Rod
and Myself just to confirm we are happy with the recommendation and if we have any concerns with evidence, we also
need to consider cost and which Solicitors to use then a paper will need to be written for Susan to gain authority to
proceed

Of the 533 live cases there are 23 known cases that are Horizon challenges totalling £751 k.

Breakdown of what I believe could be next steps :-
               £268,517.88            £ 218,386.52                                            £     264,352.93                             £   751,257.33

                                                                                                                                                            POL-0069728
                                                                                                                   POL00073165
                                                                                                                 POL00073165



Of the 23 1 suggest we proceed with 10 but put a priority on following 5

Alderly Edge —        GRO (£44k) - already gathered much of the evidence, has property could look at charge —With BP -
Helen did say u_nsure ifwe had enough evidence so need a view (Prosecuted)
Alresford - _.cRo._ (£61 k)-original test case - work started need to understand if there is property/ assets as we were
originally looking at a formal undertaking on business r PO — this case did go to legal services and Helen did some work
on it but may not yet_be-with BP (Not an investigation case)
Great Staughton GRO_ (£9.6k) - original test case already with BP (not an investigation case)
Hockley -l._._ GRO_._._i£11 8K)- already a great amount of the evidence and served LBA previously — already with BP (not an
investigation case)
Erpingham — ._c_ R_o_.'(13K) - was at point for serving when letter came in in the style of Shoosmiths — already with BP
(Prosecuted)

The remaining 5 as a second priority are
Great Bowden ___cRo _J£13.6K) (1st of 2 cases in this Branch could imply staff issues)
Rake —.__cRg_._. (£13k)
Old Colwyn —        o _ _(£43.8K)
Greenfield - GRO (£47k)
Goudhurst - €~     GRo      (£10.6k)

1 believe we should hold fire on 6 until we have proved the first batch then proceed if we have all information
needed, these are:-
Matfield- _ _Ro .    34.3k)
Odiham — GRo (£42k)
Barkham — ;_,cRo_;1 (f3 5k)
KirkoswaId      --Ro (17.8k)
West Byfleet — Misra (£73k) (Investigations still have a confiscation order £40k on this case and issues have beer raised
by Paul South in above the property value)
Great Bowden -i         GRo _._._._._._. i (£17.2k)


The following 3 cases are still with Investigations I believe, we should consider write off and Mothball once
closed but consider subsequent reviews by Investigations under POCA
Newsome . GRO (f71 .5k)- Declared bankrupt but Investigations have POC attached to debt so Investigation could
leave on file
Porters Ave _____GRo (f79 8k) as above
Broughton        GRO_._._. (£97k)- as above

Suggest we write off - 2 cases
Pitlochry —_._.cRo _._ (£15.8k) - Our claim has been lodged wih Trustee's in bankruptcy
Astwood bank - Wilson - only £117 remains outstanding as recovered by Investigations

Closed -2 cases
Leitrim - McAlerne.y_ Judgement won - debt looking to be secured on property if not paid (Scottish Case)
Sandlehurst - GRO- Charge on property
