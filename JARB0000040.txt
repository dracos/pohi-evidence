Subject: RE: Updates for individual MPs

Janet

Ron and I have discussed this and we have also discussed regular reporting at our regular meetings with POL
As you know there has been a shift toward “thematic” investigations rather than case by case investigations.
Accordingly, we do not think that it is appropriate to provide case by case updates to either POL or MPs. This
is because we are now focussing on the key issues that have been reported by a number of sub-postmasters
and MPs. Also, the number of cases and issues we are now dealing with would make case by case progress

reports very difficult to implement.

What we would prefer to do is to provide your office with regular updates that do not identify individual sub-
postmasters that could be shared with all MPs.

I realise this is not what Mark Lazarowicz and Priti Patel have asked for, but given the number of cases we
are now dealing with, we think it is the only practical way forward.

Is this something we should discuss with James at our meeting next month?
Do you think it will be possible to sell this proposed approach to MPs?

I look forward to hearing from you

With best wishes
