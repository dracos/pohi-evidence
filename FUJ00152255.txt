2 JANUARY REVIEW OF SERVICE

2.1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

January 2006 represented another excellent month in terms of servce quality with no Major Incidents reported. One notable incident affected satellite
connected branches following an oversized reference data drop as an emergency change on 19th January. The standard process was followed and full
service was resumed after 2 hours.

Once again, the Operational Business Change Service met all its Operating Level Agreements with a total of 224 change requests received and actioned.
The Horizon Service Desk met all its telephony and service targets during January, and responded to just 4 complaints, with just 1 complaint being
justified regarding engineer attendance timescales. The PostShops service volumes have reduced by half during Janaury, with all call to fix targets
achieved. There were no significant trends of note regarding the volumes of incidents logged with the HSD.

The network service remained positive, again with no major incidents or incidents affecting more than one specific branch, The proportion of network
reported incidents fixed within 24 hours remained above 82%.

However, as detailed last month, the logistics supply issues caused as a result of switch of logistics supplier has continued to impact the quality of the
engineer services, though a notable low volume of complaints. As forecast, the Work in Progress backlog was reduced to Business as Usual levels by
13th January 2006, and has remained at usual levels since, along with service level achievement. However, the impact of the first half of January has
impacted the Service Level Target achievement through narrowly missing the Local A and Local B priority SLT. All SLTs are back on track in February
2006.

2.1.2 Availability and Problem Management

Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for January 2006 there were no Major Incidents. There was I further service affecting incident within the
Fujitsu domain and I affected VIP site. There were 3 further service affecting incidents which were outside of the Fujitsu domain.

Major Incidents: None

Other incidents in Fujitsu Services domain:

Thursday 19" January. The VSAT network was suffering congestion at start of day. This was due to an oversize reference data drop overnight due to an
inclusion of a POL emergency change. 67 VSAT outlets were affected at 09:24. The congestion issue, was resolved by the SSC, by taking all the VSAT
connected outlets off line, and then bringing them back on-line I at a time. These outlets then received the reference data and relieved the congestion,
issue resolved by 11:31.

VIP sites affected this month.

Saturday 14th January. VIP Site “The Markets” Leeds 014323 lost On-line services at 16:15. Problem identified by BT on Monday 16" as an exchange
fault. Problem has continued all week with BT repairing 6 PSTN circuits. Fault is now identified as to problem in MUX at exchange and requires a
planned outage to resolve. Planned outage for 05:00 Saturday 21‘. Call E-0601140242 refers.

Monday 23rd January. Update, VIP Site “The Markets” Leeds 014323 lost On-line services at 16:15 on Saturday 14" January. Problem identified by
BT on Monday 16" as an exchange fault. Problem has continued all week with BT repairing 6 PSTN circuits by a “Lift & Shift” ic. moving the 6
circuits to spare capacity within the main frame circuits at the exchange. This did not resolve the fault so BT replaced H/W in the MUX at the exchange.
Although resolving 5 circuits it did not resolve the circuit for “The Markets”. BT required another “Lift & Shift” at the main frame to resolve the fault.
ADSL Service returned to site at 15:00, decision was taken by BM at PO to return to an ISDN service. ISDN service working from Post Office from
17:25, Denise Miller BIM attended site on this Monday and continued to monitor the PO after issue was resolved.

Incidents Outside the Fujitsu Domain:

Friday 6" January. Issues were experienced with A&L transactions timing out at intermittent intervals. Problems started at 11:40 and continued
intermittently to 14:47. A&L indicated that the failures were due to problems within their systems. POL SCT were seeking from the A&L the root cause
analysis to the problem and its resolution at 14:47. Call E-0501060356 refers.

Thursday 11th January. Transaction time outs experienced to LINK, between 08:41 to 08:45 & 09:31 to 09:47. Link reported issues at these times with
the Halifax & Bank of Scotland (HBOS)

Wednesday 18" January. The second payment file to Streamline Debit card Service was unable to be sent at 21:00. POA networks team investigated
and found unable to send file from either Data Centre Wigan or Bootle, also a manual transfer failed. Networks liaised with Streamline but no apparent
fault was identified. Service started to work again at 09:30 Thursday morning with the file transferring ok and the inbound file from Streamline received

ok. As no root cause identified network sniffers applied to the Streamline connections to monitor the payment file transfer for Thursday at 15:00 and
21:00 both files transferred successfully. Networks continue to monitor. Possible problem was with Streamline, as we could not send from either of our
Data Centres. NB. It should be noted that because of the late delivery this has affected the reconciliation reports NB102 section 4 reports with more than
10,000 exceptions (report limited to 10,000) at state E39, so reconciliation for these DC transactions will be a day later at day C. Call E-0601180850
refers.

Wednesday 25th January. There were 13 timeouts experienced on the Debit card service between 11:04 and 11:09 across 2 agents DC02 and DC04.
All of the POA systems were checked out and no fault instance was found so call passed via SCT to Streamline. Streamline response was that they saw
no failures at this time but were experiencing heavy traffic at this time. Calls E-0601150313 & 314 refer.

2.1.3 OBC Branch Change Service Summary

January 2006 again saw sustained achievement from Fujitsu Services OBC in delivering a performance within the OLA targets. A total of 224 changes
were received, 16 of these were cancelled changes. Fujitsu were responsible for 4.5 change requests not being completed on the target date. For Fujitsu
this represents a failure rate of 2.16% against the 5% target rate. There were no line plant failures therefore this also represents a failure rate of 2.16%
against the 4% target. This is an improvement, compared to the December calculations of 1.69% against the 5% target rate and a slight drop of 0.24%
against the 4% target rate. Post Office were responsible for 2.5 change requests not being completed on the target date, which represents 1.20% against
the 4% target, which is an improvement against the December calculations of 3.61%. There was I joint failure.

Fujitsu’s Services performance against a revised OLA which doesn’t include the ‘Closures’ saw an achievement of 2.41% against the 4% target. This is
an improvement of 0.98% when compared to December’s achievement.

Fujitsu’s direct failures comprised of 2 communications, I Hardware and 1 Software.

Post Office Limited direct failures comprised of 1 Process and I Compliance.

The Joint Failure was for an ‘Other’

Corrective Actions

The process for advising Implementation Project Manager’s of engineers undertaking ‘Conversions’ is continuing and working well to ensure
Conversions are completed successfully.

A new document is being put together to aid in the resolution of ‘Break-Fix’ calls on ‘Mobile’ sites. This document will include training tips and check
lists for the Post Masters to complete before logging the call. There will also be a structured script for Horizon Service Desk staff to follow to ensure data
collection and description of the faults are captured accurately.

2.1.7 Message Broadcast

24 Message Broadcasts were sent this month.
2.1.8 Horizon Service Desk and Complaints
The HSD achieved all SLT's in January.

The inappropriate calls increased slightly in January by about 7%, this is an expected result for January, Fujitsu will monitor the situation with POL to
identify any new trends or issues.

4 complaints have been logged with Fujitsu this month. 1 on engineer attendance times, I on online services, 1 on Hardware reliability and the final 1 on
HSD advice. Within the 4 logged complaints I is marked as justified (engineer), 3 as unjustified. The table below shows details of the individual
complaints.

2.1.9 Business Incident Management
There were 53 BIM incidents raised during January, 12 less than December 2005.

Of these incidents raised 20 were within the 8 hour response SLT (predominantly relating to the ‘Network Banking State 4’ exception state) and 33 were
within the 5 day response SLT.

2.1.10 Engineer Services — Site Visits By Engineer

There were 4692 break-fix site visits completed in January, (compared to 4584 in December), of which 3766 resulted in unit exchanges, and the overall
performance of the engineering service continued to be delivered around our SLT. The overall service continued to be affected by last December’s
logistics changeover until the middle of the January when service largely returned to Business As Usual levels on a day by day basis. However the SLT
figures reflect performance across the entire month.

Service Improvements

FJS are constantly working to deliver improved Break-Fix SLTs and will continue to give management focus to the current problems in getting stock to
engineers. It is expected that the monthly performance figures will return to full conformance in February.

In January, the new mobility box and power supply unit for the mobile counters was introduced and this is expected to deliver increased reliability of the
mobile counters.

The pro-active replacement programme for PIN pads reporting HCP errors got underway in January, and over 250 units were replaced. The remaining
14 (at time of print) will be completed in February prior to the start of the $90 release.

FJS are working on a project aimed at reducing the numbers of engineering visits required; and have also proposed a number of initiatives in which Post
Office Ltd could assist in this area.

Remedies

In January there were 498 remedial calls , which is higher than in December (335). Penalties incurred were £108.923.36. Performance for some SLTs
finshed below target: for Local A priority calls (93.8%), Local B priority (89.6%) and Remote B priority calls (93.9). Average Down Time was also
much higher than normal due to the additional time it took to get some spares to engineers for their calls.

2.1.11 Security Services

AUTOMATED KEY REFRESH

An average of 443 branches a day were selected for key refresh while the key refresh algorithm was turned on for this month resulting in a total of 1335
branches being targeted for refresh. The key refresh algorithm is now permanently turned on, and will be continually monitored.

2.1.12 PostShops

The PostShop rollout ceased in December with 166 live branches. Fujitsu are still in discussion with POL regarding any additional PostShops now
required so this is the live estate at the current time. The call volumes are 50% lower this month from the previous two months this is an excellent trend
and indicates that the PM’s are now very comfortable with the PostShop application.

There are no big issues this month.All issues logged are being reviewed and analysed to identify any trends. The table below represents all issues logged
by the PostShops Servicedesk.

File deliveries:
There was I instance of file delivery taking a while on 11'" January by 24 hours, however the files were all delivered the next morning. The problem was
caused we believe by a corrupt data base file ( not PC anywhere) that is part of the mechanism that controls the polling sequence.

3.2.2 ONLINE NETWORK SERVICES
Network Service Summary
The network performance in January 2006 built upon the exceptional performance in December 2005.
¢ No major incidents in the Fujitsu/C&W domain
Process improvements in the Fujitsu/C&W domain have continued to deliver improved network reliability across all technology platforms.
There was however a reference data incident on 19th January 2006 resulting in the VSAT network quality of service deteriorating. This is a
known problem and options to address are being reviewed by the Service Improvement forum. In this incident the release size exceeded the
specified capacity of the network. The SSC manually controlled replication and perfect service was restored at 11:31.
e Fastest transaction times ever recorded with 0.30s average network banking authorisation time at ADSL branches.
The fastest daily performance was 0.26s and the slowest was 0.32s showing that a fairly consistent quality of service has been achieved.
e Further network improvements
In early February 2006 the C&W ADSL components in Telehouse will be relocated to provide greater environmental protection. This was a
recommendation from a recent BAS audit. After this is complete all major network components will be in dedicated Fujitsu, C&W or BT suites
with restricted access. The plan incorporates known issues from previous incidents to minimise the risk of an incident occurring.
Between February 2006 and April 2006 all the BAS routers are scheduled to be upgraded to a more recent Cisco IOS software release. During the
evaluation exercise this release was proven to be very secure and robust. C&W have recommended it as very suitable for the high availability

requirements of the Post Office ADSL network. The release will be scheduled carefully to avoid any impact to $90/92 counter software
distribution.

4.1.1 SUMMARY

e As at 31.01.06 there were 6 open problems, of which 0 are Problem Branches
© 0 new problems were opened in January.

4.2 PROBLEM MANAGEMENT CROSS DOMAIN PROBLEMS —- ON ALERT

- There are no cross domain problems on alert for January.

4.3 KEY CROSS DOMAIN PROBLEM UPDATE

The new RAG status for the key cross domain problems are based on the criteria —

Business Impact

Bl score Root Cause RC score

High (H)

>20 outlets affected

3

Root cause unknown, no progress or no workaround in place

3

Medium (M)

>1 <20 outlets affected

2

Root cause determined, implementation agreed/needs to be agreed or
workaround in place

2

Low (L)

<1 outlet affected

Fix implemented and problem being monitored

1

RAG status = BI score x RC score = (RED = 6-9) (AMBER = 3-6) (GREEN = 1-2)
The differentiator to be applied between a RED & AMBER RAG status score of 6 depends on whether the RC is known and whether a workaround is in
place i.e. if a the score of 6 is derived by a “Root cause unknown, no progress or no workaround in place = RC score of 3” then the RAG will be red.

If the RC score was derived by “Root cause determined, implementation agreed/needs to be agreed or a workaround in place = RC score of 2 then the

RAG will be amber.

5 SCORECARD ACTION PLAN - from January 2006

Service

Post Office Ltd suggestions for improvement from previous
scorecard

Fujitsu Services Response

Business Continuity
Tony Wicks

Issues: None

Comments: Very satisfied with service. No MBCIs during
period. A potential MBCI (Wigan power failure 06/01) was
dealt with effectively through the normal channels. The final 4
reports from the 2005 test schedule have now been received

No Comments.

Release Management
Graham Welsh

Issues: None

Comments: Very satisfied with service. Good support and joint
planning on the $90 release

January has seen some significant challenges that have been dealt with
in a fair and measured way. Open communication has helped to
ensure that the issues and impacts are clearly understood. Again close
working and the daily & weekly contact has ensured that has been an
open and respectful interaction between the teams.

Management
Information and Service
Review

Pete Thompson

Issues: None

Comments: Service Review - The daily/weekly/monthly reports
continue to be very helpful and well utilised by a wide POL
audience. FS reports received in only Adobe Acrobat format
pose a minor problem (POL's version of Acrobat does not allow
multiple documents to be open simultaneously).

GRO

} will contact Les Henderson to discuss

Stephen Taplin!
the Adobe Acrobat issue going forward.

Capacity Management

Data Delivery
Ian Daniel

Issues: None

Comments: FS have visibily been endeavouring to improve on
the working relationship (this wasn't an issue before) but there's
a lot more interaction and working together with a common aim
etc etc. As per last month's comments regarding the APSORF
TOR, this has been revised but I have yet to review and approve
and work up the criteria to enable scoring to be clearly defined
(4.5). LFS - very satisfied (4).

Still working on the TOR.

Post Office Ltd suggestions for improvement from previous
scorecard

Fujitsu Services Response

Issues: None

Comments: As per previous months, volume of changes coming
in has not reduced and our two respective teams are working
very well and hard to get things out there to timescales and
quality.

No Comments.

Operational Business
Change: Branch
Ian Venables

Issues: As for last month, it is important that this level of
performance is sustained and that the Cable & Wireless
“takeover” of Energis is utilised to obtain further Service
improvements from BT for branch openings, conversions,
relocations etc

Comments: Fujitsu achieved their OBC Branch OLA Target of
4% (excluding BT Line Plant) in December, with a 2.40%
failure rate. POL is pleased to acknowledge that Fujitsu is
maintaining an improved level of performance.

POL is pleased with the productive level of co-operation being
received from Fujitsu on Service and Process Improvements.

OBC continues to enjoy an honest and close working relationship with
Post Office.

The forecast for January’s OLA is likely to be within a 2% failure for
the 4% target. Actual figure to be published prior to 7” Feb.

Fujitsu OBC continues to work closely with Cable & Wireless to
improve communications availability and to progress “Openings” to
ADSL.

Current improvements to the service include the migration of VSAT
sites to ADSL, an improvement to the process for managing fault calls
on Store and Serve sites which operate ‘Mobile’ Horizon equipment.
The project continues for the removal of all existing CRT’s on the
Managed Branch estate, conclusion of this project is still forecasted to
arrive by the end of May 2006, some 4 months prior to the agreed
timescale.

Fujitsu OBC continues to work closely with Post Office on their
current ‘Conversion’ schedule to realise completion of this schedule
prior to the financial year end.

The action plan for some engineering resource to be dedicated to OBC
continues with the end result likely to be a small increase in the size of
the team

HSH/Engineers
Julie Welsh

Issues: FS to check change implementation procedures/triggers
to reduce risk to service

Comments: HSD - No issues, very satisfied with service.
UKME - The change over to a new logistics supplier affected
service when the daily replenishment process for the new
supplier was not implemented correctly. In addition, a system
failure meant that engineer scheduling had to be done ona
manual basis. These problems resulted in a shortage of hard
ware supplies and caused engineer visits to backlog. This
problem started during week commencing 19th December but

HSD - Resume meetings and level of contact to enable effective
communication between the two desks.

UKME - It has been agreed that the SLTs for UKME will be
conformant from 1“ February. All SLTs are currently conformant
apart from the Local A Priorities. UKME and POA are working
together on the Local A Priority calls in order to bring this figure back
into the green. Conformance for Local A Priority Calls may be at risk
ifa number of calls logged for Mobile sites on the same morning, this

business as usual levels were not achieved until Friday 13th
January. An avoidable problem that means a score of 2. It is
recognised that Fujitsu gave the problem the highest priority and
diverted a great deal of resource and time to the back log of
calls. In addition, HSD worked very hard in terms of
communicating with the affected branches and facilitating out of
hours visits over the Christmas period. UKME worked closely
with POL to mitigate the impact upon branches. For that
element score a 4.

is due to problems with the spares not working when they get to site,
and having to cab subsequent spares to site. The reliability of
luggables is currently an item on our risk register and a focus area for
the service improvement group

Problem Management
Mike Stewart

Issues: None

Comments: Another reasonably quiet month. Very satisfied
with service.

Agreed another quiet month and a great achievement on branch
availability although badly let down by BT in taking 9 days to restore
the ADSL service to a VIP site “The Markets” Leeds due to a major
circuit problem at the Leeds exchange

Reconciliation
Pete Thompson

Security
Brian Pinder

Issues: Ensure all details are captured accurately on
documentation

Comments: Generally good, however, a small number of
reports have been received with FAD codes missing (3.5). No
issues with MER spreadsheets (4).

Apologies for the missing information. Fujitsu MSU will ensure all
details are captured accurately on individual BIMS. Please note where
the FAD code continues to be left off, this will be deliberate due to a
multiple-FAD incident and details will be explained on the individual
BIMS.

Issues: Discuss and agree OLA timescales for TES user
amendments.

Comments: Generally good service. Adding and removing TES
users still problematic. Whilst this topic should be discussed at
the next security meeting (20th Jan) there is a real need to agree
and document an OLA for user amendments e.g. 48 hours from
request to change (3.5).

Need to identify the problematic areas so we can identify the solution.
This has been raised and waiting for PO to discuss issues.

Networks
Alex Kemp

Issues: FS to ensure correct channels are followed when
reporting faults.

Comments: The BT exchange fault on the 30 December
affecting 11 branches in the Basinstoke area was handled well
by FS (FS contacted branches individually).

A BAS router failure was reported to POL on the 4 January but

Throughout the months of December and January there has been 100%
availability of all the major ADSL components (including BAS
routers).

04/01/06 - This was an overnight local exchange fault that affected 4
branches PSTN lines in the Isle Of White which was resolved by
09:24. The incident was first alarmed when a BAS went to 8% offline

was not reported through the POL Service Continuity Desk.
A&L - recognising that the Telford BAS router incident was not
notified into the Service Desk (call was made to the Resolution
Manager), it should be recognised that Fujitsu provided early
alerts to POL of problems in the A&L network on 6th January

however it was immediately clear that it was not a BAS fault. Small
local exchange faults are not currently reported to POL SCT under the
major incident process.

06/01/06 - This was an incident in which transactions were being
returned due to A&L system unavailability. Our powerhelp call
history indicates that the HSD made 3 attempts to phone the POL SCT
but there was no answer. The HSD agent then phoned a Resolution
Manager to ensure that POL received the message.

Service Improvement
All

Issues: None

Comments: BC - Thanks to Tony Wickes for identifying a risk
exposure to POL regarding CP4307. Tony's action has allowed
POL Business Continuity to escalate the issues internally within
POL (4).

Problem Management working group going very well (4).

(Management Information & Service Review + Reconciliation) Fujitsu
MSU would like to arrange a monthly conference call prior to the
Scorecard being issued in order to discuss scores and improvements.

Communication
All

Issues: None

Comments: BC — Very satisfied.

(Reconciliation) : All POL contacts are very friendly, helpful and
informative. Fujitsu MSU would in particular like to mention Janet
Jones and Angela Carter. Fujitsu MSU would be appreciative if POL
can please alert us to sick/annual leave cover in advance as
appropriate.

Issues: None

Comments: Generally very satisfied (4). Thanks to Nick Crowe

REVIEW OF ENGINEER SERVICES

Performance of the engineering service was again significantly affected by the change in Logistic supplier in December 05 and a number of service level
targets were not met because of difficulties in getting some spare parts into some regions. However there was a definite improvement in the second half
of January following measures put in place to manage the daily workload of the engineers and some diligent management of the spares ordering process,
such that the service returned to Business As Usual levels before the end of the month. Performance for Local A priority calls finished at 93.8% and for

B priority at 89.6%. Average down time was also much higher than normal

BS.1 The number of instances in which any of those connections are unavailable for two minutes or more in any calendar month of each SLT Calendar
Year shall not exceed one, in respect of each NB Authorisation Agent to PI connection relating to the same Bank which are available in that month.
Therefore Fujitsu are permitted one failure per month for each of the connections/lines above (4 for Link/A&L, and 8 for Capo as long as it is not the
same one twice for the given month).

BS5.2 The number of instances in which any of those connections are unavailable for two minutes or more in any calendar month of each SLT Calendar
Year shall not exceed two, in respect of each NB Authorisation Agent to PI connection relating to the different Banks which are available in that month.

If one interprets this as a max of any two PI failures in one month, it would not align to BS.1.

B5.3 & 5.4 are as above, with the exception that they restrict the failures in Q to one minute, and are performance metrics and not SLTs.
