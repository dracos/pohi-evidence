Managing Directors Summary

1 SUMMARY

1.1 RELEASE 1

e Negotiations and discussions.on the replan has again dominated much
of the managément time during the month. However wé have now
achieved a high level agreement oni the Commercial arrangements and
a high levél view of the implementation programme plan for 1997.
Broadly speaking, the acceptance process will be achieved through a
phased delivery of service products through the year, leading to
national rollout formally at the end of November. However in
parallel with this we shall implement a large number of post offices
with the approved products as they go through staged acceptance.’
The bottom line is that by the end of-the year we-will have some 2,200
post offices fully automated on rhe complete Release 1 package
covering something like 4,500 counters. Now that this plan has
emerged, there is carly sign that everyone is getting their own
individual components locked in behind it-with a sense-of
commitment and progress. .This need to pick up speed further during
the next four weeks. Quite importantly we have also been able to fix
the dispute on training:as a parc of the replanning exercise and this
now is being tested prior to the early go-live offices. There are
however quite a few important issues not resolved. through this
process and at the top of the list at the moment:is the complicated
issue of migration, not just of computer systems but of manual
processes and procedures. In addition the issue of countér space
although being more fully investigated still needs resolution.
Nevertheless, the replan work.is now sufficiently well advanced that it
can be parcelled up and given to the Core Negotiation Team [CNT] to
write into contractual form. I expect this will take quite some time.

1.2 CONTRACTUAL ACCEPTANCE

© This is the next big issue which will dominate the landscape forthe
next six months. Roles, responsibilities and planning work has taken
place but the real brunt of the preparatory effort needs'to be handled
through March. We need to be pressing PDA very. hard for.agreement
by Easter. .

1.3 SUPPLIERS ROUNDTABLE

© The result of the replan, or more accurately the CAPS slippages'with
migration of benefits to cards places serious business not‘only on ICL
Pathway but more particularly on Girobank and De La Rue.

1.4 CAPS PROGRAMME

® Confidence in the CAPS Programme-is now at a low point. Not only
do we anticipate difficulties with technical interface completion but
the délays to migration to the payment card for all benefits beyond
child benefit is now certain. What is uncertain is how long-these
delays‘will be.and the only: material we have is provisional. Although
we are covered by the change control process for this migration, this is
of little comfort. Thought is being given as to.how to escalate this
issue before it gets even worse.

1.5 NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

e Weare beginning to see the early days.of-a range of opportunities to
exploit and leverage the infrastructure. These vary from Government
Direct-to DNS to Magistrates Courts. The challenge is to bringthem
into our Business Development process such that we can populate new
facilities in-our Release 2 and Release 3 products in the first half of
1998. :

1.6 RISK MANAGEMENT

° We have issued the next full risk report on the programmié and this
now includes not just the, high level risks but the comprehensive
analysis of all knownrisks. This at.a high level shows that we start the
year with some £80m worth of risk and that if we pursue our
mitigation actions as currently defined, we can bring this down to
£27m by the end of this year. There is the management view that
there is scope within this to be more aggressive in reducing‘tisks and

this'will be driven through during Q2, Q3 this year.

1.7 STRATEGIC QUALITY MODEL

© We have just conducted our second audit on the EFQM business
model which shows thar substantial progress has been made over the
last eighteen months on the key areas of process development,
customer satisfai and resource management. This is'‘proving a
very useful annual health check and will give us three or four major
areas to focus on in 1997.

1.8 OVERSEAS POSTAL AUTHORITIES

e A lot of attention was given to Australia Post this period, although the
end result was that they have signed a Letter of Intent directly with
Escher for the use of Riposte for their next generation of countér
automation. As it stands therefore, ICL Pathway has no involvement
with this contract. Negotiations:with An Post and Escher for a joint
agreement on International Sales are marking time. !t had been hoped
that the Australia Post situation would help catalyse this. Interest is
being shown by other postal authorities‘although on somewhat longer
timescales. With a lack of any international agreement, these need to
be handled with extreme care.

2.2 SYSTEM TESTING

e Good progress has been made on the first two elements of the Release:
1 product, including the OBCS release due for shipment at the end of
April.

2.3 ESCHER DELIVERABLES

e Training mode has now been delivered. Much however remairis on
the critical path including the critical issue of scaleability and
disciplines for issuing software deltas rather than complete.releases. It
is not clear that Escher can issue Riposte with the scaleability we
require and this may require contingency action driven by Pathway.

2.4 EDS CONTRACT

¢ This looks now to.be resolved with the relationship being EDS
contract to.ITSA and ITSA contract to Pathway. This-is how we
wanted it many months ago arid is a good-out-turn.

2.5 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT

e Progress being made-with Tivioli and the baseline for the systems
management product is now beginning.

2.6 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE

e A lot of good progress on this front from the Management Awareness
programmes through to the trial run of the user training programmes.
Our ambition to get the Horizon programme tito the broader set-of
post office change programmes is gaining ground and this will give us
a high profile opportunity.

2.7 IGL SYSTEM

This is now likely to continue until the end of June and thé card usage
will extend. It is now over 1,500 cards.

¢ The OBCS Release (Pathway 1b) started February with baselining the
software, then completing System Testing on 21st February and is currently
in Business Integration Testing.

e The System Access Control has now been agreed for the OBCS release and
progress is being made on the BPS release with agreement expected by mid-
March. All issucs seem to be near resolution.

¢ Pathway Releases 1c and le are progressing to schedule However these are
dependent on the end of software development and achieving a basclined by
the end of February, and therefore becoming stable, before more rapid
progress in System Testing is: made.

© The impact of these multiple releases on the number and planning of the
required test configurations was resolved during the month.

¢ Agreement on ownership of migratioi-was a serious hindrance on progress
during the month (since resolved), however, good progress has, been made on
(1) User Awareness events.signed off (2) Training mode delivered by Escher
(3) Train the Trainer events having begun (4) Detailed installation plans for
the-first 200 Offices have been agreed (5) Meetings between Programme
Managers:and POCL Regional Liaison Managers proving productive in
agreeing processes to be adopted during rollout

e Recruitment for'Help Desk and Autoconfiguration staff has started and
Linkwise have sourced key individuals

« The.effect of the re-plan is now being reflected in a re-issue of the Master
Plan showing key Handshake Milestones. Section 2.1 shows that good
progress was generally made except in the area of agreeing Acceptance
Criteria and test’scripts for the key Acceptance process that will be followed
for Release 1e; it is expected that good progress will be made in this area in
March

2.4 RELEASE 2 AND RELEASE 3

e Senior management attention is now being concentrated on dates for Release
2 key components and therefore more focus is being brought to bear on this
Release; the importance of this is heightened by the fact that Acceptance for
Release 1 will not be given until Pathway-also demonstrates the capability to
support payment of multiple benefits and on-line functionality being
delivered in Release 2.

e Akéy document for Release 2, the ICL Pathway CAPS On Line stratégy, has
been issued. Now that development-work on Release 1 is easing, désign work
has now commenced on Release 2.

e A detailed Release 2 plan will be available during March.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

© Now that we are adopting a phased Release strategy the Migration activities
at the counters and in the Data Centres becomes more difficult and requires
dedicated resource t6 ensure this area is de-risked and driven through.

e Escher have been asked to provide deltas (incremental changes); it is
imperative to the success of the Project that this happens.

e CAPS are likely to miss delivery of a key design document - due 14/3/97. This
will impact release 2 schedule.

4 ISSUE

¢ The PSTN solution for the Post Offices not served by ISDN has made good
progress during the month however issues still remain. We have a tactical
solution to satisfy the requirements for the first-200 offices and the strategic
solution is expected to be available from EICON in April.

e Jt is.now certain that we will have to replace the keyboards that will have
been installed in the first 200 Post Offices some time before the end of June.
This will mean a re-visit by the engincers to swap the replacement

e Although all development was planned to bé.compleéted by the end of
February, there are still extra software releascs-entering T&I in the early
weeks of March.

e Significant frustration is being experienced by Pathway in getting POCL to
make progress on new Business requirements for Release 2.

¢ Documentation text production and agreement is being. hampered by a
convoluted sign-off process in the customer domain.

Commercial & Financial Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

¢ The overwhelming focus for the month has again been the Replan, and our
attempts to conclude a reasonable commercial arrangement aligned to a
workable programme plan. Although the formal Change Request is still in the
pipeline, a deal has now been struck which should hold. This includes
resolution of the Training issuc.

© One level down, we still have a number of issues to resolve (eg. counter
space, customer education), but progress is being made.

© We have at last got ourselves into a position from where we can resist
requirements creep effectively. Notably, a robust position taken on added
DSS functionality for Release 2 has already paid dividends.

2 PROGRESS

e Replan
© Training cost recovery
e Minor items (but points of principle) - Flying logo and Feltham lease resolved

¢ Concerted pressure on PDA/ Sponsors to deliver against Contracting
Authorities Responsibilities (CARs) is paying off

¢ Our handling of Change Request 16A (CAPS Release 3 functional spec.)

In light of the recent replanning exercise the plan baseline has been reset and as
such the “Previous Completion Date”, or baseline completion date is the same as
the “Current Completion Date”.

There.are no Release 1 or Release 2 Milestones scheduled for completion in
March for Commercial & Finance.

2.3 EXTERNAL, WITH PDA

© CNT were not part of negotiating the-Replan. The commercial people in the
PDA were positively excluded from all discussion. Yesterday’s CNT was
dedicated to a description by the [CL Pathway commercial team to the PDA
Head of Procurement and POCL’s and DSS’ lawyers of what had been agreed
and what the considerations had been. in getting there. The purpose was to
establish common ground from which they could write the Change Request.

e The gulf between the PDA programmes pcople and their commercial people
is extraordinarily wide and quité dangerous. All too often, their programmes
people carry on as though they have authority to actonly to hit a veto:at the
eleventh hour. The commercial arm can veto a Change Requestor cause the
shape of Live Trial to be amended - and they have done. Increasingly, the
ICL Pathway commercial team finds itself filling the vacuum in
communications-on their side. Used well, this does give us advantage, but the
relationship has become unstable.

e CAS resolution has moved a step closer following a CNT sponsored meeting
between ICL Pathway, PDA commercial, ITSA commercial.and.EDS. It was
acknowledged that the trading relationship should be ICL Pathway to ITSA
(purchase of machine time) and ITSA to EDS, against a work-specification set
out by ICL Pathway.

e The Commercial and Financial Forum contintes to deal efficiently with
practical matters in the charging arena. It looks like we have secured the
contract for supplying the DSS with Customer. Receipts. The business will be
committed single supplier for three years minimum. It is reasonable margin
and was not included in the Business Plan.

2.4 EXTERNAL, WITH POCL, DSS

© Recent realignment of responsibilities within POCL has strengthened the
roles of the key Financial and Commercial people we deal with. That is good
news. Activity on New Business is picking up, but is as-yet sporadic.

¢ DSS is, by comparison, impenetrable.

2.6 INTERNAL TO ICL PATHWAY
e Strenuous effort has continued to lock down outstanding CARs and
Agrcements to Agree, to respond to a wave of Change Requests, and to
complete the internal Change-Proposals needed to bring all aspects of our

solution fully into line with the many detailed reference-documents. This
against the background, until a few days ago, of an unstable planning base.

2.1 POST DROP DOWN

¢ All applicable CCNs have now been factored into the SADD Version 2.1 texts
and the salient CRs required for Version 2, particularly P16a’s expected

2.4 DETAILED PLAN ACTIVITIES

2.4.1 CURRENT ACTIVITIES

2.4.1.1 RELEASE 1

¢ A service agreement-describing the way in which EDS will operate the CAS
and OAS functions was prepared and reviewed positively by EDS. A
PDA/EDS/Pathway tripartite negotiation on 21/2 concluded favourably: EDS
will supply service for CAS/OAS operation as part of their Service agreement
with ITSA and we will have an agreement with ITSA. The sérvice. description
detailing failure scénarios will be retssuéd to EDS on 10/3.

¢ DSS cancelled the meeting arranged to progress thé address data cleansing
programme.

¢ Twenty PINICLs were cleared and none is outstanding.

© The document defining Post Office Closures was prepared and formally
signed off by the PDA.

© A development version of (BPS) MIS reports. is now demonstrablé in Dublin.

° Oracle has delivered BPS Accounting & Reconciliation reports. A-CP to
produce a daily file‘stimmary is required.

© There-is-potential issue concerning thé acquisition and distribution of BPS
Reference Data. It needs to join the POCL Reference data stream at some
point.

© We are trying to remove R791 (Notifications of Atempted Infringement of
Restricted Post Office). It is no obvious value.

© Changes for the Release 1 Welsh PUN were incorporated.

e Customer Services have asked for some changes following IGL experience:
some 6% of customers turn up at their post office with neither. PUN nor [D.
We propose to highlight and strengthen the words on the PUN telling people
what to do.

° We have raised a CP for Ithaca to support the full Welsh character set.

e The Audit Trail Functional Specification was output at’Version 2.0, and PDA
notified that the period’ for review was closed.

2.4.1.2 RELEASE 2

Over 60 Change Proposals were reviewed this month. We have raised five
Release 2 Change Proposals. Oracle éxpect-another 12 will be needed. Some
are to correct declared non-compliance’s at Release 1, but most are to
implement established contractual Release 2 functionality.

© Tony H has achieved a level of agreement between BA Business Processes and
CAPS over Foreign Encashment business.rules, but in doing so has found
another limitation in the BES implementation: it cannot support-a payce with
miltiple roles for the same payment. It may be possible to insist on
precedence rules for payee roles which would involve a minor change to
Oracle, and leave BES alone.

¢ The CAPS On-Line/Temporary Token issue has been the single most
significant activity involving all members of the team.

e The Temporary Tokers Usage paper was reissued to support PDA internal
review and as a basis for Customer Services to obtain sample documents and
costs from De La Rue.

¢ A paper describing the business principles embodied within the Pathway BPS
solution was produced and discussed with PDA/DSS as an aid to clarifying the
preferred approach to on-line business operations. Unfortunately this was not
factored in to CR P16a which was clearly the product of a committee that
could not decide what it wanted. .

¢ CR P16a was reviewed and comments and cost estimates returned to PDA
who now advise that P16b will be issued based upon the business rules
provided earlier and removing, in effect for convenient discard, the batch
interface changes and programmatic on-line enquiries requirements.

e A proposal on the scorecard implications of on-line working was produced
and reviewed with the Finance Director. The currently proposed business
tules are now grouped broadly in line with the likely scorecard charge lines.

e An approach to handling the commercials of EVP for carded agents was
agreed.

2.4.1.3 RELEASE 2/3
* POCL cancelled the Inventory Management meeting.

¢ Change Request 0004 to introduce support for a remote stock unit on an
outlet parent/child has been passed-to P&I for impacts.

2.4.1.4 CARS

Highlight‘of a busy month was declaration of critical CARs for which all in
Pathway contributed - many: thanks. To the extent CARs’ may have
contributed to progress, the pressure on Reference Data looks to be paying
off. The CARs’ bureaucracy is bang up to date. The creation of a new,
Release-related set of dates for old “Ongoing” CARs is now the enticing
prospect.

2.4.1.5 ACCEPTANCE - +

¢ [thas proved difficult to get everyone on the team connected to the Access
database for this activity. Target dates were set such that we should be able ro
give PDA some work to do at Easter, but we will need to make strong
progress during March.

The PAS/CMS and CAPS Acceptance Criteria specifications are being largely
rewritten by Testing. Current-versions werc based on out of date test
conditions. However rapid progress is now expected. ,

e Some progress was made with APS and work has started on OBES. POCL

Infrastructure yet to start.

¢ Avstart has been made on BES acceptance test specification. The current
document also requires substantial update/rewrite to bring it into line with the
acceptance criteria and test conditions.

© Other Test Manager contributors to this activity are at-a comparable level of
progress.

2.4.1.6 NEW BUSINESS SUPPORT

¢ The.Mails BRD business case remains on hold within POCL. Pathway needs
to determine the base from which Mails will be produced.

¢ The Talexus BRD has been split.into two: the interface specification for the
Key has now been provided. as a Token technology Specification; a revised
detailed BRD for Talexus functionality is promised for 10/3.

° A price indication was provided for Project Beekeeping (Restricted).

© POCL has decided that unless Transys funds the ticket issuing hardware there
is no business case.

* POCL have issued the EFTPOS Merchant Acquirer ITT but we have not been
notified of thé likely service scope. A mecting with ICL Retail has been set
up for mid March .

* Pathway is preparing a workable design for Mobiles.

* Dave H’s trip.to FJ Japan was prepared, including a briefing on the visit to
Pathway of Mr Takahashi from Nomura Research Institute, later in March.

1.1 OPERATIONS

1.1.4 INITIAL GO LIVE - 2
e The service‘continues to run successfully with few technical problems.

© Improvements have been necessaty in the areas of escalation management,
support and reconciliation.

© An escalation process between Pathway, ITSA.and PDA is being designed and
will be agreed next month.

© It has now been agreed to usethe reference machine for both problem
replication and testing. This is nor ideal since-it causes delays due to the
setting and resetting time for two different environments and also prevents
parallel activity when more than: one fault is being diagnosed. I-will be
pressing for separate reference and test-rigs to be built for. Release. 1b.

© The potential overpayment problem we encountered at King Stanley PO,
where expired payments were re-activated, resulted from an indexing
problem already predicted by Escher and for which a repair had already been
produced. Delays in the support process meant that the repair was not
available for application until the day of the incident. Actions are in place to
speed up the process of testing. and implementing software repairs.

1.1.2 MIGRATION.

© .An outline migration strategy has been published and the Release’ 1b to 1c
migration exetcise, which has been scheduled for June, will be,reviewed-and
signéd off in March.

e@ ACP has been submitted proposing to relocate IGL and Réléase 1b hardware
from Feltham to Wigan in order to minimise the migration risk.

113 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
© Tivoli is now undergoing counter build ready for model office.

e The testing of software distribution scripts and event tnanagémiéntiis
continuing in Bracknell. Once-testing has been completed it will be possible
to distribute software (i.e. fixes) to the counter..A full evaluation is underway
to determine if there are any issues which would prevent:software distribution
to be used for the Release 1b to 1c upgrade.

© Work has started on the software release management process.

1.1.4 SYSTEMS OPERATION

© The Release 1b operational day design , the Maestro schedule, the high level
resilience design, Sequent failure information and strategy for backup and
restore have all now been produced.

© The first draft of the CFM Operations manual has been produced but needs
further work with detailed procedures for normal running and recovery. A
final delivery of operational procedures and scripts to Test and Integration is
planned by 14 March.

1.2 POCL SERVICES

¢ The POCL Card Distribution Contract has not yet been signed off and I shall
inject a further small delay pending the outcome of an internal Pathway
review of the benefits to our solution of PUNs.

© Peritas will now establish a training helpdesk with a separate telephone
number and have agreed that this will be subject to the same measures,
standards and controls in place for the Payment Card Helpline.

© The roll-out helpdesk will use the same telephony and infrastructure as the
Horizon System Helpdesk (note new name for SIS Helpdesk).

© The development of Pathway’s overall support strategy is now well advanced
and is expected to be published and approved by 14 March.

1.3 BA SERVICES

© 1539 cards have been issued to 28 February

¢ The continual re-plan activity continues to cause serious concern to both De
La Rue and Girobank. Girobank are formally sceking to re-negotiate their
contract since 1997 predicted volumes have now fallen below the 70%
threshold.

¢ The PDA have identified late changes in the PUN wording for the Welsh
language component.

© Our experience from IGL is that significant numbers of Customers do not
fully understand the need to use the PUN to collect their Card and are
disposing or losing it. This adds further impetus to our review of PUNs.

© There has still been no progress by PDA on War Pensions Card design,
however activity is planned for March.

© A follow up meeting with the PDA and DSS to review address data quality
has been arranged for March.

© Good progress has been made with RML in defining the contingency

processes for collections from the De La Rue contingency site at Sittard in
Holland.

1.4 APPLICATION SERVICES

1.4.1 PROCESS AND PROCEDURES DOCUMENTS

¢ The PPDs are now being produced to meet the appropriate release (i.e. 1b, 1c
and 1c). We achieved delivery of Release 1b final drafts into the PDA on
time. Final comment from them is due on 5 March leaving us 2 days to turn
them around and publish by close of play on 7 March. The next phase will be
to get official sign off from the PDA after model office.

e A workshop to agree solutions to the Horizon PPD Release 1b Environment
issues was held on 19 February. Good attendance from both Pathway and the
PDA resulted in good progress. Agreement was reached on issues which had
been preventing the Operating Infrastructure PPD being completed.

© The PPDs are now being used in earnest to ensure consistency across Pathway
training procedures and documentation.

¢ A plan for the Release 1c PPD document set is in place and will be published
early in March.

1.4.2 ACCEPTANCE

© Acceptance Packs were sent to the Suppliers mid January specifying the work
they needed to perform. Good responses, requiring only minor re-work were
received from De La Rue and Girobank. The response from Sorbus was late,
not to the required standard and requires major re-work. No response has yet
been received from CFM.

1.5 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SERVICES

1.5.1 SERVICE LEVEL MANAGEMENT

© Progress with CFM on the requirements for SLA Management systems
continues to be disappointing. I have asked Bill Hillyard to secure more
business analysts to help CFM accelerate the production of key
documentation.

© Updates to the Volumetrics have been received keeping Peter Robinson busy
in maintaining his models.

e Extensive re-work will be necessary during March once the re-plan has been
finally agreed.

1.5.3 RECONCILIATION

© IGL reconciliation continucs to perform.successfully. The volume of
payments is now starting to increase.

© A few instances of corrupt data being delivered to counters was experienced
during February. Foreign encashments proved a problem in the carly part of
the month where the payment was showing only on the nominated offices
terminal. A patch was successfully applied mid-month to fix this problem
which has not recurred.

@ Oracle have now released the BES Release I reconciliation reports. They will
be input into the testing environment in early March.

© APS reports are now on the critical path and the exact format required must

be agreed by 5 March.

© Work is continuing to gain agreement.on the error matrix detailing
unmatched encashments which may arise. Requiremént 891 states we have to
resolve any encashments which lave not matched to valid payments within 5
days. Customer Service will be undertaking the investigation and resolution
process. We have yet to agree the financial liability issues between Pathway,
BA and POCL.

© The reconciliation proccsscs will be published by 12 March for agreemerit
with the PDA.

11.5.4 PERFORMANCE.BENCHMARKS

© Jan Ambrose has made-.good progress in establishing the processes for
performance benchmarks. Meetings have been held with POCL ‘s Efficiency.
and Process Support team to review the OBCS transaction model and also
with the BA to agree the BES transaction model.

© A paper and a scoping document have been produced jointly with POCL
describing benchmarking activities and plans.

© A free-standing performance benchmark environment, independent from Test
and Integration, will be established initially focusing on counter transaction
times.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

3.1 RE-PLAN AND CAPS MIGRATION STRATEGY

Imminent application by Girobank to re-negotiate their contract for Helpdesk
services - in the balance is the contract between CFM and Girobank for the
Wigan and Bootle data centres.

3.2 TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE

e Impact on APS transaction times as a result of printing two receipts rather

than using two-part stationery.

4 ISSUES

4.1 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT

A question still remains on the ability of Tivoli systems management to carry
out everything required for the counter upgrade. A full evaluation is being
carried out in early March. It is likely that a site visit will be required for the
upgrade because of the requirement to replace the keyboard.

Ability of Tivoli to perform the software distribution role in terms of
performance and scaleability. We are awaiting a report on the visit by CFM to
Tivoli in the US.

Validation of software distribution scripts. This is awaiting approval by
Product Managers. Ron west is continuing development and testing in
Bracknell.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

« CESG have informally advised us (and PDA have officially confirmed) that
the Red Pike algorithm is inappropriate for encrypting ‘RESTRICTED?’ traffic
to and from people’s homes in Northern Ireland. The secure solution
proposed for CFM technical support from home relies upon Red Pike. We
must seriously and urgently consider alternative arrangements for providing
Sequent/Unix & NT support out-of-hours support from mainland UK.

4 ISSUES

© The work load, particularly for Risk Management, FRM and Security
continucs to grow. I am now recruiting two additional staff - a Risk
Administrator and Security Analyst (within headcount budget).

Siting of the FRM / Security secure area is still under consideration.

5 COSTS

¢ No relevant information is currently available in sufficient detail to report on
costs against budget for February.

Business Development Report

1 SUMMARY

1.1 GENERAL

© Replan activitiés being: finalised now allows us to make progress again,
especially in relation to detailed costings and plans for the advertising and PR
work.

© Although training is ‘wrapped up’ in the replan commercial proposal, we
continue with Peritas‘and POCL to look at ways of ameliorating the
additional cost of the extended training.

© Migration continues to be:another irritating hang-out. I believe there is a way
forward and a meeting on 7/3 will progress this.

© Business Development initiatives continue. Magistrates Courts has been
identified by the ICL account team as a potential revenue earner across the
Post. Office counter.

“© Management of Change continues to progress. Good work with the POCL
management of change programme. Also significant input into training, user
awareness and evaluation. .

e Management Awareness events have received very good feedback and have
been a success.

1.2 MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

1.2.1 CUSTOMER EDUCATION

e ICL Pathway’s recommendations for customer education were-submitted on
15 January. Feedback was received, albeit partial. The activity of submitting,
the recommendations revealed the extent of the PDA disagreement with our
customer education planning (and therefore costing) assumptions.

° A contractual meeting to discuss the variances is scheduled for 6.3.97.

e Until this meeting is held all of the PDA team are refusing to meet and plan
communication. However, now that the next stage of the -itnplementation is
clarified; some progress will be made with the PDA.in teriis.of setting real
deadlines by which information is needed. The real challenge is to get the
PDA to agree any timeplans and to identify how the various sub-groups add
value to the CWG or CSC. I have raised this issue-with Mena: Rego and am
arranging a meeting with her to discuss. The real challenge is to influence the
BA side.

1.2.2 SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

¢ Plan completed covering all key deliverables and production schedules.
Chrissie is trying to get PDA agreement.

1.2.3 PRESS PLANNING
e Most key deliverables have been drafted: no PDA agreement as yet.

¢ No further progress on their acceptance of our crisis Communication plan. and
how they relate to our processes.

¢ We intend to up the ICL Pathway profile independently of the PDA: We will
be targeting the business, quality and trade press. Target start date is June.

1.:2.4 INTERNAL COMMS

¢ As.our involvement here is less cléar (contractually) than elsewhere, progress
is less certain. However, Andrea.has.met with all key: contacts to start a
systematic approach and has been invited on to their sub-group on BA
comms.

e Ajl sponsor publications are now received and have béen. analysed in terms of
audience, frequency and copy déadline. As a result, a list of stories, (with
relevant timings and the magazine for which they are suitable) which convey
our key messages, has been drawn up: we hope to get the PDA to accept
theseas “a good idea” for which they can claim credit!

© The matter of how BA & POCL intend to communicate the procedural
changes of the Card is quite:;complex: PDA Comms are barring our
involvement, but as this isa training issue we are talking to training from the
perspective of how sponsor training can be supported by internal comms.

e Starting to talk to sponsors etc about Internet profile.

e Am still awaiting feedback on. the involvement of thé Sub-fed.

1.3 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

¢ First Client Launch Day in Marketing Suite - revised,agenda which works
well, and has tangible outputs and deliverables.

© Top team approval of Strategic Partnership document. In addition, a number
of useful discussions and follow-up meetings came out of Hedsor session.

© Selection of Business Development. Manager progressing.

© Progress on Mails (although slow-and painful - we now understand reasons for
delay and are addressing), smartkey, bée-keeping, and scorécard mappings.

¢ EFTPOS‘requirement progressing. ITT for merchant.acquirer issued by POCL.
We are costing the development impact.

* Household budgetting has surfaced pushed by the Water Services Association
and by BA who are keen to get rid of their Diréct Deduction free service.

1.4. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE

e The Management Awareness programme is:nearly complete . By the end of
February, 17 events out of a planned 18, in this phase, will have been
completed. The events are undergoing continuous improvement and all have
been very well received. Following Stuart Sweetman’s statement at the PSC
that-he “ now owns the events” I have agreed with Mena Rego and Bruce
MeNiven that we will:issue an invoice to Bruce who will handle it:

° We have been asked to run a Management Awareness event in Chesterfield.
We are discussing terms and conscious that this will be a difficult audience.

e The Management of Change Strategy has been accepted by Lesley Lawson
and Chris Robinson (French Thornton) as the Horizon part of the overall
POCL Change’ Management Strategy (which is not yet-documented). It is a
document that itself will undergo change but-will satisfy the action received at
the Partnership Workshop for a jointly agreed Management Of Change
Strategy.

* Dave Smith will take over lan Gibbard’s old position under the title of Head
of Automation Transformation from April 97.

© French Thornton’s findings include the fact that. Retail Network Managers
currently have planned demands on their time equalling 140% of actual time
available. They are therefore reviewing with Stuart-Sweetman the RNM’s
role.

A lot of work has‘been done on the User Awareness events, and following the
dry-run with PDA I am quietly confident that they will be successful.
Ongoing work will undoubtedly be needed.

e Due to work on Help Desk rationalisation, a large opportunity with Help
desk provision-has been discovered with Post Office group perhaps totalling
30 million calls per-annum. Steve Muchow is the key. contact.

e The concept of Regional User Satisfaction managers has been discussed with
allthe RLMs. As a consequence 2 mini-projects have started:

Greg Couper is working on Information Flow with the

RLM for North-East. The objective is to understand what

information the POCL regions eg the Regional General

Managers, Liaison Managers and Retai] Network Managers
+ will require to play their part in the project effectively.

Jacqui Haxton is working on Red/Amber/Green with the
RLM for the South West. The objective is to develop a
process which identifies those Post Offices that will need
extra help to ensure they are successful (Amber): Red
offices will include serious contractual issues that can only
be resolved by POCL.and Green offices-are those which
should ‘pass smoothly: through the Implementation Process
without needing any further attention. Jacqui will also
document the regional structure:and responsibilities as well
as working closely with an RNM working group for Live
Trial.

e Cards: War Pensions variants remain outstanding although the consultants
were appointed in Nov 96. Tangible designs for DLR to work on were
promised for the end of the month but, in the event, they are now promised
for 14/3. Given that DLRCT receive the designs on 14/3 then approval
should be completed by the end of June (23/6 current target).

1.5.1 NFSP

© Colin Baker has agreed to pay the outstanding invoice of £2.5K in early
April. Sorbus are currently bidding for their h/w & s/w support contracts.
However, they (Sorbus) may decline the s/w unless they can avoid some old
applications which are still running.

activities on the temporary tokens (secure paper/hologrammed....) and the
postmasters’ smart cards will ramp up during the coming months.

John Down 7/3 to see how we might progress this and a general interchange
of views.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

None

4 ISSUES

¢ Migration and “going live” are still a key area of concern. A letter from Bruce
McNiven clearly states the PDAs understanding of the contract that migration
is a Pathway responsibility. This could have serious resourcing and cost
implications. Strategy now adopted and meeting taking place Friday 7" to
discuss.

¢ Delivering User Satisfaction is a responsibility that is not clearly understood.
The implementation teams are not focusing primarily on it, whereas the
service teams are expecting it. It is imperative for both teams and ICL
Pathway in general that User Satisfaction is actively managed and clelivered.
Funding will be an issue.

e Political/sensitive nature of all client re-engineering is becoming clear;
presentations to DNS Union Reps, presentation to Chesterfield. Needs
careful management and will require increasing support from MarComs (PR
management) which is not in current MarComs resource/budget plans. This
represents the most likely route for project leaks if we do not work closely
with clients PR areas.

e  Re-plan activities have been leaked by Girobank the supplier to Girobank the
client. We need to plug this leak for MarComs (PR management), BusDev
(Involvement on Bee-keeping as a partner), and credibility reasons. Richard
Banks is raising re-plan impact at his meeting with Stuart Sweetman on 19/3,
and if Stuart Sweetman deduces that there is an ICL Pathway leak he (or Paul
Rich) is likely to discuss/write to JHB, who accordingly needs to be briefed.
That said, we need to plug this leak sensitively, otherwise Girobank the client
will stop telling us what they have heard from Girobank the supplier.

5 COSTS

e Business Development continues to operate within budget taking into account
the deferred expenditure due to the re-plan.

© I have also undertaken a full review of the.’97 budger with Finance and
Programmes group to ensure accuracy with the overall plan. This has not
uncovered any major discrepancies.

International Sales Report

1 SUMMARY

Australia Post have signed a letter of intent with Escher to use Riposte for their
next generation of counter automation. They have an aggressive programme of
implementation with full roll-out planned by January 1999 to overcome critical
year 2000 issues in their current systems and support their business development
plan. As part of an overall trend towards insourcing IT, Australia Post will
manage this project.themselves supported by existing developmient staff from
Unisys. As part-of'the contract Escher will conduct a design study during March
and it is planned'that ICL Pathway will be involved in this, which may lead to
further consultancy work.

Negotiations for’a joint agreement on international sales witli An Post and
Escher are marking time whilst the full implications of the Australia Post deal
are worked through. A,review of our position has. been scheduled with a
Pathway International Sales Board on 7" March and with Keith Todd on 14”
March.

Our proposal for-a.design study at Deutsche Post (led. by Fujitsu Germany) is
progressing well and they plan to visit us in April.

We continue to develop interest from the Japanese Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications (MPT) along with the Fujitsu account team. MPT have
appointed the Namura Research Institute as consultants and they will visit us on

21" March.

We expect a decision on our joint bid with British Postal Consultancy Services,
_An Post and ICL Bulgaria. by the end of March, following a change in
Government.

2 PROGRESS

There are no handshake milestones-affected by international sales.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

None.

4 ISSUE

The Australia Post’s demands on Escher are likely to conflict with ICL
Pathway’s demands. We will need to be extra vigilant to ensure that our needs
are clearly understood and our milestones are achieved.
