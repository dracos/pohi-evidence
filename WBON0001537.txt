David

Thank you for your email. We're looking to complete the attached bug note and largely need your help with the points
highlighted in yellow, including:

How the issue was fixed.

Asimple explanation of the issue — currently we have " Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the Accenture
CDP system identified that only one top-up had been received by Accenture CDP but two were being shown it the
Horizon Batch Feed. The second Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction, confirming the problem was with
the first transaction." — it would be helpful if this could be expanded on/ explained as fully as possible.

Happy to have a call if the above and attached are still unclear — I can be free for a call between 3.30 and 4.30 today if
you let me know when is best for you.

Kind regards

Katie

Katie,

I have done some digging on this and it doesn’t look like we have a lot of information relating to this issue. It
would be helpful to understand what you are looking for so we can see if there is anything that could be
useful.

If you want to discuss this please do give me a call.

Kind regards,

David

Hi David

Barry is out of the office today, I've been asked to communicate to you directly. Barry has been in touch with your team
separately on this.

I wondered if you would be able to come back to me today in terms of an ETA for a full response from atos please on
the Bug 28 response for the ongoing litigation? The plan is currently to include these bug summaries as part of the
Counsel team's written closings in the Horizon Issues Trial so we just want to be sure on timings of response.

Who’s the lawyer?

What’s this all about?

. One of the bugs that we need atos' support with has been called the 'Drop and Go' bug. Fujitsu have confirmed they
are not aware of the Drop and Go business process and are therefore unable to comment on whether the issue was
caused by user error or a fault with the APADC script. Ideally we want to understand what happened in this particular
instance, if it is a known issue with the script and, if so, how this was resolved. In terms of relevant documents, please
find attached:
