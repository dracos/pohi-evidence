a 1. Why the Government has ALBs UKGI-BP-3260

e Arms Length Bodies are established with a specific purpose, distinct
from their parent department

e They are used:
* To separate implementation from policy making

¢ — In situations requiring independent assessment away from the
department

* To introduce commercial discipline especially in complex delivery
bodies

__I 3. Near term focus UKGI-BP-326a

Context — Mixed understanding of purpose of ALBs across government

= Role — Clear & communicable target shareholder role model
— Understanding of “outlier” roles within portfolio
— Overview of whole UKGI governance landscape

= People — More relevant skill-sets in our target recruitment mix
— Focussed & sustainable training and development for existing
shareholder teams

= Quality — Setting & maintaining UKGI standards, with proportionate &
value-add supporting processes
— Continuous improvement (and risk reduction) by sharing best
practice from inside & outside HMG
= Communication — Clarifying our message on “what we do & why we're good at it”
for audiences across Whitehall & beyond
— Increased interaction with ALB NEDs & external expertise

= Impact — Measuring effectiveness - development of KPIs (both relative
and absolute); identifying things we are doing well & where we
are carrying greater risk
