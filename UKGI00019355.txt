Even if he does table a UQ it is still for the Speaker and Leader of the House to decide
whether or not to accept it. So even tabling a UQ does not necessarily mean a Minister
is called to the House to make a statement. We will not be sure of the position until
tomorrow so recommend sticking tightly to the agreed lines overnight and referring any
wider questions to POL.

We are unlikely to know for sure until after the 6 pm meeting at which the
Second Sight report is 'published' if he is still heading in that direction and,
if he is, then it will be for the Whips to try to use their powers of
persuasion.

Following Jo's earlier telephone call with James
Arbuthnot, suggested briefing for the Whips' Office:

Briefing for the Whips on James Arbuthnot tabling an
Urgent Question to obtain a Ministerial statement in
response to Independent review by forensic
accountants (Second Sight) of Post Office Ltd's
Horizon computer system which records all
transactions conducted across the entire post office
network.

The issues covered by the review relate to a very
small number of ex-subpostmasters whose contracts
were terminated and were subsequently convicted by
the Courts for false accounting or, in some more
serious cases, theft and fraud.

The report confirms that no systemic problems with
the Horizon system were found but also found scope
for Post Office Ltd (POL) to improve aspects of its
support and training for subpostmasters.

POL has welcomed the report and committed to put in
place additional measures to address historic issues,
improve future processes and to work with
subpostmaster representatives to examine potential
changes in support measures for subpostmasters.

Though Post Office Ltd is wholly owned by the
Government, it operates on an arm's length basis in
determining its commercial and operational strategies
and policies.

The issues raised by the Report are wholly
operational matters for POL and do not relate in any
UKG1I00019355
UKGI00019355

way to Government policy decisions or actions. A
government statement could only reiterate that there
was no Government role in the issues and it was not
appropriate for Government to become involved.

A second aspect on which James Arbuthnot (JA) has
indicated a wish to see Government comment or
action is in respect of identifying a means of redress
for ex-subpostmasters who were advised to by their
legal advisors to plead guilty to false accounting to
avoid charges of theft and fraud (which potentially
carry risk of imprisonment if found guilty).

JA is seeking to imply that the Report suggests that
new evidence might be found on the basis of which
some false accounting verdicts could be
challenged/appealed. He has a constituent who was
convicted of false accounting but who has blamed her
circumstances on the Horizon system and lack of
POL support in investigating the financial
discrepancies which occurred in her subpost office.

He also appears to take the view that a Government
statement could open the review and or appeal
against these convictions.

In summary we would suggest that there is a strong
case against tabling an Urgent Question on the basis
that a Government statement could not achieve the
objectives JA seeks because:

= the issues are not related to any Government
action or policy decision but are wholly
operational matters for Post Office Ltd in which
Government has no role.

no systemic problems with the Horizon system
have been identified by the review.

= the number of subpostmasters who have
experienced problems are a minute proportion
of the tens of thousands of people successfully
using the system across the network of over
11,500 branches on a daily basis

Post Office Ltd has proposed measures to
address some of the points about
subpostmaster support and training raised in
the Report
UKG1I00019355
UKGI00019355

= Government cannot intervene in the legal
process to review or appeal past convictions.
