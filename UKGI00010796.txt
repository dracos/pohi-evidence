Day 4 - Highly Confidential & Legally Privileged

Evening Tom & Richard

The parties focused on the non-financial aspects of the proposed settlement and therefore no further
offers were made today. A significant amount of time was spent between the mediators and the
claimants in getting them to articulate the settlement structure. At the end of Day 3, the non-financial
aspects of the settlement from the Claimants’ perspective included:

© Agreed statement by the parties (which we will reviewed from both a legal and comms
perspective)

© POL’s approach to the convicted claimants (not that we “consent” to their applications to
the Court of Appeal to have their convictions overturned but more to do with our approach
ie that we would take external QC expert advice on our ensuring that we comply with our
legal obligations (for eg. disclosure obligations in respect of the Horizon issues judgment to
the CCRC).

© POL would assist those claimants who wish to exit the business post settlement.

© POL would waive or withdraw the proof of debt for those insolvent claimants.

In addition, the claimants have asked today for:
¢ A support programme for claimant SPM and SPM in similar position of the claimants including
mental health support for claimants
* POL to consult claimant group on the change process and for them to have some form of
consultancy role advising the business, which would include input to consideration of the future of

the Post Office
¢ POL not the enforce SPM debts pending implementation of the settlement agreement

© Emergency funding for hardship cases (taken out of the funds of the settlement)

These points are up for negotiation and the devil will be in the detail. The parties are going to have a
discussion tomorrow to better understand what the claimants envisage as they have not really explained
these additional requirements but also for us to socialise operational challenges. For example, there
may be some things we can give assurance on such as some form of consultation but as Nick pointed out
we need to careful not to undermine the existing NFSP or CWU although we may consider what changes
could be made to the NFSP. We also need to keep in mind any potential impact to the Starling project (if
prospectively some of these concessions appear to indicate that SPM are workers).

After the meeting on Tuesday afternoon, we will finalise our settlement draft and circulate to the other
side on Wednesday for review. The parties will then meet again on Thursday to continue the financial
aspects of the settlement. It is therefore likely that Nick and I will need to reach out to Tom and Tim on
Thursday / possibly Friday.

I hope we will be in a position to provide further clarity on the Claimants additional proposals late
tomorrow night/ early Wednesday.

Do let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Kind regards
Ben
