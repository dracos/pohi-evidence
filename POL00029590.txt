So there are a few things

James is now back from recess and has spoken to Janet about the Paula meeting, he drafting something for JFSA and
Second Sight. I spoke to Janet yesterday as it was her first day back and we are organising another's call later in the week
and a coffee to discuss how we take it forward after her conversation with James

There are several things I have said we need to discuss, how we shut down new cases still coming through, how James
deals with cases without any evidence, and how SS fulfil his desire to keep JFSA on Board.

SS are now working in the 3 cases as agreed which include the Rudkin case, where he alleges that he heard someone at
Fujitsu state they could alter a subpostmasters account.

Lesley and I had a meeting with Fujitsu this week and they are providing for us an audit trail of adjustments which can be
made centrally which they say happens very rarely, so we are waiting to see that and the controls in place. However

they suggest that what Rudkin heard was the testers for the HNGX referring to test data and not the live environment.

This would be good if we could prove it.
The plan is to look at the audit trails And then have a joint meeting with us, SS, and Fujitsu.
We are also pushing ahead with the spot reviews sent over by SS. So lots going on

Thanks

Hi Alwen — as you know, Paula is seeing Alice tomorrow. She asked if you could provide an update on
the latest state of play with James Arbuthnot et al. I’ll be sending her a list of issues/background points
tomorrow morning at around 9, so if you were able to give me something by then that would be
appreciated. Give me a call if it’s easier just to give me a few points over the phone — or I can pop
round in the morning.

’'ve mentioned the point we discussed earlier around potentially needing to reconvene the sub-
committee to discuss possible Fed concessions.

Thanks,
Martin
