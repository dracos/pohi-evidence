lan is referring to the Winn-Lusher email — copy attached. In this email, Andy Winn refers to the Balancing Transaction
process that allows FJ to inject new transactions in a branch's accounts.

SS refer to this in all the CRRs that raise "remote access" and this email is the cause of their focus on "remote access".
We did prepare a note to SS on this topic but it never quite got finalised (latest version attached).

Kind regards
Andy

Subject: Second Sight

All,
During a catch up with Second Sight last week, and as part of a discussion about Bracknell, Ian mentioned an
Andy Winn memo. Iam not sure that I have come across this (apologies if you have in the past given me

information about this) and he did not expand on what it was.

Do any of you know? If so, could you please let me know, and copy Tom, Steve and Patrick, what that memo is
about and whether or not the issues it raises have been dealt with.

Best wishes
Belinda
