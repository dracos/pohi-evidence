Peter

Please find attached, as discussed, a copy of the published documentation for the Scheme. There is a flowchart
but there is little about actual timescales although it says that SS will take between I and 3 months to investigate
acase. However, as discussed, the Scheme allows for the Working Group to vary the process as necessary for
the proper administration of the Scheme. It has done that. Specifically the Post Office investigates the case in
the first instance and then passes its investigation to Second Sight to review.

Let me know if you need anything further.
