Dear Kevan,
Please see the email below. Your views?

As for the possibility of an Adjournment Debate, I have been to see the Speaker and
I believe he will grant it for the 90 minute 2:30 session on Wednesday 17"
December. He asked if the application would be in my name or yours. I said either,
not yet sure, which didn’t bother him. Do you have a view? It is possible that since
my flight from the USA gets in at 10:05 that morning, the risk that it might be delayed
by snow or something would suggest it should be you; on the other hand, my name
has been more associated with the issue than yours, and maybe that would bring in
more MPs to take an interest. I shall inquire as to whether it could be in the name of
both of us jointly.

ut I understand will struggle in this afternoon to get the letters and press
release out. I attach hereto my current draft of the letter and of the press release,
which will need some words from you.

Yours ever,

James
