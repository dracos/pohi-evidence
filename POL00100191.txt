David, apologies that we didn't quite finish yesterday, as I meant to ask what out next steps are re the
3A letter to MPs? And, (Alice asked the same question this am) do we have a date for the MPs meeting.

What would be very helpful is a list of next steps on Sparrow as there are a number of issues floating
around - could you do this? And manage me (!) if you need input or responses.

Thanks, Paula
