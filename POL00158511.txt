If the payment-in was increased by £20,000 and accepted, the case would settle and because there would have been no
trial there would be no determination by the court on any of the disputed facts in the case and it could not be held up as a
precedent for any future claims. Each case has to be assessed on its own merits and a settlement in this particularly
difficult case for POL would not mean that future claims where the Horizon system was involved would need to be or
should be settled. There would be no admissin that the Horizon system was at fault if the case settled at this stage on the
basis of an improved payment-in.

A large part of the problem in this case is the age of the claim and the fact that not all the call logs/records are available
as they have been destroyed by Fujitsu which is one reason why we do not particularly wish there to be a trial of this
case.

I have read the notes and spoken to Jennifer Robson about this case and wondered if you could clarify something for us
please? If we were to settle (and we are not stating at this point that we will) could we ask for this to be without prejudice
and settle without admitting that Horizon was at fault. There have been a number postmasters who have not been able
to use the equipment though trained fully at the time of installation and it has frequently been used as an excuse for
errors. We would not want this case to set a precedent for similar cases in th future.

Wolstenholme

I refer to my email to you dated 17/3/04. Can you please let me know if you are willing to increase the payment-in by
£20,000 as my agents in Manchester have written to say that they feel the payment-in should be increased as soon as
possible.
