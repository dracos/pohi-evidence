POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PETER ERNEST JERAM

|, MR PETER ERNEST JERAM, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | am currently the Head of the Digital Systems Platform Unit for Fujitsu Services
Limited (“Fujitsu”), with responsibility for the Europe region, a position | have held
since around May 2018.

2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office IT Inquiry
with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to Fujitsu on 11 March 2022
and a series of follow-up questions provided to me by the Inquiry on 1 July 2022 (the
“Request’), to the extent | have direct knowledge of such matters.

3. Set out in this statement is my best recollection of the matters raised in the Inquiry’s
Request in which | was directly involved. However, some of these topics relate to
events that took place more than 20 years ago; namely the design, development,
pilot, testing and acceptance of the Legacy Horizon system in the period up to the
national rollout. There are therefore circumstances where my recollection is more

limited.

4. Where | have included information from documents relevant to the Inquiry’s Request,
these documents are referred to using references WITNO418_01/1 —
WITN0418_01/7 and are listed in the index accompanying this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. | joined the ICL Pathway Limited (“ICL Pathway”) team in around 1997 as a Senior
Consultant, working for an IT consultancy firm known then as OSI Consulting Limited
(‘OSI’). A number of OSI consultants joined the project with me. Use of external
consultants was not unusual in large IT projects at the time and remains
commonplace today. Prior to attending ICL Pathway, | had seven years’ experience
working on various IT projects with OSI, including a project with International
Computers Limited (“ICL”), as it then was, on another customer account.

6. When | joined the Horizon project as a Release Project Manager, Terry Austin (who
| recall was also an external consultant) was the Development Director. Towards the
end of 2000, | was asked to replace Terry Austin as Development Director. | then
replaced Mike Coombs as the Programme Director in around 2001.

7. It wasn’t until around April 2003, when the Horizon project moved to Fujitsu, that |
joined Fujitsu as a permanent employee.

8. | left the Post Office Account in around 2005 to take on another role within Fujitsu and
have had no direct involvement in the Horizon project since that time.

9. In terms of reporting, as a Release Project Manager, | reported to the Development
Director and joined the Development Director meetings. As Development Director, |
would have joined the Programme Director meetings. Each of the teams | was part

of interacted sufficiently with the relevant other teams, and with the Post Office.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

10.During my time as Development Director, | was part of the Development Directorate,
with responsibility for project managing further technical design, development and
testing of the Horizon system. This included managing the people working on third
party products, such as Escher’s Riposte, which were used as part of the Horizon
solution, ensuring that such third party products delivered what was required to
achieve the solution. The Development Directorate was also responsible for ensuring
that ICL Pathway teams and third party providers delivered to schedule, and resolved
any issues that were found during testing.

11.1 have a project management background and, as the Development Director, | was
responsible for managing timescales, costs, reporting and ensuring that experts
delivered what they were responsible for. My role was not a technical one. It was to
manage others, who did have the relevant technical expertise, and | relied on them
in relation to technical matters. | was not directly involved on the technical side of the
development of the Horizon solution.

PILOT

12.When | started work with ICL Pathway, | recall becoming the Project Manager for
what was known as “Release 3”. | have reviewed the following documents to refresh
my memory in relation to Release 3: (i) an email with subject line “EFTPOS Host
Software ITT” and the EFTPOS Host Application invitation to tender attached
(WITNO418_01/1 and WITNO418_01/2, respectively); and (ii) a memorandum

regarding the “EFTPOS ITT Assessment Process” (WITN0418_01/3). | understand

Page 3 of 9
WITN04180100
WITN04180100

“EFTPOS” to stand for Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale. | do not recall
whether or not “Release 3” correlated to the releases that were rolled out as part of
the pilots. As Project Manager, it was my role to plan how this release would be
implemented, therefore scheduling how long it would take. | then managed the
progress of the relevant release against that schedule, in addition to tracking the costs
and quality of the release. My recollection is that Release 3 was not eventually rolled
out and was probably replaced during any re-planning activities.

13.At this time, | worked in the Development Directorate in a team of hundreds of people,
and reported to Terry Austin.

14. The rollout of the Horizon pilots took place more than 20 years ago. | do not therefore
recall which functions were the subject of the trials for the releases. | do, however,
recall there being a number of test teams and test environments, and that we worked
jointly with the Post Office team. The testing and acceptance of Horizon is discussed
at a high level later in this statement.

CASH ACCOUNT

15. | was not involved in the development of the cash account function in Horizon and
cannot therefore comment on whether there were issues or what may have been
communicated to Post Office. | do, however, recall that the cash account was a real
focus in the development of Horizon and something that had to operate correctly.

16.Prior to Horizon, sub-postmasters were required to complete their cash accounts on
paper, possibly A3 paper. Horizon requirements from Post Office were for the system
to print a cash account, in the same format as the paper versions completed by sub-

postmasters. The sub-postmaster would validate the printed version and submit it to

Page 4 of 9
WITN04180100
WITN04180100

the Post Office. My understanding was that a time later, only when Post Office were
content with the accounting element of the Horizon system, did the Post Office decide
to rely solely on Horizon, and that a paper cash account was no longer printed. | do
not recall exactly when that decision was made by Post Office, but | do remember
that it was not decided quickly.

ACCEPTANCE AND TESTING

17.| noted above that there were a number of test teams and environments during the
period prior to the national rollout. These test teams worked closely with Post Office,
forming joint testing teams. | did not initially recall the names of the Post Office team
members who were part of the joint testing teams. However, | have reviewed an email
with subject line “MOT & ETE Test (V2)” (WITN0418_01/4) and the Model Office Test
(“MOT”) and End-to-End test governance document attached (WITN0418_01/5),
which have prompted me to recall that Chris Young (Chair of the MOT progress/status
meetings), Marc Reardon (Horizon End-to-End Co-ordinator) and Mark Burley (MOT
Co-ordinator) were Post Office representatives involved in joint testing.

18.My recollection is that both the ICL Pathway and Post Office teams worked from ICL
Pathway’s offices in Feltham, where certain test environments were hosted. Post
Office testers had their own room in Feltham, and also joined the ICL Pathway teams
in their workspaces. It was at these offices where the initial test phases were
performed. As explained above, given the project management focus of my role on
Horizon, the technicalities of the various testing environments are not within the scope
of my knowledge. | believe Alan D’Alvarez took over testing at ICL Pathway at some

point, although | do not remember when.

19.One of the final testing phases was the MOT, which comprised a model branch
located on Borough High Street, London (the “Model Office”). The Model Office was
connected to a Horizon test system and enabled the teams to trial releases in a true
Post Office environment. MOT was defined, run and performed by the Post Office
test teams, as demonstrated in the following MOT and End-to-End testing weekly
progress / status review minutes: WITN0418_01/6 and WITNO418_01/7. ICL
Pathway’s role was to supply the counter hardware and to support the operation of
the Model Office as if it was in live operation.
20.In terms of the testing process, tests would have been defined in test scripts,
dependent on the relevant testing phase, and then run against those scripts. The
results of those tests would then have been recorded in documents such as test
reports. At a high level, the relevant test phases were as follows:
a. Unit Testing, Link Testing, and System Testing, which would have been
performed by Delivery Units; then
b. Business and Technical Testing, which tested a system integrated by
Technical Integration and integrated the outputs of the streams described at
(a) above into a single system for testing purposes. While | am aware that this
phase of testing would have involved “technical integration” testing, | am not
aware of the specific content of those tests; and finally
c. End-to-end testing and Model Office Testing.
21.To the extent that deficiencies were identified during testing, these would have been
known to and discussed with the Post Office test teams, logged in the PinICL or Peak

databases (depending on when the issues were identified) and resolved, with

resolutions incorporated into the product before it was re-tested in the next test cycle.
At the end of each test phase, any outstanding deficiencies that had not been
resolved would have been recorded in an end of test report.

22.The purpose of the different phases of testing is to validate that the product delivers
the agreed requirements and to ensure that any deficiencies identified are resolved
as we move through the lifecycle. In light of this testing process, | did not have any
concerns in relation to the system moving to Live service based on the testing
performed and results achieved.

23.\f there were still known deficiencies remaining in a particular release when it was
rolled out to the live system, these would have been known to, discussed, and agreed
with the Post Office as being acceptable in live service. In my experience, this
approach is typical of large scale IT projects. There was an open relationship between
ICL Pathway and Post Office when it came to issues identified during the testing
cycle. | was not generally responsible for and had limited sight of communications
with sub-postmasters. | cannot therefore comment on whether sub-postmasters were
informed of these deficiencies.

24.In relation to the acceptance of releases by Post Office, whilst | was Development
Director and then Programme Director, the necessary approvals (including approvals
relating to which deficiencies were acceptable for live service) were provided by my
counterpart at the Post Office, David Smith (| do not recall who my point of contact
was at the Post Office prior to Mr Smith nor do | remember the specific timing of Mr
Smith’s involvement with the Horizon project). To that end, | recall attending meetings

with Mr Smith at Post Office’s offices, Mount Pleasant, London. These meetings were

Page 7 of 9
WITN04180100
WITN04180100

also attended by Mr D’Alvarez and our colleague, Stephen Muchow (who was the
Service Director and then the Account Director at the time).

25.From my recollection, these meetings took place on around a weekly basis and Mr
Smith and | had a good working relationship. Although | do not recall the meetings
themselves, we would have shared progress on releases, discussed any deficiencies
identified and, to the extent that deficiencies were identified, agreed appropriate
actions. | do not recall when these meetings started but it may have been after the
national rollout.

FITNESS FOR PURPOSE

26.ICL Pathway continually reviewed its work to make improvements for future releases,
this would have included formal internal audits, although | do not recall any of these
audits specifically. Internal auditing prior to the national rollout was owned by Martyn
Bennett, Head of Quality Management, and by his responsible Internal Audit

Manager, Jan Holmes.
