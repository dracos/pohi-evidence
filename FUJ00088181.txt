2.3.2 Service Level Relief

Section 2.4 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service Description sets out the limits
which, if exceeded over a monthly period, will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the
measurement of performance in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service SLTs, and
Liquidated Damages Targets (LDTs) if applicable and affected by this excess. Such
adjustments shall be made on the following basis:

(a) Fujitsu Services shall identify, for joint consideration with Post Office, any failure to
achieve the Data Centre Operations Service SLTs and / or LDTs within the month due
to the limits being exceeded. Post Office and Fujitsu Services (acting reasonably) will
agree the reasons for that SLT or LDT failure if it has been caused or contributed to by
Fujitsu Services:

«if the SLT or LDT failure occurs as a result of a Default by Fujitsu Services, no
adjustment shall be made to the performance measurements for the affected SLTs
or LDTs in respect of that month;

« if the SLT or LDT failure is agreed to be as a result of the limits being exceeded,
the performance measurements for the affected SLTs and LDTs in respect of that
month shall be reported as reasonably required by the Parties;

(b) following each Service Level Measurement Period, Post Office and Fujitsu Services will
assess whether, on average during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period, any
of the limits have been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) or more. In making that
assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall consider the cause of any daily peaks
in excess of the daily averages during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period
and disregard the measurements in respect of those days where the peaks have arisen as
a result of a Fujitsu Services Default. If, having made this assessment, Post Office and
Fujitsu Services agree that a limit has been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) and within
any three (3) consecutive months, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet to discuss,
(acting reasonably) any appropriate changes to the applicable Data Centre Operations
Service SLTs and LDTs; and

(c) any dispute between Post Office and Fujitsu Services arising in connection with the
application of this section 2.3.2 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Following successful NB Token Validation, a Banking Function Transaction
shall not proceed unless a network connection to the Data Centre can be
reasonably expected to be established to obtain on-line NB Authorisation, as
set out in the CCDs entitled "Banking User Interface Design Proposal”
(NB/PRP/004) and “Network Banking Counter Dialogues — Activity & Screen
Flows” (NB/SPE/003). Once that connection has been established, a NB
Request shall be sent to the Banks and the Banking Function Transaction shall
only proceed if a positive NB Authorisation is received from the Banks and
that Banking Function Transaction is not Declined by the Counter Clerk. In the
event that the Counter Clerk Declines a Financial Transaction, a CO
Confirmation shall be sent on-line to the Banks.

There shall be no local facility within a Branch to override a NB Decline
response in an NB Authorisation.

If the NB Authorisation is not for the same amount as the NB Request, the
Banking Function Transaction will be Declined by the NB System, except in
the case of a NB Request for a Banking Function Transaction type "Withdraw
Limit", which will be permitted to proceed subject to the maximum limit set by
Reference Data.

The MAAWP and the MCWP shall be:

. set as parameters in the NB System;
. common for all Banks; and
. configurable by Fujitsu Services' Reference Data,

and in any event the MCWP shall not exceed 40 seconds.

If, after the generation of a NB Request at a Counter Position or after the
Authorisation Agent makes a NB Request available to the Banks, a corresponding
NB Authorisation is not received within the MCP or MAAWP respectively, the
Banking Function Transaction shall be Declined.

Service, Service Description.

5.1.4.2. POL FS Availability

(a) Fujitsu Services shall measure the time that Configured POL FS in live
operational use (as opposed to in development or testing environments) is
available to be logged into by POL FS Users as a proportion of the total time
between 07:30hrs and 19:30hrs on Working Days (“POL FS Availability”).

(b) measuring time in relation to section 5.1.4.2 (a) between 07:30hrs and 19:30hrs
on Working Days only and excluding time required, following a failure, to
repair or recover Configured POL FS, the SAP Loading Applications and/or
the underlying database.

(c) If the elements of the POL FS System used to support live operational use of
Configured POL FS become unavailable and failover occurs pursuant to
paragraph 5.2 of Schedule B2 the period of such unavailability shall not be
taken into account for the purposes of assessing Fujitsu Services’ performance
in respect of the SLT set out in section 2.3.5.4 Table 9 of this Data Centre

(d) In the event that the SLT set out in section 2.3.5.4 Table 9 of this Data Centre
Operations Services, Service Description is not met, Fujitsu Services shall
provide Post Office with an analysis of the reasons for the failure. Post Office
and Fujitsu Services shall agree a reasonable rectification and improvement
plan to address the failure.

5.1.4.3. Data Loading

(a) When a new Client interface to the POL FS System is introduced by Post
Office the design target for “New Client” shall apply to data being loaded from

transactions types that may be undertaken by POL FS Users (“Sample
Transaction Types”) using Configured POL FS and a target maximum SAP
System Time in respect of each such transaction type.

Fujitsu Services shall monitor the Sample Transaction Types to determine the
average SAP System Time for transactions of each Sample Transaction Type in
each Service Level Measurement Period.

Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours within the capacity and
performance constraints of the POL FS System to ensure that the average SAP
System Times for transactions of each Sample Transaction Type as measured in
each Service Level Measurement Period do not exceed the applicable target
maximum SAP System Times specified herein.

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets referred to in section
5.1.4.4 as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of the POL FS System,
