All,

It was good to meet you last night and put some faces to names and voices. Following that I've now attempted to draft
a Witness Statement as discussed.



   Oa06. Witness
statement Gareth .,.     '

Here is a first draft, and I'd appreciate feedback as to whether I have captured your requirements as to style and
 pproach. I appreciate that you probably cannot comment on the factual content.

As agreed, I need to do two further pieces of analysis and I've indicated with highlighted comments in boxes where I
should include these. However I thought it was worth getting`a first draft of the witness statement to you before doing
that so you, have a chance to review the Witness Statement in parallel.

I've heard nothing further from Charles McLachlan regarding an updated version of his Report. Clearly, should such a
report appear,'I may well need to update the Witness Statement to reflect any changes.

Regards

Gareth

branch".        As I have stated earlier in this statement, any Transaction
Correction that has been generated by the external Post Office Ltd systems
must be explicitly accepted into the Branch's accounts by an appropriate
User.          In many cases there is the opportunity to reject the Transaction
Correction allowing a separate process to agree Whether or not it is valid
before it is accepted into the accounts. Therefore, I would say that it is not
necessary to examine the process for generating Transaction Corrections.

movement of cash and stock) into and out of the branch that changes the cash and stock . that

to be repaid at the current value). Note that revaluation can be positive or




Finally, the 4k'" bullet States "It was not possible to examine the processes of reconciliation
conducted by the Post Office that could give rise to Transaction Corrections.".   AS Stated

earlier this .is not really relevant since any Transaction Corrections will have
been accepted by the User into the Branch accounts and should not be
accepted if not understood. Accepting a Transaction Correction implicitly
means taking responsibility for that in accounting terms.


Moving on to Section 2.2.2 of Professor McLachlan's report which is titled
Opportunities for Reconciliation. I accept that the Horizon system has not
been designed to automatically provide vouchers for every transaction. It
was not a requirement for Horizon to produce such vouchers and in fact
there were specific requirements from Post Office Ltd regarding transaction
times that preclude printing such records. My experience as a' user of Retail
systems (such as supermarkets) is that such vouchers are not normally
generated there either.


In Section 2.3 of his report, Professor McLachlan looks at hypothetical
issues with Data Entry. Section 2.3.1 looks at the calibration of the touch
screen.        I accept the fact that a misaligned touch screen could certainly
cause confusion to the User and result in incorrect buttons being activated.

In section 2.3.2, Professor McLachlan states that 'Poor user interface design can
contribute to poor data entry quality and user errors.". I agree with this as a statement.

However Professor McLachlan makes no attempt to explain in what way the
Horizon User Interface design is "Poor". As I stated earlier one of the key
goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it could
be used by. Users with no IT experience. A significant amount of effort was
put into designing and agreeing the User Interface with Post Office Ltd.

supposing the Cheque button was pressed in error for Fast Cash, then there
would have been a discrepancy in the value of cheques and there is no
evidence of such discrepancies.

Later in this section, Professor McLachlan claims "the 'Fast Cash' button is
demonstrated to be a source of data entry error (the reversals confirm this).".    I don't agree
with that. I can see no evidence to support this statement. The fact that
there are reversals following a failed Debit card transaction is due to the fact
that some transactions cannot be abandoned and need to be settled and
then reversed. This was a specific requirement on Horizon from Post Office
Ltd. The fact that this has been done shows that the user was well aware of
the failure of the Debit Card transaction and followed normal process when
the failure occurred.




correlation between the two which indicates that the variances between the
declared cash and the system cash figures were not being monitored very
well within the Branch. I would agree that this could be down to Theft I
Fraud, or incompetence by the Branch staff. However there is no evidence
that this is: down to any sort of System failure. Further I would suggest that
small discrepancies are to be expected in such an environment due to
mistakes in giving change etc.                             My understanding is that Post Office
investigators expect such small discrepancies in normal operation.

the Stock Report.


I also note that in this section Professor McLachlan states that he has
discussed this scenario with me and that I "acknowledge that this is a known feature
of Horizon and that the Post Office have not instructed Fujitsu, to change, the system to produce a
meaningful stock report.".            I don't recall any such discussion. I have seen such a

written for a separate case, and did explicitly check out the scenario and

Therefore I would contend that section 2.4.2 of the report is irrelevant.

£1,840.          I've subsequently gone over the data again and found some
additional transaction corrections that have been processed and the total
net value of all such Transaction Corrections is actually slightly less namely
£1,619.43.


He then refers to. a slightly wider scope that he has taken in Appendix J
where he comes up with an absolute value of £82,918.35 (though a net
value of £19.257.21).                    I have now had a chance to examine this data in

McLachlan's analysis:

Later on in the section Professor McLachlan states "There is no record of Misra
requesting evidence in the transactions provided between 1 Dec 06 and 31 Dec 07. ". This is

incorrect. There was one such example on 131h December 2006 and two
more on 14th March 2007. I accept that I had omitted these from my initial
