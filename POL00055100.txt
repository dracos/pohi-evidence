Jarnail
| have spoken to a few people regarding the three points raised by Izzy Hogg.

| am awaiting comments from Penny/Gareth at Fujitsu but the general consensus of opinion is that the points
are too vague and more information is required exactly from the defence as to what they require.

Other guidance is required as per e-mail from Andrew Winn below in relation to Rod Ismay’s comments.
Can you please advise.

Regards

Rod Ismay the head of P&BA is not happy at the prospect of an open ended invite. He has asked the
question of what are the legal parameters we are working within. Simplistically if we refuse or impose
conditions do we lose the case? | think we need more guidance on how something like this might reasonably
operate.

| think Mark Burley would be the route into IT to identify who might be best placed to deal with that aspect
