Jarnail

I have spoken to a few people regarding the three points raised by Izzy Hogg.

I am awaiting comments from Penny/Gareth at Fujitsu but the general consensus of opinion is that the points
are too vague and more information is required exactly from the defence as to what they require.

Other guidance is required as per e-mail from Andrew Winn below in relation to Rod Ismay's comments.

Can you please advise.

Regards

Jon Longman

John
Rod Ismay the head of P&BA is not happy at the prospect of an open ended invite. He has asked the
question of what are the legal parameters we are working within. Simplistically if we refuse or impose
conditions do we lose the case? I think we need more guidance on how something like this might reasonably
operate.

I think Mark Burley would be the route into IT to identify who might be best placed to deal with that aspect.

I enclose a copy of an E-Mail received from Issy Hogg, the Defence Solicitors of the 22nd July 2010, the
content of which is self explanatory. Could you please be kind enough to let me have your urgent
instructions as to the access and information she is requesting in respect of the system in the
Midlands and the operation at Chesterfield and the error logs. I will contact Gareth Jenkins to find
out what transpired at the meeting with Charles McLachlan.

I await to hear from you.
