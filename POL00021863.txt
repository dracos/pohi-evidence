Rodric
I hope you had a good Christmas.

As you will no doubt be aware, we are currently working through the list of Second Sight's questions to POL in connection
with their Part Two report.

As part of this, we are providing reasons to Second Sight in relation to the questions POL is not proposing to answer.

Are you able to assist with Andy's query on question 13.1 of the attached document? Please can you copy Andy and Mark
in on your response.

Kind regards

Paul

Some comments from me attached.

I've tried to flesh out some of the "reasons" so that it doesn't look like we are just stonewalling. I also think there are a few
questions we may be able to answer or at least fudge an answer. I think it would be better to try to answer a question
than just refuse entirely wherever possible.

I wonder if we should remove the 5 questions we have answered already — rather than record these as a refusal to
answer we should perhaps take the benefit of saying already answered?

Paul — see questions 4.6(c) and 4.6(h) and 5.1. Did these questions go to Rob King in POL security — he should know the
answer to these. Also — pls can you action 13.1.

Hi Belinda,
As requested, please find attached the list of questions we are not providing answers to, and the reasons why.

Andy — there is one question I have highlighted. Did we actually ever send out the response with regards to Suspense
accounts as I am unsure?

In total we are not providing answers to 41 of the 110 questions posed (37%). Splits by reason in the table below:

Total Questions 110 %
Fishing 28 25%

Out of scope 8 7%

Already answered Es 5%

41 37%

Any questions just shout,

Mark

Please see an attached some amendments to the draft letter for second sight to accompany the answers to their
questions.

Mark/Paul/Andy Parsons — would you be able to prepare the schedule of questions to which Post Office is not prepared
to respond and the reasons why — it would be that some of the text I have included in the letter is best placed in the
Schedule.

Best wishes
