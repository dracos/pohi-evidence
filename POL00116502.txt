Hi Mark,

attached subcommittee board paper in your name. Let me know what you think. Jane do let me know if
there is anything else you think I need to add in.

Thanks

Hi Mark,

On the 30" April the Board sub-committee are meeting (see email below) and Alice wanted:

1. A paper to be produced for the next Sub-Committee on all of Jo Swinson’s public comments on the
Scheme including correspondence, PQs and other public engagements — identifying, inter alia,
references to the mediation Scheme or timelines.

I have produced 2 documents (attached). The first is ministerial commitments with regard to the scheme

and timelines (including the statement in parliament and PQs). The second is a much more

comprehensive document that includes both the minister and our public commitments.

Please can you take a look and let me know if you’re happy for me to send them on to Belinda.

Thanks
Sophie

Please see below. This is not quite what we were expecting or had been working on.

Mark/Sophie — I assume that the first one is yours — Sophie has already almost completed that.
David — with input from Sophie/Mark
David — can you work on the rest
