1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the design and
implementation of controls relating to cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies and the manner in
which Post Office addresses suspected criminal misconduct. Cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies
and addressing criminal misconduct is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post
Office Board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

Post Office receives a large number of requests to assist Law Enforcement Agencies in the prevention,
detection, investigation and potential prosecution of alleged offences. It also has legal obligations to
provide information to Law Enforcement Agencies (e.g. through suspicious activity reports) and may also
wish voluntarily to notify Law Enforcement Agencies if it suspects that it, its Employees, Operators or
Customers have been the victim of crime.

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to cooperation with
Law Enforcement Agencies and the manner in which Post Office will address suspected criminal
misconduct.! It is one of a set of policies which provide a clear risk and governance framework and an
effective system of internal control for the management of risk across the Post Office. Compliance with
these policies supports the Post Office in meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of
shareholders, employees? and other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

Post Office’s approach to cooperating with Law Enforcement Agencies is based upon the following core
principles:
e Post Office is committed to supporting Law Enforcement Agencies in the prevention, detection,
investigation and potential prosecution of alleged offences;
« Post Office will as far as possible cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies and voluntarily provide
information and evidence on request;
e Post Office is committed to ensuring that prosecutions are fair and that Prosecution Teams are
made aware of, and provided with, Disclosable Material in Post Office’s possession;
e Post Office will manage the risks associated with providing such cooperation, by ensuring that
appropriate controls are in place in relation to the provision of information.

In accordance with these principles, and subject to the controls described in section 2.4 below, Post
Office:
e will make a Victim Crime Report to the police where suspected criminal misconduct is identified
in its business operations;
e will not conduct private prosecutions (Post Office’s shareholder must be consulted and approval
obtained from the Post Office Board if any deviation from this is contemplated);
e will provide information to Law Enforcement Agencies to assist the prevention, detection,
investigation and potential prosecution of crime:

1In this Policy “Post Office” and “Group” means Post Office Limited, Post Office Management Services Limited and Payzone Bill
Payments Limited.

2In this Policy “employee” means permanent staff, temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else
working for or on behalf of Post Office.
POL00447923

o voluntarily for intelligence purposes, accompanied by an Advisory Note if required to
describe any known issue/s which might affect the reliability of the information;

o voluntarily for use as evidence, where it is classified by Legal and Compliance as ‘low risk
data’ for the purpose of this policy (see Appendix 1);

o voluntarily for use as evidence, if approved by Post Office Legal or any Nominated Criminal
Law Advisors acting for Post Office; or

o as required by a Mandatory Order or otherwise approved by the Post Office Board.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all areas within the Post Office and defines the minimum standards to control
financial loss, customer impact, regulatory breaches and reputational damage in line with Post Office’s
Risk Appetite.

In exceptional circumstances, where risk sits outside of Post Office’s accepted Risk Appetite a Risk
Exception can be granted. For further information in relation to the risk exception process please contact
the Central Risk team.

For definitions please see section 3.1.

The risk to Post Office in relation to cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies and the manner in which
it addresses suspected criminal misconduct is reviewed by the Board annually.

1.5. The Risks

Post Office is frequently asked to provide data and other information to support Law Enforcement
Agencies and prosecutors in Criminal Investigations and prosecutions. This may arise either when Post
Office is a victim of crime or when it holds data which is relevant to other suspected criminal misconduct.
Post Office also has legal obligations to provide data in some circumstances, for example suspicious
activity reports.

Provision of appropriate and reliable information to Law Enforcement Agencies promotes the
administration of justice. Compliance with this policy will ensure:
e Suspected criminal misconduct is subject to proper review before it is reported to a Law
Enforcement Agency;
e Proper consideration is given to information that may be provided to Law Enforcement Agencies
and Prosecution Teams, to assist them in complying with their duties of disclosure;
e Any issues with the reliability of provided information are identified and dealt with appropriately;
« Post Office is able to identify and verify information provided to Law Enforcement Agencies at a
later date.

1.6. Legislation

There are a number of relevant legal and regulatory requirements which are applicable, including (but
not limited to):
e Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002
Terrorism Act 2000
The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017
Crime and Courts Act 2013

In addition, Post Office can be legally required to provide information if it is served with a compulsory
order from a Court or Law Enforcement Agency (e.g. under Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984, or section 2 of the Criminal Procedure (Attendance of Witnesses) Act 1965).

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

A Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in pursuit of day to
day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of activity and levels of exposure that
the Group is willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has?:

e Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances where there
are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and commercial practicality.

e Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues.

e Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to Financial Services matters.

e Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from business’
conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the organisation.

e Averse risk appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however, that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls have been
implemented, a matter may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception
waiver will be required.

2.2. Policy Framework
Post Office has established a suite of financial crime policies and procedures, on a risk sensitive approach
which are subject to an annual review and which are relevant to this Policy. The Policy suite is designed

to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, corruption and fraud and ensure adherence to
relevant sanctions regimes.

2.3 Who must comply?
Compliance with this Policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees.
Where non-compliance is identified, the matter must be referred to the General Counsel. Where it is

identified that an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or negligence, this will
be treated as a disciplinary offence.

3 The Risk appetite was agreed by the Group's Board January 2015
2.4 Minimum Control Standards

@

POL00447923
POL00447923,

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks, so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:
