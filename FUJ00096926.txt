FUJITSU 3

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1 Introduction

This document comprises the HNG-X Acceptance Report to the HNG-X Acceptance Board for the
assessment of the progression through Acceptance Gateway 3 (AG3) — Readiness for Pilot.

The basis for HNG-X Acceptance is defined in Schedule B6.3 and some sections are reproduced within
this report.

The POL Requirements and Criteria, contained in the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue - POL DOORS.
archive v1.42, and associated with AG3 are contained in Appendix A.

The definition of the HNG-X Acceptance Methods is contained in Appendix B.
The definition of the Acceptance Incident Severity is contained in Appendix C.

1.1 Scope
The purpose of this Acceptance Board is: -

‘To agree the Acceptance status of the relevant Release (HNG-X Release 1 for AG3) and provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board'.’ The proposed options that this Board can
select from are described in Appendix D.

This recommendation is based on an assessment of the status of the applicable POL Requirements and
Acceptance Criteria and of the stage progression criteria for AG3 are described in Schedule B6.3.

The primary assessment concerns the status of any Acceptance Incidents as follows:-

Progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 shall occur once all of the following have
been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated to achieving progression through the
respective HNG-X Acceptance Gateway:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6 (of Schedule B6.3 which refers to dispute handling, defect
aggregation and deferred tests), all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been achieved;

(b) activities leading to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 (named “Readiness for Router
Roll—Out (Z1)" and HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 (named “Readiness for Data Centre
Migration”) must be completed and these two HNG-X Acceptance Gateways passed through in
accordance with paragraph 4.5.4.2 as pre-requisites to achieve HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3.

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents is five or
fewer and an agreed workaround exists for each of them; and

(d) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance
Incidents except for those which the Parties agree do not require a workaround.

(e) details of all Non Incidents are recorded, although they shall have no impact upon
Acceptance Gateway progression

These together with other supporting factors are summarised in the following checklists for AG3.

It should be noted that there are also defects that are not linked to POL Requirements and which are not
the subject of Acceptance Incidents. A separate assessment of the status and significance of these has
been undertaken and this will be available for consideration at the Release Authorisation Board.

time for High Volume Pilot (over 272 branches). As such, “Qualified Acceptance” at AG3 was agreed,
subject to the successful delivery of the high priority items in Reset 04.

Whilst not an exact match, this is the closet to the Acceptance Board Recommendation 3: ‘Proceed at
risk through Acceptance Gateway.’

These associated conditions were discussed at the corresponding Release Authorisation Board and
recorded in the minutes of that meeting.

2 Review of status of Acceptance Criteria

The POL requirements for Acceptance Gateway 3 comprise all of the functional requirements
represented by the POL Use Cases and a set of the Non-Functional requirements.

2.1 Functional Requirements — Use Cases

There are 143 Use Cases which constitute the POL functional requirements. Their summary status is as
follows: -

Key to Status

Failed (Deferred Fix) — This indicates that a Use Case has one or more defects associated with it, but
that the resolution of these defects have been agreed to be deferred to beyond start of Pilot.

ACCEPTANCE REPORT FOR HNG-X ACCEPTANCE GATEWAY

2.3 Delayed (Deferred) Test status

The Schedule B6.3 acknowledges that there may be circumstances when previously scheduled testing

that was targeted for completion by this Acceptance Gateway cannot now take place. Providing that this
is not due to a contractual default by Fujitsu, and the parties agree, then the tests associated with a POL
requirement may be delayed — this is known in the contract as a ‘Deferred Test’. Fujitsu are still obliged

to carry out these ‘Deferred Tests’.

For this Acceptance Gateway, Either Fujitsu or Joint Test Team has requested that tests associated with
the following requirements are given this ‘Deferred Test’ status. Quality Centre does not record this
status and so the current QC status is shown for each criterion.

2.3.1

Delayed Test Status - non-testable criteria

The final testing of the following non-testable criteria has been agreed to be delayed.

3. Review of status of Acceptance Incidents

The Acceptance Incidents listed below have been raised because the acceptance evidence has failed to
meet the acceptance criteria. They have been classified into three groups: -

« Those arising from defects whose resolution has been agreed to be deferred until after
the start of Pilot. These have an identifier of Al-AD-nnn

« Those arising from defects that have been raised during the assessment of the non-
testable criteria - in this case Document Review. These have an identifier of Al-NT-nnn.

« Those arising from defects that have been raised during testing and where no formal
deferral discussions have taken place. These have an identifier of Al-TS-nnn.

3.1 Acceptance Incident Aggregation

Schedule B6.3 (4.6.3) recognises that HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the
same failure or deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function, may be
aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance Incident for the purposes of the thresholds identified in
section 1.2. The following sections contain details of all of the individual Acceptance Incidents and then
identifies where aggregation has occurred.

B_ Definition of Acceptance Methods

The set of HNG-X Acceptance methods are defined in Appendix D of Schedule B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance
Process and reproduced below.

Type Description

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that cannot be objectively verified by a test of HNG-
Document X may be satisfied by Post Office undertaking a HNG-X Document Review. The
Review outcome of any such review will be documented by Post Office in the HNG-X

Acceptance Tracking Document. Fujitsu Services will supply a list of documents
(and any specific references within such documents) for Post Office review,
which may satisfy the agreed HNG-X Acceptance Criteria.

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria may be satisfied by Post Office participating in an
Design HNG-X Design Walkthrough led by Fujitsu Services of the Fujitsu Services’
Walkthrough I design. The outcome of any such HNG-X Design Walkthrough will be
documented by Post Office in the HNG-X Acceptance Tracking Document.

HNG-X Tests that are owned and managed by Fujitsu Services with significant
Solution collaborative support from Post Office, for the purpose of verifying that the
Test Fujitsu Services’ solution for the HNG-X System satisfies the relevant HNG-X

Acceptance Criteria. The collaborative team will produce a joint test report
presenting the results of the tests.

HNG-X Tests that are run and managed by Post Office with significant collaborative
Release support from Fujitsu Services, for the purpose of verifying that the HNG-X
Validation Release satisfies the relevant HNG-X Acceptance Criteria. The combined team

will produce a joint test report presenting the results of the tests and provide
evidence on any areas of non conformance.

HNG-X Post Office shall specify any need beyond the level of support that Fujitsu
Monitoring Services are required to provide under normal operational practice (such as a
report etc). Duration, nature and characteristics to be agreed in advance between
Post Office and Fujitsu Services and will take place during Live Pilot or
exceptionally during Live Monitoring. The total duration of HNG-X Monitoring and
the obligations on Fujitsu Services to produce data/reports to support Post Office
monitoring to be agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (each acting
reasonably and in good faith) for a particular HNG-X Requirement.

C Definition of Acceptance Incident Severity

The definition of the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is defined in Appendix A of Schedule
B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process and reproduced below.

The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would render a key element of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or a key element of the
Infrastructure unfit for operational use, which could include:

a) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types;

b) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types using the
required business inputs or generating the required business outcome;

c) creating system performance issues which are in, or are likely to cause a, breach
of Service Level Targets.

Medium I The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would not prevent operation of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or more
Transaction types.

Low The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that does not cause any adverse
operational impact in the use of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or an
element of the Infrastructure, or the HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be addressed by
a workaround without any adverse operational impact for Post Office.

Non An incident raised by either Party which, following investigation is found:

Incident
> not to be a defect;

>» not to have resulted from the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X
and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X
Acceptance Process; or

* not to fall within the high, medium or low categories set out in this column.
