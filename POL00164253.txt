Subject:               RE: Enquiry re: Current Prosecutions

 I now have the actual action from the Board. Copying Charles as he will need to assist with this, and also
 get signed off through Chris Day. Absolute deadline is Close Friday so I will need a final document by
 midday Friday. The action is:

  The Board asked for a note from the General Counsel explaining who was named in past
 prosecutions and the liability for the Business and individual Board members. The note should also
 include information on both P1and D&O insurance cover.

 This includes the table Rodric and I discussed today about a timetable for prosecutions back as far as we
 have them, by quarter and in who's name they were brought (e.g Post Office — presumably after 2011 or
 RMG).

 What I have so far is:

 At its meeting on 27 November the Board asked for a note from the General Counsel explaining who was
 named in past prosecutions and the liability for the Business and individual Board members. The note
 should also include information on both PI and D&O insurance cover.

 Previous prosecutions
 The attached table shows ?????? prosecutions by period, going back to ?????.
 Jarnail, could you please provide the table and if we are unable to state who brought the
 prosecutions (e.g. RMG or Post Office can we please say what it would take to get them. What I
 mean by that is that if we would need to trawl back through old files to get the exact data and it
 would take x period of time and cost £x then can we please say so.

 Prosecutions already in process before we `paused'
 I will insert the information provided by Jarnail earlier today.

 Business liability
 Charles/Rodric can you provide a paragraph on liability for the Business. On the one hand I assume
 that should be obvious but it needs articulating

 Liability for Individual Board Members
 It is highly unlikely that any individual director would have any personal liability in connection with this
 review, unless they had acted in bad faith or maliciously, In the highly unlikely event that an action is
 brought (which could only be by Post Office Limited or in very rare circumstances by the shareholder acting
 on behalf of the company) there is insurance in place to cover their liabilities. The policy provides cover up
 to £60 million and has a £25,000 excess for claims by the company but no excess for claims brought by
 individual directors. It is also retrospective.

 Directors duties
 POL's directors are subject to various personal duties including the duties to:
 - act in accordance with the company's constitution and for a proper purpose;

Subject: Enquiry re: Current Prosecutions

Jarnail — senior management has asked for the "current position on prosecutions — when paused/what do we have in
train".

Can you please put something together? I'm back in the office tomorrow if we need to discuss.

Thanks, Rodric
