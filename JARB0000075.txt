Subject: January meeting with Alice Perkins

Hi Alan,

Just to confirm... James is meeting Alice and Paula on 28 January first thing in the
morning. If this changes, I will let you know.

I wonder whether you might be willing to have a phone call with James, perhaps the
week prior to this, to chat through anything you think he ought to raise? I would like
to put two times in the diary: the first can be any as follows:

Tuesday 21 January 2014 - 9am or ipm

Wednesday 22 January — 1pm or 5pm

The second:
Monday 27 January 2014 — 5pm — this is provisional, but just in case any last minute
details need thrashing out

Can you let me know what suits, please?

Finally, what he will need is evidence. If, as you suggest, current practice is not
changing despite processes being reviewed and cases investigated, he will need very
clear description (no names are required) about what is going wrong, when, and
why this indicates that processes are in fact not being changed as the mediation
process proceeds. I am sure you are keeping a log of what you are hearing, and this
would be useful to refer to.

Let me know what else we can do, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Janet
