Subject: FW: Making Good discrepancy by Cheque

Ideas discussed:

Does it really happen — could it be handled by a non-Horizon rem-out process?

Don’t allow make good to cheque — could be a problem if the amount is large.

Can’t transact cheque in new TP and branch would not be all square in previous TP.

Thought about cheque listing working off last cut-off irrespective of TP, not pleasant and Rem was still be outstanding in

old TP (but presumably that is how it is at the moment).

5, Thought about make good to cash, then change cash to cheque somehow in next TP — doesn’t sound very nice, don’t want
to encourage clerk to do this.

6. Andy Winn suggesting resolving prior to rollover, but Housekeeping clear loss from local suspense settles to cash not
cheque (via ModeParameters).

7. Could abort rollover when make good needed and make them do it manually (same problem as not cheque make good
option on Housekeeping, so could add a button to do this on Housekeeping).

8. Could abort after making good and force them to rem out manually.

9. Could rem out cheque automatically once it has been accepted, just prior to rollover. Not sure how easy/hard that is code

wise.

Hi Jon,

It seems we may have a problem around the “settle to cheque” function at TP rollover as you predicted in your earlier
mail (extract used below).

I think that we need to look at viable options around this, although there are a limited number of occasions where this
happens we need to stop the problem so that we can eventually remove the old manual Rem out and Cut off
processes currently hidden under the “NBSC use only” button.

Do you want to have a call to discuss this first?

Has a resolution been put in place for branches that will make good by cheque when correcting discrepancies on TP rollovers?

Below is the last communication we received regarding the issue

Hi Peter

Technically the branch cannot be in the next trading period when they press make good cheque as that clears the misbalance from
the current trading period. The branch trading report will show the cheque value on it to make it balance. I would have thought it
would be possible to redirect the branch around if the option is selected but I may be trying to spend next year’s IT budget here.

Branches can clear losses from Local Suspense to cash immediately prior to rolling. That might be an option to add the make good
cheque option here to enable the mandatory rem out to kick in at that point?

Cheers
Andy

Sorry Andy,

Our mails crossed over.

The CRO process is mandatory at balancing, this was always part of the requirements catalogue. The practice of
remitting out cheques at this point and cutting the report off has always been in the guidance on HOL help to cover
those branches where the postal despatch occurs before the end of day and additional cheque payments may occur
prior to balancing.

Your suggested sequence hits a problem at TP rollover, as described by Jon Hulme:

Towards the end of the balancing process, the clerk can clear a loss from local suspense via product 6489 “Make good to cheque”,
which is recorded as a product 2 “Cheque”. If this happens, the cheque is accepted, but will not appear on the subsequent Cheque
Listing report since the stock unit is now in a new Trading Period. The report ignores cheques from the previous Trading Period.

All this is unchanged behaviour; what is different with the new Cheque Rem Out process is that because it doesn’t appear on the
report it cannot be remitted out using the automatic process.

Thus the “cheque” would be stuck in the old TP and the stock unit would be in the new TP.
FUJ00092139
FUJ00092139

If we look at the alternatives I am sure we can find a workable solution for the longer term, given that removing the
manual entry of cheque value was one of the original objectives of the change I don’t think leaving the old manual
process on the system is a viable option.

Hi Peter
Coming back into this a bit late but I strongly do not want branches recording things that have not happened i.e. make good cash
with no cash added.

If as I’ve been told the new solution enforces any cheque values to be remmed out prior to branch trading then to my mind the
make good cheque option remains valid:-
1. Branch goes through mandatory processes including remming out cheque holdings.
Proceeds to roll and chooses to make good loss by cheque.
Branch has cheque stock so is unable to roll.
Cheque is remmed out.
Branch then rolls with no discrepancy to resolve.

WRWN

Puts another layer in for the branch but marginal extra effort and accounting is accurate — if they actually put a cheque in and
despatch!

Again playing catch up but I’m not clear if the mandatory rem out applies to TP only or BPs as well. I think making BP rems
mandatory would be a mistake and discourage branches from doing what is a recommended but optional process.

Thanks Sarah,
That sounds like a plausible solution to me, does anyone else have a view on this?
I know that Crowns and multiples are not currently allowed to settle to cheque in this way, so in a sense we would be

standardising the approach across the network. Does anyone know if there are other necessary circumstances in which
a branch would need to settle to cheque rather than to cash?

Hi

What about disabling the make good cheque function altogether and only have make good cash. If an office wishes to use a
cheque, then they add this into adjust stock after balancing?...just a thought!

Sorry, this extra update arrived just after I had sent the previous mail to you...
I guess we need to have a think about how this situation might best be handled in the future. We don’t really want the

old manual process left around permanently. Perhaps we should have a conference call next week once the pilot
branches are live

So the “unwind” process would be to use the manual button to rem out . However this would lead to a negative value on the
Cheque Listing report, and so they should also cut-off the report with the negative balance to get back to an all square position.

Of course, if they had accepted cheques in the new TP prior to doing this (quite likely), then similarly they are going to need to use
manual buttons to Rem Out the correct amount, and then cut-off.

Kind regards,
Jon

Having said all that, I’m not sure that Post Office allow branches to make good to cheque.

The options available to the clerk come from products that are part of product group 6480 (clear loss from local suspense). This
group contains the product in question which is 6489 “Make good to cheque”, but this product is disabled by default and so would
not appear. I’m not sure which branches, if any, that Post Office enable this product in. That is a question for the POL Ref Data
team.

Hi Jon,

Can you have a think about the point raised below and let me know if it looks like it may be an issue for us or not? If the
situation is as described then we need to understand how to correctly unwind things for a branch.

Good Afternoon Peter

I have thought of a possible issue following on from our meeting this morning

When a branch is balancing and making good a discrepancy, they have an option for making good by cheque. When this button in
selected, it adds the cheque on to the cheque line. As far as I am aware this process doesn’t also add the figure on to the cheque

listing. I am thinking this may create a problem as branches will print or preview the cheque listing, not see the cheque and will try
to adjust stock but the cheque will already be there.
