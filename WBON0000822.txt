Dear Ron, lan,

Please find attached POL's draft case summary for M009. Apologies for this being sent later than expected. The
supporting documents have been posted to Huddle by Shirley.

I'd appreciate your comments on the format, style and content of these documents. We're trying to produce these
documents in a way that is of most use to you and, in the future, Spmrs — hence the short delay in providing these
documents. In particular, these documents have been prepared to assist with identifying:

¢ Points of common ground between POL and the Spmr.

¢ Points of disagreement.

« Where there is disagreement, the foundation for a logical and evidenced opinion on the merits of the SPMR's.
complaint.

¢ And ultimately, by pulling together the above 3 points, a recommendation on whether the case is suitable for
mediation.

I'm of course very happy to discuss how to review and refine our approach to meet these objectives so that the
Working Group will be able to reach a decision when the case is presented to it for a decision on whether mediation is
appropriate.

Kind regards,

Angela
