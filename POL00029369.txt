Subject: FW: WEST BYFLEET ISSUES - SEEMA MISRA - Legally
Privileged

Dear Jarnail,

John Longman sets out in his email below the extra matters that I asked Mr Jenkins to
look at. In relation to the Eleanor Nixon statement Mr Jenkins should also be made
aware of the information we recently received, that the problem with Streamline existed
only until August 2005 and so the Nixon statement is unlikely to have any relevance for
Misra.

The areas where Mr Jenkins says "for POL to respond" should be deleted from the
statement. These areas will only lead to a flood of further disclosure requests and I am
afraid that POL will never respond.

It doesn't appear that Mr Jenkins has seen the 3rd interim report served this week. He
should comment on that as well.8

The quality of training of SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins' expertise. However I
wonder if he might be prepared to comment on how it might be possible to examine the
Horizon data to investigate mistakes.

Iam keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can efficiently test
their theories against the Horizon data. I do not want them to say that they will not have
time before the trial. I anticipate that it would not be very difficult to test their theories
against a short but representative span of data eg. from the months where she has
admitted to false accounting. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider practical
and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test their theories.

Many thanks,

Warwick
