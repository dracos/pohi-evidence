           Thanks Mark this is helpful (ish!)

           To all on this email chain, please do not forward this email to anyone else as it is critical that we
           maintain privilege around it.

           Given the statements that Mark has collated, can we please reference the advice from Fujitsu that we
           have relied on in making these statements (for example did we show FJ the drafts of these before
           making them etc?), as clearly there is a gap between these and what we now understand may be the
           case.

           Andy, once this is available would you please consider whether this affects the legal risk and approach?
           Mark D (and others) - we need to consider the positioning around the current wording in light of these
           statements.

I think we have agreed wording on the Post Office side. Tony has already signed
off. I've sent the wording to both FJ and Deloitte and asked for comments by cob
tomorrow.

Sorry I couldn't dial in - I think Tom will have given my apologies.

Mark/Andy. Please can you set out the timeline for approving this text (eg Deloitte, FJ) if
this is necessary.

Completely agree that making sure we are not contradicting previous statements is
vital.

 I am stuck with a live issue at present. My uneasiness on this issue is
 why we can't give a firmer position on the super user point before we
 reply?

 I suspect I know the answer but the current wording leaves us
 vulnerable and we would need to look at what we have said publicly
 (select committee, panorama etc...) before we commit the position.

         Mark

         In response to your question in the other email thread
         about seeing everything we have said about "'remote
         access`', we don't have a central log of everything POL
         has said on remote access. However, the language




                                                                           POL-0026484

                                                                POL00030002



  used in the email referenced below (attached again) is
  reflective of the language used by POL towards the end
  of the Scheme.

  We have also previously compiled POL's comments on
  this topic that were made in individual case reports (see
  attached), which gives a flavour of the responses
  given. T:lis should however be treated with caution as
  these responses span a two year period and POL's
  understanding of the situation changed over time.

  One of the tasks we could do (albeit this will need to be
  after the LOR has been sent) is to compile a complete
  chronology of ;shat POL was told and what POL has
  said on this topic. One to discuss on our call later.

  Quote from S              Report:

  " This ability to directly amend branch records is
  something that Post Office has consistently denied was
  possible. This recently discovered evidence appears to
  confirm, that in 2010 at least, it was possible for Fujitsu
  / Post Office to directly amend branch data without the
  knowledge of the relevant Subpostmaster.

  14.16. In commenting on a draft of this report Post of
  Office told us that the references to "amend" and
  "correct" in the documents mentioned above, are not
  strictly correct as neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have
  the ability to directly change or delete existing records.
  All that can be done is that additional records can be
  added by Post Office / Fujitsu without the consent (and
  possibly the knowledge) of the relevant Subpostmaster.
  This will, however, have the effect of altering balances




                                                                POL-0026484
                                                                 POL00030002
                                                               POL00030002




at the branch, as both debit and credit entries can be
made.

14.17. Post Office also told us:

"All of the above processes for correcting/ updating a
branch's accounts have similar features. All of them
involve inputting a new transaction into the
branch's records (not editing or removing any previous
transactions) and all are shown transparently in the
branch transaction records available to Subpostmasters
(as well as in the master ARQ data).

The language used in the documents produced by Post
Office/ Fujitsu and to which you refer is unfortunate
colloquial shorthand used by those working on the
Horizon system. i con see how it could be read to
suggest that Post Office was ''altering" branch data but
the above explains why this is not the case."

14.18. This is not something that we have been able to
test or validate.

14.19. Clearly, the fact that such an ability exists, is not
necessarily evidence that such 'amendments' were
actually made. This is not something that we have been
able to investigate.

This section of the Report was based on the attached
email sent to Second Sight.

subject to litigation privilege [BD-
4A.FI D26859284]



Please find attached the proposed
wording on the remote access issue â
for discussion on our call at 6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when
reviewing:

         1. In light of comments yesterday,
            we've provided a slightly longer
            explanation so to hopefully
            present this issue in a better
            light.

         2. Tony agrees with the current
            wording but has reiterated the
            importance of dealing with this
            point candidly, even if that does
            cause some short-term pain.

                   We do not yet have a 100%
                   clear picture on some of the
                   technical and operation issues
                   on this topic. We therefore
                   need to be careful not to
                   overstate our case. This draft
                   wording will also need to be run
                   past Deloitte / FJ.

Andy
