Importance: High

All

With apologies for the late circulation, attached is the draft risk assessment which we have
prepared to assist tomorrow's briefing on contingency planning. This is still a work in progress
and we will take you through:

e Our approach to risk assessment

e Initial work that has been undertaken on potential mitigating actions

* Issues and timetable.

Please note that we are scheduled to update the Board on this work at the end of July, and
have also been requested to provide an update on contingency planning to Alex Chisolm
(Permanent Secretary of BEIS) and Andrew Griffiths MP (Minister responsible for Post Office)
which is currently scheduled for 10 September. To that end, it would be helpful to get your
thoughts on the proposed approach.

Hard copies will be available for those at the meeting.
Kind regards,
Jane
