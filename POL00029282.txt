1.0 Introduction

This document describes the Operational Change Process and the use of OCPs. This document also describes
the set up and use of PGP electronic signing keys. The document shows a PGP user how to set up a key, define
a key ring of other “signers” and describes the signing operation which is used within Customer Service.

2.0 The OCP Process

2.1 Process Overview

All of the processes which make up the overall OCP process are performed on-line using the OCP and OCR
sections of the SSC web site, with the exception of those OCPs which have cross-domain implications and
therefore need to be communicated to Post Office Ltd — see section 2.7. All Fujitsu staff who are involved in
the process must have access to the SSC web site.

The process flow of an OCP is as follows:
© OCP is raised
e Ifthe OCP is not retrospective:

§ Post Office Account Operations are required to approve the OCP before it can be approved by any other

Other teams can then approve the OCP

§
§ Once all required teams have approved the OCP Post Office Account Operations need to make it
available to the actioning team before the OCP can be actioned.

«Ifthe OCP is retrospective it is made available to the actioning team as soon as it is raised.
«The actioning teams action the OCP

© Post Office Account Operations then complete the OCP.

Once the OCP has been approved by Post Office Account Operations then people can add comments to it.
Once the OCP has been completed or withdrawn then no comments are permitted.

Only Post Office Account Operations can withdraw an OCP.

Only Post Office Account Operations have access to the History log that is written for each OCP.

OCPs sometimes need to be sent to users outside of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account), or attached
as evidence to a PinICL. In particular, OCPs which have cross-domain implications for example
Network Banking or Debit Card need to be sent to Post Office so that they can be propagated to the
other domains/suppliers of the Post office.

Whilst there is no special facility to do this, it is possible to achieve this, (refer to “Saving OCPs” section 3.3)

For retrospective OCPs teams may need to be aware that they have been raised.

Ifso then an email needs to be sent to inform teams that it has been raised so that comments can be added to
the OCP.

Comments can not be added to the OCP once it has been completed.

2.2. Generating an OCP

Anyone can raise an OCP, except those who have logged onto the SSC web site using the “OCPview”
user. OCPs raised by Post Office Ltd, either at their own behest, or on behalf of other domains are
emailed to Post Office Account Operations, who will raise the OCP on the web site.

Once raised the OCP must then be approved by Post Office Account Operations, before it can be
approved by any other team, unless it has been raised retrospectively.

If the OCP is raised retrospectively, then the approval stages are not required since the work has already been
done, and so it is made available to be actioned without requiring Post Office Account Operations intervention.

Teams may be required to be aware of retrospective OCPs, and Post Office Account Operations will make
those teams aware that the OCP has been raised. These teams can then add a comment to the OCP to state that
they are aware of the OCP.

To raise an OCP, the user must tale the following actions -
Click on the “Raise a HTML OCP” link.

As long as the user is not logged into the web site using the “OCPview” user, the Raise OCP
form will be displayed

If the OCP is a retrospective OCP (i.e. the work has already been done) then the user should
tick the “Raised retrospective” box. Once the OCP has been raised it will be made available
to the actioning team for them to action it.

Enter the date that the OCP is required to be actioned. This will default to today’s date.

Enter the time that the OCP is required to be actioned. This is optional. If it is not entered
then it will default to 23:59.

If the user has logged into the web site using a team username, then it is necessary to enter a
full name in the “Raised by” field, otherwise this field will be filled in automatically and
cannot subsequently be changed.

Enter an email address if the user wishes to be informed when the OCP has been completed.
This is optional, except where the OCP has been raised at the request of Post Office Ltd,
where their return email address should be entered.

Enter a title for the OCP. This should be something meaningful as this title will be displayed
as part of the search results.

Enter a brief summary of the OCP. Again this will be displayed as part of the search results.

Enter the location where the changes are to take place. A list of common locations are in the
drop down list to the right of this field. Selecting an entry in the drop down list will add it
into the “Change at (Location)” field to it’s left.

Enter the Machine IDs of the machines affected, or if insufficient space, specify "See below"
and enter the machine ids into the Details and Purpose of Change box.

Enter the type of change required.

Select the Priority and the Risk of the OCP from the drop down lists. The defaults are High
Priority and Medium Risk.

Specify whether the change will affect the service from the drop down list. The default is
“No”.

Version: 1.0
Company-in-Confidence Date: 18-MAR-2004

Enter the scheduled duration of the change. This is optional.
Enter the Machine and Service IDs. These are optional.

Specify whether the system build is affected by this change. If it is then the Post Office
Account Development Team will be automatically selected as a team required to approve the
OCP when the details are transmitted to the server, unless the OCP is a retrospective one.
The default is “No”.

Specify whether the change is required on the LST rigs. The default is “No”.

Enter the Powerhelp and PinICL call references. These are optional. The system will add
leading zeros to both the Powerhelp and PinICL references. In addition, the system will
ensure that the Powerhelp reference is in the correct format of “yymmddnnnn”. For example,
if today is 22/01/2002 and the user specifies the Powerhelp call reference as “1”, the system
will make that into a valid Powerhelp reference of “0201220001”. When the OCP is raised it
will contain a link to the Powerhelp call specified, which when clicked on will attempt to
display the Powerhelp call details. The system does not check that the Powerhelp call entered
actually exists.

Enter the originator’s reference if any. This is optional.

Select the teams required to approve the OCP. This is optional in most cases. If the OCP is
being raised for a business continuity test or for any part of the system which will have a
cross-domain impact , for example changes to the Network Banking Agents, comms links to
Streamline or IBM, routers etc, then the OCP must be forwarded to Post Office Ltd.

Individual teams can be selected by holding down the CTRL key. The list of teams does not
include Post Office Account Operations, Post Office Account Service Management or Post
Office Account SSC Support. These teams will be automatically added and required to
approve the OCP when the details are transmitted to the server, unless the OCP is
retrospective.

Select the teams that are to action the OCP.
Individual teams can be selected by holding down the CTRL key.

Post Office Account Operations can add teams to the OCP in both the list of teams to approve
and to action. Any teams added this way apply only to this OCP.

Enter the details and the purpose of the change.
Enter any regression actions. This is optional.
Enter the justification for the OCP.

Complete the “Responsibility for Monitoring” box. This should specify the name of the
person(s) or team(s) who have the responsibility for monitoring the effect of the OCP once
implemented. In particular the monitoring should be checked that there is NO detrimental
effect on the “Live Service”. If necessary the details of the monitoring to be undertaken can
be specified in the “Details & Purpose of Change” section.

Once the form has been filled in press the “Raise OCP” button.

The form will then be checked to ensure that the required fields have been completed.

Ifall is okay at this stage, the details will be transmitted to the server.

If the form fails the initial validation the cursor will be placed into the field that caused the error and the user
will need to correct the error before the details will be transmitted to the server.

If the server responds with an error then the user will need to press the “Back” button on their web browser
and re-enter the correct details.

NOTE — an OCP is raised in order to make a change to the live system. If the change is
likely to affect a system build, then the relevant part of the form must be set to YES. If
the change is being made to the system in order to overcome an operational deficiency
which should be permanently fixed in the system code, then there MUST be a call raised
to report the problem, and the call reference added to the OCP.

2.3 Approving an OCP

Before the OCP can be actioned it must be approved. If the OCP is retrospective then this stage is not
required and the OCP will already be available to be actioned.

Only the selected teams are allowed to approve the OCP. Once the selected teams have all approved the OCP
then it is marked as approved.

Post Office Account Operations can approve the OCP on behalf of any of the teams, and they can also override
the approval stage and make it available to be actioned if necessary. Once the OCP has been made available to
be actioned then approvals will not be allowed.

If a team does not approve the OCP then they need to add a comment to that effect and inform Post Office
Account Operations.

Teams selected to approve the OCP are shown in the OCP by an asterisk against the team. Once the team has
approved the OCP this will change to the name of the person who approved it for that team.

Only users who are flagged as being able to approve for a team will have the option to approve an OCP in the
Administration page.

If the user’s username is not a team username then the system will only display a list of teams that the user can
approve on behalf of. For most users this will be a single team

If the user’s username is a team username then the system will display a list of teams that the team username
can approve on behalf of. When the user enters their UK domain username, the system will check that the user
entered is allowed to approve for the team selected.

For teams that have been added to the OCP when raised or approved by Post Office Account Operations, then
Post Office Account Operations must approve the OCP on behalf of that team.

More than one person in a team can approve for that team, even when the status of the OCP has changed to
Approved.

People can approve the OCP until it is made available to the actioning team.

If an OCP needs to be communicated to Post Office Ltd, then it is emailed to them by Post Office Account
Operations. It is expected that Post Office Ltd will respond to such emails within four hours. If the OCP has
been raised at the request of Post Office Ltd, then approvals from teams within Post Office Account , and a

return email is expected within 3 hours (in order to enable Post Office Ltd to meet the 4 hour commitment to
other domains).

In order to approve an OCP, the user must do the following actions —

From the High, Medium or Low priority pages:
© Click on the required OCP reference.

e = This will display the Administration page with the OCP reference filled in and the action
“Approve OCP” already selected.

b. Their UK domain username in the “User name” field
otherwise these fields will be completed automatically and cannot be changed

Enter the password that matches the username displayed or UK domain username entered as
appropriate.

From the drop-down list select the team for which the user is approving. For the majority of
people this will only have a single team.

Add any comments that may be necessary. This is optional BUT Approvers should ensure that
any RISK that they identify associated with the OCP is included in the “comments section”. For
OCP’s initiated by Post Office Limited this is particularly important.

The text in the PGP field is automatically generated by the system and it is this text which should
be digitally signed by the user.

If the user is known to the system then their name will already be included, otherwise it will be
included when the user enters it in the “Approved by” field above. Changing the user’s. name in
the “Approved by” field will change it in this field also.

The system will check that the text displayed in the box when the form is first displayed is the text
that has been PGP signed.

Tf the user wishes to add to this text then this should be done on a new line.
To produce a PGP signature the user must do the following:
1. Highlight the text in the PGP Signature box and cut (Ctrl X) the text.

that is currently in the box. This will paste the PGP signature from the clipboard
into the PGP Signature box.

Once the form has been filled in press the “Approve OCP” button.
The form will then be checked to ensure that the user has entered the required fields.

Tf all is okay at this stage, the details will be transmitted to the server which will check that the
user is allowed to approve for the team selected.

and you will need to correct the error before the details will be transmitted to the server.

If the server responds with an error then the user will need to press the “Back” button on their web
browser and re-enter the correct details.

Note:

Pressing the “Back” button on the web browser will clear any user name and password entered,
and also reset the text in the PGP field.

Once the details have been accepted by the server it will respond with a message saying so.

Once all the teams required to approve the OCP have done so, the response from the server will
include a link with which to email Post Office Account Operations informing them that all the
required teams have approved the OCP.

2.4 Ac

OCPs can only be actioned once they have been made available to the actioning team either
explicitly by Post Office Account Operations, or automatically if the OCP is a retrospective one.

oning an OCP

If an OCP needs to be done over a period time, then comments can be added to it to keep people
updated on it’s progress.

Once all the required teams have filled in the action form, then it is automatically made available to
Post Office Account Operations for them to mark as completed.

Only the teams stated in the OCP as required to action the OCP can action the form. Post Office
Account Operations can also action the OCP on behalf of a particular team, but again only if that
team is in the list of teams required to action it.

2.7 Post Office Ltd involvement in OCPs and Cross-Domain
OCPs

Post Office Ltd act as the central point of contact in the change process between domains. In this context, the
term “domain” refers to Post Office Ltd suppliers such as IBM for Network Banking, Streamline for Debit
card, TSD for incident management etc.

Post Office Ltd needs to communicate Post Office Account OCPs to other affected domains and also needs to
communicate to Post Office Account any changes in the other domains which may have an impact on the Post
Office Account operations.

All OCPs which require changes to be made to software or equipment which interfaces to other domains must
include Post Office Ltd as one of the teams to be informed on the OCP. This will include any changes to

include changes to other parts of the system where an impact on an external domain is likely. Any OCP which
is passed to Post Office Ltd should specify the impact on other domains in business terms

It is Post Office Ltd’s responsibility to communicate any Post Office Account OCP which is passed to them to
the other affected domains . to collate the responses from those domains, and to pass these comments to Post
Office Account, specifically be email to Post Office Account Operations. From the Post Office Account point of
view, these OCPs will arrive as emails to Post Office Account Operations, who will generate the OCP and
inform interested teams that the OCP is available for approval. On completion of the OCP, or if any Post
Office Account team raise any issues, then Post Office Account Operations will communicate these to Post
Office Ltd. For teams other than the .Post Office Account Operations team, the OCP is treated in the same
manner as an internally raised OCP.

It is Post Office Ltd’s responsibility to ensure that all operational changes reported to them from other
domains, which may have an impact on Post Office Account operations, are communicated via email to Post
Office Account Operations with a request that an OCP be raised, and to ensure that the Post Office Account
responses are communicated to the originating domain.

It is expected that OCPs passed from the Post Office Account to Post Office Ltd will receive an emailed
response within 2 hours. This has a dependency on the Post Office working day, which should be taken as
09:00 until 17:00 weekdays only. Any OCP communicated to Post Office Ltd after 15:00 should not expect a
response until the following working day. This does not necessarily mean that the OCP should not go ahead —
if there is an obvious business requirement for the work to be done, then the normal process for retrospective
OCPs remains, even for cross-domain changes (typically, for example, and OCP is raised when a central server
reboot is required. It is not the intention of this process to hold-up work which is obviously required for hours
awaiting approval, and the reboot should go ahead, with the OCP process merely providing a post-action audit
trail).

Some OCPs are for planned activities, for example IBM maintenance slots, Energis line replacement etc. Such
OCPs are not urgent, and therefore the timescales for impact from all teams, including Post Office Ltd, are not
expected to receive responses within two hours, and the timescales can be adjusted accordingly.

Although every attempt should be made to inform Post Office Ltd of the result of an OCP, there is an
assumption that an approved OCP will be actioned at the time specified in the OCP. There is a obligation on
the actioning team to inform Post Office Account Operations if an OCP has NOT been actioned. It is then the
responsibility of the Post Office Account Operations team to inform Post Office Ltd.

There is an equivalent obligation on Post Office Ltd to inform Post Office Account Operations in the event that
an OCP which had been notified to Post Office Account, but which was taking place in a different domain did
not take place as planned.

If there are any issues with the OCP process as it relates to cross-domain changes, then the escalation route
between Post Office Account and all other domains is via the SSC manager from Post Office Account and the
Release Implementation Manager on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

The Escalation Process would be invoked in a timely manner before actioning or approval has been denied.
The normal escalation routes would be used by both the POA SSC Manager & the POL Release &
Implementation Manager.

3.0 OCP Administrative Functions
3.1 Listing OCPs

In order to make it easier for the various teams to monitor when they are required to approve or action an
OCP, or to see what OCPs are at various stages in the process, there are a number of links on the menu which
list the OCPs

There are a number of ways to list the OCPs:
a) By team
b) By priority
c) By status

d) List of scheduled activities

These links can be accessed by anyone.

When listing by team, and the “Scheduled Activities” page, the information is retrieved directly from the Index
Server database, and so it may take up to twenty minutes before any changes are reflected in that page.

The other links access the files directly and so will always reflect the actual state of the OCP as soon as a
change is made.

Listing by team does not include any team names that have been added to an OCP.

Each listing, with the exception of “To be Completed”, use a sequence of colour coding to reflect various
stages depending on the type of listing.

Generally, yellow entries reflect the fact that the OCP is getting close to some limit, with red reflecting the fact
that the OCP has exceeded that limit.

3.1.1 List OCPs by Team

The link “Approve/Action by team” initially displays a drop down list containing all the teams
The User should select the required team and press the “List OCP’s” button.

This will then list any OCP’s that are awaiting to be approved or actioned by the team selected.
The page is refreshed automatically every 60 seconds.

The details displayed are taken from the Index Server on the web site. This can take a few minutes to reflect
any changes to existing OCPs or new OCPs just raised.

The meaning of the colour coded entries depends on the status of the OCP, whether “Authorize”, “Approve”,
“Approved” or “Action”.

Only the “Approve” and “Action” statuses have colour coded entries.

If the status is “Authorize” then the OCP needs to be approved by Post Office Account Operations before it can
be approved by any other team. It will only appear if the Post Office Account Operations team is selected.

If the status is “Approve” then the OCP needs to be approved by the team selected.

Entries that are coloured yellow are within 15 or 30 minutes of exceeding the required approval time
depending on the priority of the OCP. For High priority OCPs this will be 15 minutes, for Medium and Low
they will both be 30 minutes.

If the status is “Approved” then the OCP needs to be made available to the actioning team by Post Office
Account Operations.

If the status is “Action” then the OCP needs to be actioned by the selected team.
Entries that are coloured green are to be actioned tomorrow.
Entries that are coloured yellow are to be actioned today.

Entries that are coloured red should have been actioned already.

3.1.2 List OCPs by Priority

There are three links available which display all the OCP’s at a particular priority.
Click on the relevant link to list the OCPs at that priority.
For High priority OCPs, the page is refreshed every 30 seconds.
High priority OCPs should be approved within 30 minutes of being raised.
Entries that are coloured yellow have less than 15 minutes of approval time left.

Entries that are coloured red have failed to be approved with the 30 minutes required.

For Medium priority OCPs, the page is refreshed every 5 minutes.
Medium priority OCPs should be approved within 2 hours of being raised.
Entries that are coloured yellow have less than 30 minutes of approval time left.

Entries that are coloured red have failed to be approved with the 2 hours required.

For Low priority OCPs, the page is refreshed every 30 minutes.
Low priority OCPs should be approved within 24 hours of being raised.
Entries that are coloured yellow have less than 30 minutes of approval time left.

Entries that are coloured red have failed to be approved with the 24 hours required.

The pages show the teams that have yet to approve the OCP.

Entries that are coloured in cyan have been approved by all the required teams and is waiting for Post Office
Account Operations to make them available to the actioning team.

3.1.3 List OCPs by Status

There are five links available which display all the OCPs at the statuses of “To be Authorized”, “To be
Approved”, “To be made available for actioning”, “To be actioned” or “To be completed”

Click on the relevant link to list the OCPs at that status.

The pages refresh automatically every 5 minutes.

Company-in-Confidence Date: 18-MAR-2004

The “To be Authorized”, “To be Approved” pages have the same colour coding of entries as for listing by
priority.

The “To be made available for actioning” page does not have any colour coding of entries.
The “To be actioned” page has colour coded entries:

Entries that are coloured green are to be actioned tomorrow.

Entries that are coloured yellow are to be actioned today.

Entries that are coloured red should have been actioned already.

The “To be completed” page does not have any colour coding of entries.

3.1.4 List of Scheduled Activities
This link provides a form from which you can select the scheduled activities for a particular year and month.

By default this will include OCPs that have been completed or withdrawn, though by unticking the “Include

Completed and Withdrawn OCP’s” option.

The list of scheduled activities does not include any retrospective OCPs since these are by their nature
unscheduled.

The year is selectable starting at 2002 with an upper limit of two years from the current year. So in 2003 the
years will go from 2003 to 2005, in 2004 they will go from 2004 to 2006, and so on.

The year and month default to the current year and month.

When the “Display activities” button is pressed, it will then display all the OCPs for the selected year and
month.

At the bottom of the display will be links to move to the previous or next month.

Each page will show the OCPs sorted by the Activity date (ie. Required Implementation date), the status of the
OCP, with the Machine and Service ID if entered, with the title of the OCP in the Activity column.

These pages do not auto-refresh.

Clicking on the OCP reference will view the OCP.

3.2. Searching for OCPs

Once an OCP has been raised it can be searched for using the Search page.

The search page uses Microsoft Index Server to index the OCPs. This relies on reading a number of properties
within the OCP itself. This can take a few minutes and so the user should allow a maximum of 20 minutes for
the Index Server to do this.

Ifa free-text search fails to find the OCP expected, this may be because the text for which the search is being
made is in a property. To search for a property use the “Property” drop down list to specify it.

There is detailed online help available from the search page itself which gives detailed information on how to
perform searches on properties, and also deals with the construction of complex queries.

The results of the search will be either a page containing a maximum of ten or twenty hits. If the box “Return
the titles only” is ticked then it will display a maximum of twenty hits per page which will include just the

titles of the OCPs found, otherwise it will display a maximum of ten hits per page which includes the title and
the summary of the OCPs found.

Because of the way the data is stored in the server it is not possible to search on a range of dates, a search
needs to be made for each individual date. There is a separate search page (HTML OCP Date Search) which
does the date range search. The user enters the range of dates and the system will then search the server for all
the dates in between and then display the results in the same format as the Scheduled Activities page.

Further details on conducting searches are available on the web page

3.3 Saving OCPs

OCPs sometimes need to be sent to users outside of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account), or attached
as evidence to a PinICL. In particular, OCPs which have cross-domain implications for (for example)
Network Banking or Debit Card need to be sent to Post Office so that they can be propagated to the
other domains/suppliers of the Post office.

Whilst there is no special facility to do this, it is possible to achieve this by doing the following:

View the OCP.
In the web browser, right click to bring up the context menu.
In the context menu should be an entry “View Source”.

Selecting the “View Source” option will open a Notepad window containing the source of the
web page.

and save the source to a file on your hard disk
is the OCP reference, and filetype of “All files

In the Notepad window select “File”, “Save As.
with the filename “OCPnnnn.htm” where “nnn”
Cay.

The saved file can now be emailed or attached to a PinICL as required.

3.4 Copying OCPs

Sometimes OCPs will be raised which are copies of previous OCPs. To save having to type the details
out all over again, the previous OCP can be copied.

Anyone can copy an OCP, except if you have logged in using the “OCPview” user.

The Raise an OCP page will be displayed with all the details of the previous OCP except the
following:

The Retrospective flag is not set,

The Required Implementation date is not copied,

The name of the person who raised the OCP is not copied,

The date the OCP was raised is not copied,

Any teams added to the OCP are not copied.

The OCP can then be amended as needed and submitted as if the details had been typed in manually.

There is no indication that the OCP is a copy of a previous OCP.

Once the Raise an OCP page is displayed then the same rules as for Raising an OCP apply.

3.5 Adding and deleting attachments to OCPs

Files can be attached to the OCP and also removed from the OCP.
Files can only be attached and removed by Post Office Account Operations.

Files can only be attached once the OCP has been approved by Post Office Account Operations.
Files can not be attached or removed once the OCP has been completed.

Ifan OCP is withdrawn then any attachments are deleted.

Any file type may be attached, but the current size restriction is 2 Mb.

Ifa file greater than this size is attempted to be attached then Internet Explorer will return an error
saying it can not find the page.

Only | file can be attached at a time, although a number of files can deleted at the same time.

Ifa file of the same name already exists in the Attachments directory then it will be overwritten if
adding as an attachment.

To add and delete attachments, the Post Office Account user should -

From the Administration page:
e Enter the OCP reference and select the action “Add an Attachment” or “Delete an Attachment”.

© Press the “Do Action” button to display the attachment form.

If the user has logged into the web site using a team username, then they will need to enter:
a. A full name in the “Approved by” field

b. The UK domain username in the “User name” field
otherwise these fields will be completed automatically and cannot be changed

Enter the password that matches the username displayed or UK domain username entered as
appropriate

3.5.1 Adding Attachments:

The list of current attachments is displayed.

The user will need to enter the full pathname of the file to be added.
The “Browse” button will display a window allowing the selection of a file.
Once the form has been filled in press the “Add Attachment” button.

If the file with the same name is already attached (as shown in the list of current attachments) then the user
will be asked if they want to overwrite the current attachment.

The form will then be checked to ensure that the required fields have been entered.

If all is okay at this stage, the details will be transmitted to the server which will check that the user is allowed
to attach files.

If the form fails the initial validation, then the cursor will be placed into the field that caused the error and the
user will need to correct the error before the details will be transmitted to the server.

If the server responds with an error then the user will need to press the “Back” button on their web browser
and re-enter the correct details.

Note:
Pressing the “Back” button on the web browser will clear any user name and password entered.

Once the details have been accepted by the server it will respond with a message saying that the number of
attachments has been updated.

If an error stating that the page could not be displayed is output , then the user should check the size of the
attachment. The user should find that it is over the limit (displayed on the form).

3.5.2 Deleting Attachments:

The list of current attachments is displayed.

Select the attachments that are to be deleted.

Individual attachments can be selected by holding down the CTRL key.

Enter the reason for deleting the attachments.

Once the form has been filled in press the “Delete Attachments” button.

The user will be asked if you want to delete the selected attachments.

The form will then be checked to ensure that the required fields have been entered.

If all is okay at this stage, the details will be transmitted to the server which will check that the user is allowed
to delete files.

If the form fails the initial validation the cursor will be placed into the field that caused the error and the user
will need to correct the error before the details will be transmitted to the server.

If the server responds with an error then the user will need to press the “Back” button on their web browser
and re-enter the correct details.

Note:
Pressing the “Back” button on the web browser will clear any user name and password entered.

Once the details have been accepted by the server it will respond with a message saying that the number of
attachments has been updated.

4.0 PGP and Public Key Cryptography (Overview)

With PGP™, you can protect the privacy of your email messages and files by encrypting them so that only the
intended recipients can read them. You can also digitally sign messages and files, which ensures their
authenticity. A signed message verifies that the information within it has not been tampered with in any way.

PGP is based on a widely accepted encryption technology known as public key cryptography in which two
complementary keys—a key pair—are used to maintain secure communications. To send someone a private
email message, you use a copy of that person’s public key to encrypt the information, which only they can

decipher by using their private key. Conversely, when someone wants to send you encrypted mail, they use a
copy of your public key to encrypt the data, which only you can decipher by using a copy of your private key.

You also use your private key to sign the email you send to others. The recipients can then use their copy of
your public key to determine if you really sent the email and whether it has been altered while in transit. When
someone sends you email with their digital signature, you use a copy of their public key to check the digital
signature and to make sure that no one has tampered with the contents.

To use PGP, you must first create a key pair.

Instructions concerning the installation of the PGP software, and full instructions on the creation of keys,
together with a dowloadable version of the PGP sofiware are currently held on the SSC web server
“SSCDIAG3”. It is expected that they will shortly be moved to the SSC web serer “Scarper”.

5.0 OCP turnaround target times

The following turnaround times are set as targets and include all the signatories involved.
Urgent — 2 hours
Routine — 8 hours

Janet and Jean will chase the OCP to ensure sign off but it is down to the individual to ensure that sign of is
within the required timescale. Mandatory signers must regularly monitor their email for OCP’s, Optional
signatories will be told about the sign off by the Duty Manager.

6.0 Differences between OCP and OCR processes

The OCP process is administered by Post Office Account Operations, and is available to all users for the
administration, authorisation and auditing of changes made to the live operational service.

The OCR process involves the correction of customer data on the live system, and because user data is
involved, requires different approvals and auditing.

Only the SSC has the authority to make changes to the data on the system, and therefore only SSC staff can
action an OCR .

In most cases, an OCR does not involve the financial integrity of the system. Under these circumstances one of
the SSC Manager, the Support Services Manager or the Customer Service Duty Manager can approve an OCR
If the data to be changed has a financial impact on Post Office, then approval must also be given by a senior
Post Office Manager.

When an OCR has been approved, and has been actioned, it is necessary for two users of the OCP system to
confirm that the work has been done — an actionee and a witness. The actionee will always be an SSC staff
member, the witness can either be an SSC staff member or a development staff member.
