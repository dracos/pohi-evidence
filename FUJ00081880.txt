ti Sandie,
Looking at Peak PC0246949 it appears to be derived from 17991774 and I found Tf£S incident A105041260. There is no Problem Record

aised for this, however Peak PC0246997 was used by Development to investigate this, A code fix has been developed, but requires
fficial testing and releasing. I’ve made enquires and unfortunately LST are unable to take the fix for testing in Release 12.88

FUJ00081880
FUJ00081880

ithout significantly impacting that release to live:

6 the condition can be avoided by Post Masters, i.e., by making them aware of the condition and advising them not to press enter
fultiple times, I propose that this is KEL’ed and included in the counter Release 13.05.

egards

esolution Details: Update by Anne Chambers:Category 70 -- Final -- Avoidance Action Supplied:We have found that if there is a
hogout before a user has fully logged on, then subsequently a pouch is remmed in manually (most likely at an outreach branch), then]

fter the rem in slip has been printed, the same screen is redisplayed and the user is likely to press Enter again and duplicate
the remittance, possibly several times. A different screen should be displayed which would prevent this happening.

A rem in slip is printed each time, showing the same details but different session numbers, and a transaction log search confirms
the repeated rems.

[his is not an area that has changed for several years so it likely to have happened before but we have no record of it having beenI
eported to us. I can only check back two months; I've found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828)
nd all but the last removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding.
sranch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this.

je are continuing to investigate the problem (PC0246997), but any fix will not retrospectively change the branch accounts.

Iso we are aware of the issue and are continuing to investigate but NBSC should be able to sort the discrepancy out in the meantime.

y the sounds of it NBSC are just saying it our issue - which we are investigating - BUT they are missing the fact that they can
ort the discrepancy out.

[Thankyou Katie,

tf this incident is caused by the branch action it may be right and proper for NBSC to offer the advice given below however I am
cerned that there have been 4 incidents identified by Fujitsu with no explanation sitting behind them.

IBSC cannot check what the branch has done on their Horizon system and do not understand the impact to the Branch Account hence theI

lrequest for support from our colleagues in Finance Service Centre

Phere incidents like this occur I would expect an explanation of the root cause to be supplied by Fujitsu via Atos so that both ourI
Finance Service Centre and NBSC colleagues can be assured that the right advice is given, there is no impact to the branch account
nd a full audit trail is available. It does not feel right for Atos and Fujitsu to be giving instruction to NBSC to speak to
branches with advice with insufficient information

If this has happened in this case it would be useful to see that in this email trail.

hank you Kendra.

I''ve asked Fujitsu to advise regarding the root cause however my immediate concern is rectifying the reported loss.

Jujitsu have provided the following information which may be useful

las per Fujitsu, they have found found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all but the last
jcemoved the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding. Branch 224843 may be able

to do the same but NBSC should advise on this

Hi Rod/Dawn

ould I enlist your help and support on the below issue please?

ihilst I am happy for NBSC to try and support where they can, the concern I have with the below is we have no process for managing
this type of issue and we are unable to see any of the back end accounting for this Branch. Therefore, any advice that we try and
rovide could end up making matters worse - this is already showing a £24k loss. I am not happy for NBSC to give advice on

something that is not a process that exists within the knowledgebase.

Similar to a disconnected session, NBSC would have no understanding as to the implications on branch accounting if they were to
\dvise the branch as suggested below.

from the explanation below, this appears to be a technical issue, however, I don’t know if you have any other previous similar
scenarios that would advise on what the correct process should be for this particular situation?

Many thanks
gd

Hi Kendra, i
It can provide some background here which will hopefully explain why I suggested this call. The below issue was raised with Ian
Iwhomas by Helen Baker on 8th October

[his morning Anne Remmed £8000 from core branch to outreach using barcode

Fihen she accepted into outreach, and settled, horizon printed receipt, then another, then another, then another..she managed to
stop it at four receipts of £8000 from the one barcode rem in transaction. ji

she was concerned as she had never seen this before. She balanced core and it was correct, but outreach was £24,000 short.
Although the core had sent only one lot of £8000, the outreach had accepted 4 lots of £8000 in one transaction
she has spoken to NBSC ref 1358666 who told her it was a technical issue.

he then phoned the IT help desk ref: 17972295. She was unconvinced they understood the problem although they said they would
probably ‘rectify remotely’ . After waiting till the end of day, she called back and escalated to option 7 and spoke to Rich who

FUJ00081880
FUJ00081880

Fold her to phone NBSC.

It don't think the helpline understood what's happened. I can understand that as you would think it not possible. But, incredibly,
Anne's outreach horizon now shows £24,000 short and it doesn't exist. As you can imagine, Anne is concerned and I have told her not]
to touch the outreach unit until this is resolved for her.

[the incident was passed to Fujitsu who have advised that in order to resolve the issue, the branch/NBSC must ‘complete a rem out
for the excess to correct the cash holding’ which Fujitsu are unable to do. The NBSC has subsequently advised that they cannot
ssist as this is an IT issue however Fujitsu are also advising that they cannot assist. As a result, the issue has been passed
back and forward for over a week.

in order to resolve this as quickly as possible for the branch and avoid any further delays, I suggested a call between all parties)
to discuss and agree a way forward.

It hope this helps.

hanks,
katie
