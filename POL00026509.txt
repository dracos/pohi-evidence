activity to dedicated Area Managers once a capability assessment has been completed,

New Branch Support model:

SPM Engagement — new channels are being explored to increase the levels of
engagement with SPMs which create opportunities to listen and share.

branch, who will visit the branch through the course of the year and can be called on to
discuss matters concerning their specific branch.

New Branch Support Tools — a new set of tools is being developed to help SPMs with the
health of their business as a whole (i.e. not just the Post Office), including P&L, customer
experience and store design.

remuneration for 2020/21, an top of the £17m p.a. increases for banking, fixed

accuracy in Transaction Corrections.

Transaction Correction Disputes Team — a dedicated team has been mobilised to help
SPMs if they do not agree with a Transaction Correction.

discrepancies if a Tier 1 cali is unable to resolve the issue.

Horizon Knowledge Based Faults (KBFs, formerly known as KELs) — work has been
undertaken jointly with IT and Fujitsu to identify known faults from Knowledge Based
Articles (KBAs) and Knowledge Based information (KBI).

KBF Process - a new process has been formalised which the Branch Support, Loss
Prevention and Area Manager teams can use to help identify faults when a SPM reports a
discrepancy.

Branch insight Tool — operational performance information is now available to all Area
Managers and Branch Support teams to facilitate supportive discussions with SPMs
around operational activity.

JOINT PRESS STATEMENT

The Parties to the Group Litigation in Bates v Post Office are pleased to report that they have
reached a comprehensive resolution to their long-running litigation in the High Court, following
several days of respectful, challenging, and ultimately successful mediation during which the
parties engaged with each other in good faith.

The Post Office would like to express its gratitude to claimants, and particularly those who attended
the mediation in person to share their experiences with us, for holding us to account in
circumstances where, in the past, we have fallen short and we apologise to those affected.

The Post Office is committed to applying the lessons it has learnt. its new Chief Executive Officer,
who joined in September and fed this drive to a mediated resolution, is undertaking an ambitious
and sustained programme of changes to the Post Office's relationship with postmasters whose role
we recognise as being core to our future success, We fook forward to working in genuine
partnership with postmasters to seize the opportunities ahead of us and to continue to serve
communities across the country.

Post Office Chairman, Tim Parker, said:

"We are grateful to the claimants for taking part in this mediation and agreeing a settlement,
bringing the Group Litigation to a close. I am grateful to Nick Read for his important engagement in
the mediation process. We accept that, in the past, we got things wrong in cur dealings with a
number of postmasters and we look forward to moving ahead now, with our new CEO currently
leading a major overhaul of our engagement and relationship with postmasters."

Nick Read commented:

"I am very pleased we have been able to find a resolution to this longstanding dispute. Our
business needs to take on board some important lessons about the way we work with postmasters.
and I am determined that it will do so.

We are committed to a reset in our relationship with postmasters, placing them alongside our
customers at the centre of our business. As we agree to close this difficult chapter, we look forward
fo continuing the hard work ahead of us in shaping a modern and dynamic Post Office, serving
customers in a genuine commercial partnership with postmasters, for the benefit of communities
across the UK."

Alan Bates commented:

"The Steering Committee would like to thank Nick Read, the new CEO of Post Office, for his
leadership, engagement and determination in helping to reach a settlement of this long running
dispute. During the mediation, it became clear that he intends to reset the relationship between the
Post Office and its Subpostmasters and put in place new processes and support for them, as part
of a wider programme of improvements.

it would seem that from the positive discussions with Post Office's new CEO, Nick Read, that there
is a genuine desire to move on from these legacy issues and learn lessons from the past.”
