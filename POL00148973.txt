Subject: RE: Significant Litigation Report

Hi Jarnail — I have played around with “Part (B) — Criminal Litigation’. Are you OK with this, or does it need amending?
PART (B) — CRIMINAL LITIGATION

PROSECUTION CASES

There are number of cases which could have been prosecuted (e.g. those with full and frank admissions to theft
/fraud), but prosecutions were not commenced to avoid adverse judicial comment.

Several cases have also been terminated while POL obtains an independent expert report on the Horizon branch
accounting system (see below).

There are currently 14 cases which are being kept under review as to whether a prosecution (supported by an expert
report) can be commenced.

EXPERT REPORT

New experts from Imperial College London have prepared a scope of work on which formal instructions and a
protocol for requesting and receiving information will be based.

Appropriate individual confidentiality agreements will be prepared for both for the experts and POL employees
involved preparing the report.

POL00148973

It is envisaged that meeting/s to progress the report will take place with the experts, POL and Fujitsu in September
and October 2014.

PROSECUTION POLICY

Former First Senior Treasury Counsel Brian Altman QC has drafted a proposed prosecution policy for POL.
Comments from POL stakeholders will now be sent to Brian Altman for review.
