TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010

Dear Mr Singh
Re: Misra

I thank you for your email. I have not had the chance to consider it in
detail. I do, however, note that the answers supplied relate to my request
dated the 30th November and to Professor McLachlan's 2nd interim report.
You were in court on Monday when your Counsel requested that we provide our
final request, subject to any further questions arising out of material
still to be disclosed, and the Judge ordered such request to be served by
Wednesday. We duly served that request on Wednesday with Professor
McLachlan's 3rd interim report. You have failed completely to refer to
either in your email.

We do not therefore accept your contention that you have fully complied
with our disclosure requests.

Dear Ms Hogg,
POL00054010
POL00054010

I refer you to my letter of the 27th January 2010 and my colleague Phil
Taylor's three E-Mails of the 29th January 2010, copy attached for your
information. I also refer to your E-Mail of the 3rd February2010.

First E-Mail

In reply to your latest Defence Statement request for disclosure my Officer
has now forwarded me the following Instructions.

(i) Alan Stuart led the audit in October 2005 and his report is attached.
He also stated that other than completion of the cash, stock and compliance
questionnaire, no other notes would have been made at the time. At that
time paperwork was retained for one month only unless there was a special
reason for retention beyond that time.

(ii) No notes were taken by the Auditors as above.

(iv) My Investigating Officer has E-Mailed Tamiko Springer and her reply
was as follows: "I have checked my records. I don't have any notes on
file for West Byfleet. I ceased to be responsible for West Byfleet after
March 2006".

I understand that you have already received the details requested in (v)
and (vi).

(See attached file: 126023.zip)
Second E-Mail
Continued from last E-Mail.

Sb) What enquiries were made, bearing in mind the request came from a
trainer, as to the cause of this loss.

Michael's reply - I am sorry I can't remember the training for
the office, the PSA and the learning actions will be on file
for the office. I didn’t raise any issue as to loss of stock
or cash during my time at the office.

I have examined the file and the documents contained within it
relate to Mrs Misras application to be subpostmistress, her
business plan, the transfer of the PO, the official secret
act, her agreement to repay a £3,400 loss at the PO in
instalments, contract with outgoing subpostmaster e.tc.
There are no further training documents that have not
already been served. The file is too bulky to photocopy.

Third E-Mail

Please see the attached second statement from Andrew Dunks.
(See attached file: A Dunks 2nd Statement .doc)
Referring to the Defence Case Statement on the 21st January 2010, I now

enclose by E-Mail the NBSC calls made by West Byfleet.

Jon Longman, Investigation Manager, spoke to me about the statement made

Mrs Nixon on 7 Jan as this was being used by someone who was being
prosecuted in connection with an issue at West Byfleet branch.

I had no recollection of any Horizon probléms at Highcliffe and the only
info I could find is what Craig has already sent from the EFC.

Anyway I don't see that her statement proves there is anything wrong with
Horizon as she has admitted that the wrong keys were pressed!

Sorry I can't be of any further help.

Does this change anything from your perspective - do you search cases by

There are though, these papers regarding debt/loss and don't know if they

You are probably aware that there is a challenge to the Horizon system
again from the prosecution side of the business. The defence in a case

Horizon :

We had information to this effect see Eleanor Kimberley's E-Mail dated 3rd

August 2005.

John
ref phone call for information on Highcliffe 195508.

I have found Maureen Lyme, and have spoken to her regarding this office,
although she cannot remember specific offices, she has stated that pre
August 2005 offices were using a separate system for debit/credit card
transactions called streamline. Offices would put credit/debit cards
through this system and produce a receipt, which could be keyed into the
Horizon terminals.

Some Post master/ clerks would key the information into horizon as cash,
instead of debit/credit cards resulting in a shortage in offices. If
postoffices contacted Chesterfield at the time any branch discrepancies
were dealt with, and sorted out with the individual post offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect accounting procedure and
not a problem with the horizon system.

No information is available for any correction notices pre August 2005.
Hope this helps

Paragraph 18B - There is a preliminary report in the case of Hosi however
this does not pass the disclosure test in that it does not undermine the
prosecution case or support your Client's Defence.

We refer to your E-Mail of the 3rd February 2010. We feel apologised to
point out that if any apparent errors were occurring in the Indictment
period your Client should have a good knoweldge of what they might be
simply because she would have been readily checking the stock against the
Horizon records. Your Expert needs to consider possibly a material over a
4 week period which we are happy to provide for this relevant period
obviously this would be less expensive and reduce costs. We cannot see why
you need to see all the data as it would be satisfactory to see data for a
4 week period where your Client Seema Misra was falisfying the accounts
therefore any problems would be apparent in these weeks. We hope. that your
Expert will speak to Mr Jenkins and together they would find common ground.
We therefore conclude that your Expert would need no longer than formally
consider this over a period of a couple of weeks.

I enclose statement of John Longman and Andy Bayfield. I hope to be in a
position to serve upon you the statement of Gareth Jenkins shortly.
(See attached file: Witness statement Jon Longman.no 2.doc) (See attached

file: Witness statement Andy Bayfield AB checked.doc)

The prosecution now considers that your disclosure requests have now been
dealt with.

Kindly acknowledge receipt.
