Alan,
A few thoughts after a quick skim:

1. I think it may be saying too much about possible holes in the Horizon solution. I appreciate we need to justify
this, but this may be going too far. I'll leave Roy to be the judge of that.

2. Talking to John Burton this morning, he was asking can this be delayed to HNG-X R2, so perhaps we shouldn't
be referring to Weekend D (also how does that fit in with the Weekend D Removal CP). What we do have is a
constraint that this cannot go live until the Audit System is running in Ireland. Again Roy is probably the best
judge of this.

3. Is there enough info in this CP for the costs to be captured? It seems to be pitched very much on what is
needed, rather than how it will be achieved. Given that the main impacts will probably come from you, then this
may not be an issue in practice.

Regards

Gareth

As discussed last week, I have put the attached together as a proposed HNG-X CP to handle the processing of
counter events within Audit.

Any initial comments?
