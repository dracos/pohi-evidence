2. _. Key Programme Issues this month
RED LIGHT ISSUES
Horizon system
There are major concerns about the test results emanating from Model Office and End
to End.

The results indicate that cash accounts and transaction data delivered to POCL’s
downstream systems lack accounting integrity , all of which raises serious doubt about
Pathway’s ability to enter into the next phase of Model Office and End to End testing
without some form of remedial action.

OTHER ISSUES:

Migration to from MS Mail to Lotus

. The business has been directed by Group to go ahead with the migration from MS Mail
to Lotus in 98/99. This may have budgeting implications for the other automation
projects and may have change management implications for the programme. The
migration will be driven by a Group project and there is a need to ensure that POCL is
in a position to assess impact of this project’s requirements on the programme plan.

6. 28/9/98 Capability planning CEC are due to discuss proposals on the Rob Durrant

18 months ago the Midlands region supported
by Chris Robinson (external consultant)
undertook some work on regional capabilities
to support roll out concentrating on people
capability. This work indicated that the then
planned level of resource was insufficient to
support the roll out. Amongst a number of
measures to address this issue CEC agreed
that there would be no new products launched
during the roll out.

The Business Planning process gives a high
level view of a single point in time. A more
detailed capability process is needed that is
updated on a regular basis

Business is not able to sustain the pace of
transformation, either through a lack of
resource or because it has to pause to enable
changes to current state to be made

Gateway process later in the day. CEC
members are invited to consider the extent to
which the Gateway process can fill these gaps

A project profile has been prepared to take
Gateway forward.

The Migration. Working Group has been re
convened and will be undertaking detailed
migration planning, which will identify the
impact and constraints of automation on the
business. This process needs to plug into a
wider business capability checking process.

See updated action points

Red Light issues

There were no new red light issues.

Other issues

It was noted that there is a potential for overspend versus the business case numbers
for 99/00. This was due to a different understanding over the scope of the project
from that in the original July MaPEC business case.
Overall business case
It was noted that an overall business case with updated numbers and assumptions is
due to go to the December PO Board and that a new Horizon case would be required
by then, . . :
Release 2+
It was noted that release 2+ is now expected in February 2000 (pending the Horizon
update on timescales) and that it will include smartcard products. In some cases the
counter will have to accommodate both the Horizon terminal and the AP terminal to
continue to provide AP functionality until Release 2+ is implemented
Another potential issue is that a British Gas new product requires smartcard
capability not currently provided by Release 2+, raising the possibility of needing to
maintain the AP terminals until release 3, in order to keep British Gas as a client.
The British Gas issue is being impact assessed. .
The ergonomic implications of having the two types of equipment on the counter
need to be fed into the survey process.
D Smith

The ATSG was informed that in order for the automation programme to deliver the
20% cut required timescales will need to slip and one major project will have to be

CEC and the Single Sap System would have to be delayed to enable delivery of the
cuts,

It was noted that where projects were cut/ slowed down there was an opportunity to
divert the resource to other projects and/or Group.

It was noted that there is a possibility that technology requirements have been
double counted across the programmes and that Wendy would assist Finance in
identifying such duplication.

Horizon testing and timescales

Dave Miller gave an update on the progress of testing in the Horizon programme
and how that impacts on current timescales,

Testing was due to complete on 18 December with a release Authorisation Bard .
taking place after that. The Horizon programme view is that these dates are not
achievable because of problems encountered during testing, so the testing phase will
be extended by four weeks following MOR. Additionally a further testing phase has
been added in January/ February lasting four weeks which will enable complete
testing results to be assessed prior to authorisation. National roll out is now duc to
commence on 16 August ending in November 2000. These dates have not been
formally agreed with Pathway , they are however prudent dates to be used for
planning purposes. .

Release Authorisation”

Naresh Mohindra gave a presentation on the release authorisation process (slides

attached),

The following were noted:

the Release Authorisation (RA) decision endorses the release for live trial, it
does NOT provide contractual approval of the delivered services

© the main risk with RA is that there is an exposure to errors in the live trial
environment

© the release authorisation process is not intended to be bureaucratic, less paper
will be used, issues will be raised at an early stage and there should not be too
many thick reports to read.

© regular reports will be produced at -12,-10,-6 -2,-1 weeks from authorisation.

© a business owner would be assigned to each criterion and they would take the

decision on the acceptability of the results attached to the criterion assigned to
them by looking at the relevant evidence.

Requirements Specification

Dave Smith gave an update on this work. The background to this is the agreement
that the requirements specification document would be used as the basis for a new
front end or for going to the market.

‘The requirements specification document needs further work to be fit for going to
the market, and a number of critical business people must Contribute toitasa
business priority.

It was noted that the requirements specification is based on a “generic” capability
that will enable bringing products to market quickly; and that the ATSG have in the
past been supportive of this concept.

The “generic” capability is much more than a “technical requirement” and requires

_ Significant change elsewhere within the business for example, the account managers

may need to have a different approach to clients and there may bea need for re

training in the new way of working,

It was noted that PONTIS have recommended that with respect toa banking

product, the clients should not be shown the details of the technology supporting the

offer.

The ATSG agreed that:

further work should be done to the requirement specification with input from
appropriate people as a business priority

© there is a need for a plan to manage the implications of. moving toa “generic”
product offering

FAD codes

Pathway have treated this as a fixed unique outlet identifier, however the FAD code
can change as a result of conversions or organisational change,

Pathway have hard coded the FAD codes into the system and changes will
necessitate a site visit by Pathway. A solution has been proposed through joint
working between Pathway and POCL, however this is not scaleable and will result
in costs of £5-7m if POCL goes through an organisational change. ‘(these costs are
indicative and are yet to be negotiated with Pathway).

Action It was agreed that:

© the possibility of using Data Management and assigning movable codes to FAD
codes, so that changes in office category can be implemented through the
changes in the new codes would be investigated:

© the extent to which FAD codes are embedded in other systems must be
investigated

© new systems must not have embedded codes

© the operational disruption resulting from changes to FAD codes must be
considered,

Possible dates:

referendum before that, the UK would be joining the EMU in the 3" quarter of 2002
with the Euro currency being introduced in February 2004.

8.5 Peter is working with clients to understand whether they have any dual currency
requirements, at this stage the dual currency requirements seem to be minimal.
There is a possibility that our agents have dual currency requirements, or that dual
currency is necessary for the HR systems.

2.0 Programme Goals, Objectives & Measures

Vision:

POCL’s Harnessing Technology Programme is aimed at automating the entire

operating process from the customer transaction to the client. It isan essential

component of the business 'strategy and impacts ona wide range of POCL’s
strategic goals:

¢ improving POCL’s competitive offering to clients

¢ improving service to customers

increasing sales

¢ improving financial control

e reducing the cost of operations

Automation provides a platform for the development of a new long term

vision for POCL. The detailed business objectives of the vision are still

emerging but it is likely that the automation platform will be required to

support:

¢ extensive use of smartcards for a range of transactions -

¢_ information and advice services through connection to government and
other agencies

« “simple on line banking services, including cash withdrawal and deposits’

¢ integration with a number of customer access channels

The objectives below are for the timescales starting from November 98.

The delivery of the harnessing technology programme as currently defined is
contingent upon the delivery of the Horizon programme which will give front
end automation. Failure to deliver front end automation by Horizon would
necessitate a contingency solution to be invoked and the programme plan as

it currently stands would be invalidated.
