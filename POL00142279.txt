verify financial assets and confirm compliance with a range of business

£18,517.50 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures

£20,209.36 Total Shortage

6. During the audit Mr Harding asked the auditors how much the shortage was

and upon being told said, “I didn’t think that it was quite that much.”

7. In his interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police and Criminal

Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 6" October
2009, the defendant said:

He had had losses over the past 4 years which he could not explain.

He worked in the branch full time with one assistant.

He wished that he had sorted things out with the Federation
beforehand.

He had been able to balance the accounts by falsifying the records.

He found it hard to believe that someone had been stealing from him
He had made no gain from the Post Office.

He had not paid bills through the Post Office.

He had not settled a transaction correction when he was required to
make a loss good as he did not have the money so he rolled it over
without putting the money in.

At one stage he thought that it was his assistant but the losses

continued after the assistant stopped working for him

Defence case

8. In interview the defendant denies theft but admits false accounting to cover up

losses.

Discussion

9. This is a pre Horizon on Line case. The Second Sight Interim Report deals
largely with Horizon on Line. If this was a case where the allegation was one
of theft or the defendant was sentenced on the basis that he had appropriated

the money we might well have had to consider disclosure.

10. In this case there were discussions between the Judge and Counsel on the 16"
November 2009 when the defendant pleaded not guilty to the theft count but
guilty to the false accounting count. It was agreed that the defendant would be
sentenced on the basis that, “No financial benefit, no one took the money, that
it was lost during the normal course of operating a business and that the

defendant falsified accounts to cover this up.”

. In this case he was charged with False Accounting and on his own admissions
in interview he is guilty of the offence to which he pleaded guilty on the basis

upon which the Judge sentenced.

Conclusion

12. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the Second Sight Interim
Report, we would not have needed to disclose anything contained therein to
this defendant. The passage of time has not changed that position, in my

opinion, and we need take no further action upon this file.
