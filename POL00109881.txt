Subject: in the loop - media coverage over the Horizon mediation scheme

Attachments: Mediation Scheme.pdf

Hello,

It is possible that over the next few days there may be more media
coverage over the Mediation Scheme we set up to address the
complaints of a small number of mainly former postmasters who believe
the Horizon system is to blame for losses in their branches.

Given this, I thought that you might find the attached briefing note

I useful. It sets out our position on this issue and what we have done in
Mark Davies response to the complaints made (in addition of course to the branch
Communications and Corporate support work being led by Angela Van Den Bogerd).

Affairs Director

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you or your teams have any
questions. And if you or your team would welcome a briefing on the
issue I would be happy to make time to do so.
