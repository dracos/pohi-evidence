Dear Andrew,

I haven’t downgraded anything. ‘Reasonable’ was not my word. I believe we have a strong case because the
Judge decided more than he should have done or was necessary for him to decide at the Common Issues
trial. He was asked on many occasions both before and during the trial to take great care not to trespass into
the territory of the future cases and I believe that he wrongly failed to heed that request. Many of his
observations are expressed as firm conclusions rather than cautious preliminary expressions of current
thinking and that point was not seriously challenged by the other side in the recusal hearing. If he had case
managed the litigation in a more disciplined way all this could have been avoided.

The latest recusal judgment is an aggressively strong defense by the Judge of his personal position. This is
not surprising. He dug himself into it in the first place and he’s now in the business of digging himself out.
The collective view of the team - having observed him during the trial - was that this is what he would do
and his refusal to recuse himself coupled with his refusal to give leave to appeal against that judgment was
predicted by the team. As previously explained I also believe that in all the circumstances Post Office has no
real alternative choice but to pursue appeals to the Court of Appeal against both the recusal and the Common
Issues judgments.

All that said, and as previously advised, I cannot give a guarantee of success in the Court of Appeal. There
are always risks associated with litigation. I think Lord Neuberger’s view on prospects should also be sought
by the clients.

Regards,

Tony

Hi Andy

Sorry to be petty — LGQC told me when I met him (feels like ages ago) that we had ‘strong grounds’ to bring
the application for recusal. When I challenged him on what our prospects of success were, he said (not an
exact quote ....) he wouldn’t say ‘strong grounds to bring the application’, unless there were strong prospects
of success .....

That now seems to be down graded to ‘reasonable’ .
to the Board why.

..If that is deliberate then I need to be able to explain

Sorry ..

Jane
Counsel's view on the prospects of success on appeal has not materially changed following the recusal

judgment. They continue to believe the appeal has a reasonable prospect of success. If anything, Fraser has
said a few things in the judgment that may even help demonstrate apparent bias.

Andy

Now that the Counsel team have had a chance to review yesterday’s judgment, is there anything in that
which changes their view of the prospects on appeal? I have been specifically asked this by the Board so an
early answer would be helpful!

Thanks
