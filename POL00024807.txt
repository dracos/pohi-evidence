Quote from SS' Report:

"This ability to directly amend branch records is something that Post Office has consistently denied was possible. This
recently discovered evidence appears to confirm, that in 2010 at least, it was possible for Fujitsu / Post Office to directly
amend branch data without the knowledge of the relevant Subpostmaster.

14.16. In commenting on a draft of this report Post of Office told us that the references to “amend” and “correct” in the
documents mentioned above, are not strictly correct as neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the ability to directly change
or delete existing records. All that can be done is that additional records can be added by Post Office / Fujitsu without
the consent (and possibly the knowledge) of the relevant Subpostmaster. This will, however, have the effect of altering
balances at the branch, as both debit and credit entries can be made.

14.17. Post Office also told us:

“All of the above processes for correcting / updating a branch's accounts have similar features. All of them involve
inputting a new transaction into the branch's records (not editing or removing any previous transactions) and all are
shown transparently in the branch transaction records available to Subpostmasters (as well as in the master ARQ data).

The language used in the documents produced by Post Office / Fujitsu and to which you refer is unfortunate colloquial
shorthand used by those working on the Horizon system. I can see how it could be read to suggest that Post Office was
"altering" branch data but the above explains why this is not the case.”

14.18. This is not something that we have been able to test or validate.

14.19. Clearly, the fact that such an ability exists, is not necessarily evidence that such ‘amendments’ were actually
made. This is not something that we have been able to investigate.

This section of the Report was based on the attached email sent to Second Sight.

Kind regards

Exactly - it's hard to assess this without seeing what we've previously said

Thanks Andy

Would you please circulate the extract “The use of balancing transactions was explained to Second Sight
and is referenced in its Part Two Report at paragraph 14.16.” so that we can see what was referenced at
the time.

Thanks

Subject: Remote Access wording - subject to litigation privilege [BD-4A.FID26859284]

All

Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion on our call at
6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

POL-0021286
POL00024807
POL00024807

1. In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to hopefully
present this issue in a better light.

2. Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing with this point
candidly, even if that does cause some short-term pain.

3. We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation issues on this
topic. We therefore need to be careful not to overstate our case. This draft wording will also
need to be run past Deloitte / FJ.

Kind regards
Andy
