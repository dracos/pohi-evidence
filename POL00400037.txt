All

Please find attached my IT service deck for tomorrow. I will be with you at 12.00. There is quite a lot of detail in the
first few slides with regards to RCA of recent incidents which I will paraphrase. We are looking to adopt a different
and more robust approach to IT Service Management. Our focus is to shift to the earlier prediction/proactive
monitoring of service to prevent and reduce the amount of incidents that occur. Collectively we are extremely good at
resolving and restoring service, our priority now is to stop them from happing where possible in the first place.

Thanks
Andy

Hiall,

Ineed to make a change to tomorrow's agenda. Natalie has kindly agreed to come along at 11 for half an hour
so we can discuss and agree how we take the town hall events to the line and field teams.

As the people closest to our customers I don't want them to feel overlooked or unable to hear from Paula, me
or you progress and plans and have a chance to ask questions. It feeds into the senior management visibility
that we feel so passionately about.

Can you give this one thought overnight about what washouts do to reach out to them, if anything.

Tom, Kevin has agreed to cut his slot by half an hour so do you mind if we move your item to 4?

Many thanks,

K
