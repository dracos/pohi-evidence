Subject: Briefing Commission for a iiiésiinter Hall Debate on Post Office Mediation Scheme
Hi all,

We've just found out that Jo will be doing a Westminster Hall Adjournment Debate on Wednesday 17 December on
“the Post Office mediation scheme” (joy!). The debate will be from 14:30-16:00.

In terms of briefing she will need:

- A 10-15 minute speech (roughly 1300 words as she will be speaking after the opposition). Please can you
format this in chunks with clear headlines so Jo can easily swap additional information in and out depending
on the content of the debate.

- Fact sheets on the main issues. As this quite a long debate (they are traditionally closer to 30 min) we will
need to be overly cautious and supply Jo with more information that she normally needs. The issues that
spring to my mind are: The Horizons Working Group (background to why this was set up, the other work
streams on going to address this issue, progress so far, why it’s so important government stay independent)
going, Network Expansion, Post Office and Government Services, Universal Service Agreement, Ofcom’s
recent decision on Royal Mail’s submission, CWU strike, Post Office financial performance, Network
Transformation, Transitional Leavers. Please shout if I’ve missed anything that from your perspective are key
issues.

We have held a slot in our diary on Tuesday for a pre brief from 12:15-12:45. I will get in touch with James
Arbuthnot’s office tomorrow to see if I can get any clarity on his speech for the debate.

Could you also have think about who can be in the box that would be great, would be good to have either Steve or Re
in there as well.

Happy to discuss, although I am out of the office until 14:30 this afternoon.

Thanks,

Alysa
