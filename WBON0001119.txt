Dear Andy,

Here is where I have got to with the Defence (para 38 of the enclosed draft, on page 30). It has proved to be
slower going than I expected, but now I think about it, the pages in which we respond to their attempt to set
the scene were always going to involve the greatest amount of thought. You will see the scale of the further

instructions/detail we will need to get our case right, including from Fujitsu.

Rod kindly indicated that he was happy to wait until tomorrow lunchtime for the initial draft but I am

sending it to you now to give you an opportunity to review it and call me with any major queries, corrections

or objections before then. I will be carrying on with the document tomorrow.

Best wishes,

Tony
