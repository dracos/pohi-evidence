POST OFFICE LIMITED MATTERS — DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — CLAIMS OVER £500K OR THOSE OF A SENSITIVE NATURE

POL/HF/CD

Rod Ismay of POL

POL has received notification of a
total of five (5) claims from former
subpostmasters (SPMs). Each has
alleged wrongful termination of
contract (based on (1) alleged
defects in POL's internal processes
and (2) alleged defects with the
Horizon system). Each is seeking
damages in the sum of c.£150,000.

Despite reports in the media that
Shoosmiths have consulted on a
further 85 cases, POL has not been
notified of any additional claims.

A third party fraud investigator is to
be appointed (following consultation
with various MPs) to review up to
10 cases where Horizon is alleged
to have caused the losses. It is
anticipated that no further court
action will be taken pending the
outcome of that investigation.

In respect of four of the five clai
Shoosmiths have not taken any further
action to date to progress the claim.
There is no litigation in progress.

POL has been successful in having the
fifth claim struck out and is currently
seeking costs from the former
postmaster concerned.

Post Office Integrated Comms Plan

The CAG noted and reviewed the Integrated
Communications Plan (May — Sept 2012). The meeting
offered the following observations:

A key event taking place at the end of the month is the ND12
Go On Digital Conference. PV is speaking on Day 1. The
event includes a series of Post Office Champions workshops,
facilitated by Maggie Philbin. It concludes with the
presentation of the Digital Champion of the Year Awards,
presented to Llangadog Post Office couple, Win and Richard
Morgan.

1. Action - PV asked AR to ensure that all the activities
contained within the plan are given both named owners
and detailed completion timescales.

PV asked that a follow-up communication on the subject of
the Scottish Local Authority FOoG session be included on the
plan timeline.

The CAG discussed the likely timing of any mutualisation
announcement from BIS. MG advised that whilst BIS has not
confirmed any specific date, it has been suggested that the
response to the consultation will be issued before summer
recess.

On a wider communication subject, PV asked for a progress
update on the redesign and development of corporate pages
for the website. AR/MM responded by confirming that a
reskin of the website is underway and that the corporate
pages are drafted and awaiting sign-off.

PV stated that the images used at the recent Vision Launch
event did not represent the current brand identity for the
business and these should not be used for other events.

2. Action — SFM and RW to liaise and prepare new style
images and share these with PV.

RMG Comms Update (Verbal Update)
DS provided a brief update on key Royal Mail communication
matters.

RMG Report & Accounts — this is provisionally planned for
publication on the 28 June.

3. Action - the CAG asked AR to liaise with Chris Day on
the Post Office submission to the RMG report.

Gold Medal Winners Olympic Stamps — RM is planning to
issue a press release naming the 500 Post Office branches
where the Olympic Gold Medal Winner stamps will be
available. The provisional release timing is mid June. DS
reflected on the good integration between internal and
external communication messaging in support of this major
initiative.

RM Modernisation Programme — the programme continues
apace and DS reminded the CAG of the importance of
ensuring that RM and PO network change activity is shared to
access the potential impact on external customers and
stakeholders.

SFM — suggested that it would be beneficial for RM to
benchmark how Australia Post used the Sydney Games to
leverage business and brand profile.

PV thanked DS for his contribution to the meeting and wished
to place on record her personal thanks and that of Post Office
Ltd for David's advice and support over many years. David

leaves RMG in June. The CAG wished DS well for the future.

Projects Eagle and Polo (Verbal Update)

JW provided a verbal update on the key FS-related projects.
Eagle — it is hoped that the discussions around the Eagle
changes are close to completion. A firm date has yet to be
agreed for communicating the changes.

Polo - a proof of concept pilot is scheduled to start in selected
Post Office branches in East Anglia on the 22 October. Work
continues with BOI on the IT build aspects. It is likely to be
September until a final go / no go decision is made on the
project.

Annual Report and Accounts

AR shared with the CAG the key elements of the approach to
be taken in respect of the preparation and communication of
the full year RMG Report & Accounts. This will be the final
combined set of financial results, and as such, RM will
inevitably dominate the coverage. A press release and press
briefings are being prepared. The Post Office
Communications team is contributing to both the statement
and the supportive Q&A brief. The tactic is for Post Office to
take a low-key approach to the R&A. KG suggested a
challenge to that stance and said that Post Office should be
more proactive and bold in telling our story. AR responded
by reminding the meeting of the complicated external agenda
which is unravelling over the next few months. This includes
the publication of reports of major significance to the
company. Specifically, these include the R&As; the BIS

UKGI00044255
UKGI00044255
POLCAG07/05

POLCAG08/05

POLCAG9/05

In Strictest Confidence

Select Committee report; the Post Office Network Report; and
the report on Mutualisation. The key is deciding whether the
Post Office’s best interests are served by adopting a
proactive or reactive approach to each topic.

4. Action — PV asked AR to compile a more detailed
timeline of the key ticket issues for circulation in advance
of the June meeting.

Handled with Care - PR & IC Plan

RW and RK took the meeting through the PR and IC plan that
supports the ‘Handled with Care’ brand marketing strategy.
The CAG noted and endorsed the approach.

In line with the new brand values of Care, Challenge and
Commit, then a company-wide ‘first line fix’ communications
campaign is to be rolled out. This includes wider business
messages to be inserted into sessions with Subpostmasters,
e.g. Step Branch briefings and Rural Branch Network forums.

5. Action — MM to liaise with Harry Clarke about this
campaign, with the CAG asking MM to join the Customer
Complaints Group.

6. Action — MM shared that it has been identified that an
elevator style Post Office story speech would be really
useful for FOoG colleagues when they meet external
clients and stakeholders. AR to provide please.

June Meeting Agenda

A presentation on the feedback from the Vision Launch and
the workplan moving forward will be presented at the June
meeting.

7. Action — RW to prepare and share a presentation at
the June meeting

At the June CAG, the further elements of the overall
engagement strategy with stakeholders will be shared,
covering; BIS, Other Government Departments, Devolved
Administrations and Special Interest Groups.

8. Action — MG to prepare a paper and deliver a
presentation at the June meeting.

Agenda Standing Items
The CAG agreed that the following should be standing items
on future meeting agendas:
- Integrated Communication Plan Update (Alana
Renner)
- FS Update on Financial Services Projects (Nick
Kennett)
- RMG Communications Update (Shane O’Riordain)

Vision Launch Review

PV recognised the fantastic job that the Communications
team had done in executing the Vision event. In advance of
formal structured feedback, then all of the anecdotal feedback
so far has been overwhelmingly positive. Well done and
thank you to all those concerned.

Action — the CAG asked for a digest of the Vision event
feedback and the wider workplan of how the key messages
are being cascaded throughout the company to be shared at
the June meeting. Action -RW

Justice for Spmrs - engagement with MPs

PV shared with the CAG her recent experience of meeting
with two prominent MPs on their concerns over the accuracy
and validity of the Horizon system, following lobbying from
Subpostmasters at branches where financial discrepancies
have been discovered. PV praised the work of Angela Van
Den Bogerd, Head of Network Services, in meticulously
unpicking the MPs claims step by step and turning an openly
initial hostile stance into one of understanding and
acknowledgement of our position on the cases concerned.

PV stated that the MPs concerned have now asked Post
Office colleagues to meet a larger group of MPs who have
similar complaints from constituents to demonstrate the
robustness of the Horizon system.

DONM: The next meeting will be held at 9.30am on
Thursday, 21 June in Room 107.

+ The constitution of a mutual Post Office should include a mechanism for
the payment of profit distributions, subject to consistency with its public
benefit purpose. Investment requirements to ensure the ongoing delivery
of that purpose should take precedence.

+ Profit distributions should not come at the expense of increased taxpayer
funding for the ‘social’, uncommercial part of the network. The mutual
must be incentivised to ensure as much of the network as possible is
sustainable without reliance on the Government.

+ POLis to work with its stakeholders to consider more detailed aspects of
the mutual model, including the optimal balance of representation ofa
Post Office mutual.

+ The future membership of a mutual Post Office should include staff and
sub-postmasters. There must also be a formal conduit for any mutual to
engage with consumers.

+ A mutual should include a representative body to provide oversight of the
Board and represent the membership. Its remit and composition will be
defined by POL and its stakeholders.

+ The Board must have the clear autonomy to run the business in a manner
consistent with the mutual’s purpose.

+ A formal transfer of ownership should only take place when commercial
sustainability and financial stability have been achieved and it represents
good value for money for the taxpayer. Working with its stakeholders, the
Post Office and Government should agree the criteria against which the
financial stability and commercial sustainability of the Post Office should
be assessed.

+ Government will retain an ownership stake at least until commercial
sustainability is reached. In the meantime, Government will continue to be
closely involved in the development of the mutual model and the definition
of its public benefit purpose.

+ Government will retain a mechanism to ensure that it can intervene if
required to protect the public benefit, upon a transfer of ownership to a
mutual.

In terms of next steps, the Government Response says:

* The conclusions in this document do not fix a timetable for
implementation of mutualisation. The timetable will be dictated by the
point at which the Government, the Post Office and its stakeholders are
satisfied that it has attained the financial stability and sufficient
commercial sustainability to create a sound basis for transferring
ownership, informed by the Post Office's success in introducing its new
network models and growing its business and dependant on the
successful establishment of a positive culture of working together to
achieve the shared goal of building a successful Post Office that is run for
the public benefit.

+ The generation of a culture of mutualism within the business will be a vital
precursor to any ownership transfer.

+ The Post Office and its stakeholders will build further a culture of
engagement and customer responsiveness.

+ The Post Office will establish a stakeholder forum to recommend a
definition of the purpose of the Post Office for the public benefit.

+ The Post Office and its stakeholders will collaborate to develop more
detailed aspects of the mutual model, including its membership and the
balance of representation; and governance arrangements such as the
role of the representative body.

+ The Post Office’s commercial strategy must be introduced successfully with
revenue growth and the introduction of new ‘Local’ and ‘Main’ branch
models.

+ The Post Office, working with its stakeholders, will develop criteria against
which financial stability and commercial sustainability can be measured.
Government will monitor progress against these criteria to assess suitability
for a transfer of ownership.

+ Government must endorse the proposal on a basis that represents value for
money for the taxpayer. As required by the Postal Services Act 2011, the
Government must report to Parliament in advance of a vote on whether to
mutualise.

+ Parliament must debate and vote in favour of the transfer of ownership to a
mutual.

Government has now handed the baton over to POL to take forward the work.
Government want to remain closely involved as the work develops. Proposals
on the detail of mutualisation should be worked through with stakeholders and
agreed by the Post Office Board and Government. This now gives an
excellent opportunity to start to shape and influence mutualisation policy, think
creatively about the options available to us and influence the agenda going
forward.

Proposal

3.1

3.2

3.3

To ensure that all workstreams necessary to inform decisions on
mutualisation are properly steered, developed and co-ordinated, we propose
that POL establish an internal Mutualisation Programme.

The Mutualisation Programme Board will be chaired by the POL Chief
Executive, who will report to the PO Board sub-committee on the work of the
Programme. The Board will comprise relevant members of the POL
Executive Committee and will be supported by a Programme Manager.

The largest and most complicated workstreams are likely to be those
related to finance. These are also the most urgent and it isimportant
that work begins on them at once. As such, they are the subject ofa
specific Committee discussion under agenda item 3.

Recommendation

4.2

The sub-committee is asked to note the summary of the Government
response to “Building a Mutual Post Office”.

The sub-committee is requested to approve the establishment of a POL
Mutualisation Programme. Its Terms of Reference and details of the
workstreams will be presented to the next meeting of the sub-committee.

Finance workstreams
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

+ Take the sub-committee’s view on the financial issues which need to be
worked through in relation to mutualisation.

* Seek the approval of the sub-committee to establish a financial workstream as
part of the POL Mutualisation Programme to work through the issues and define
financial stability and commercial stability.

Introduction

Whilst it would be possible for POL to undertake mutualisation on an informal
basis now (indeed it could be argued POL has operated on that basis recently
through ColleagueShare & Share In Success for employees and agents), for
POL to become a formal mutual a number of financial conditions would have to
be met.

In particular, in line with the Government response to the consultation ‘Building a
Mutual Post Office’, Post Office Ltd must achieve financial stability and
commercial sustainability before becoming a mutual. It is for POL to define what
that means in practice, working with stakeholders and Government. What that
means in practice requires us to consider in more detail a number of issues.

The main ones are:

4. Government funding would need to be paid on a “service contract” basis
that allows POL to build value and provide an ongoing commitment for the
public good/community service. Currently, POL is effectively paid the
minimum for it to remain a Going Concern during the defined funding

») period, which has often been as short as 12 months. For example, during

the ding period POL’s value will reduce by c£150m. Obviousl
this change may substantially increase POL's funding requirement. This
would probably involve agreeing with Government which branches they will

pay for, how the segments will be defined (eg by profit; by location etc) and
what conditions they will require.

The reason this will be required is to allow value to be obtained from the
subsidised part of the business — in the way the Subsidy currently works,
this is not possible.

2. Cashflow needs to be generative after all costs and distributions. It is
difficult to be specific as to how much this needs to be but for a business
the size of POL £50m to £100m pa would seem reasonable.

The reason this will be required is that, for the business to be sufficiently
solvent that a distribution can be made, it must plan for a positive cashflow
over its plan period.

3. POL would have to have substantial net assets before it could realistically
distribute — again this is hard to estimate but an increase of £100m to £300m
on POL’s current position would seem reasonable to absorb downsides to
plan.

Again this is required as a buffer in case of a downturn in POL’s business
— the alternative would probably be further funding from government which
would defeat a key objective of mutualisation.

4. The working capital facility would need securing on a long term basis —
currently it is due to expire in March 2016.

This is required to fund POL’s working capital requirements - in particular,
network cash.

5. Identifying options for sources for long term funding.
POL needs to be able to secure funding and capital for investment.
6. How to incentivise branches, specifically the non-profitable branches.

It will be important to ensure that all branches are properly incentivised to
build the business.

Further issues

3.1 If Government funding is paid for a service there may be VAT issues.

3.2 The funding may result in any upside being distributed but downsides
being paid by Government as there will not be any other source of funding
to keep POL solvent.

3.3 Action would be required to restructure POL’s balance sheet so that the
Share Premium could become a distributable reserve — this may require a
court action which would, of course, be in the public domain.

3.4 POL would need to escape impairment before it could distribute.

3.5 It could be difficult to distribute reserves whilst undertaking a large
restructuring programme because of the uncertainty in the near future — eg
even BP stopped their dividends during their Mexico oil crisis.

3.6 The existing funding agreement would need completely re-writing and
probably approving by Brussels even if the amount of money paid to POL >
remained the same.

Recommendation
4.1 The committee is invited to:
e Agree that the lists of issues identified above are the ones that need to
be explored.
e Identify which ones should be dealt with as a priority.

e Agree to set up a workstream as part of the POL Mutualisation
Programme to define what is meant by financial stability and commercial
viability and deal with all the issues listed above.

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is:

2.2

3.1

3.2

3.3

To request the sub-committee’s approval for the establishment of a stakeholder forum.
To approve the Terms of Reference (ToRs”) of the stakeholder forum. (Appendix 1)
Background/Rationale

In his speech at the NFSP conference in May, Norman Lamb announced that that the Post
Office will set up a stakeholder forum to begin the next steps on the path to mutualisation.
This is confirmed in the Government response to mutualisation published on 4 July 2012
which says: ‘...the Post Office will therefore establish a stakeholder forum. It will be
structured in a way to enable input from the widest ranges of stakeholders, either directly or
through representative groups, including representatives of stakeholders from across the
spectrum of subpostmasters, directly employed staff, multiple retailers who operate Post
Offices, consumers and Government. Its particular focus will be working with the Post
Office to define the business's public benefit purpose.’

The particular focus of the forum will be to define the public purpose of the Post Office,
around which a future mutual could be built.

Government has passed responsibility to Post Office Limited to set up and run the forum.
The conclusions of the forum, in the form of a definition of the public benefit purpose of the
Post Office, will be presented to ExCo, the Post Office Board and then Government.

Proposal

For the forum to be effective, its membership needs to be small enough to enable
meaningful and substantive discussion, but it must be structured and directed in a way that
requires the members to carry out research and consult with those they represent,to ensure
that the forum benefits from the widest range of input. The success of the forum will be
judged on the quality of its work and also the ability of a diverse group of stakeholders to
work together towards a common goal.

To ensure that the forum works in the most effective way, we propose to seek the advice of
a small group of experts in negotiation and engagement: David MacLeod, David Erdal and
Margot Van Boeschoten. A meeting is being arranged with to explain the nature of the task
and the forum and seek their advice, and possibly ongoing assistance, with the
establishment and running of the forum to ensure its success.

The proposed ToRs are intended to:

+ reflect the terms of the Government announcement

+ confine the work of the forum to carrying out the task as announced by Government so that
its effectiveness can be tested before any decision is made in relation to it undertaking any
further work. If the forum works well it could be used to undertake or contribute to further
work on mutualisation. However, work needs to progress on other aspects of mutualisation,
which should also be developed with input from stakeholders at some stage in the
development process.

UKGI00044255
UKGI00044255

The forum should be created in such a way that does not preclude other mutualisation
workstreams starting as necessary in advance of the completion of the work of the
stakeholder forum and, where necessary, involving different stakeholders or stakeholder
representatives.

As part of its consultation on “Building a Mutual Post Office”, Government has already hosted
what might be considered the precursor to the Stakeholder Forum. The meeting was chaired

by Norman Lamb, the Government Minister responsible for the Post Office. The membership
of the Stakeholder Forum proposed in the ToRs reflects attendance at this meeting.

Options
The forum will have no decision making authority. It will act only in an advisory capacity.

The forum must use the research already conducted by Government and POL on public
perceptions, customer segmentation etc. rather than commissioning new work.

The definition of the purpose of the Post Office must be agreed by the ExCo and the POL
Board before being passed to Government for approval.

The sub-committee may identify and commission from the Forum new work to inform
mutualisation, as it sees fit.

Recommendations

The sub-committee is requested to approve the proposal for the establishment of the
stakeholder forum and to note the proposed use of external experts.

The sub-committee is asked to approve the Terms of Reference for the stakeholder forum.
