Insurance Number (NINO) which identifies the person to whom the Order
Book has been (or is about to be) issued. The Horizon Central database
maintains a list of every Post Office outlet at which that NINO has been
used by the OBCS application. This information is also held in the local
outlet database. All information received from DWP associated with
withdrawn or stopped Order Books is passed to all branches at which the
associated NINO has been used (if any). If an OBCS transaction is carried
out in an outlet and the NINO associated with the Order Book is not found
in the local database, an enquiry is made to the Central database as to the
state of all Order Books associated with the NINO. That outlet is then
registered as being associated with that NINO for all future Order Book
control information. Thus over a period of time a number of branches
become associated with each NINO. If the NINO is not found in the local
system the enquiry for OBCS information associated with that NINO is
carried out in real time. Such an enquiry will only happen once for any
NINO in a given outlet. All other OBCS transactions are batch.

Post Office outlets are identified by Post Office Ltd with a FAD Code.
These identifiers are passed from Post Office Ltd to Horizon when a
Branch is first Opened (or migrated to Horizon in many cases). When a
Branch is first opened (or migrated to Horizon), Post Office defines the
number of Counter Positions required (including any Back Office
positions). These are then allocated Counter positions from 1 (which is the
