Lucy,

We have looked into this, and it appears that the relevant Peaks are PCO126042 and PCO126376, attached.

The two related KELs were deleted, due to the fact that the S90 Release was proven to have fixed the issue, and they
so would not be included in the set of KELs which you have.

We have been able to retrieve the text from one them however, as attached, KEL JSimpkins338Q.

Thanks Matthew.

I've had a look at the information and there is reference in Gareth Jenkins witness statement to an email in appendix c
of Charles McLachlan's report. I've gone through the report but cannot see it included — are you able to send me a
copy of all of appendix c? Gareth also refers to a previous witness statement on 8 February 2010 — do you have a
copy of this?

Also, the report itself contains track changes — do you have a final copy?
Kind regards,

Lucy

Lucy,
The attached email I sent to you in July included the zip file that was originally provided to Second Sight, and which
includes information relating to the Calendar Square case.

I don’t believe there is a related KEL, but I will check for other information.

Matthew, Pete,

You may recall a while ago that I asked you to provide information on Calendar Square, Falkirk. Apologies if I have
missed your response, however I think this request may still be outstanding. Please could you provide me with any
information you have on this. Could you also confirm whether KELs exist for this bug?

Kind regards,

Lucy
