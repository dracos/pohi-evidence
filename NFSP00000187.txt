1. Introduction

This report is produced jointly, between POCL and ICL Pathway and provides a high level quantitative overview of
implementation activities, deployed within the Infrastructure and Installation Phases, to facilitate the introduction of the Horizon
system into the POCL network.

The figures within this report are based purely on National Rollout and do not include Live Trial Outlets except figures quoted for
Checking Rollout Data. Where cumulative figures are quoted these represent activity from the Start of National Rollout.

A Dual Traffic Light Measurement System is encompassed within this report, which is intended to create a high level management
summary. These measurements will be categorised into an overall End to End Implementation Programme Rollout status as well
as a status for the individual activities within both the infrastructure and installation phases. An additional system will operate in
order to provide Trend Analysis. See Appendix A for Success Criteria measurements for individual activities.

more efficient communication channels.

The number of activities aborted due to unforeseen non-fixed counter, refurbishment, Aborted activities
