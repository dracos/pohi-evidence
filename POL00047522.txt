You were telling us that you’ve had a few problems at home and that. While I
understand that you’ve been working under pressure, you gave us an explanation

discrepancies are only appearing in pension and allowances when none of your

SB Your balances haven’t reflected.

LB No.

SB Nobody’s come back to you.

LB No.

3.00 SB I don’t know how much we believe that everybody’s completely dishonest when
you've overpaid them. You haven’t double keyed a number because the numbers
are different on the front on some examples.

LB Yeh. I haven’t got it, that’s all I can say. I haven’t got it

SB There’s got to be a reason for it, you can’t just lose £1000...

LB What if I’m serving them and say I pay off the docket and I’m giving it
somewhere else short in the day and not knowing or .. I know I’m like clutching
at straws here.

AG So you’re making 2 mistakes you’re saying.

LB Several, I don’t know. I really don’t know.

SB They’re all mistakes all centred around the pensions, you’re not making mistakes
anywhere else. I mean it’s not... you’re duty’s not just about paying out pension
and allowances. You’ve got a number of transactions to perform but all your
mistakes, £100 or £200 with a different number in the pensions.

LB I don’t know what to say, I haven’t got it, I haven’t got it. I don’t want to lose
my job if I’m crap or even if you think I’m robbing. I don’t want to lose my job.

4.00 SB Is there any reason why the Post Office should continue to employ you, giving
£1000 away in a few short weeks.

LB I don’t want to lose my job. I love my job. I thought I was good at my job.

4.30 It was explained to Ms Brennan that this check was initiated by Chesterfield. The
week 41 check was read out to her from the 20Sa.

05.30 LB And that’s me?

AG No. And there’s another one, group 14, there’s 3 at £79.05 claimed and there’s 4
received. Now, that’s probably because what they’ve done there is they’ve
worded it the other way round. What they’ve said is there’s a docket for £79.05

that hasn’t been claimed but it’s a docket for £179.05 which is isn’t there which
has been claimed so in effect that probably is you if we have a look at that one.
So to carry on from that, week 41 found these errors so a further 4 weeks were
checked and the same sort of errors every week.

LB Yeh,

AG So then we’ve had a look at the pouch each week when it’s lefi here and there’s a
lot to go through and we’ve found further mistakes so we haven’t asked for
Lisahally to make any further checks in between yet because the matter’s quite
serious, we’re losing £100, £200, £300 a week, if I just check that one in fact,
because we have the listings here. Right, we’ve got week 41 which is there, that’s
42. And they’re talking about a group 14. It’s that one there isn’t it? Yeh. ’m
just going to show you that one, Steve’s gonna give that an initial as well and a
number.

7.00 SB SB9. Again, date stamped as B. 4 at £79.05 claimed and the one that’s ..
at £179.05 claimed but not there.

AG There you go, that’s £100, exactly the same as the others. So if we just look at
these, the £100 there plus another £100 is £200 plus that one is £300, 4, 5, 6, 7,
that’s £700 in 5 weeks. Now if you have a look at that on an annual basis, £700,
it’s about £7,000. That’s more than you get paid. We can’t afford to keep you
can we?

LB Don’t sack me.

AG I’m not going to sack you but Jan Mullen is going to get a report and she’s ...
LB Well give me a refresher course or something, don’t sack me.

11.00 AG It’s Not you then. You've not stolen any money?

LB Thaven’t got it, no.

Ms Brennan was informed that further checks would be made.

LB Thave not got it.

SB Do you think somebody else has got it then?

LB I dunno.

AG How can anyone else get it, they can’t key in figures can they?

LB No, no one else can take it out of my stock can they?

AG No one else uses your code do they?

LB No.

12.00 AG You say yourself that you stay with the same stock.

LB Yeh.

AG So you don’t leave the stock and say will you serve out of this one and I’ll go and
have a cup of tea.

LB No, not like that, no.

AG So nobody else can be blamed for it, whether it’s genuine or whether it’s
deliberate, it’s you isn’t it?

LB Yeh. What can I say?

AG You said you didn’t do it. So we have to go away and write a report and see
what other people think. We don’t have any control over it, all we do is present
the evidence that we’ve got. There’s the evidence, we go away and do a few more
checks and we add that to the evidence that we’ve already got and then someone
makes a decision about you.

LB I love my job, I love doing this.

Ms Brennan was asked if she had any bank accounts. She said that she had her
girobank account. She then showed a recent girobank statement

SB Anything you want to say Lisa?.

15.00 LB No. I’m sorry.
Ms Brennan was informed that she may be prosecuted and cautioned. The master
seal 047856 was signed and form CS019 handed to Ms Brennan. The machine
was switched off at 1110 hours.
