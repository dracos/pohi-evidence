Shanice, Oliver, Jefferson and Bex,

Advice for approval.

Purpose

Following advice submitted 8 November (attached as Annex A) this advice requests Minister Tolhurst’s
approval for the settlement range proposed by POL (and their external legal advisors Herbert Smith
Freehills (HSF)) in preparation for their mediation meeting with Claimants in the Group Litigation Order
on 27/28 November.

This note seeks your approval to a proposal from the POL Board to authorise settlement at a figure up to
£65m. CST approval is being sought in parallel. The settlement working group of BEIS/UKGI/HMT
officials met on 14 November and agreed to support the POL board’s proposal for settlement at a figure
up to £65m.

In line with the decision of the POL Board, any offer above £48m could be made only if it ensures a
settlement takes place and would require POL [CEO and Chair] approval, as well as the approval of
Officials from BEIS and HMT.

Minister Tolhurst has a phone call with officials on 18 November to discuss the advice and justifications
for the settlement range proposed.

Timing
Urgent — a decision is required by 22 November.

We have discussed this advice with Perm Sec’s Office in light of the pre-election period and can confirm
it is classed as ‘essential business’ and should be allowed to continue during this time.

Special Advisers

This has been sent to SpAds office in parallel.
