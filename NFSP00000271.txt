Dear Colin

Re:___ Outstanding Action Points

There are still a few action points outstanding from meetings between
yourself and Dave Miller which I wanted to have cleared ahead of our
meeting tomorrow.

1. Flat Screens

Ican now confirm that flat screens are the chosen option for sub post offices
and surveys and modifications will incorporate this approach,

2, User Perceptions

As you know I have had a number of discussions about the potential impacts I
of user perceptions on the response to initial functionality the system will
contain. Our view of this issue will be part of the agenda for Wednesdays
meeting.

3 Training

I know you would like a workshop to review in detail the Horizon
sumumarisation and balancing and how this will be approached in training. I
hope to provide this soon but we are still in the early stages of detail on this
part of training and it would be mid to late October before I would be able to
set up suitable arrangements.

As part of our approach to walk throughs and dry runs of the final training
approach, it is intended to pick up those subpostmasters who attended the
original training event in Stockport.

4. Printer

You asked for information about how far the printer could be located from
the counter. There are two responses to this:

@ The back office printer can be sited a maximum of three meters
from the nearest counter or back office terminal,

® Counter printers in standard layout would normally be restricted
to a furthest reach distance of 655mm.

hope this response picks up on the detailed issues which have arisen and
which you can feed back to your executive committee members.

I will be happy to take any further comments or clarifications when we meet
on Wednesday.

Yours sincerely

Bruce McNiven.
