e Saving/Submission

Firstly you need to refresh your Workspace. Although Workspace refreshes automatically, if you are going straight
into a tool there is a time delay between automatic refreshes, so it's always best to do it manually.

Open Sharepoint Workspace > Click on the ‘Synch’ tab along the top, and then click the ‘Synch’ button.

Procedural Security/Government Services

The procedural security questions remain unchanged, and have the four standard options in the drop down. There
is also a button for quickly marking the whole section as compliant.

Government Services:
The sections are marked as N/A if the branch doesn’t do them (Passports, AE] and DVLA). There are quick
buttons to mark all Government Services as Not Tested or N/A. There is no button for marking all as passes, this
is in case the automatic N/As are overridden by accident.
