1. Introduction

This is a summary report produced jointly by Pathway and Horizon to comment on the
conduct of the End to End 1 phase of Horizon Release 2 testing. It focuses on the testing
environment, the testing activities performed, the results of these and the conclusions drawn.

2 Scope and Objectives

E2E1 is the first of three planned End to End phases. The major objectives for E2E] are to:
@ Create a migrated start point for this and subsequent cycles of E2E
™ Prove the E2E scripts and test data
@ Prove the End to End environment will support the E2E scripts
@ Prove the communication links between all participants

The format of the testing was for the Horizon test team to be based in Feltham and run a
series of scripts and test cases jointly devised by themselves, the Benefit Agency and TIP.

3 System under test

3.1 Environment
The test environment within the Pathway domain comprised of a data centre, initially at
release 1c then migrated to release 2, with links to all external systems. -

The test environment within the Horizon domain comprised eight post offices; three of these
offices were migrated from release 1c to R2; four new offices were introduced into the R2
system, two from ECCO and two that were previously manual. One office was configured as
non-automated to enable encashments via the Helpdesk. The counters were Pentium P166
with 32 MB memory. :

Gateway PCs, for the transmission of data to remote sites, were located at Farnborough,
Huthwaite and De La Rue, Tewkesbury.

3.2 Software

The following applications formed part of the testing baseline:
@ BPS

m@ EPOSS

m@ APS

™@ OBCS

@ RDMC

by

m@ TPS

The software release was 8F increment 4.1, with some additional changes made. to this
baseline during the test cycle. These changes were notified to the relevant testing partners.

4 Test Conduct

4.1 Test Phases

The testing was performed by Horizon test staff and Post Office counter staff over the period
10th August to 30 September inclusive, the stages being:

™@ 10/08 to 19/08 - phase 1 of migration, moving three outlet operations from
release 1c to R2, with the data centre at release Ic

20/08 to 25/08 - data centre migration to R2

M@ 26/08 to 22/09 - full R2 operation and the introduction of 4 new R2 outlets
(2 MiEcco Migrations, 2 MiMan Migrations)

The end date relates to the completion of the Horizon/Pathway processing, external parties
continued their processing and reconciliation work after this date. PACS did not finish
processing until 7” October due to problems in the CAPS domain.

4.2 Test Schedule

As planned the test run days were run day for day with real days with the following
exceptions:

™@ 5 day delay on Day 3 due solely to changes required to reference data
provided by POCL to enable the distribution of non-core products to the
counters

™ 4 day delay for Pathway to complete the Data Centre Migration for Day 6.
This was due to E2E only having one sequent box. In the live environment
the Data Centre Migration would be done from one box to another which
would speed up the process

™@ 2 day delay on Day 9 at the request of CAPS for processing Temporary
Tokens

M@ 2 logical days done on 1 day for Day 21 and Day 22. This was possible as
there was no on-line processing at the counter or with CAPS on Day 21.
This was required to ensure the forthcoming power down at CAPS would
have no effect on the overall schedule

@ 1 day delay on the 12 September during CAPS power down. This day
was used to catch up with the result checking for the extra day’s processing
above. Input files had been sent through early so Day 24 could be
completed during the CAPS power down

%
@ Advanced 2 days where 4 logical days run on 2 days for Day 26 to Day 29.
This was possible as there was no on-line processing at the counter or with
CAPS for 3 of the logical days

m2 days delay on Day 32 was agreed to by all parties at a meeting on 16/9/98
because; .

a) CAPS expressed the concem that they would not be able to keep up
day for day running during the contingency recovery processing, due to
a lower level of weekend support in their domain, & said a 2 day break
over the weekend would be very helpful to them

b) Discussion at the same meeting about the start point for E2E2 made
it apparent that the originally planned E2E1 end date of 20/9/98 was no
longer critical.

4.3 Tests Performed

The following are the test statistics:

™ number of planned scripts 3910

® number of scripts run 2720 (69.6% of scripts planned)

™ number of scripts passed 2025 (74.4% of scripts run)
Scripts were not run due to;

Known problems as identified in the NR2 MORI Release Notice, v. 1.0, eg.
Stock Unit transfer functionality,

Some EPOSS and APS scripts were re-planned to reduce running time,

Some BPS payments were not available for encashment at the counters when
required for a variety of reasons, eg. Day 8 Cardholder file arrived from CAPS
in le format, Days 10 & 11 CAPS Payment files arrived too late to process &
a mismatch between the script & CAPS data where the next payment due date
contained zeros.

* Evidence supplied with these incidents is insufficient to enable further

investigation and the faults cannot easily be recreated. These incidents will be closed

if they do not re-occur in E2E2.

** The high number of ‘No fault’ TIP incidents is due to script discrepancies. The
intention is to ensure this figure is lower for subsequent E2E phases by ensuring that
TIP are given accurate information about what actually occurred at the counters to

check their files against.

5 Conclusion

5.1 Summary

E2E] successfully proved the test phase objectives to prove the E2E scripts and test data and
that the End to End environment will support the E2E scripts. This statement is made in the
knowledge that the 30.4% of scripts not run in E2E] are just ‘more of the same’ as far as the
functionality to be exercised goes. A migrated start point for this and subsequent cycles of
E2E has been created. However, it has subsequently been decided not to use this migrated
start point for E2E2. The 1c to R2 Counter & Data Centre Migrations have been descoped

x
from subsequent phases of E2E. The communication links between all participants have been
proved to be sufficient for the purposes of E2E.

Some issues were identified, none of which are considered to be major, and these can be
addressed in the later phases of End to End.

5.2 Achievements

The following have been successfully demonstrated:
@ Script run without any restarts
™ Proved day to day running can be maintained

@ Communications between Horizon, Pathway, and the external
parties have been exercised and improvements identified

™ Migration of outlets / BES counters from Release Ic to R2
performed on schedule

Data centre migration from Release Ic to R2

MiMan migrations performed

MiEcco migrations performed

Temporary Tokens, Urgent Payments and Urgent Stops processed
PAS/CMS Help Desk operation

Operation of the six main application areas (PASCMS, TPS, OBCS,
APS, RDMC and EPOSS)

Distribution of reference data via RDMC including non-core
products and revaluations

ISDN and Lan failures and Office Closures

Year End Rollover and long Cash Accounts

@ All CAPS encashment files were delivered within the SLA (6pm the
following evening)

5.3 Issues

The following issues were identified, some of which have already been addressed:

™ On-line scripts took longer than estimated to run. This was a
particular problem when other problems in the overnight
processing caused delays to the start of the next on-line day

™@ Problems were experienced printing reports which had a significant
impact on the time required to run the on-line day

® Due to (i) unplanned urgent card re-orders included in the CAPS
files and (ii) PUNs not being received from DLR in sufficient time

a lot of cards and PUNs had to be entered manually which
impacted the time required to run the on-line day

™ The cash accounts did not balance. This, in turn, meant that TIP
were unable to do most of the reconciliation they were hoping to
achieve

™ Problems arose getting the on-line interface with CAPS working.
These were due to;

Pathway CAS environment not cleared down correctly prior to
the start of testing, 7

CAPS starting on-line activity before contacting Pathway to
check the system & link were up. CAPS on-line is not yet fully
automated, servers and services have to be started each day
prior to testing

CAPS data input incorrect, eg. wrong Benefit Agency used,

Insufficient experienced support from EDS to solve
environmental problems

™ CAPS appeared to experience problems processing the returned
Encashment files within the planned daily test schedule, inspite of
always receiving them within the agreed SLA. As jointly agreed,
Pathway sent a few files over 11 hours ahead of the SLA but this
did not appear to help

™ Change of nominated post office, Expiry & Stop Confirmation files
were all produced but not sent over to CAPS due to the NFS link
failing. This link has been removed completely for subsequent E2E
phases, which brings the environment more in line with that of live.

@ Pathway did not receive details of all the STIRS raised by CAPS &
directed at Pathway.

™@ The Reconciliation process was not fully completed as CAPS did
not produce the Current Liability report daily

@ It was planned that CAPS would provide on-site support for the
duration of post-migration E2E1. This did not happen.

™ Uncarded Casual Agent encashments were not successfully
processed in E2E1 due to deficiencies within the Pathway domain.
It is planned to rectify these problems for E2E2 although CAPS
only plan to use Child Benefit in the live release.
