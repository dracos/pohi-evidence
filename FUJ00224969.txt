Desktop Layout

Introduction
The Desktop layout is designed to maximise the speed at which transactions and user
operations are performed. In order to achieve this, the Desktop provides:

© Direct navigation to menus containing the most heavily used products and
transactions.

* Automatic data entry, wherever possible, using a scanning device such as a bar-
code reader or magnetic card swipe.

Alternative methods of manual data entry via touch screen and keyboard.

* Sufficient information to enable the user to complete an operation with the
minimum of interaction with the system.

¢ Standard controls and functions.

This chapter describes briefly the main types of screens that make up the system, their
function, layout and characteristics.

Screen types

The Horizon OPS Desktop contains the following main screen types:
© Menu screens

Menu screens enable the user to select a product, navigate to another menu screen
or to a transaction screen.

© User dialogue screens

User dialogue screens enable the user to supply information to the Horizon system
in order to perform a particular task. The user may simply accept the information
that the screen displays, enter the quantity of the product that is being sold, or
details of an account that is to be credited with a deposit. There are several types
of dialogue screen; the format that is used depends on the data that is to be
displayed or input.

© Report screens

Report screens are a form of user dialogue screen but are specifically designed to
enable the user to choose whether the selected report is to be printed or previewed
on the screen, and other options. A report screen may be accessed directly from a
menu button or via an input screen, if a date or other criterion has to be specified.

2.3. Screen Design

Screens are designed according to the function that they are to perform.

The screen is divided into discrete areas or ‘estates’, which are used for distinct
purposes, There are two main areas: the navigation estate is the top part of the screen
and contains the navigation and other functions, and the real estate, which comprises
the remainder of the screen and is available for displaying information, input areas and
so on. Of the real estate, the right hand part is used to display context information on
‘menu and report screens, but is available to be used in other ways for data input or
information display screens.

The navigation estate comprises the top section of the screen and is
displayed on all types of screen. The buttons within
this area provide consistency for generally available
commands to be activated. In addition, the navigation
estate includes some function buttons such as the
button to access Help information, and the Quantity
button.

«The menu estate comprises the left-hand side three-quarters of the

screen on menu screens. This contains up to sixteen
buttons for navigating through the menu hierarchy and
for selecting other menus, products and reports. On
report screens this area contains an information panel
and three or four option buttons.

© The stack estate comprises the right-hand side quarter of the sereen for
menu and report screens, and other screens when it is
necessary to display context information.
Ifa current customer session is in progress,
transactions are displayed here.
Otherwise, the clock and date are displayed.

© Thereal estate comprises the screen area below the navigation estate.
On screens other than menu screens, it is available for
displaying information to the user, input areas and
additional options. An example is shown in

OCXs

Screens are populated by screen objects (OCXs), which are combinations of panels
and buttons.

Panels

Some types of panels are used to present information to the user and other types
provide a consistent mechanism for the user to enter data.

Buttons

Buttons are labelled screen objects that react like push buttons when they are selected
and enable the user to choose a specific menu, product, or course of action.

The various OCX types are available to application developers and ensure that a
consistent style is maintained, For example, all the button styles in use have a
predefined position for a caption, an icon and a function key label.

The following sections analyse the three types of screen listed in section 2.2.

2.3.1 Menu Screens

Menu screens must be organised in a way that enables users to reach the required
sereen, product or function as rapidly as possible.

Menu screens are easily identified visually by the clear division of the screen into
three areas: navigation, menu and stack estates, and by the indentation of the rows of
menu buttons.

The type of menu is identified by the title lines. The current context is made obvious
to the user by displaying the mode of the transaction at the bottom of the stack estate:
“Serve Customer’ or ‘Rem In Other PO”, for example.

Figures 2-1 and 2-2 show examples of menu screens. Figure 2-2 is an example ‘Commented [12]: Page: 4
showing the display before a customer session has been started. Figure 2-1 shows a Comment 34 [POCL 38]
‘menu screen with an active transaction stack during a customer session.

The menu estate is laid out using a maximum of sixteen buttons, arranged in four
rows of four, each indented slightly further from the left.

Detailed guidelines for designing menu screens and the hierarchy of menus are listed.

2.3.2 User dialogue screens

User dialogue screens must contain sufficient information for the user to perform a
task without having to refer to other documentation, The order in which data is to be
entered and the options that are available must be made obvious.

Alll input screens display the navigation estate, but the rest of the screen (the real
estate) can be deployed in various ways, depending on which component types
(OCXs) are used to build the screen.

There are several different formats that are used for screens, depending on the
application that is being used. Chapter 3 describes the various formats and the
guidelines that apply to each.

Simple dialogue screens are script driven; instructions to the user and data entered so
far appear on the right of the screen, and the user enters or selects data on the left. The
instruction on the right-hand panel, or a suitable contraction of it, appears as the
caption for the input field so that it is obvious to the user which field is being updated.
A purple arrow indicator points to the field that is being processed at the moment; the
field itself has a purple halo. Figure 2-3 shows an input screen for a simple dialogue,

2.3.3 Report option screens
Report option selection screens present standard options to the user:
© Print - print the report on printer.
‘© Preview - preview the report on screen.
© Cut-Off (if applicable) - accounting period cut-off: reset the data after printing,
© Exit - retum to the report selection menu.

Like menu screens, report screens are easily identified visually by the clear division of
the screen into three areas. In addition to the navigation and stack estates, the area
occupied by menu buttons on menu screens contains an information panel and three or
four option buttons on report screens.

The screen shown in Figure 2-6 is for selecting report options. It is an example of an
unscripted transaction. It displays information and gives the user various options.
