Subject: URGENT - Second Sight Investigation

Jarnail,
For the Briefing Note we are preparing for the Chairman and CEO, can you please find out today whether:

- we had any convictions pre-Separation based solely on Horizon (ie there were no other contributing factors such as a
paper trail, money in a bank etc).

- we were able to defend Horizon when challenges were raised to it in pre-Separation prosecutions.

Given that "pre-Separation" is a pretty long period (!), we could limit it to the length of time we keep the physical
prosecution files, or if we keep those forever, say to cases since 2000.

I assume you'll need to speak to Rob Wilson (I think) at RM for this?

Thanks for your help.
