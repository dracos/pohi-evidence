2. ESCHER UPGRADE SOFTWARE

21 General

24.1

This paragraph 2 specifies the terms on which the Escher Upgrade Software may
be used by Post Office and Escher Software Users in connection with the Existing
Services. Such rights of use shall cease upon the occurrence of Trigger Point T6
(Counter Application Rollout Complete).

2.2 Terms of Use

2.2.1

2.2.2

Fujitsu Services grants to Post Office and to all Escher Software Users from time
to time (together with Post Office the “Licensed Persons”) a right to use and (for
the purposes only of loading, execution, storage, transmission or display) copy
the Escher Upgrade Software to the extent necessary for the Licensed Persons
to receive the Existing Services in connection with the system known as “Horizon”
currently in use by Post Office and as upgraded by the Escher Upgrade Software.

Fujitsu Services warrants that it has the right to grant the rights stated to be
granted by it under paragraph 2 of this Schedule B4.1 and that it has the right to
make such back-up copies of the Escher Upgrade Software as are reasonably
necessary for the provision of the Services.

The rights granted by paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 are subject to the
following conditions:

2.2.3.1 Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of all actual or threatened
breaches of Escher’s trade secret, patent, copyright, and other ownership
rights in the Escher Upgrade Software of which it becomes aware and
shall use reasonable endeavours to provide Fujitsu Services with
assistance as may be reasonably requested by Fujitsu Services in
relation to the prevention and/or challenge of such actual or threatened
breaches.

2.2.3.2 Notwithstanding paragraph 2.2.3.1 of this Schedule B4.1, Post Office
may at its absolute discretion notify Escher directly of such actual or
threatened breach in addition to notifying Fujitsu Services.

2.2.3.3

2.2.3.4

2.2.3.5

2.2.3.6

All use of the Escher Upgrade Software by Post Office and/or Escher
Software Users shall take place within the United Kingdom or its
territories.

On termination of this Agreement, provided such termination occurs prior
to Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout Complete), Fujitsu
Services shall at Post Office’s request procure the direct licence of the
Escher Upgrade Software to either Post Office or a replacement for
Fujitsu Services appointed by Post Office (as Post Office requests) at no
charge and on substantially the same terms as the Existing Licences.
The obligations of Fujitsu Services and the rights of Post Office under this
paragraph 2.2.3.4 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Post Office's rights granted by Fujitsu Services by paragraph 2.2.1 of this
Schedule B4.1 shall terminate upon the grant of a direct licence in
accordance with paragraph 2.2.3.4 of this Schedule B4.1.

Save to the extent required under English law, the rights granted by
paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 shall not be construed so as to
allow Post Office to modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or reverse
compile the Escher Upgrade Software or take any other action to disclose
Escher's source code. To the extent that Post Office is permitted by law
to take such action for interoperability or otherwise, such reverse
engineering or related activity shall be limited to the minimum amount
required and may not be undertaken unless Fujitsu Services has refused
or is unable to make or procure such adaptations after Post Office
requests that it do so. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled, subject to the
prior approval of Post Office, to charge Post Office its reasonable costs
for making and/or procuring such adaptations as Fujitsu Services makes
or procures and Post Office shall pay such charges.

2.3 Intellectual property rights

Post Office and Fujitsu Services each agree that Escher's copyright legend shall be
displayed on all software and associated documentation and media under their respective
control in a manner consistent with the CCD entitled “HNGX-U/ Style Guide”
(DES/APP/STD/0001) (formerly “Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide”, reference
SD/STD/001).
