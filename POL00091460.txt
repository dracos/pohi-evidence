GLO Post Settlement
Programme

Author: Ben Foat/Rodric Williams Sponsor: Ben Foat Meeting date: 15 January 2020

Executive Summary

Context

On 22 November 2019 the Court of Appeal refused Post Office permission to appeal
the March 2019 Common Issues judgment. After commencing mediation on 27
November 2019, the parties settled the Post Office Group Litigation on 10 December
2019.

On 16 December 2019, Mr Justice Fraser “handed down” and made public the
judgment on the Horizon Issues Trial. On the same day he also signed a Consent
Order formally recording the conclusion of the Group Litigation.

Although the litigation has been settled, there remain a number of actions and
workstreams which Post Office must complete in order to satisfy the terms of
settlement and manage the impact of the courts’ judgments on Post Office’s
operations. The length of this report and its appendices reflects the volume of work
required.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What are the post-settlement workstreams which Post Office must undertake
following the conclusions of the Group Litigation?

2. What is the budget for these actions and workstreams?

3. What are the next steps?

Conclusion

1. There are five workstreams which arise following the conclusions of the Group
Litigation. It is proposed that each workstream be run independently but report
into the Board Sub-committee and Steering Committee governance structures
already in place for the Group Litigation.

2. [[PLACEHOLDER]]

3. The next steps for each workstream are summarised at the end of this report.

Post-Settlement Workstreams
There are five workstreams which arise following the conclusion of the Group
Historic Shortfall Claims; Common Issues /Ops

Litigation: Convicted Claimants;
Modernisation ; iia and Settlement Deed Compliance.

The proposed structure and resource for managing this programme of work is set out
in Appendix 1, with progress overseen and directed through the existing monthly
Board Sub-committee and fortnightly Steering Committee meetings established for
the GLO, with additional Shareholder reporting as required. The Communications
team will be engaged in each workstream.

The key elements of each workstream are discussed below. A timeline of the key
milestones to the end of February 2020 is set out at Appendix 2, which will be
updated as matters progress.

Common Issues /Ops Modernisation

The effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision to refuse Post Office permission to appeal
the March 2019 Common Issues judgment decision is that the judgment’s findings
now govern Post Office’s relationship with postmasters who have contracted under the
standard “SPMC” contract used prior to Network Transformation, or the “NTC”
contracts used following Network Transformation.

It is recommended that two steps are taken as a consequence:

1. Restatement: a communication is sent to all current postmasters stating the
contractual position following the GLO judgments. This would not be a
variation of the contract, but an incorporation of the GLO findings into the
express terms of the existing contracts so that the contractual positon is

POL-0090482
POLO0091460
POL00091460

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE

contained in one document (rather than in the contract and a separate 300-odd
page legal judgment as currently).

This exercise would also require postmasters who entered into the old SPMC contract
before c.2006 physically to sign and return their contract to ensure it is binding, to
address a finding that a postmaster may not have been bound to all of its terms when
they were on-boarded under a historic practice which did not require the postmaster
to sign the actual contract.®

Post Office is required to give a minimum of 3 months' notice of changes and
the logistics of ensuring the SPMC contracts are signed and returned may take
substantially longer. It is estimated that this minimum contractual change
would therefore take several months to design, implement and complete. A
communications pack is being drafted for this purpose, to be received for
review later this month.

2. Reform: a team should be established for the wider commercial reform of the
postmaster contracts, identifying the overarching objectives of a contract
reform programme (options for which are set out in Appendix 6).

Julie Thomas’s team has prepared a GLO/Operational Implementation Update, which
provides an update on how performance measures for support processes are tracking
following the conclusion of Mediation and ‘handing down’ of the Horizon Issues Trial
Judgment (HITJ) in December 2019 (see Appendix 7). The GE is asked to note the
current low impact on Support teams and processes following the handing down of
the Horizon Issues Trial Judgment in December 2019.

Settlement Deed Compliance

The Settlement Deed requires Post Office to take a number of actions in addition to
those discussed above concerning Convicted Claimants and the Historic Shortfall
Group Scheme. These include meeting with 3 members of the claimant group on a
quarterly basis over the net 12 month to share and obtain feedback on Post Office’s
plans for improving its relationships with postmasters and customers, and using
reasonable endeavours to resolve any outstanding issues with claimants who are still
serving as postmasters or have been suspended as swiftly as possible following the
identification of those issues by the claimants and/or their solicitors.

Each of these actions has been logged and is being tracked to completion. The latest
version of this tracker will be available in the Reading Room.

Budget

[IPLACEHOLDER - to be completed by Mark Underwood following 09.01.20 Budget

Next Steps
The key next steps for each post-settlement workstream are:

- Common Issues /Ops Modernisation: send to the network updated contract
terms reflecting the Common Issues judgment; establish a programme team
for the wider commercial reform of the postmaster contracts.

- Settlement Deed Compliance: continue to progress the required actions to
conclusion, liaising with the claimants’ solicitors as appropriate.

6. Objective of the Contract Reform Programme

A range of possible objectives for a Contract Reform Programme are set out below. These range from the
doing the minimum necessary to operationalise the Common Issues Judgment (Cl), through to completely
changing the nature of the relationship between Post Office and its SPMs and including changes which are
unrelated to the Cl.

The implications in terms of scope, implementation options, timing and resourcing will differ for each
option. Options 1-7 are set out (very broadly) in order of increasing complexity (and therefore time and
cost), but the full implications will need to be worked through in detail once the objective has been
clarified.

No. I Objective Description

1. Operationalise Keep the current contracts but make operational changes to bring Post
Office's practices in line with the CU. This work is already underway.

2. Regularise In addition to 1, carry across the CU findings into the existing SPM contracts
and rollout those changes to the entire network. Retain the same core
agency relationship model and range of contracts.

3. Mitigate Carry across the ClJ findings into the contracts in a modified form that is
more commercially workable for Post Office. Retain the same core agency
relationship model and range of contracts.

4. _ I Simplify In addition to 3, rationalise the current 60+ contracts into a handful of models
that are easier to manage. Retain the same core agency relationship model
and existing standard terms in all areas other than those affected by the CU)

5. Update In addition to 4, re-draft all the provisions in the SPM contract to bring them
up to date with best practice. Retain the same core agency relationship
model

6. Evolve Retain the core concept of an agency relationship, where Post Office is

contracting with customers via SPMs as agents, but overhaul the commercial
balance between the parties (eg. PO bears all shortfalls but remuneration is
reduced accordingly).

7. Transform Move away from the agency relationship to something else eg. a franchise or
directly managed model. A full transformation could take a significant
amount of time to implement so changes may need to be made to new
contracts the interim to reflect the CU whilst the transformation option is
being scoped out.

7. GLO/Operational Implementation Update

Questions asked & addressed

Has Postmaster reaction to the Mediation settlement and Horizon Issues Trial Judgment (HITJ) significantly
impacted support processes?

The support process changes made post Common Issues Trial Judgment (CITJ) in March 2019 are largely
operationalised and did not experience a surge in demand in December 2019 (Period 9 - P9) following HITJ.
The Historic Claims process currently under development led by Legal may cause an impact to Operations
resource and a Case Review team has been established in the short term to triage and investigate claims.

Report
1. Daily monitoring of branches logging on to Horizon established in August 2019 built a baseline for

understanding any unusual closure activity following the HITJ. Levels remained normal following Mediation
and throughout December.

2. High risk resignations where Postmasters ‘walk away’ are at 198 YTD (average 22 per month compared
to 188 (average 21 per month) for the same timeframe in 2018/19. With the given reasons and cross-
referencing to Historic Claims, there is no evidence to suggest any resignations in December are as a result
of HITJ. See Chart 1 below.

5. An interim process for Postmasters to make Historic Claims was established following CITJ whilst
awaiting development and cascade of the formal process following Mediation. At 8th January 2020
there were 48 formal claims from 17 current and 31 former Postmasters. 7 claims (15%) relate to the
current version of Horizon. See Chart 4 below. A further 38 notifications have been registered giving
the intent to formalise a claim.
