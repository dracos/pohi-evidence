iii Anne,

IT?m aware you are on leave until Monday 26th October and I?m on leave on the
ionday to Wednesday next week (W/C 26th).

following e-mail it was concluded that Post Master could be advised how to
avoid this happening and what to do if they did get into a transaction
iscrepancy situation.

ould you please produce a KEL covering this incident advising of the avoidance
actions.

Hi Sandie,

Looking at Peak PC0246949 it appears to be derived from 17991774 and I found
IrfS incident A105041260. There is no Problem Record raised for this, however
Peak PC0246997 was used by Development to investigate this. A code fix has been
leveloped, but requires official testing and releasing. I?ve made enquires and
nfortunately LST are unable to take the fix for testing in Release 12.88
ithout significantly impacting that release to live.

§ the condition can be avoided by Post Masters, i.e., by making them aware of
the condition and advising them not to press enter multiple times, I propose
that this is KEL?ed and included in the counter Release 13.05.

esolution Details: Update by Anne Chambers:Category 70 -- Final -- Avoidance
ction Supplied:We have found that if there is a logout before a user has fully
hogged on, then subsequently a pouch is remmed in manually (most likely at an
lbutreach branch), then after the rem in slip has been printed, the same screen
is redisplayed and the user is likely to press Enter again and duplicate the
remittance, possibly several times. A different screen should be displayed
hich would prevent this happening.

rem in slip is printed each time, showing the same details but different
lsession numbers, and a transaction log search confirms the repeated rems.

this is not an area that has changed for several years so it likely to have
appened before but we have no record of it having been reported to us. I can
only check back two months; I've found 4 other instances (outreach branches
214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all but the last removed the discrepancy by
completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding.
ranch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this.

le are continuing to investigate the problem (PC0246997), but any fix will not
retrospectively change the branch accounts.

Iso we are aware of the issue and are continuing to investigate but NBSC should
able to sort the discrepancy out in the meantime.

Isy the sounds of it NBSC are just saying it our issue ? which we are
investigating ? BUT they are missing the fact that they can sort the

iscrepancy out.

What is the current action plan and associated timescales for resolution?

Ihankyou Katie,

If this incident is caused by the branch action it may be right and proper for
BSC to offer the advice given below however I am concerned that there have
een 4 incidents identified by Fujitsu with no explanation sitting behind them.
BSC cannot check what the branch has done on their Horizon system and do not
understand the impact to the Branch Account hence the request for support from
our colleagues in Finance Service Centre.

here incidents like this occur I would expect an explanation of the root cause
Ito be supplied by Fujitsu via Atos so that both our Finance Service Centre and
BSC colleagues can be assured that the right advice is given, there is no
impact to the branch account and a full audit trail is available. It does not
feel right for Atos and Fujitsu to be giving instruction to NBSC to speak to
ranches with advice with insufficient information.

If this has happened in this case it would be useful to see that in this email

Fujitsu have provided the following information which may be useful:

Hi Rod/Dawn
ould I enlist your help and support on the below issue please?

hilst I am happy for NBSC to try and support where they can, the concern I
ave with the below is we have no process for managing this type of issue and
are unable to see any of the back end accounting for this Branch. Therefore,
any advice that we try and provide could end up making matters worse ? this is
lslready showing a £24k loss. I am not happy for NBSC to give advice on
something that is not a process that exists within the knowledgebase.

similar to a disconnected session, NBSC would have no understanding as to the
implications on branch accounting if they were to advise the branch as
suggested below.

From the explanation below, this appears to be a technical issue, however, I
jon?t know if you have any other previous similar scenarios that would advise
lon what the correct process should be for this particular situation?

:ransaction discrepancies # 1358666

i Kendra,

I can provide some background here which will hopefully explain why I suggested
this call. The below issue was raised with Ian Thomas by Helen Baker on 8th
ctober:

(This morning Anne Remmed £8000 from core branch to outreach using barcode.

hen she accepted into outreach, and settled, horizon printed receipt, then
lanother, then another, then another..she managed to stop it at four receipts of

#8000 from the one barcode rem in transaction.

she was concerned as she had never seen this before. She balanced core and it
as correct, but outreach was £24,000 short.

lthough the core had sent only one lot of £8000, the outreach had accepted 4
lots of £8000 in one transaction!

FUJ00086073
FUJ00086073
PC0247207 -- HardCopy -- Matthew Lenton Page 6 of 9

She has spoken to NBSC ref 1358666 who told her it was a technical issue.

she then phoned the IT help desk ref: 17972295. She was unconvinced they
nderstood the problem although they said they would probably ‘rectify
Iremotely' . After waiting till the end of day, she called back and escalated to
loption 7 and spoke to Rich who told her to phone NBSC.

It don't think the helpline understood what's happened. I can understand that as
you would think it not possible. But, incredibly, Anne's outreach horizon now
shows £24,000 short and it doesn't exist. As you can imagine, Anne is concerned
land I have told her not to touch the outreach unit until this is resolved for
her.

the incident was passed to Fujitsu who have advised that in order to resolve
the issue, the branch/NBSC must ?complete a rem out for the excess to correct
the cash holding? which Fujitsu are unable to do. The NBSC has subsequently
advised that they cannot assist as this is an IT issue however Fujitsu are also
advising that they cannot assist. As a result, the issue has been passed back
land forward for over a week.

In order to resolve this as quickly as possible for the branch and avoid any
further delays, I suggested a call between all parties to discuss and agree a

ay forward.

IX hope this helps.
