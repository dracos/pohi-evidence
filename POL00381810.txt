Subject: Paula's next session with Will Gibson, BIS

Dear All

Please note that Paula’s next session with Will is on the 7 October. As some of you will be on annual leave/offsite next
week, please would you make sure you email over to MartinE any key issues by midday on the 3 October, so he has
time to coordinate the briefing for Paula.

Thanks

Theresa
