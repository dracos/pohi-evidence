1.0 Introduction

The Transaction Processing System (TPS) Report Set has been designed to enable
reconciliation of the transactions carried out in Post Office branches using the Electronic Point
of Sale Service (EPOSS) which are sent to Post Office Ltd Financial Systems (POLFS), and
Post Office Ltd Management Information Systems (POLMIS). The TPS report set identifies
errors that occur within counter transactions or during the harvesting process. In addition to
errors highlighted by Fujitsu Services within the TPS Report Set, errors may also be
discovered by Post Office Ltd Finance (POL Finance) when reconciling data within its central
systems or which relate to enquiries from Post Office Clients. To initiate the Business Incident
Management (BIM) reconciliation procedure, Fujitsu Services Management Support Unit
(MSU) and POL Finance generate Business Incidents for one or more errors discovered.

NB: For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal reconciliation produced between the
POLFS and POLMIS transaction stream. The POLMIS stream should therefore not be used
to verify financial integrity and Post Office Ltd should ensure the TPS Report Set and POLFS
transaction stream are used for this purpose.

NB: Acceptance of this document will not indicate acceptance of a specific Fujitsu / POLFS
or POLMIS Interface solution. Those solutions should be identified within the relevant AIS or
contractual document.

2.0 Scope

This document sets out the reconciliation and incident management procedures to be adopted
by the Fujitsu MSU for dealing with Business Incidents relating to the TPS Report Set errors
and POL Finance generated Business Incidents. This includes reconciling the data contained
in the TPS Report Set and raising Horizon Service Desk (HSD) BIM reports and Manual
Error Reports (MER) where necessary.

This iteration of this Contract Controlled Documents (CCD) revises the current procedures
with respect to the S80 release, ie. ending of Cash Account reconciliation as well as to reflect
the change of TPS data being delivered to POLFS and POLMIS as apposed to Post Office Ltd
Operations Transaction Information Processing (OPTIP/TIP).

21 Transaction Corrections delivered to Fujitsu from Post
Office Ltd

In addition, S80 introduces the process whereby Post Office Ltd forward transaction
corrections from POLFS to Fujitsu for onward transmission to individual Post Office
branches. A daily transaction corrections file is received from POLFS and a log file is created
which shows how many transaction corrections have actually been successfully loaded into the
TPS. Should there be any transaction corrections which cannot be delivered to the individual
branch, Fujitsu MSU will raise a BIM report and inform POL Finance of this exception in line
with the Day J Service Level Target for processing transaction corrections.

Fujitsu (for S80) will generate four daily TPS exception reports (TPS Report Set) (from the
Host and counter reconciliation software), and one Non Polled Outlet report from the host,
which are described briefly below for information purposes:

NB: These reports are not delivered to Post Office Ltd, however they can be provided for
audit requirements if required.

1. Host Detected Transaction Control Errors:

This report shows detail for any Post Office branch where the control totals for
the transactions output by the host to POLFS and POLMIS do not match the
daily transaction totals calculated by the counters.

2. TPS Harvester Errors:

This report lists error conditions detected by the TPS Harvester when failing to process a
transaction where one of the transaction message attributes is corrupted or incomplete
within the Riposte message store.

3. Non Polled Branches:

This report identifies all Post Office branches, which have not been polled on a daily basis
and have therefore not transmitted any transactions to POLFS or POLMIS. This report
does not feature in the reconciliation process and it is used by Fujitsu to aid the resolution
of communications outages / hardware faults which have prevented transactions being
harvested from individual Post Office branches.

4. Incomplete POLFS Summaries

This report identifies all Post Office branches on a daily basis in which the net total of
transactions (debits/credits) does NOT net to a value of zero. Fujitsu MSU will raise
incidents on all such occurrences in cases. There may be cases where POL Finance will
need to advise and agree on any adjustments to the Fujitsu central data store that may need
to take place or order to make the transactions for a particular branch net to zero. (As per
agreed process document ref: CS/PRD/019; Customer Service Operational Change
Control Process))

NB: It is not intended that this document describes the format or content of the individual
reconciliation reports

The TPS Report Set will be routed to Fujitsu MSU, on a daily basis by 08.00hrs, where they
will be checked for completeness and accuracy of content. In the event that the reports do not
arrive, or after checking appear to be incorrect, in the sense that the reporting process in itself
has failed, Fujitsu MSU will raise an incident via Post Office Account Third line support
(SSC). A BIM report will be issued to POL Finance where appropriate, i.e. where there has
been a reporting error (the reconciliation reports are flawed but not the transaction stream), or
in cases where ‘delayed transactions’ can be delivered later with out compromising the
integrity of those transactions.

It is not intended that Fujitsu MSU will deliver any of the TPS Report Set to POL Finance as a
matter of course, other than the Non Polled Branches report which will be forwarded to a

specifically agreed Post Office Ltd distribution list. An extract from the TPS Report Set may
however be delivered as ‘evidence’ as an attachment to the BIM report / MER if it is
considered by Fujitsu MSU that this would aid the reconciliation or settlement process within
POL Finance. However, the reports can be delivered to POL Finance upon request.

3.0 Reconciliation and Incident Handling

3.1.1 Business Incidents

Relate to the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the effect of the system fault on the
resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to Post Office Ltd.

e A Business Incident relates to one or more of the errors reported within the TPS
Report Set, or one or more of the reconciliation or settlement errors raised in
accordance with this document by POL Finance
3.1.2 System Incidents
Relate to the underlying ‘Cause’

System incidents are raised to track the root cause of a Business Incident. Depending on the
impact, nature and scope of the incident the Problem Management process may be used.
However if the nature of the incident is seen as a low priority/a ‘one off the ‘Business as
usual’ approach may be taken’ i.e. the BIM process will suffice. What course is taken is a
matter of discussion and agreement between POL Finance, and Fujitsu MSU.

Where there are associated System Incidents and Business Incidents, their
relationship can be either:

© one to one; or
* one to many, respectively.

Incidents escalated through the Problem Management route will be reported at regular
intervals as Problems.

3.2 Incident Originators

It is envisaged that Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within
Fujitsu MSU and POL Finance:

© Fujitsu MSU for errors reported via the TPS report set

¢ POL Finance for any other reconciliation or settlement error discovered by POL
Finance that has not been reported by Fujitsu MSU

© Fujitsu SSC, for any system fault, file or transaction rejection which cannot be
repaired electronically or data base adjustment which is considered by Fujitsu
Services to have a reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office Ltd.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch raised calls to the HSD
will not generate Business Incidents. However calls from Post Office branches will be
monitored and if it is considered necessary by Fujitsu Services, difficulties reported to the
HSD, either directly or via the Post Office Ltd Network Business Support Centre (NBSC),
will be elevated to Business Incident status.

3.3 Generation of Business Incidents

In line with the generic incident management policy agreed between Fujitsu and Post Office
Ltd, Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if generated by POL Finance, as
appropriate, via the HSD. This ensures that the Business Incident is properly logged, enabling
Fujitsu MSU to ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system
fault can be rectified.

In all cases Fujitsu MSU will raise a ‘BIM’ report to log incidents. All such BIM reports will
have a unique identifier. This ID will mimic the Fujitsu PEAK reference however the BIM
report will always contain any other relevant references as required.

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the HSD when
generating a Business Incident to ensure the timescales for the resolution of
Business Incidents referred to in section 4.5.3 can be achieved. Achievement of
such timescales is dependent upon the following information being provided by POL
Finance when generating a Business Incident via the HSD:

e A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘*PATH040’ etc.

© Prefix all narrative with ‘THIS IS A BUSINESS INCIDENT FOR MSU, PLEASE
ROUTE THIS CALL TO EDSC ’

e A full description of the issue, i.e. particular FAD(s), particular date(s), product(s),
etc. The information should be of enough detail to allow Fujitsu MSU to progress the
incident and escalate if needed to the correct support teams

Where POL Finance raise a Business Incident which may require a large amount of supporting
information, summary detail only may be given to the HSD and the additional information sent
via e-mail to Fujitsu MSU. (A current contact list will be made available to POL Finance).

3.3.1 Powerhelp vs. Peak Incident logging

Since the associated delivery to Post Office Ltd of the DRS and TES tools it has become
apparent that not all incidents need to be reported to HSD (under PATH040) as outside
support is not always needed from Fujitsu MSU to aid in reconciliation of incidents. While all
such incidents are reported via the BIM process it has become apparent that it is not efficient
to raise a Powerhelp incident for the sake of obtaining a unique identifier when the BIM and
PEAK data bases provide the same uniqueness. A working agreement with Post Office Ltd

FUJITSU SERVICES

has already been agreed on this; the main criteria being an auditable unique identifier via the
BIM process.

If Fujitsu SSC involvement is needed the PEAK system allows attachment of evidence,
whereas Powerhelp only allows description via text.

This in no way prevents POL Finance from raising ‘PATH040’ incidents (via Powerhelp)
which will be reported in appropriate time scales using the unique reference.

All incidents will be reported using unique references, but will always be a PEAK however the
Powerhelp reference will be quoted if available.

3.4 Incident Reporting

3.4.1 BIM Reports / MER

The BIM system has been designed to report the progress to resolution of a Business Incident
to allow Post Office Ltd to complete an accurate reconciliation or settlement with their clients
For ease of identification and association with the corresponding HSD/ PEAK call, BIM
report references the unique PEAK reference.

3.4.1.1 Format and Content of BIM report / MER

A BIM Report will be issued for each Business Incident generated via the HSD or
the PEAK incident tracking system (depending on the route that the incident was
raised). As part of that BIM report, Fujitsu MSU will issue a MER for each error
associated with the relevant Business Incident where it is necessary.

BIM Reports / MER are designed to notify POL Finance of the detail required to
assist in the reconciliation or settlement process within POL Finance. They
communicate information concerning the resolution of the symptom of an underlying
cause, not the cause itself. Business Incident reporting to POL Finance will fall into
one of the following categories:

1. BIM Report (Standard)

This will be the standard BIM report as shown in Appendix 1 without the ‘Transaction
Details’ section completed. It will provide POL Finance with a brief description of each error
to the extent that each error can be identified.

2. BIM Report for a repaired error

This will be the standard BIM Report as shown in Appendix 1. However, the
‘Transaction Details’ section may be completed if considered necessary by Fujitsu
MSU. Full details of the repaired transaction ‘File’ will be documented providing an
explanation of each correction made.

3. BIM Report and MER

a TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management Ref: CS/PRO/I11
FUJITSU Version: 5,0
FUJITSU SERVICES
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 17/10/2005

This will be the standard BIM report as shown in Appendix 1. However, the ‘Transaction
Details’ section will be completed as a MER to describe each error associated with the
Business Incident, and specifying in a format suitable for POL Finance to complete a manual
reconciliation and settlement if required.

NB: A BIM report may contain more than one MER.

BIM reports / MER will not advise any detail as to the underlying ‘Cause’ of the problem if
this is a result of a software error etc. This information is supplied via the Problem
Management process.

3.4.1.2 Clearance Criteria & Charges Applicable to MER.

Fujitsu MSU anticipates that it will provide information concerning Business Incidents to POL
Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM Report / MER.
On a monthly basis, the MER spreadsheet is populated by Fujitsu MSU with details of
chargeable and non chargeable errors together with the appropriate supporting information
This is then forwarded to Post Office Ltd, Operations Control for approval. For the avoidance
of doubt, transactions or transaction corrections which are delivered by Fujitsu MSU to
POLFS via file transfer are NOT chargeable. Transactions or transaction repairs which are
delivered manually to POL Finance via a BIM report are chargeable as defined in section
3.4.1.3

A BIM Report is ‘Cleared’ when Fujitsu MSU has provided the information required to enable
full reconciliation to take place, ie. provide transaction detail, provide actions for POL
Finance to undertake to correct a customer’s bank account, etc.

Post Office Ltd Operations Control will agree with Fujitsu MSU on a monthly basis any
payments it considers are payable to Post Office Ltd (as compensation for Post Office Ltd
costs in dealing with MER).

3.4.1.3 MER Charges

To clarify, S80 brings about much simplification with chargeable errors. As the Cash Account
no longer exists, having been replaced by the Branch Trading Statement, the only remaining
chargeable aspect is in respect to individual transactions. These are only chargeable to Fujitsu
if they have been corrupted in some way when delivered through a fault in the Horizon system
or the related Fujitsu processes, i.e. an OBC issue where transactions are stranded when an
outlet is not closed correctly, with charges based upon the following criteria and applicable to
POLFS only and not POLMIS:

e £100 per transaction which can not be delivered to POLFS by electronic means and
this has been discovered before it was due to be sent to POLFS (i.e. it has not been
rejected by POLFS)

e £150 per transaction which can not be delivered to POLFS by electronic means and
this has been discovered after it has been sent to POLFS (i.e. it has been rejected by
POLFS)

FUJITSU SERVICES
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 17/10/2005

In cases where transactions are lost due to fire, flood, or Post Master interference Fujitsu will
not accept liability.

MER are delivered to Post Office Ltd Operations Control on a monthly basis for agreement by
10" working day of the following month. It is expected that in these exceptional cases that all
issues will be addressed on a case by case basis.

3.4.1.4 Report Distribution

Fujitsu MSU will distribute BIM reports / MER using the Fujitsu corporate mail
network. In the event that Fujitsu corporate mail system is unavailable, Fujitsu MSU
will discuss with POL Finance the appropriate means of information transfer.

3.4.2 Reporting Timescales

Fujitsu MSU will use reasonable endeavours to raise an initial BIM report relating to a new
Business Incident. This will be made available to POL Finance, on the same working day as
the Business Incident is generated via the HSD, or on the PEAK system where applicable. In
the event of the TPS Report Set not being available to Fujitsu Services in time to enable any
errors to be notified within this timescale, Fujitsu MSU will contact POL Finance to agree a
temporary extension to the timescale. This initial, incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify
POL Finance that a Business Incident has occurred and that the completed BIM report will be
provided to POL Finance within the agreed timescales.

Fujitsu MSU will use reasonable endeavours to ensure the final completed BIM report / MER
is cleared within five working days Service Level Target (SLT) from the date the Business
Incident was generated via the HSD, or the PEAK system.

If the BIM report / MER is not cleared, or Fujitsu MSU think it is unlikely to be cleared within
five working days, Fujitsu MSU shall immediately notify POL Finance and shall procure that
Fujitsu MSU Manager (or in his absence, his deputy) is made available to discuss with POL
Finance to discuss the delay within two working days of such notification.

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of a System Incident as the time taken to develop
a fix or correct erroneous reference data cannot be determined. Obviously however, Fujitsu
will give every System Incident the priority it deserves taking into account Post Office Ltd
requirement and would aim to deliver an initial analysis of the root cause within 5 working
days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action, within 10 working days. It is clear
that at all times the relationship between Incident Management and Problem Management is
clearly understood, and if need be escalations through Problem Management will happen to
hasten the rectification of the system incident.

3.4.3 Repairing Data

Where Fujitsu MSU corrects errors, ONE Business Incident will be raised to cover each error,
which has been corrected, or group of errors if they are related to each other. A BIM report
containing appropriate information will be issued relating to that error or group of errors.

FUJITSU SERVICES
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 17/10/2005

Where there is a need to correct errors, Fujitsu MSU may make corrective assumptions, based
upon the format and content of previous valid records of the same type, if no other detail is
available. For example, where a transaction mode is unknown, the mode used may be obtained
from a previous transaction of the same type. In such cases, Fujitsu MSU will promptly inform
POL Finance of the assumption within the working day that the assumption has been made.
POL Finance may wish to review and validate these assumptions on a case-by-case basis and it
should be noted that any assumptions made would not necessarily set a precedent.

3.5 Links to Problem Management

The processes highlighted within this document are not intended to replace the current agreed
Problem Management procedures, which will run side by side with the incident management
process, as has always been the case.

By way of example, “problems” may be raised by Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd in the
following scenarios:

© Where there is a trend of similar Business Incidents where there is no identifiable cause.
e Where a System Incident has been raised and the cause is unknown.

Problem management expands the scope of the incident management process
described in this document to include any wider issues, which must be dealt with in
order to rectify problems and to ensure that the associated Business and / or System
Incidents are not repeated.

A System Incident is generated by Fujitsu MSU to ensure the relevant code or fix etc. is
developed, tested and delivered to the live estate. However, resolution of problems which
arise as a result of that System Incident will cover any additional requirements of both parties
e.g. Operational Focus updates; briefings etc. and in many case the authority from Post Office
Ltd to proceed with a relevant fix.
