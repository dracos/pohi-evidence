Dear Sam,

Please find attached a submission for the attention of Minister Griffiths, kindly provided by UKGI,
concerning new NED appointments at Post Office Ltd.

Alex asked me to forward this on his behalf; as following consideration, and clearance, he is keen to
support proposals, and wishes to provide the Secretary of State with the memo attached as a cover
note for when this is considered.

Could you please let me know if the Minister is content for this to go to SoS, so we can proceed to
consulting Ministers? CC’ing UKGI.

Best wishes,
Henry
