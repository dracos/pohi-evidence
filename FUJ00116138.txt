Background

> Post Office Ltd was established as a part of Consignia plc in
October 2001

> 17500 Post Offices, 38K counters - the Uk’s largest retail network

> The Horizon project, historically run by ICL Pathway, brought automation to
every UK Post Office in the largest non military IT project ever undertaken in
Europe

> Post Office Ltd are currently suffering severe commercial losses as a result of
declining revenue streams (e.g. benefit payments)

> Dual role - Post Office as a community service (particularly in rural areas), Post
Office as a commercially driven organisation

> The Opportunity
> The current Horizon contract worth approximately £1bn, due to expire in 2005

> Post Office want to reduce IT costs now - prime opportunity to renegotiate the
current contract into something more attractive, which could include:
> Substantially increase current term beyond 2005
» Increase scope, potentially to include outsourcing of back office systems
» Renegotiate contract terms to simplify contract and service management
> Develop Strategic Partner role with Post Office - new era for Fujitsu Services

Customer Requirements

The biggest business driver in Post Office at present is to
reduce cost, in particular IT costs which are currently running
at £200M p.a., 16% of revenue

A more open approach to architecture - to increase flexibility
of solution and reduce time to market for new products

Ability to introduce 3rd party products more easily

Strategic collaboration with Escher - leading software supplier
in the Post Office market

Move to collaborative working - Fujitsu Services and Post
Office Ltd working more effectively together

I I Value Proposition

> Fujitsu Services will do :

> Reduce annual Horizon cost to Post Office by £30m (approx. 20%)
in 2002/2003, ways this could be achieved include:
> Restructuring finance by extending contract over a longer term
> Implementing more effective ways of working which reduce overheads
>» Implementing new SLAs that cost less
> Less burdensome terms and conditions
» Redesigning architecture to reduce operational cost (medium term)

> Fujitsu Services must implement a new contract with the customer
with broader scope of services, for example
> Ongoing operation and maintenance of the Horizon solution
> Incorporate Post Office Back Office System outsourcing
> Development of Banking business
> Possible technology refresh
> Joint architecture/programme management
> The value of the base contract is likely to be in the region of £600m
over 6-7 years

> This negotiation to conclude Heads of Agreement is due to be
completed in June 2002

> There is a need to reach understanding via Heads of Agreement
