Bug 28
Drop and Go Bug

Summary

e The Peak PC0260269' identified by the experts relates to an issue in branch involving a Drop
and Go transaction that was timing out in branch and, despite timing out and not appearing to
complete, being recorded as a successful transaction in the branch accounts.

e This particular instance of the issue involved the branch re-attempting the same Drop and Go
transaction, being a £100 mobile phone Top Up.

« The root cause was identified by ATOS as being a problem in with one of their Drop and Go
scripts.

e This was therefore a proper bug in Horizon, arising as a result of an issue with an ATOS script.

Background: 'APADC'

« AP-ADC = Automated Payment - Additional Data Capture ("APADC")

e APADC are a series of modular functions that are provided with the Horizon codeset.
Specifically, these functions allow control of the user interface with Horizon and enable
transaction designers to build the 'APADC' script, which contains a series of APADC functions to
capture the transaction data.

e For example: a 'NameLong' function displays a graphical user interface on Horizon to capture all
elements of a Name on a single screen, i.e. Title, Forename, Middle Initial, Surname. As such,
adding NameLong, along with other various functions, to a transaction script allows ATOS to
build complex transactions without requiring counter code changes by FJ.

Part 1: PC0260269 [F/1660.1]

« Dates:

o 05-Jul-2017: PC0260269" and KEL cardc235Q° opened as a result of the SPM
complaint relating to a duplicate Drop and Go transaction appearing in the branch
account.

o 05-Jul-2017: Analysis in the Peak (F/1660.1/2) confirms that:

1. only one £100 transaction made it to CDP system*

2. the nightly transaction file from Horizon contains two records, which suggests the
£100 may be charged/ deducted from the branch twice

3. the second transaction from the Horizon file matches the transaction in the CDP
system

transaction in the CDP system and that this generated an exception

o 05-Jul-2017: Counter log and message log extracts obtained by FJ (F/1660.1/4).

o 05-Jul-2017: FJ identify 2 potential causes:

1. the 'ADCScript-CDBalanceTopUP' script
2. auser error.

o 05-Jul-2017: Call passed to ATOS (as the Drop and Go scripts are supplied and
maintained by ATOS).

o 05-Jul-2017: Defect cause updated as being '42: Gen — Outside Program Control’. Fu
have confirmed that this means a fault outside of Fujitsu control, including external
websites, extemal networks etc, which aligns with the situation here as ATOS appear to
be responsible for the issue.>

o 05-Jul-2017: KEL updated to summarise the above and confirmation in the KEL that
any future calls should be routed to ATOS.

« What happened?

o The clerk initiated a Drop and Go transaction for £100 which failed due to timeouts, but
then a success message was displayed
o The clerk settled the transaction and handed the customer £100
The customer checked their balance and stated that the top up had not been processed
o The clerk performed another Drop and Go transaction that was successful
All of the above documented in KEL cardc235Q', extract below:

°

The clerk initiated a Drop and Go transaction for £100 which failed due to timeouts, but then a success message was
displayed. The clerk settled the transaction and the customer handed over £100. The customer checked the balance and
stated that the top up had not gone through, so the clerk then performed another Drop&Go transaction which was successful.
‘The customer has paid in £100 but the branch account has been debited by £200. Accenture verified that only the second
Drop&Go top up was successful

o Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the Accenture CDP system identified that
only one Top Up had been received by Accenture CDP but two were being shown in the
Horizon Batch Feed. The second Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction,
confirming the problem was with the first transaction.

« How was it spotted?

o The SPM reported the issue with the NBSC and in response Peak PC0260269” and KEL
cardc235Q° were raised.

« How was it fixed?
Branch 499323 TC:

Issue I APADC script What the script does Issue and how it was fixed
involved

1 Balance&TopUp I An APADC transaction script that The issue was the primary issue summarised
captures and transmits data when a I in PC0260269° and KEL cardc235Q” in that:
Customer wants to Top Up the

balance of a Drop and Go Account.

the customer was charged for the Top
Up

e despite being charged for the Top Up,
the Top UP was not being added to the
customer's account.

As per the Test Report, ATOS identified a
bug in the Balance&TopUp script that
incorrectly allowed the transaction to
progress after an unrecoverable timeout had
been identified — i.e. the transaction should
not have been completed.

As per the Test Report, this was resolved in
an updated version (6.12) of the
Balance&TopUp script.

2 OpenAccount An ADADC transaction script that The Test Report confirms ATOS identified
captures and transmits data when a I that the same issue as above in terms of the
Customer wants to open a Drop and I transaction being able to progress was

Go Account. As part of the Account I present in the OpenAccount script.

Opening
As per the Test Report, this issue was
resolved in an updated version (6.11) of the
OpenAccount script.

¢ Possible conclusions:

o There was no long-term financial impact on branch 499323 as a corrective TC was
issued by Post Office.

co Any repeat instances of the issue would involve a duplicate transaction, which would be
easy for the SPM to identify in the branch accounts.

e Impact on Subpostmasters?
o The customer paid £100, but the branch account was debited £200, resulting in a £100
shortfall to the branch.
o Branch received a TC on 29 June in the sum of £100 which corrected the shortfall.
o There was therefore no long-term financial impact on the affected branch.
« Notes for Counsel

o Coyne in JS2 [D1/2/25-26] correctly summarises that the customer was credited with
£100 but the branch was debited with £200.

° F/1660.1
‘© F/1660

‘AC_155044487_1 3
POL00132736
POL00132736

This is easily responded to as the branch received a TC credit for the £100 shortfall and
as such there was no lasting financial impact to the branch account.

Dr Worden in JS2 [D1/2/25-26] notes that (1) this would have been very visible on the
counter and (2) that the script issue would have been easily fixed.

Dr Worden's summary appears accurate as it is clear the SPM identified the issue and
reported it and ATOS were able to fix the issue.

Note, however, that FJ have identified a further instance of the issue (dealt with
separately below). This further instance relates to a different ADADC script, which was
not fixed as part of the above process. ATOS have confirmed that the original author of
the Drop and Go transaction scripts, including the ADADC scripts, was a Post Office
business analyst who has subsequently left the business. ATOS have also confirmed
that there is no documentation that describes the different ADADC scripts full
functionality. This indicates that, while this was a simple script issue, there is an
argument to suggest that there is a lack of knowledge within ATOS concerning the
ADADC scripts, as one script that should have been fixed was not.

Part 2: Single further instance of the Drop and Go Bug

°

FJ identified a further similar instance of KEL cardc235Q in PC0273234" from August
2018, which implied that there was some sort of issue with the April 2018 fix described
above.

ATOS have undertaken review and confirm that this Peak relates to a different Drop
and Go Function and script entirely, namely: the APADC CountMails script.

This was investigated by ATOS and a fix to the CountMails script issues in September
2018.

« Dates

e Mails transaction
€ ATOS have confirmed that
they were unaware that the
CountMails script also offered
the ability to Top Up. For
completeness, ATOS have
confirmed that the original
author of the Drop and Go
transaction scripts, including the
CountMails script, was a Post
Office business analyst who has
subsequently left the business.
ATOS have also confirmed that
there is no documentation that
would have identified that the
CountMails script also had the
ability to Top Up.

In terms of the functionality of the
CountMails script, ATOS have
confirmed that the ‘Count Mails’
transaction was intended to be a
quick transaction for the clerks to
perform in branch and take receipt
of a number of Drop and Go items at
the same time, registering the
number of items received and
issuing a receipt to the customer for
the number of items. The clerk
would then use a separate
transaction (called 'Start Mails') to
process the items individually after
the Customer had left the office —
i.e. at a quiet moment when there
were no other customers are present
in the branch. It is only at the point
of processing the individual mails
items that a clerk would identify
whether there was sufficient balance
on the account to process the items.
It would therefore be unusual for a
customer to request a Top Up (the
second functionality described
above) as part of the Count Mails
process as they would need to have
prior knowledge of their account
balance before performing the Count
Mails process to know that a Top Up
would be needed in order to process
all of the items.

As per the embedded email chain below, the
incident was received by ATOS on 13 August
and a script fix deployed to live one month
later on 13 September 2018. The email chain
confirms that the updated script was produced
on 12 September 2018. ATOS have
subsequently confirmed that the fix was
processed under RADC/1809/005, the
Business Change Reference that ATOS
Information Services Team and Fujitsu use
when sharing reference data between them.
In this case, we understand the reference
data tool the form of an excel spreadsheet:
38779 CDCountMailV6.13, which has a
Worksheet for each step within the
CountMails APADC script.
