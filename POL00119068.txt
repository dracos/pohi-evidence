CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0685

Graham,
Further to my telephone call on the 4® May.

The 21* May is now not convenient to the Defence Solicitors. The case has therefore
been taken out of the list and is now listed for Mention on the 25" May. Counsel is
already in Winchester on that date. I would be grateful if you could attend to assist
Counsel.

I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from the Defence Solicitors dated 3° May. I
would be grateful if you could let me have your views regarding the contents.
