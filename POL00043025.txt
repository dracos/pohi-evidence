Please can you confirm as a matter of urgency (this morning) how long you believe it will take to extract the KELs?
We are expecting questions from the Claimants / the Court about this and need to be prepared to answer them
immediately.

Thank you

Andy

Further to the below and our discussion yesterday, I understand that to extract the previous versions of the current or
deprecated KELS as HTML files it would be necessary to produce a new script. Please could Fujitsu proceed with
producing this script, but not run the script until we provide further confirmation to do so?

If you could let me know and ETA for this script being ready it would be much appreciated.

Many thanks
Amy

Lucy,

This part: “/t/he KEL only contains the current database entries” — I’m not completely clear what that is
intended to mean, but it may be clarified by the following:

This is correct: “is constantly updated and so the current version will not necessarily reflect the version that
was in place at the relevant time”

The second sentence is not correct: “The previous entries / versions of the current entries are no longer
available".

You may recall that there are three status categories of KEL: current, deprecated and deleted. For those that
are current or deprecated, they have been updated in such a way that previous content is not permanently
overwritten, but instead a new version is created, with the previous versions being retained and accessible.
For those that have been deleted, only the last version at the point of deletion has been retained.

Matthew,

Post Office is seeking to quote from its Electronic Documents Questionnaire submitted back in 2017. It is seeking to
rely on the following quote in relation to KELs:

"(t]he KEL only contains the current database entries and is constantly updated and so the current version
will not necessarily reflect the version that was in place at the relevant time. The previous entries / versions
of the current entries are no longer available".

Can you confirm that this is definitely the correct position (i.e. that previous entries are no longer available)? We need
to respond to Freeths by 10am tomorrow, so confirmation ASAP would be appreciated.

Kind regards,

Lucy
