Thanks. I'm starting to get initial comments from Counsel. I'll collate these together and get a codified set of
responses to you by Sunday evening.

If you need anything before then, please do feel free to call. I'm available all weekend.

I'll need to brief GE on Monday morning and probably have an urgent board meeting shortly after.

Will do Ben.

When do you need to brief Al / the board? If there is a set deadline it will help me press Counsel for their
input. I fully understand that it is urgent in any event.

Thanks both - we will need to explain the CEO and the Board why we received advice that is again contrary to
the outcome. Can we summarise the CoA conclusions and what was it that caused there to be a different
conclusion from the advice that was given. I am concerned that credibility is being lost so let’s be clear on how
this is to be positioned.

ccling Ben and me so that they can see we have it and can be copied in on anything they may email back.

Please find attached the Court of Appeal's decision refusing permission to appeal on the recusal application.

I have sent this to Counsel (Lord Grabiner and David Cavender) for advice on next steps but suspect the
answer is that there is no further action possible.

I will relay Counsel's views as soon as received.
Sorry to drop this on you at the start of weekend.

Kind regards
Andy
