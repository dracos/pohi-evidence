Subject: RE: Horizon: Review and Mediation Scheme

Hi Martin

Yes a telephone catch up this afternoon would be helpful, then let's look at setting up a meeting in
wic 4 November.

Hi Angela

I need to submit a draft reply to the Stephen Mosley letter about Martin Griffiths to Jo Swinson (which
had the Alan Bates email as an attachment) today. Helpful therefore to have, if only as background,
a chat about POL/Bates contacts over this tragic case sometime during the day.

Regards

Mike

Hi Mike - haven't forgotten about this, but it was proving difficult to line up diaries. Next week isn't
good either because of half term. We could do a telephone update tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon
followed by a further meeting perhaps in w/c 4 November?

Best wishes, Martin

Guess we are running out of time for this week - particularly as I am away from
the office Thu, Fri and Mon. Could we look at diaries for next week for

Tue onwards?

Hi Mike

We have now received 46 applications from sub-postmasters for the mediation
scheme since it was opened at the end of August. 37 of the application have been
accepted on to the scheme and we are now awaiting full submissions from the sub-
postmasters in question before proceeding to the next stage. The remainder
require additional information or are in legal processes which exclude them from
joining at this time. The application closure date is the 18" November.

As discussed with Will last week, we are in the final stages of appointing Sir Anthony
Hooper as the independent chair and expect to have him in place by the end of
October.

We should probably have a longer catch-up on the mediation scheme and the wider
project in the next week or so.

Thanks,
Martin

Mike

It would be helpful to have, for background purposes and possible
enquires from Jo (we have a couple of Horizon related Minster's cases
in the pipeline), some information on the progress of the Mediation
scheme - numbers of cases submitted for review, numbers accepted,
numbers of mediations that have so far taken place (and with what
result/success). And has an independent Chair appointment been
made?

Regards

Mike
