The Chairman welcomed David Cavender QC and Andy Parsons from Womble Bond
Dickinson to the meeting.

David Cavender provided an update on the case. We had lost our application to limit
the evidence being presented at the trial to the common issues. This judgement was
discussed and it was noted that during the trial we would politely but persistently I
challenge the claimants’ cases where there were inaccuracies or contradictions. I
Andy Parsons provided an update on the second trial on the Horizon system. The I
claimants’ IT expert had found that Horizon was not a robust system but this
assessment was founded on identifying a large number of small problems with the
system which our expert was confident could be rebuffed.
