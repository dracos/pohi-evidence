Hi Penny,

As per our conversation. Please can we make Blackpool Road POLTD/1112/0203
a priority, as this has been requested for a Crown Court trail which is now

due to commence within a few weeks. Our legal team have requested

production of these documents as they are an integral part of the
prosecution case assisting to corroborate and prove criminal conduct.

Many thanks.

Hi Jayne / Andy,

Please see emails below - this is a request for Horizon data (advised to

get by Cartwright king). The reply back from Fujitsu is that Horizon
Integrity cases are taking priority I understand importance of the ongoing

FUJ00225012
FUJ00225012
investigation in relation to Horizon Integrity but without the data this
case could be lost or dropped.

Blackpool Road POLTD/1112/0203 - this is fraud of around 6k involving 29
DVLA transactions.

Blackpool Road case is due in court on the 28th February. A request for
the full 3 months Horizon data was submitted on the 28th December 2012
because we require to address certain issues raised in the defence
statement in relation to the counter position where the defendant served
and to prove that no one else has served in the defendant's stock unit.
Also it will address an issue around shared passwords which the defence is
claiming and the data will show what other members of staff were doing
while the fraudulent transactions were entered on horizon by the defendant.

Our solicitors have already written to the court to extend the deadline for
further disclosure to the 25th January so we can present the Horizon data,
the data has to be presented to the court and the defence by this date.

Regards
Andrew

Hi Maureen

Unfortunately I don't.

We have 4 more outlets for the Horizon Integrity Audit to return, my
assumption is that these take priority. I've sent a note to Jayne for

confirmation but unless she says otherwise we are working on these.

We can talk the latter part of next week and I can give you an estimated
timeframe, if that helps.

Kind regards
Penny
