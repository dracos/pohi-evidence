Jeremy, John

In the frantic activity to agree the frequency of the system instability problem I find myself
wondering where we got to in determining the so called ‘industry standards’. As you know - we
have access to performance stats for our legacy systems which gives us but one perspective
when attempting to set performance targets. I sense however this is a weak comparison given
different technology solutions etc

Did we (if so what was the outcome?), or, are we still pursuing any other comparable standards
via iT or any where else to give another more credible dimension to the target setting ?

Ruth
