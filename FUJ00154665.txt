Subject: RE: Requests for data and calls
Penny,
Iam not saying that you are confused about the difference between an ad-hoc request, an ARQ and a support call - am saying that the
customer is either confused about the difference, or else is making a deliberate attempt to avoid the costs of raising ARQs or ad-hoc data

requests by raising these as support calls.

Bottom lines for S'

* on these problems is as follows :

a) If itis believed that there is a system problem which has caused discrepancies, then we will investigate as normal... this includes the
calls passed over yesterday although none of these calls says that they believe that there is a FS system problem, all of them actually indicate
that there is a mismatch in the figures in POLFS, cause unknown.

b) If it is believed that POL are using the support process as a means of avoiding ARQ or ad-hoc data request costs. Then the calls
should be referred back to POL (by Liz 2) requesting payment.

c) If there is any hint of litigation, then we wont deal with the calls as support calls, but will assist the security team in their analysis.

There is a significant difference in the system now which is leading to this sort of call, and why there needs to be a more robust application of
the process - In the past, reconciliation on the system was done in two different streams within the FS domain - If there was a reconciliation
issue, or a mismatch in the figures, then it had to be in our domain somewhere (even if it was caused by PM user-error).

The new system means that much of the reconciliation and auditing figures are produced by POLFS, which is not in the FS domain, is a POL
system and is managed for them by PRISM.

Regards
Mik
