Richard,

Fujitsu use of ddl to partition databases is a valid design principle. However, in the light of operational issues we agreed
with Oracle to make changes to remove the use of ddl to partition to reduce the fragmentation currently being observed in
the shared pool. We do not accept that this can be a root cause of the LCK issue because:-

1. It is our understanding that the LCK issue is triggered after a substantial amount of shared pool has been taken up
through fragmentation. We believe it is some combination of the amount of shared pool being taken up and the degree of
fragmentation that creates the conditions in which the LCK issue can occur

2. It is our understanding that the way our application currently works means that we cause shared pool to become
fragmented more quickly than will be the case when we implement improvements. Once we implement the changes to our
application the shared pool will still be taken up by fragmentation over a longer period of time; the conditions in which the
LCK issue can be triggered will still arise, albeit less frequently.

Our view is that the root cause of the LCK issue is either
a. a problem in the LCK process itself which means that it cannot clear up the fragmentation quickly enough, or
b. an architectural problem within Oracle which means that the LCK process is called at the wrong time (i.e. too late),

meaning that it has no chance of clearing up the fragmentation without causing the system to hang.

Rgds, Jim Singh
