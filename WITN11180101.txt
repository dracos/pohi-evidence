Andrew

lam surprised that you have been able to from a fully rounded opinion, sufficient to make some
of the very serious accusations in your prior communications without carrying out a full and
detailed review of the data?

The amount of distress and worry and this has caused me since your email earlier this week has
been significant.

I have been available on the phone (both mobile and landline) on which I regularly receive calls
from all manner of departments in Post Office every single day...so what number they have been
calling I have no idea! As you can see from our communications so far — when I am contacted, I
deal with things - rapidly.

I would be delighted to discuss the data with the PAST team once it is provided and I have had
sufficient time to review it and would appreciate your facilitation of this.

Elliot

Dear Elliot,

I have now had an opportunity to speak with the PAST, they will generate an Excel version of the
44 page Account Statement dated 20 February 2023 to which you refer, the spreadsheet will be
broken down by branch and in date order. PAST will provide commentary for transaction
corrections (TCs), however, due to the number of outstanding TCs since 2019 this is no small ask
and will take sometime to collate. I will be in touch again once I have received the document
from the team.

Earlier this afternoon I forwarded to you a copy of the emails previously sent to you by PAST,
please can you acknowledge receipt?

I have reattached the Jpeg Screenshot of the Partnership Portal. I am advised that PAST stopped
sending Account Statements to your email address in September 2022 and
started placing Account Statements in the Partnership Portal for you to access. I have also
spoken to John Jenkinson who advises me that he has advised you on many occasions over the
last 4 years how you can access the portal and the information that is located in there.

In the meantime, I understand from PAST that they have been trying since August 2021 to speak
with you on the phone to discuss the accruing balance on the account and how you propose to
address the same. If you are now willing to speak with PAST I would be very happy to facilitate
such a call?

Yours sincerely,

Andrew,

As you must have fully reviewed and collated this data in order to form your review so far, I
would assume this must be something you have to hand.

It will surely be quicker for us both for you to provide me your working documents (which I
assume must contain the data I have requested) and not delay my investigation than me start
from scratch with another department?

Regards
Elliot

Good Afternoon Elliott,

Account statements and letters were sent to!_ I can confirm that I have a
copy of each email which I will access in a few moments and will forward onto you.

Can I respectfully suggest that you address the rest of your requests below to the Post Master
Support Team (PAST) as per the letters/emails sent to you at the time of the occurrence by PAST
in which they offered to work with you to understand the discrepancy.

Yours sincerely,

Andy,
I have begun reviewing the documents you have sent.
To begin, can you supply the 44 page PDF statement in excel format, broken down by branch so

we can review this in a format that enables us to look at data properly. The document you have
provided is not in date order, and contains no explanation or notes for each line.
WITN11180101
WITN11180101

Please provide line detail including the reason for each TC or BD (and the TP in which is occurred)
so that this can be properly reviewed. Please include original transaction data.

Additionally the attached file cannot be accessed — please provide access to where file is stored,
or actual jpg copy.

Please also provide the email address that the alleged emails were sent from, and the precise
time and date so our email records can be reviewed for them.

Please provide access details for the “partnership portal” referred to in John’s letter — as I am not
aware of this site or how access to it.

Thank you for your assistance,

Elliot
