Dear Mark,

Russell, Mark - UKGI!,
Manson, Justin - UKGI
Post Office

Just to let you know that this morning Tim Parker could not have been more positive about Richard Callard
and his performance as a NED at POL. He said he managed the difficult balance as NED of a unitary Board
with his role at UKGI giving appropriate challenge and advocacy. Do pass on to Richard, whose email I

don't have.

with best wishes

Robert
