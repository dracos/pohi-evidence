My sincerest apologies, for some reason I did not receive Tom or your emails ! Let me attempt to recover the delay asap.
With regards to the software upgrades/architecture documents and error logs requirements, these may be with Atos
however most likely Fujitsu being their internal records/MI. Is it appropriate I request these from Fujitsu ? Not sure what
with the sensitive nature.

Babu - Please can you confirm you are available today to attempt to source the practices /policy and Operations Manual
documents ?

Thanks

FYI below. We've been chasing Andy Garner (who I think is in your team) for information on the Horizon Operations
Manual. We've not had a reply and this is now urgent. Please could you give Andy a nudge or let us know if there is
someone else who might be able to help with this.

Thanks

Good morning Andy

I just wanted to send you an email to make sure you got the below, and to check that everything is in order.
We are sending the wider points for approval to Legal today — but I suspect we will need to send this to follow.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Good morning Andy
I have been given your contact details by Shirley Hailstones.

Shirley thought that you might be best placed to help us locate certain documents that we have been asked to disclose
in the Horizon dispute.

We will be taking a view on what to disclose, but as a first step we also need to work out what we have and where. I
POL00408698
POL00408698

include a small table of documents below, and I would be grateful for any guidance/assistance you can provide for
each.

It may also be useful to have a quick call so I can give you some background to this, and to give us a chance to talk
through the requests. Would you be free for a chat today?

We have an ongoing central dialog with Fujitsu relating to the dispute — if we need to ask Fujitsu for any of these

documents please could you list the documents for us to request (rather than requesting them yourself)?

No. I Document sought by the other side

Comment / request

1 Documents containing non-contractual
understandings, practices, policies etc relating
to Post Office's relationship with Fujitsu and
Fujitsu's performance (Horizon specific)

We consider that this request is too wide.
However, please could you let us know if you
have a single location where you store
information of this type (that would be easily
accessible)?

3 Schedule of Horizon updates, modifications
and software versions since 1999 (including
details of what the updates fixed)

We do not anticipate that this documents exists,
but is there any document showing the various
revisions to Horizon and setting out dates for the
same?

4 Schedule of the software architecture since
1999

We do not know precisely what they are looking
for here. We therefore intend to reject the
request on this basis but, before doing so, I
wanted to make sure that you agreed. Are you
aware of any such schedule?

5 The "known error log" kept by Fujitsu and any
correspondence relating to the same

We are not aware of this document (or whether it
exists). Do you know of a "known error log" and,
if so are you able to provide us with a copy?

Mark Underwood is assisting with a similar exercise for different documents. I have copied Mark to this email on the

off-chance that he finds any of the above documents whilst carrying out his own searches.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards

Tom
