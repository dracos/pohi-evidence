3.1 I MB presented the risk report.
He explained the report was taken from the risks presented in Archer, and that his team would be
meeting GE members/risk associates monthly to review departmental risks going forwards. An updated
risk appetite statement (not updated since 2016) would be presented to the RCC, ARC and Board for
formal sign-off in November, once reviewed against POL’s new purpose (communicated to POL 8/9/20).

Tab 2.1 Minutes (10 September 2020)

2.1

3.2. I He advised that the team had seen increased levels of engagement across the Group due to individual
business units being more aware as the first line of defence, however risk articulation (being clear on the
cause, event and impact of risk), alignment (ensuring risks are managed through Archer as a single
source) and RAG ratings (to ensure they reflect Group standards) are areas for address.

3.3 I The Committee noted that there are 473 risks in the group (listed on Archer) with the following key
enterprise risks:

* Commercial - POL not an attractive business proposition due to complex/confusing products,
new products considered cost ineffective and difficult to scale.
© Covid-19 — the risk to business employees/postmasters and the business remain, particularly in
light of reduced footfall/trading on the high street.
* Financial - concern that funding is insufficient and costs uncontrolled in the short/medium/long
term leading to the inability to deliver strategic objectives.
© Legal — POL unable to comply with legislative and regulatory changes, resulting in fines, lost
revenue, reputational and customer damage. It was noted that legal and regulatory updates
would be provided to RCC to avoid this.
The Committee requested further explanations be provided on the types of risks presented and advised
that some risks had incorrect GE owners for example, AC was listed as risk owner for COVID.

MB advised this would be reviewed with GE members.

Compliance

3.4 I JH presented the compliance report with the following points noted.

Telecoms: JH reported that the regulator had agreed to stop fortnightly reporting following strong call
centre performance during the COVID pandemic.

3.5 I Fairness: A meeting is planned shortly with NR, Meredith Sharples and Ofcom regarding POL’s
performance against the regulator’s Farness Commitments (however JH questioned the need for NR to
attend). The team is working on ways to reduce the number of ‘vulnerable clients’ and plans are to be
presented to the regulator ahead of the meeting.

Additionally, whilst not in breach with the regulator, the Telco team will be sending out Annual Best Tariff
Notifications (required to be sent before 14 February 2021) to customers who have been out of contract
for more than a year and have not received an End of Contract Notification. A rise in customer calls and
complaints is expected as customers query why their current price is higher than the new offers
presented in their communications.

3.6 I GLO/Freedom of Information Requests/GDPR: the team remains stretched responding to Historic
Shortfall Scheme and related/linked FOI requests (186 open requests). Following receipt of 41 FOI I Action:
enquiries considered vexatious from one journalist, 31,000 boxes of data (previously unknown) have now I JH
been identified in storage. These are being reviewed by legal, HSF and Peters and Peters and a separate
paper for ARC will be prepared regarding this issue.

The Committee recognised the need for improved data retention/management training across the group
and in the retail network.

3.7. I Schrems II case and Privacy Shield: the team is monitoring the implications for POL from Schrems Il.
There is the potential that POL will have to update its standard contractual clauses within its contracts
where personal data is stored outside of the EEA. JH remarked this was an industry wide issue and which
the team would continue to monitor.

3.8 I Financial Crime: there continues to be a large increase in suspicious activities reports during lockdown.

2.1

The team is working closely with the banks to understand the reasons for the continued spike. This
remains a watching brief.

Internal Audit
3.9 I JApresented the IA report.

Good progress has been made with the 2020/2021 IA programme with seven reviews (five in POL, two in
PO!) completed since the last ARC meeting in July, including a review of the Belfast exit programme.

JA remarked there were no contentious issues to report and that the IA plan for 2020/21 would be
reviewed against POL’s new purpose.

3.10 I The Committee noted the following audits have been reviewed since the last ARC meeting (27/7/20):
* GLO Historical Shortfall Scheme -Data Validation

Maintain Minimum Control Standards during Covid-19 (needs improvement)

RMPP (DB Pension Scheme) -Data Errors (Final Draft Report) (not rated, lessons learned)
Health & Safety Response to Covid-19 (Final Draft Report) (needs improvement)

Belfast Exit Programme Assurance -Phase 1 -Interim Report.

ee ee

JA reported there are three overdue actions which the team is following up. The Committee noted the
need for management to respond to audit actions and take responsibility for completing their actions.

The Risk, Compliance and Audit paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

4. Pensions Assurance
4.1_I LCand MC presented the Pensions Assurance paper.
42 I LC reported that since the last meeting, meetings have been held with the unions (who are keen to be
actively involved in decisions related to claw back and reductions) and the Pensions Trustees. An Internal
Audit has identified the following lessons learned:

© The 2014 Robin Agreement was not effectively implemented.

* The implementation of success factors in 2018 was to tight deadlines due to licences expiring.

* There were insufficient controls in POL and RMPP to identify the errors that arose.

4.3 I Work to quantify the errors is expected to be completed by the mid-October September and
communication with the Pension Trustees remains aligned. Annual Benefit Statements (ABS) for RMPPP
members will be delayed and a holding statement to explain the delay sent to affected members
(expected to be issued on or about 21 September 2020).

4.4. I In view of the potential for leak, and the fact that pension statements have been delayed for a second I Action:
successive year, LC advised that she had spoken to the Chair of ARC who had provided approval for a I LC/MC
report to be made to the regulators ahead of ARC. The Committee requested a timetable and proposed
quantum ahead of the ARC meeting, but noted that LC was due to meet the Chair of ARC separately to
discuss this issue.

The Pensions Assurance paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

5. _I DeepDive: Successfactors

5.1 _I LC, DJ and SR presented the deepdive.

5.2 I LC reminded the Committee this was an outstanding request from the ARC - on whether the product was
suitable for POL and that POL was making best use of the product. She had been in discussion with the
Chair of ARC to discuss her findings and provide comfort to any risks.

SR reported the product was considered a world leading system, but noted it was only as good as the
design and implementation when initially installed/developed - implementation was challenging and the
product has not been fully utilised.

5.4

A review by Deloitte on Successfactors and the HR processes identified 51 new opportunities to improve
the integrity of the system as well as functionality, connectivity, governance and reporting. Of the (See
51 opportunities, 21 ‘quick wins’ were identified which can be delivered relatively easily with minimal
cost. 22 opportunities were identified as ‘Priority’ based on value add and these have been ‘combined’
and worked up into 14 ‘prioritised opportunities’.

Additionally, a HR Services Director has been brought on-board to focus on developing the HRSC and HR
Service Delivery Model.

5.5

The Committee noted the developments but recommended that consideration should be given to
whether HR (particularly Payroll) could be outsourced; and that the report should clearly highlight the
complexity of having differing types of pay within POL.

The Deepdive Successfactors presentation was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

PCI-DSS and Cyber Security Update

PCI-DSS Programme Update

61

6.2

RW presented the PCI-DSS update and reported the following:

P2PE workstream (which encrypts retail and banking transactions from the Pin Entry Device (PED) to a
PCI compliant zone in Ingenico before onward processing to Global Payments (retail transactions) or
VocaLink (banking transactions): this remains on track to deliver per plan the Vocalink accreditation of the
retail & banking software and is followed by a final round of testing and branch piloting activity to be
completed by March 2021 (also on track).

Once pilot activity is completed, the solution will be progressively rolled out across all branches with a full
rollout and formal independent QSA accreditation being completed by June 2021. The team continues to
investigate options to improve the velocity of the roll-out phase timelines.

The TOM workstream (which addresses use of PCI data by POL in processes outside of the transactions
‘occurring at the PED) has identified seven areas where changes to products and processes are required to
achieve PCI compliance.

The activity required to address each of these areas has been planned and the team is working with
suppliers to achieve the required remediation.

The following key updates since the last meeting were noted:

‘* Fujitsu and Ingenico have completed the second banking key milestone: a balance enquiry, and the
banking solution is on track to complete to plan.

* Delivery of the payment solution has slipped by three weeks due to issues with the Global Payments
test environment. Accreditation of the retail payment solution is now scheduled to complete in
October (versus September). As this is not on the critical path there is no impact to the end to end
plan.

* Additional changes have been identified and the project team is working with the business to
understand criticality and potential workarounds. Fujitsu and Ingenico are also impact assessing the
changes in order that these can be delivered in future releases of the software.

* Finances: We are currently tracking within the 2% tolerance on the £15.8m approved at board.
However, some new risks have been identified that may need additional funds.

High Level Design now v2.4 has been updated with further TOM solutions.

Although JS noted the slippage with the delivery of the payment solution, he remained confident all
timelines and plans would be met on deadline.

The Committee requested key milestones (including contractual milestones) be clearly highlighted in the
paper for ARC.

The PCI-DSS Programme Update was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

Cyber Security

64

Ti presented the Cyber Security update.

Cyber Security Maturity: Cyber security remains a key focus for the team. Since the last ARC meeting,
business and IT strategies have been developing at pace and the team has adopted the following
principles for the 2020/21 cyber programme:

1. Deliver maturity increases where there is greatest value for lowest cost including Cyber Strategy and
Policy developments plus other areas where we are making process-related changes.

2. Align as much as possible of the major cost items with delivery from other IT projects such as EUC,
Belfast Exit where we will gain the capability as part of these projects.

3. Defer the remainder of the higher cost items for maturity increase.

4. Focus on security activities to enable the business such as those around SPM and Belfast Exit.

65

Several capabilities (recommendations in the Deloitte Maturity assessments) have been deferred until
beyond the end of FY2021. These include:

1. DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Phase 3 (Rule Enforcement) - DLP Phase 2 (analysis and pre enforcement
activities) is still proceeding in 2020, and while full DLP maturity takes an average 2 years to achieve,
deferring phase 3 until 2021 will add a further 6 months at a minimum to implementation timeline.

2. Network Access Control (NAC) ~ providing strong defences against unauthorised devices connecting

to our network due to cost.

SOC Forensics — some of this capability will be provided by the GLO IT forensics team.

Firewall attestation capability enhancements enabling clear resolution of firewall rule issues.

Identity and Access Management automation.

SOC Room — unlikely to be needed for 6-12 months

Web Proxy enhancements - similar capability being developed under the EUC project.

Novae

Additionally, the Central risk team is reviewing cyber risk appetite statements considering COVID working
practices, the relaxation of certain controls for extensive remote work practices and the reduction in
capex. Changes in risk appetite will result in changes to target maturity of cyber capabilities.

6.6

Covid-19: ransomware attacks continue during Covid and Deloitte are reviewing the team’s readiness for
such an attack.

The Committee noted that a major cyber security breach test would be completed in late 2020/early
2021, along with tower testing in October/November and a red team exercise.

Joiners Movers Leavers (JML)

67

68

T presented the JML report.

JML remains a key focus for the team, the biggest issue remains the different types of leaver (standard,
extraordinary ie. those who receive a settlement, rapid i.e. disciplinary issue, and health related) and the
associated tasks for each. Additionally contractual and leaving dates may differ taking into consideration
leave taken during a notice period.

TJ advised that an exercise for leavers completed during covid identified that IT access for all leavers was

removed on time, the HR leaving process was in all cases started on time and physical access and payroll
were also terminated correctly for these leavers.

However areas for improvement include the process for return of laptops and other kit, some leavers had
deleted and downloaded confidential data, and the cleanliness of data in HR and IT systems.

69

Two new responsibilities for JML will be introduced: an IT System Platform Owner (SPO) who will be
responsible for the IT elements of a platform; and a Business Data Owner (BDO) from the owning business
who will be accountable for the data in each system. Monthly reports on leavers will be provided to GE.

The Committee noted the progress made and requested these be clearly articulated to ARC.

The Cyber Security Update and JML report was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

Insurance Renewal 2020/21

MD and AB (Locktons) presented the Insurance Renewal update.

He reported that the renewal date is 1 November but given timings of the ARC meetings and the
timetable for renewal (insurers will not give terms outside 30 days from renewal), final terms cannot be
provided at this time, Delegated authority would be sought for the CEO and CFO to sign off the insurance
renewal.

As Locktons were procured compliantly (appointed initially for a 3 year term in 2015, extended for three
further 12 month terms), legal and procurement agreed that an OJEU process for insurance renewal was
not required. It was noted that Loctons are incentivised to keep POL’s costs down.

74a

‘AB explained the 2019 renewal had seen difficult market conditions for crime and D&O lines and that
premiums in 2019 had increased significantly to £1.6 million. Additionally POL had purchased further
cyber coverage to mitigate against the increased volume of cyber-attacks.

It was expected that premiums would increase again this year, due to challenging crime and D&O markets
and concerns over COVID claims and whether appropriate coverage is in place. Consideration should be

given as to whether to buy infectious disease coverage under Business Interruption.

The Committee requested that all avenues be explored to reduce the premiums, particularly as working
conditions this year had significantly changed.

The Insurance Renewal Programme paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

Law & Trends

SIG presented the Law Trends update.

Although noting five matters (listed below) for the Committees’ attention, the Committee discussed the
impact of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the Act) to POL.

SIG advised the Act had been fast tracked due to Covid and the potential of insolvency of suppliers. Most
relevant to POL, is the wide-ranging prohibition on the operation of termination clauses in contracts for
the supply of goods and/or services where the counterparty enters a relevant insolvency process. The
new provisions would also prevent POL (as a supplier) from doing ‘any other thing’ (e.g. changing
payment terms) where the client has entered into a relevant restructuring or insolvency process.

However, POL could terminate a contract where a breach occurs after the insolvency procedure had

started.

Certain exclusions apply e.g.to financial contracts. The Legal team are analysing excluded contracts . They
are also conducting a review of key supplier contracts to identify those with narrowly drafted termination
clauses where it might be prudent to monitor the financial health of the counterparty. Templates such as
P- Suite documents, will be reviewed and updated accordingly.

8.2 I The following four matters were noted but not discussed in detail:
1. Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) - Schrems Il Decision.
2. Ofcom Consultation — Implementing the new European Electronic Communications Code.
3. Online Platform Regulations.
4. HM Treasury consultation on new economic crime levy.

The Law & Trends paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

9. __I Bi-Annual Legal Risk Review (Non GLO/Starling)

9.1 I SIG presented the Bi-Annual Legal Risk Review.

9.2 I She reported on the following key legal risks:

* Contract Management ~ there are differing levels of expertise and management of contracts across
the Group, specifically understanding the obligations of each party and the impact on POL. The Legal
team has developed a contract management framework to improve standards required, and training
will be provided to the business.

Additional training to the legal team will be provided by external legal providers to improve
knowledge/expertise, and an updated Procurement policy has been drafted for ARC for approval.
The development of Web3 (contract management system) would ensure all contracts were centrally
recorded and had named account owners.

AC recommended the contract management process be automised as much as possible and
suggested SIG discuss with TL the financial controls management system (Traction) to use as a
template.

‘* Non-Compliance with Regulatory requirements and Principles - there are varying levels of expertise
across the Group regarding POL’s regulatory obligations where activity is outsourced but not
responsibility. Controls and accountabilities being mapped out by Compliance along with a review of
policies is in place.

9.3 BF noted that litigation was minimal save for GLO/Starling.

The Bi-Annual Legal Risk Review was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

10. I Contract Management Framework (CMF)

10.1 I SIG presented the Contract Management Framework update.

10.2 I She reported that against an initial target of 50 material contracts, that 132 of the 134 material contracts
and 43 non material contracts have been located and uploaded onto Web3, with their obligations
mapped and resource and processes have been agreed with Company Secretarial, Legal and Procurement
to ensure new contracts, as entered into across the PO Group, are compliant with the CMF.

10.3 I The Legal team is working with Procurement to get the 1500 non-material contracts identified by GE and

GE-1 uploaded to Web3 with header level details recorded. As contracts expire/ renew they will be fully

remediated (have their obligations mapped/ CM assigned) in line with ARC’s direction in May. The project
will stay open for the next nine months and will enable new contracts to be mapped, contract owners
and managers identified, and compulsory training provided to the Group.

The Committee recognised the importance of contract management.

The Contract Management Framework (CMF) paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC

Update on Post Master Accounts

11

TP presented the report.

He explained this report arose from an ARC action to understand:

1) What information is presented to Post Masters regarding their customer accounts

2) What trends are prevalent or emerging in Postmaster customer accounts?

3) What further work can KPMG perform to assess whether any other product processes can give rise
to similar issues to those identified with stamps? How much would this cost? What are the
limitations and risks?

Findings from reviewing historical suspense accounts would be presented to ARC in November.

11.2

Regarding information presented to Post Masters in their customer accounts, TP advised these are settled
centrally at the end of a trading period and that branches are expected to complete trading period
accounting 12 times a year on a 5 week, 4 week, 4 week schedule at the end of each trading period.

Letters are sent to Postmasters regarding their balance on the Monday following the scheduled branch
balancing date, with a chaser sent the following week if no response is provided. It was noted that the
letters have been updated since the Common Issues Judgment, and automatic deduction of monies has
also ceased since the judgement, when no response is received from the Post Master.

Revised processes and letters have been independently reviewed and approved by Norton Rose Fulbright
as reflecting the requirements of the Common Issues Judgment.

POL is currently completing a thorough review of its Loss Recovery policies and processes and is
considering other opportunities, such as the use of Branch Hub, to allow Postmasters to monitor the
balances on their customer account(s). The review will conclude in Q3 2020-21.

113

Regarding trends, apart from in TPO4 2020, the year on year balances settled centrally by branches has
fallen year on year in each trading period over the last 20 months. The reduction in balances settled
centrally is driven by a reduction in both the volume of branches settling balances centrally and the
average value being settled centrally.

the total level of declared losses across the network has also decreased, driven by an increase in the
monitoring of branches, an increase in the support provided to branches and through more frequent
earlier intervention for branches that are having operational issues.

114

Regarding the review of further processes that could be identified as having a similar risks to stamps, the
team had identified no further areas.

As no further products/processes had been identified as at risk, TP advised that a high level review of the
product portfolio would be conducted to identify key risk areas. This will include any products with
specific process issues that may have the potential to cause product-related branch discrepancies, and
where Postmasters may suffer detriment as a result.

and historical processes, where historical processes are known.

The Committee remarked on the excellent progress made to improve data provided to Post Masters.

The paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

12. I Policies for Approval
12.1 I The following policies were NOTED for onward submission to the ARC:
* Procurement Policy
* Contract Execution
* Vulnerable Customer
© Physical Security
¢ HMRC Fit and Proper Standards
12.2 I BB presented the Procurement Policy.
She explained that the Procurement policy (not reviewed since 2015) sets out the legal framework for
Public Procurement Regulation under which POL operates as a public sector body. She noted that the
regulations were published in 2015 and have not been altered since, save government notices on good
practice. POL complies with these regulations.
She set out that an Appendix A providing more detailed guidance on Sub Threshold awards has been
drafted for discussion at RCC and ARC, as the regulation and guidance is much lighter and open to
interpretation.
Sub threshold awards is the area which is most often the subject of the recent Procurement Risk
Exception Form (PREN) process. The object of this appendix is to establish the minimum operating
standards relating to the risk management of procurement activity under PCR threshold values. It was
noted the upper threshold is updated every two years to account for exchange rate variations between
the UK and the Eurozone.
A discussion took place on how the regulations are applied in practice and whether how "cross border
interest” is interpreted drives significant additional effort.
A decision on the interpretation of cross-border awards would be made by BF to avoid any internal
confusion, and a review of how UKGI handle cross-border awards (and other similar organisations) would
also be completed.
The Committee recommended a pragmatic approach be taken, particularly with cross-border awards —
whether more legal risk notes should be drafted in future, or a blanket approach to cross-border awards
is taken and the resourcing impact and associated costs assessed.

Central Risk seeing increasing levels of engagement from individual business units in managing

the risks for which they are accountable (in their 1* line role).

Some areas of relative weakness remain. They include:
Risk articulation: ongoing need to be clear on the cause, event and impact of the risk

+ Alignment: Ensuring risks articulated elsewhere (such as in ARC and Board papers) are
reflected and managed through RSA Archer

+ Mitigations: sometimes need strengthening i.e. no mitigations at all, or not SMART (what, by
who, by when)

+ RAG ratings: need to ensure in some instances that risks have been rated in line with
corporate standards

+ Risk Assessment: need to carry out risk assessment on a monthly basis or before the
expected response date

Given their strategic nature enterprise risks do not see significant change in ratings month on

Summary

The Post Office has undertaken significant work in recent months to ensure all local risks are
uploaded onto the GRC tool and linked directly to higher level enterprise and intermediate risk
levels to provide an overall, risk profile across specific themes.

The current data shows (as at 4/11/20) we have 457 open Local Level risks. This is a +71 net
increase since 8/2020 (54 new risks raised and 96 closed). The bulk of these low level risks
have been categorised as Commercial (61), Operational (63) and Legal (91). The latter cover
risks around potential non-compliance across various regulations (AML, ABC, vehicle safety,
environment etc). There has also been 52 Security local risks and 32 Technology

risks. Commercial has reported 1 new ‘Critical’ risk by the Telco team. This concerns a breach
of regulatory communications following the FJT P1 communications incident which could result in
an Ofcom investigation. A remediation plan is in progress to fully mitigate this risk.

Central Risk are continuing to proactively liaise with Business Risk Leads to ensure local risks are
correctly articulated, rated and their remediation updated, following the new proposed PO
Structure and Purpose. Target ratings for most risks await the outcome of the risk appetite and
KRI work,

products are too complex or confusing, new product are cost ineffective, unattractive to the
market and/or unable to be scaled. Key mitigation include refreshed IR Framework, direct

comms to Field teams and employees, and regular review of IA contingency plans.

+ Health and Safety Breach - Branch Network and Mental and physical health and safety: Risk
of harm or breach of regulatory requirements and risks through crime such as violence and
hate crime. Physical safety and associated effects continues to be a key concern for the
business. This could be exacerbated by the combination of coronavirus measures and Brexit
disruption, and contingency plans are in place for ensuring branches remained stocked but do
not hold unnecessary cash.

The Risk Policy is organised around 3 themes: Risk Governance, Strategy and Protocols.
The Policy outlines the minimum control standards that apply to each of these themes. It
is supported by a Risk Management Framework, which provides additional detail and
guidance to support the identification and management of risk across the organisation.

The principles are based on ISO:31000 (Risk Management-Principles and Guidelines)!.

They also have regard to the UK Corporate Governance Code (Guidance on Risk

Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting). The

principles include:

a) Risk management is fundamental to how Post Office is directed, managed and
controlled at all levels

b) Risk must be embedded in all activities. Its underlying risk culture and approach is
key to effective decision making

c) All material risks must be identified, measured, monitored, managed and reported

d) Risk management processes must be aligned and integrated with the delivery of Post
Office’s strategy

e) Risk management must follow a consistent, transparent and auditable methodology

f) Risk reporting must allow for the effective review, challenge and monitoring of risk
exposure against Post Office’s approved risk appetites

g) Risk Governance must adhere to the industry standard ‘3 lines of defence’ model.

1.2 Key definition

The Policy definition of ‘risk’ is based on the ISO 31000 definition namely the effect of
uncertainty on the Post Office achieving its strategic objectives. That effect may be
positive, negative or a deviation from the expected. Risks are described in terms of causes,
potential events and their consequences.

1.3. Application

This Policy applies to Post Office Limited (excluding Post Office Insurance, First Rate
Exchange Services Limited and Payzone Bill Payment Limited although they will have
regard to it) and to all Post Office employees, contractors and business operations.

1.4 Risk Governance

Post Office’s Risk Governance arrangements are concerned with how risks are managed

and reported within the organisation. Risk Governance includes:

. Structure: The Post Office risk management structure consists of the Board, ARC,
RCC and Group Executive (GE)

. Roles and Responsibilities: Post Office follows the industry standard ‘3 lines of
defence’ model with regard to risk management governance, compliance and
oversight

. Risk Reporting: Post Office has in place a reporting cycle for enterprise, intermediate
and local risks. Specific dashboard reports are produced for each GE Business Unit
and the corporate GE every month and the RCC/ARC every 2 months

. Escalation: Where the Risk Owner has insufficient authority to effectively manage
the risk, they should escalate the risk to their relevant GE member, or equivalent
senior leader.

+ ISO 31000 is a family of standards relating to risk management codified by the International Organization for
Standardization.

1.5 Risk Strategy

The Post Office’s Risk Strategy is concerned with specific risk policies and framework,

appetite and attitude to risk, the techniques by which Post Office assess risks as well as

the key priorities in any given year. Risk Strategy includes:

. Strategic objectives: This Policy and the supporting risk management framework is
focused on managing the risks and opportunities of Post Office associated with its
strategic purpose of ‘We're here, in person, for the people who rely on us’

. Risk Appetite & Key Risk Indicators (KRIs): The Post Office’s ‘3 lines of defence’ risk
management structure oversees Post Office’s risk appetite and KRIs. Post Office
assess risk appetite against a 5-tiered scale

. Exceptions: On occasions Post Office may need to accept risks that are outside of
approved appetite or outside of existing procedures. Such circumstances must be
exceptional, time-limited, formally documented (through a Risk Exception Note) and
approved by the relevant GE member.

1.6 Risk Protocols

The Post Office Risk Protocols are the guidelines provided to the organisation for the

management of risk. Risk Protocols include:

. Risk Management Process: The Post Office Risk Management Process is consistent
with the principles of ISO: 31000 and it has a number of sequential components
including Establishing the Context, Risk Assessment, Monitor & Review and
Consultation

. Harm table: The Post Office corporate HARM table describes the risk
impact/likelihood scales (on a standard 1-5 scale) which must be applied

. Risk Hierarchy and Classification: Post Office has a three-level risk hierarchy:
Enterprise, Intermediate and Local risks. The Post Office risks are allocated one of
fourteen categories consistent with those advocated by HM Government's ‘Orange
Book’

. Risk articulation: All risks across the risk hierarchy must be expressed in terms of
their cause(s), the risk event itself, and their impact.

1.7. Minimum Control Standards

Post Office has a number of minimum control standards which apply to the management
of its risks. Below is an example of the relationships between the risk area and the required
minimum control standards:

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner
The risk landscape in which Post Office operates is volatile, uncertain and complex,
with increasing demands from its customers and greater scrutiny from regulators,
legislators and Government. This will continue.

This is why Post Office must focus relentlessly on actively monitoring and
strengthening its approach to risk management and promoting a consistent risk-
intelligent culture.

Failure to effectively manage its risks will adversely impact Post Office’s ability to
deliver its business strategy, will undermine the protection and preservation of its
reputation and brand, and the delivery of consistent, high-quality services.

In doing so Post Office acknowledges that risk exists in everything it does. So
everyone in the organisation has a duty of care to manage these risks. However,
risk management is as much about exploiting opportunities as it is about
managing threats. Given this Post Office will inevitably take a certain amount of
risk in order to achieve its strategic objectives.

This Risk Policy (with its clear principles and mandatory minimum control
standards) is an important tool in managing risks efficiently and effectively.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy is organised around 3 themes:

. Risk Governance: This focuses on how Post Office risk management activity
is organised. It describes (i) the relevant Committees (and their respective
roles with regard to risk and how they interact), (ii) the ‘3 lines of defence’
risk management model (and where accountability and responsibility are
placed within. it) and, (iii) the criteria by which risks should be escalated to
provide the requisite oversight;

. Risk Strategy: This focuses on Post Office’s overall approach to risk
management. It describes how risk management activities are aligned, the
level of risk maturity being sought and the level of risk exposure (appetite)
that is acceptable; and,

. Risk Protocols: This defines the risk management activities that must be
undertaken, how they will be undertaken and their frequency.

The Policy also outlines the minimum control standards that apply to each of
these themes.

It is supported by a Risk Management Framework (a series of separate but
interlinked documents) which provides additional detail and practical guidance to
support the consistent and robust identification and management of risk and
opportunities across the organisation.

This Policy, the supporting Framework and other material is accessible on Post
Office’s Central Risk intranet site.

1.3. Principies

The Post Office’s Risk Policy principles are based on 1S0:31000 (Risk

Management-Principles and Guidelines).1 They also have regard to the UK

Corporate Governance Code (Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and

Related Financial and Business Reporting)’. There are 7 principles:

1. Risk management is fundamental to how Post Office is directed, managed
and controlled at all levels;

2. Risk must be embedded in all Post Office activities. Its underlying risk culture
and approach is key to effective decision making;

3. All material risks must be identified, measured, monitored, managed and
reported on a continuous basis at an individual and aggregate level;

4. Risk management processes must be aligned and integrated with the delivery
of Post Office’s strategy and in such a way that supports an enterprise wide
approach;

5. Risk management must follow a consistent, transparent and auditable
methodology and proactively recognise external factors, opportunities, and
uncertainties;

6. Risk reporting must allow for the effective review, challenge and monitoring
of risk exposure against Post Office’s approved risk appetites; and,

7. Risk Governance must adhere to the industry standard ‘3 lines of defence’
model to ensure clear accountability and appropriate segregation of duties.

1.4. Application

This Policy applies to Post Office Limited? (excluding Post Office Insurance, First
Rate Exchange Services Limited and Payzone Bill Payment Limited although they
will have regard to it) and to all Post Office employees’, contractors and business
operations.

1.5. Compliance

This Policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees, contractors and business
operations and applies wherever in the world Post Office Limited’s business is
undertaken. All Post Office third parties who do business with the Group (including
consultants, suppliers and business partners) will be required to agree
contractually to this Policy or have their own equivalent Policy.

Where significant non-compliance with the Risk Policy is identified the matter must
be referred to the Chief Finance Officer and the Head of Risk.

+ ISO 31000 is a family of standards relating to risk management codified by the International Organization for
Standardization.

2. Risk Governance

Post Office’s Risk Governance arrangements are concerned with how risks are
managed and reported within the organisation.

2.1. Structure

The Post Office risk management structure consists of the:

° Board®, informed and advised by the Audit, Risk & Compliance (ARC). They
have overall accountability for the assessment and management of risk,
taking a strategic view of the risks faced by Post Office;

. ARC®. They support the Board in its assessment and management of risks.
The ARC reviews Post Office’s risk policy, risk appetite and attitude to risk to
ensure these are appropriately defined and communicated so that
parameters and expectations are understood; and,

. Group Executive (GE)’. The GE, led by the Chief Executive, has operational
responsibility for Post Office risk management and systems of internal
control.

2.2. Roles and Responsibilities

Post Office follows the industry standard ‘3 lines of defence’ model with regard to

risk management governance, compliance and oversight. This means:

. The GE and Post Office Groups (and their subsidiary business units)
perform the 1% line function. They are accountable for identifying,
assessing, owning and manage their risks. They are also accountable for the
design, implementation and maintenance of the associated internal control
measures;

. The Central Risk team perform the 2"4 line function. They oversee the
corporate approach to risk management. This involves defining and
implementing risk standards, policies, procedures and guidance. They also
assist the 1° line function in the management of their risks in line with good
practice as well as monitor compliance and effectiveness. Furthermore, they
are accountable for reporting to the Board, ARC and GE on Post Office risk
performance as well as advising on emerging risks and changing risk
scenarios; and,

. Internal Audit, who operate independently of 1% and 2" Line functions, are
the 3 Line. They provide an independent evaluation of the adequacy and
effectiveness of Post Office's framework of governance, risk management
and control.

2.3. Risk Reporting
All Post Office risks must be monitored, reviewed and recorded regularly to
determine whether, or not, the corporate risk profile has changed and to gain

5 The Board is collectively responsible for setting Post Office's strategic direction and primary business objectives.
It establishes a robust governance framework and ensures that the Company has financial and human
resources required to achieve its agreed objectives. It is chaired by a non-Executive Director.

©, The ARC is a Committee of the Board from which it derives its authority. It provides oversight of Post Office’s
Group's risk management systems, operational controls and key systems, including monitoring exposures to
the Group Risk Appetite.

7 The GE is a Committee of Post Office senior management responsible for day to day Post Office operational
management.

POL-BSFF-0238386_0031
assurance that corporate risk management rules and procedures are effective.

Such regular (and incremental) reporting has a number of benefits including:

. ensuring responses are effective and efficient;

. building up knowledge to improve risk identification and analysis;

. providing a better link between risks and objectives, key dependencies, core
processes and stakeholder expectations;

. detecting and preparing for changes and trends in existing risks, including
the extent to which risks are aligned with approved appetite;

. identifying and preparing for new and emerging risks; and,

. identifying good risk management practice, building on it and disseminating
it to other parts of the organisation.

Post Office has in place a reporting cycle for enterprise, intermediate and local
risks. Specific dashboard reports are produced for each GE Business Unit and the
corporate GE every month and the RCC/ARC every 2 months. These reports
include (but are not limited to) information on risks trends, compliance levels and
associated actions. The data is taken directly from Post Office’s Governance, Risk
& Compliance tool which provides a ‘single source of truth’.

2.4. Escalation

Post Office has a 3 tier risk hierarchy (see Section 4.3) with each risk having a
designated Risk Owner accountable for proactively managing their risks to within
an approved level of appetite.

Where the Risk Owner has insufficient authority to effectively manage the risk,

they should escalate the risk to their relevant GE member, or equivalent senior

leader. This should be done in circumstances where:

. treatment of the risk requires decisions/actions beyond what the Risk Owner
is authorised to decide and/or there are commercial constraints;

. the risk may impact multiple business areas and/or addressing the risk
requires action by multiple stakeholders;

. addressing the risk requires corporate changes; or,
grievances from stakeholders have been received to which the Risk Owner
cannot impartially and/or effectively respond.

When a risk is escalated, the Risk Owner must provide the receiving manager with
complete information about the risk to enable the latter to act appropriately. Risk
ownership can only be transferred when a risk has been escalated and accepted.
Escalation does not require the impact and/or likelihood rating of a risk to be
‘artificially’ inflated to give it visibility.

2.5. Transfer

Risk ownership can be transferred where the risk has:

. been escalated;

. to be reallocated within the organisation due to internal restructure; or,
. has changed and it needs to be reassigned.

When a risk is transferred, the Risk Owner must provide the new owner with
complete information about the risk to enable them to manage the risk
appropriately. Risk ownership can only be transferred when a risk has been
accepted by the new Risk Owner.

3. Risk Strategy

The Post Office’s Risk Strategy is concerned with specific risk policies and
framework, appetite and attitude to risk, the techniques by which Post Office
assess risks as well as the key priorities in any given year.

3.1. Strategic Objectives

This Policy and the supporting risk management framework is focused on

managing the risks and opportunities of Post Office associated with its strategic

purpose of ‘We're here, in person, for the people who rely on us.’ Such focus

increases the probability of success (and reduces the likelihood of failure) in:

. supporting Post Office Postmasters (i.e. making sure that Postmasters feel
that they have a role in shaping the business);

. building a fit for purpose network (i.e. having the right branches in the right
place); and,

. focusing relentlessly on Post Office core strengths and customers (i.e.
defending and growing main products and services that are so critical to Post
Office income.

3.2, Risk Appetite® & Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)°

Post Office has in a place a series of risk appetite statements and KRIs to:

. allow the Board, GE and ARC to understand the organisation’s aggregated
and interlinked levels of risk to determine acceptability or not;

. provide further assurance that the strategic objectives will be secured and
early warning where these are under threat;

. allow the business to focus limited resource to manage risks outside of
tolerance and tolerate risks which lie within the thresholds;

. support management in making decisions with an understanding of the
degree to which the business is exposed to the consequences of a risk
event; and,

. flex and adapt to the changing business environment.

The Post Office’s approach is based on industry-standard principles*® namely:

. Scope: Risk appetite/KRIs are primarily articulated at the enterprise risk
level and guide/shape the management of linked (but subsidiary)
intermediate and local risks;

. Complex: Risk appetites/KRIs are complex given that excessive simplicity,
while superficially attractive, is counter-productive;

. Measurable: Risk appetites/KRIs are measurable so are based on relevant,
accurate and readily available existing data;

. Flexible: They are not single, fixed concepts. There will be different (and
tailored) appetites for different enterprise risks; and,

® Risk Appetite is the amount of overall risk an organisation is willing to pursue (or retain) to achieve the relevant
strategic objective. It is a qualitative assessment generally made at enterprise risk level.

® Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are measures put in place to show the underlying trend of specific risks. KRIs are
predictive. They are a set of ‘guide rails’ to provide context within which individual risk impact and likelihood
ratings can be considered. KRIs are a quantitative assessment again generally made at enterprise risk level

. Manageable: The approach considers Post Office’s risk management
capability and the organisation’s willingness and capacity for taking risks
and level of maturity in managing them. 3.1

The Post Office’s ‘3 lines of defence’ risk management oversee its risk appetite
and KRIs as follows:

+ Approve alll final draft Risk Appetite Statements and associated KRIs.

+ Request, as necessary, the Group Executive commission work to

Board/ARC'* articulate additional Risk Appetite Statements/KRIs

* Seek assurance Post Office is adhering to approved Risk Appetite
Statements/KRI thresholds

~ Effectively and clearly communicate goals and objectives, strategy,
achievement metrics, and relevant time periods for pursuing the
objectives related to developing risk appetite statements.

Group Executive + Set the Risk Appetites and approved tolerance levels that ensure enough
risk is being taken to ensure Post Office strategic objectives are met

+ Secure Group Command consensus on statements and approach.

* Commission revisions of Risk Appetite Statements and KRIs as needed.

+ Validate or raise concerns about the ongoing viability of existing Risk

Group and individual Appetite Statements approved by the GE /Board

Business Units ‘+ Monitor existing KRIs to determine adherence to Risk Appetite
Statements that apply to the Group

* Produce Post Office corporate policy/standards for Risk Appetite and KRIs

* Develop (in discussion with 1* Line) initial set of corporate Risk Appetite
Statements and KRIs

Central Risk * Facilitate ongoing development of new (and enhancements to existing)
Risk Appetite Statements and KRIS

+ Provide assurance of 1* Line compliance with standards in this area

+ _ Escalate areas of non-compliance to Group Executive and Board/ARC

+ Provide, as part of its agreed Audit plan, an independent and objective
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and
Internal Audit control, making recommendations for improvement
* Report to RCC/ARC on its findings, particularly around areas of non-
compliance

Post Office assess risk appetite against a 5-tiered scale (see section 9.1).

3.3. Exceptions

On occasions Post Office may need to accept risks that are outside of approved
appetite or outside of existing procedures.

Such circumstances must be exceptional, time-limited, formally documented
(through a Risk Exception Note) and approved by the relevant GE member.

Central Risk report regularly on all open Risk Exception Notes to the GE and ARC.
They are accountable for assuring the relevant business unit are proactively

managing in a timely fashion and the necessary mitigating actions are being taken
to close the exception.

Risk Protocols

The Post Office Risk Protocols are the guidelines provided to the organisation for
the management of risk. These include detailed rules and procedures, how risks

are

classified, as well as the risk management methodologies, tools and

techniques used.

Figure 1: Post Office Risk Management process

It has a number of sequential components:

i.

Establishing the Context: Post Office risks should be understood in the

context of the organisation itself, the activities it undertakes and the range

of skills and capabilities available to it. Consideration must also be given to

the environment in which Post Office operates, its external stakeholders and

their expectations.

Risk Assessment: This is the means by with which Post Office should

evaluate and prioritise the risks it faces through:

a) Risk Identification: Techniques by which Post Office identifies all the risks

its faces be they existing, new or emerging

Risk Analysis: whereby each risk is assessed in terms of its potential

impact and likelihood (see Section 3.2) and its relationship to the

associated approved appetite (see Section 0)

c) Risk Evaluation: a risk profile is produced providing a significance rating
to each risk and therefore a tool for prioritising treatment efforts;

d) Risk Treatment: implementation of actions to respond to risks including
decisions on whether to tolerate, treat, transfer or terminate

Monitor & Review:

This is focused on (a) reacting to early warning indicators of the need to

make interventions, (b) reviewing emerging risks and opportunities, (c)

reviewing whether risks owners are implementing the responses for which

POL-BSFF-0238386_0035
they are accountable and, (d) reporting on the success (or otherwise) of the
interventions to date and whether additional activity is required.

4. Consultation: This should ensure that (a) appropriate decisions and actions
are taken to respond appropriately to a particular risk, (b) different areas of
professional expertise and views are appropriately considered in the
management of risks and ( c) sufficient information and evidence to facilitate
risk oversight and decision making are provided.

4,2. Harm Table

Post Office assess each risk by demonstrating the relationship between the
likelihood of the risk materialising (on a standard 1-5 scale) and the impact of the
event should the risk materialise (again on a standard 1-5 scale) to provide an
overall risk rating.

The Post Office corporate HARM table describes the impact/likelihood scales which
must be applied. This is provided at section 9.2.

Each active risk should have 3 ratings namely:

. Inherent: the level of risk before any control activities are applied;

. Current Residual: the latest level of risk considering the effectiveness of
the controls currently in place; and,

. Target: the level of risk that is desired when any planned additional controls
have been implemented. This must. be consistent with the associated
approved risk appetite.

All of these should be recorded on the Post Office’s Governance, Risk & Compliance
tool.

4.3. Risk Hierarchy and Classification

Post Office has a three-level risk hierarchy. These are:

. Enterprise Risks: The Post Office's key business risks are grouped into
fourteen enterprise-level themes which mirror HM Government's approach to
enterprise risk classification (as described below). These risks are Post
Office-wide and so are of corporate importance. Each enterprise risk is owned
by a single GE member. Central Risk provide an update on the management
of these enterprise risks at each RCC and ARC;

. Intermediate Risks: These are sub-categories of an enterprise risk to which
they are linked. They are often the key risks faced by individual business
areas; and,

° Local Risks: These are sub-categories of intermediate risks, to which they
are linked. They are often more specific, local risks faced by individual
business units.

The Post Office risks have been categorised as follows, consistent with those

advocated by HM Government's ‘Orange Book’:

. Strategy: Risks associated with ineffective and poorly designed strategy, not
aligned to the interest of its key stakeholder(s), unable to support the full
integration of any acquired business, delivery of plans or objectives;

POL00423571

. Governance: Risks associated with ineffective and/or disproportionate
oversight of decision making, unclear authorities and accountabilities across
the management hierarchy, insufficient transparency on business
performance;

. Operational: Risks associated with ineffective and inefficient internal
processes, unsound and insufficiently assured control environment and
ineffective continuity plans and recovery strategy;

. Legal: Risks associated a failure to comply with legislative and regulatory
changes, act in accordance with legal and regulatory obligations (i.e. GDPR),
sectoral regulator guidance and/or other external legal activity (i.e.
litigation);

. Health & Safety: Risks associated with failure to provide a safe work
environment for employees (including workplace and branches) and ensure
physical safety of employees and agents in response to incidents such as
theft, robbery, burglary, terrorism, pandemic and site safety (e.g. workplace
COVID-secure);

. Financial: Risks associated with failure to provide adequate liquidity to meet
financial obligations, having insufficient funding, uncontrolled costs, credit
failure and increased taxation;

. Commercial: Risks associated with failure to implement unattractive
commercial proposition due to high 3. party dependency, capacity
constraints, cost pressures, varied demand and skill shortages;

. People: Risks associated with ineffective leadership and engagement, sub-
optimal culture, inappropriate recruitment model, insufficient capacity and
capability, unattractive Postmasters proposition, industrial action and/or
non-compliance with relevant employment legislation/HR policies;

. Technology: Risks associated with inadequate technology, inability to
deliver the expected IT services and sustain competitive advantage in
products/services;

° Information: Risks associated with failure to produce a robust, suitable,
appropriate, correct and complete data/information and to exploit
data/information to its full potential;

. Security: Risks associated with failure to prevent un-authorised and/or
inappropriate access to the estate and information, including cyber security;

° Change: Risks associated with failure to implement change programmes and
projects aligned with strategic priorities, consistent with budget allocation,
deliver requirements and intended benefits to time, cost and quality;

. Reputational: Risks associated with adverse events including ethical
violations and/or adverse stance to corporate social responsibility; and,

. Marketplace & Brands: Risks associated with failure to maintain a
competitive advantage in response to actions adopted by main competitors,
changes in customers service needs and expectations, loyalty to the Brand.

4.4. Risk Articulation

All risks across the risk hierarchy must be expressed in terms of their cause(s),
the risk event itself, and their impact:

Figure 2: Post Office bowtie diagram

. Cause: A cause is an element which alone or in combination with other
causes has the potential to give rise to the risk. They are generally (but not
exclusively) external;

. Event: An event is an articulation of the potential adverse or beneficial
circumstances that could result from the cause — in effect the risk itself. A
risk may have multiple causes and consequences and can affect multiple
objectives. Post Office risks should be classified (see section 4.3) against the
Event not the Cause or the Impact; and,

. Consequences/Impact: Consequences are the outcome of a risk event
materialising. Outcomes can be positive or negative. They can also be direct
or indirect. It is also possible to express them qualitatively or quantitatively.
They should be assessed using Post Office HARM table (see Appendix 9.2).

4.5. Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) tool
All Post Office risks (across all levels of the risks hierarchy) must be identified,
analysed, evaluated and managed using the Central Risk GRC tool.

4.6. Incidents

All non-IT incidents should be reported by the Incident Reporter. The Incident
Owner responds to incident based on the Post Office risk appetite, identifying the
root cause as well as putting appropriate action plans and all controls in place.

By working closely with the respective Risk Business Partner, the Incident Owner
must also consider any impact the incident has had on the current risks and
controls (mapped where relevant) or whether the incident constitutes a new risk
to the business that has not been recorded within the risk register. The Incident
Owner manages action plans through to closure.

IT related incidents are reported (new) or escalated (existing) through the IT
Service Desk.

Post Office has a number of minimum control standards which apply to the 3.1
management of its risks.

They cover a range of control types (i.e. directive, detective, corrective and
preventative) to ensure risks are managed to within the acceptable level of risk

appetite.

8. Definitions

Appetite
This is the level of risk that the Group is prepared to accept or pursue or before
action is deemed necessary to reduce it; also, sometimes called ‘risk tolerance’.

Control
This is any action taken to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of a risk.

Exception

There are on occasion exceptional situations where business requirements make
it necessary to depart from an approved policy and operate outside of risk
appetite. In these circumstances the business can choose to accept this risk and
formally request a risk exception for a defined period of time.

Governance

This is the system by which organisations are directed and controlled. It defines
accountabilities, relationships and responsibilities in the organisation as well as
determine the rules and procedures and monitors performance.

Impact
This is the estimated result including financial, operational and reputational that
would be realised if a risk event would occur.

Incident

An incident is an event, where individual operational controls either did not exist
or did not operate as intended, or the incident was not anticipated, and which has,
or could have, resulted in a financial impact (direct or indirect), a regulatory
implication, a customer consequence or a significant operational impact.

Likelihood
This is the evaluation or judgement regarding the chances of the risk materialising.
Likelihood is also called ‘probability’ or ‘frequency’.

Risk

Risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on the Post Office achieving its strategic
objectives. That effect may be positive, negative or a deviation from the expected.
Risks are described in terms of causes, potential events and their consequences.

Risk Management

This is the co-ordinated activities designed and operated to manage risk and
exercise internal control within an organisation.

® Tolerance for uncertainty: How willing is Post Office to accept uncertain outcomes? This illustrates the Board's appetite to trade off certainty to achieve a given objective.
A low rating demonstrates the Board's need for certain outcomes, while a high rating shows the Board will pursue an objective even with an uncertain outcome.

* Decision choice: When faced with multiple decision options, how is Post Office willing to select a decision that puts a strategic objective at risk? This question assesses
the Board's acceptance that a given choice may lead to failure to meet a strategic objective. A Board who are averse will only choose options that pose a minimal threat to
the strategic objective’s achievement. A Board open to this risk are willing to trade off the possibility of failure for a high-risk, high-reward decision.

5 Pri tion of strategic objective: How willing is Post Office willing to trade off this specific objective against achievement of other objectives? This demonstrates the
Board's willingness to pursue achievement of a given strategic objective over achievement of another. A Board who are averse to this would never trade off completing the
objective in question for failure of other objectives. A Board which is open would be willing to accept this trade-off.

i Risk Appetite & Key Risk Meeting
Title: Indicators: A Proposed Approach Date: 12 November 2020
Author: I Mark Baldock, Head of Risk Sponsor: AL eameron; Group Chief Finance

Input Sought: Noting & Approval

The Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) is asked to approve that the approach to Risk
Appetite and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), which will:

* be primarily articulated at the enterprise risk level;

* be assessed against a 5-tiered scale;

¢ be tailored for different enterprise risks;

* take into account our willingness and capacity for taking risks and our level of maturity
in managing them;
be managed using the 3 lines of defence model;
* be reported monthly as part of the Group Executive (GE) Dashboards and every two

months as part of the RCC/ARC Dashboards; and

* be subject to yearly review;

for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

The Committee is also asked to note that, subject to approval, the approach will be initially
applied to 3 enterprise risk groupings namely (i) Legal & Compliance, (ii) Operational and
(iii) Technology & Security. Their specific application will be subject to separate approval
by the RCC and the ARC, currently targeted for January 2021.

Executive Summary
This paper seeks RCC approval to the Post Office’s approach to Risk Appetite and Key Risk
Indicators (KRIs). It describes:

¢ the principles that underpin the approach

* the associated benefits

* how Risk Appetite and KRIs should be assessed

* how accountability should work

* proposed Next Steps and the indicative timeline

The Post Office’s approach is based on industry best practice.

Report 34

e What are Risk Appetites and Key Risk Indicators and why are they important?
e¢ What are the principles that underpin our proposed approach?

e¢ How have we approached this work?

¢ What are the proposed Next Steps and the indicative timeline?

Background

1. The Post Office’s draft Risk Policy! is organised around 3 themes namely (i) Risk
Governance (which focuses on how Post Office risk management activity is organised),
(ii) Risk Strategy (which considers the Post Office’s overall approach to risk
management and (iii) Risk Protocols (which defines the risk management activities
that must be undertaken.

2. The Risk Strategy component is specifically concerned with the techniques by which
Post Office should assess risks. This includes an approach to Risk Appetite and
Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) such that we can meet our strategic objectives of (i)
supporting Post Office Postmasters, (ii) building a fit for purpose network and, (iii)
focusing relentlessly on Post Office core strengths and customers.

3. This paper details the Post Office’s specific approach to Risk Appetite and KRIs. These
are defined as follows:

. Risk Appetite: The amount of overall risk an organisation is willing to pursue (or
retain) to achieve its strategic objectives. It is a qualitative assessment generally
made at enterprise risk level.

. KRIs: The measures put in place to show the underlying trend of specific risks.
KRIs are predictive. They are a set of ‘guide rails’ to provide context within which
individual risk impact and likelihood ratings can be considered. KRIs are a
quantitative assessment again generally made at enterprise risk level.

Approach
4. Our approach is based on industry-standard principles? namely:

. Scope: Our Risk appetite/KRIs will be primarily articulated at the enterprise risk
level but will also help guide/shape the management of linked (but subsidiary)
intermediate and local risks;

. Complex: Our Risk appetites/KRIs are likely to be complex. Excessive simplicity,
while superficially attractive, may be counter-productive;

. Measurable: Our Risk appetites/KRIs will be measurable so will be based on
relevant, accurate and readily available existing data;

. Flexible: They will not be single, fixed concepts. There will be different (and
tailored) appetites for different enterprise risks; and,

. Manageable: Our approach will take account our risk management capability, our
willingness and capacity for taking risks and our level of maturity in managing
them.

* The Post Office’s draft Risk Policy v1.1 has been tabled separately for RCC/ARC approval in 11/2020.

Tab 3.1.1 Risk Policy, including the proposed approach to Risk Appetite & Key Performance Indicators

Benefits
5.

We consider such an approach will:

. allow the Board, GE, RCC and ARC to understand our aggregated levels of risk to
determine acceptability or not;

. provide assurance that our strategic objectives will be secured and provide early
warning where achievement is under threat;

. allow the business to focus limited resource to manage risks outside of tolerance
and tolerate risks which lie within the thresholds;

° support GE in understanding the degree to which the business is exposed to the
consequences of a risk event; and,

. be able to flex and adapt to the changing business environment.

Assessment

6. We propose the Post Office assess appetite (at the enterprise level) against a 5-tiered
scale which ranges from ‘Averse’, through ‘Neutral’ to ‘Open.’

7. Wewill also take into account other factors including our tolerance for uncertainty
(how willing are we to trade off certainty to achieve an objective), decision choice
(how willing are we to make a decision, from a number, that risks a strategic objective)
and strategic priority (how willing are we to trade off an objective against
achievement of other objectives)

8. Our proposed Risk Appetite scale is provided at Appendix 1.

Accountability

9. The Post Office's ‘3 lines of defence’ risk management governance structure will
oversee both the initial application, and ongoing management, of our approved Risk
Appetites and KRIs as follows:

+ Approve all final draft Risk Appetite Statements and associated KRIs.

* Request, as necessary, the Group Executive commission work to articulate

Board/ARC? additional Risk Appetite Statements/KRIS

+ Seek assurance Post Office is adhering to approved Risk Appetite Statements/KRI
thresholds

* Effectively and clearly communicate goals and objectives, strategy, achievement
metrics, and relevant time periods for pursuing the objectives related to developing
risk appetite statements.

Group Executive + Set the Risk Appetites and approved tolerance levels that ensure enough risk is
being taken to ensure Post Office strategic objectives are met

* Secure Group Command consensus on statements and approach.

+ Commission revisions of Risk Appetite Statements and KRIs as needed.

+ Validate or raise concerns about the ongoing viability of existing Risk Appetite

Group and individual Statements approved by the GE /Board

Business Units * Monitor existing KRIs to determine adherence to Risk Appetite Statements that
apply to the Group

* Produce Post Office corporate policy/standards for Risk Appetite and KRIs

* Develop (in discussion with 1* Line) initial set of corporate Risk Appetite Statements
and KRIs

Central Risk * Facilitate ongoing development of new (and enhancements to existing) Risk Appetite
Statements and KRIs

* Provide assurance of 1* Line compliance with standards in this area

* Escalate areas of non-compliance to Group Executive and Board/ARC

* Provide, as part of its agreed Audit plan, an independent and objective evaluation of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and control, making
recommendations for improvement 3.4
* Report to RCC/ARC on its findings, particularly around areas of non-compliance .

Internal Audit

Reporting
10. Following RCC/ARC approval of the individual Risk Appetites (and linked KRIs) for

specific enterprise risk groupings the target risk ratings of the relevant enterprise risk
as well as each linked (but subsidiary) intermediate and local risks will be calibrated to
ensure alignment.

11. This will mean that any risk in this grouping
. identified as being outside of appetite must be proactively treated with
mitigation actions clearly articulated, owners allocated, and dates identified;
. assessed as being within appetite can be simply tolerated such that no further
mitigations will be required.

12. Central Risk will include an assessment of enterprise risks against their approved Risk
Appetite (along with the latest KRI trends) as part of the monthly GE Dashboards and
bi-monthly RCC/ARC Dashboards

13. An illustrative Dashboard is provided at Appendix 2.

Next Steps
14. The RCC are asked to approve that our Risk Appetites and KRIs and note that, subject

to approval, the approach will be initially applied to 3 enterprise risk groupings namely
(i) Legal & Compliance, (ii) Operational and (iii) Technology & Security. This will
be subject to separate RCC/ARC approval, currently targeted for 1/2021.

* Tolerance for uncertainty: How willing is Post Office to accept uncertain outcomes? This illustrates the Board’s appetite to trade off certainty to achieve a given

objective. A low rating demonstrates the Board's need for certain outcomes, while a high rating shows the Board will pursue an objective even with an uncertain outcome.

5 Decision choice: When faced with multiple decision options, how is Post Office willing to select a decision that puts a strategic objective at risk? This question assesses
the Board's acceptance that a given choice may lead to failure to meet a strategic objective. A Board who are averse will only choose options that pose a minimal threat
to the strategic objective's achievement. A Board open to this risk are willing to trade off the possibility of failure for a high-risk, high-reward decision.

© Prioritisation of strategic objective: How willing is Post Office willing to trade off this specific objective against achievement of other objectives? This demonstrates
the Board's willingness to pursue achievement of a given strategic objective over achievement of another. A Board who are averse to this would never trade off
completing the objective in question for failure of other objectives. A Board which is open would be willing to accept this trade-off.

Illustrative Commentary

The approved risk appetite for this specific enterprise risk grouping is Averse. This means
the Post Office will avoid taking pretty much any risk in this area where at all possible and
has an extremely low appetite for any such risk materialising.

The current enterprise risk is currently assessed at 2:2 in terms of its potential adverse
impact and the likelihood of it materialising. Although year to date trends show the risk
rating has been reducing in recent months it remains outside of appetite. As such
further mitigations are required in addition to those already in place to reduce the risk
further.

Although 3 of the 4 KRIs are trending Green there is some evidence of volatility in recent
months which, if it continues, will place increasing pressure on the enterprise risk rating
even if, in the near future, it is brought within tolerance.

Comms incident

1.

On 17 September 2020, Fujitsu notified Post Office of a P1 incident affecting inbound
and outbound customer communications between February and September. The total
number of affected inbound comms is 7,846 and the number of affected outbound
comms is 153,684 (following a deduplication process as some comms are issued in
two formats). The outbound comms has impacted c.107,300 unique customers.

Some of the communications are regulated and could result in consumer harm. The Post
Office breach protocol process was followed and Meredith Sharples informed Ofcom
verbally on 27 September of the incident. This was followed up with a detailed letter on
23 October. Ofcom are now reviewing the content of the letter and deciding on whether
to open a formal investigation. A copy of this letter is attached in Appendix 1.

Given the variety of outbound communications that have been impacted, addressing and
rectifying consumer harm has been a complex process as there are 33 different comms
that were impacted which include, but not limited to, cease notifications, overdue payment
reminders, confirmation of engineer appoints. The team have prioritised their work
according to the impact on customers as set out in the table below. Details of the specific
comms impacted was provided to Ofcom.

Priority No. of impacted comms (not customers)

1. Customer's services were ceased 2,877

2. Potential financial impact on the customer 115,830*

3. Customer inconvenienced - communications

relates to regulation 3,650

4. Customer inconvenienced - communications

does not relate to regulation 21,133

5. No customer impact 9,551

* Please note that 99,689 of the priority 2 comms are e-bill notification communications where we inform the customer that their billis
ready online,

The final RCA with Fujitsu is still being worked through. However, we understand that the
main cause of the incident is a result of a file that become too large. Once deleted this
appears to have rectified the issue. Fujitsu have put in further checks to confirm that
outbound comms are going out and inbound comms are arriving correctly.

Of the 7,846 inbound communications, the Fujitsu team has reviewed 2,644 as at 5"
November. Where any consumer harm is identified the customers are being made good,
as if the communications failure had not happened. The Post Office team is checking the
remediation work being done by Fujitsu. We are pressuring Fujitsu to confirm when it
expects to have completed this exercise and are pushing for it to be closed by end
November/early December.

Fairness
6.

Post Office met Ofcom on 20" October to discuss how Post Office is meeting the Fairness
Commitments we have signed up to. Ofcom view these commitments as “reputational
regulation” whereby they publicly expose Communication Providers for practices that they
believe are unfair. Ofcom expressed appreciation for the work done but continued 7

reference Post Office having a high pricing differential between in contract and out of
contract customers. This was explained by the telecoms team as being a result of having

low acquisition pricing, thus driving a larger gap. This is not abnormal for the industry. 3.2
Ofcom made no further comment and, as a result, no action is being be taken by the
Telecoms Team other than to monitor the differential. If this became greater we could

expect Ofcom to ask more questions, although we think it is more likely that it will address

this at an industry level.

7. Ofcom plan to issue a statement with press coverage on their review of the market early
next year to “name and shame” the worst providers as well as note good practice. We are
expecting further informal follow up questions. Ofcom were understanding that our
current position in the sale process meant that we were limited in our ability to make
changes currently. This means that no action needs to be taken right now. However, once
the sale process/RFP status becomes clearer this will need to be reassessed.

Annual Best Tariff Notifications

8. The telecoms team have delayed the implementation of the introduction of Annual Best
Tariff Notifications from October to December2020, within the regulatory timetable. These
letters will inform customers who are currently out of contract that they could save money
by signing up to a new contract and will present Post Office’s best offers. The ABT must
be sent by 14'* February 2021 and there is a very low risk to the implementation deadline
however the letters are expected to drive more calls to the contact centre and drive
complaints as people will query why their current price is higher than the new offers in
their communications.

9. Ofcom had previously expressed concerns about the amount Post Office customers who
are out of contract. According to Ofcom the average number of out of contract customers
in the industry is 40%, (the highest is 61% and lowest is 24%)!. Post Office have 58%
customers who are out of contract, however some of these customers are on rolling 30
day contracts and would not necessarily be better off moving to a longer-term contract. If
these customers were not included, it is estimated that Post Office would be below 50%. As
noted below, we are due to start sending Annual Best Tariff Reminders to customers,
which we expect will further alter the percentage. Of the customers receiving the ABT
notifications, the Telecoms Team anticipate 5% will churn and 35% of customers will re-
contract onto new pricing. The Team will evaluate the effectiveness of the reminders
before reviewing any further action.

Voice only customers

10. Post Office met with Ofcom on 1% October to discuss their plans for the voice only market.
In 2017, Ofcom reached a voluntary agreement with BT to reduce its pricing for voice only
customers by £5. This voluntary agreement is set to end at the beginning of next year
and Ofcom confirmed during the meeting that they are looking to agree a further voluntary
agreement with BT. We are now awaiting the consultation which will detail the agreement
so that we can assess the impact to Post Office. We expect the impact to be minimal as
Ofcom thought the introduction of retail price regulation would be unlikely and are looking
to have a similar basket control that was agreed before.

European Electronic Communications Code

11. Ofcom have now issued their statement and consultation on the European Electronic
Communications Code and detailed the regulations they plan to introduce. This requires

significant changes to be made in telecoms however Ofcom have staggered the
implementation deadlines, with the first tranche not due to be implemented until

This has been noted in the Law and Trends Forum. 3.2

GLO and Historic Shortfall Scheme

13. Compliance continues to work with the Historical Matters Unit to identify, locate and
provide all data required to support the various ongoing initiatives, in particular:

a. Servicing 220 Data Subject Access requests that vary in complexity from access to
Shortfall information through to full requests requiring extensive searches of Post
Office systems and archives.

b. Considering the implications of information to be provided to the Enquiry which
includes personal data relating to the 2015 Mediation Scheme. We continue to work
with internal Legal on making a representation to the Enquiry to provide pseudo-
anonymised data rather than full disclosure.

14. Post Office continues to receive a higher-than-normal number of complex FOI requestsin
relation to Historic Matters.

15. Given the sensitivity of these requests, Post Office is working with external Counsel, Legal
and Communications on the responses and, where appropriate, decisions on disclosure
are referred to the HMU Steerco. We continue to meet the FOI response timelines as set
out in legislation and we have had no complaints from the ICO in respect of our handling
of these cases.

16. Examples of FOI requests since the September RCC include:

a. The number and value of Transaction Corrections issued by Post Office over the last
12 months
i. The business does not hold the information in the format that was requested by

the individual. by the individual.

ii, FOI does not require an organisation to create new information, neither is it

process that will allow for accurate Transaction Correction information to be

accurate Transaction Correction information to be issued to HSS applicants and to
the HSS resolution team to verify claims.

b. Information relating to ‘out of date’ scratch cards and whether Postmasters suffered
any losses as a result of this.

i. Where scratch cards went out of date Post Office should have carried the loss and
not passed it through to Postmasters. However, anecdotally it is reported that
some Post Office auditors who had identified out of date scratch cards in branches
recorded this as a loss against the Postmaster.

ii. Despite extensive searches across the business, we cannot definitively say
whether Postmasters suffered a loss or not.

iii. KPMG is working with HMU on the Post Office response to the judgements and this
is one area that it will be examining to give a definitive answer.

iv. We expect that the FOI request will be re-issued by the requester where, given the
KPMG work, Post Office should be better placed to respond.

AWS Move to the Cloud:

17. Good progress is being made from a Data Protection perspective. Questionnaires continue
to be received from upstream clients and are managed on a case-by-case basis. There are
no significant concerns regarding the move to the Cloud and confidence remains high of

Client acceptance of the move.

18. The DP team are currently working with the Project to map out the Privacy Impact
Assessments that will need to be completed and remediated against prior to going live. At 3.2
this stage we are not anticipating any significant risks that will hinder progress.

GDPR Contract Remediation

19. The Contract Remediation project was formally closed at the end of July as reported to
the previous RCC. Work is ongoing on and the number of outstanding contracts has
reduced from eight to seven since the last RCC

20. Of those seven, four are awaiting execution and will be completed by the end of November.

21. Negotiations on the three remaining contracts (Fujitsu, Santander and Kinto (formerly
Inchcape)) are close to completion with no significant barriers to execution.

22. Monthly CRG meetings continue to monitor progress and support negotiations. This will
continue until all outstanding contracts are finalised.

Compliance with Money Laundering Regulations

23. Following the permanent removal of 3,257 and pausing of 2,679 HMRC branch registrations
in May 2020, it has been identified that 6 of the branches that were de-registered as part
of this exercise have completed Travel Money transactions (25 transactions totalling
£6,784.30 between 1* june (HMRC annual registration date) and 28" October 2020).
Post Office is in breach of the regulations in respect of these branches.

24. The IT/Data team have identified historic inconsistencies between Post Office MDM data
and Fujitsu RMD data records, which has caused the issue - a further 35 branch
records are inaccurate, but this has not resulted in transactions to date. A root cause
analysis and correction are still under investigation at the time of writing. We will
investigate where the failure occurred and report back on the appropriate remediation
steps to ensure that branches cannot transact when they are de-registered and/or
what assurance can be provided to reconcile the data between Post Office and Fujitsu.

25. We verbally self-reported the issue to HMRC on 3'¢ November 2020 and have arranged for
the premises to be registered. All of the relevant agent data is held from previous
declarations and can be supplied on the November monthly HMRC report. Given the previous
fine of £800k for premises registration issues in 2016, HMRC may decide to levy a financial
penalty. However, on the basis that there are only 6 impacted branches for a 5 month
period, and limited transactions, we may avoid penalty (previously c.900 premises were
involved going back a number of years). A full written report will be sent to HMRC by 6"
November 2020 once IT/Data investigations have progressed.

26. Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and investigations continue to rise, with 1,427 SARs and
157 investigations in August & September (up from 566 and 111 in August & September
2019). This is driven by branches raising concerns with large and multiple cash deposits,
particularly relating to money transmission businesses. There is also evidence of changing
criminal behaviour due to Covid and the economic uncertainty which is likely to further drive
up suspicious activity in our Network and result in more SARs. We are working closely with
Network teams to ensure customer-facing staff are made aware of the risks and their
responsibilities.

27. We continue to work with banks through the National Economic Crime Centre Project
Admiralty and the Banking Framework members to address the risks of cash laundering via
Post Office. We continue to discuss particular activity with 2 banks in relation to significant
cash deposits at Whitechapel and Philpot Street in East London where we continue to see

£5-7m per week deposited. These banks are currently analysing these deposits, and we

have been advised that some relationships are being exited by them, but we expect a full
response from them in November. If the banks are unable to provide assurances that the 3.2
cash deposited is in line with their KYC, we will ask the banks to make alternative
arrangements for these deposits.

28. From 20' August to 26'" October, 23 Banking Framework cases were investigated (up
35% on the 2019). A number were complex cash deposit cases involving multiple
accounts and banks. To help with increased workloads, a fixed term contract PO started
mid-October, funded to the end of 2020/21. We continue to monitor volumes and their
drivers but suspect this will need to be a permanent resource in 2021/22.

29. From intelligence provided by us, recent law enforcement activity concerning cash
deposits in South and East London resulted in an individual arrested and money seized at
one branch in connection with money laundering offences, we are aware of ongoing
investigations.

30. A meeting was held with our new HMRC regulatory supervisor on 30'" September. HMRC
have indicated that they will not be undertaking proactive supervision activity or branch
visits whilst Covid issued continue.

31. A response was submitted to HMT in respect of the Economic Crime Levy Consultation. The
paper indicated that their preferred option is to have a revenue based levy with some
exemptions for small businesses where it is not cost effective to gather the levy. We have
put forward a position that as all POL regulatory revenue is derived via payment of dividend
and commission from FRES, who are also regulated and subject to the levy, this would
effectively be a ‘double-levy’ and therefore POL revenue should be exempt. We are
unlikely to see a response to the consultation, and the draft legislation until the new year.

32. The risk assessment process was presented at the Commercial lead team meeting and have
since seen an improvement in stakeholder engagement.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption (“ABC”) update

33. Annual ABC training has been completed in September - overall completion is at 96.5% as
at 2"? November 2020, however one Business Unit is at 81.7%, and this unit is being chased.

Whistleblowing Update

34. There has been an increase in new reports during August & September 2020 - 8 compared
to 5 in the same period last year. The majority have been received from agent assistants
and relate to allegations concerning Postmaster activity. There are no trends or issues, and
all investigations are proceeding.

35. We are procuring some initial consultancy work with Protect (UK Whistleblowing Charity) to
benchmark our whistleblowing policy and processes and help us to identify if there are
any control gaps. We are also working with the Postmaster Complaints project to ensure
that there is a centralised view of postmaster complaints or reported concerns. We have
provided copies of our policy and procedures to the HMU Public Inquiry team.

Fit & Proper update

36. There have been a number of teething issues with the new agent F&P system and processes.
A number of technical fixes have been delivered but some issues remain open and
subject to further investigation:

e Errors in Power BI reports produced to drive branch revocation and HMRC reporting
e Data refresh issues

« People data extraction from the Financial Assessment is more cumbersome and
labour intensive than first thought due to missing data on the report

e Legal Status discrepancies are being identified which were not corrected in 3.2
previous declarations. They are being managed but are taking time and resource in
F&P Ops, the Contracts and onboarding teams.

e Development of F&P Release 2 to bring in scope MoneyGram only branches and
‘paused’ bureau branches is on track with a view to deploying into production
before the November change freeze, but this will require changes to processes and
bedding in of new reporting.

e Self-serve declarations for Sole Traders via Branch Hub is also being developed
by Accenture with the intention to have in place for January 2021.

37. These issues are being managed and overseen by the F&P Ops team manager who has built
up expertise since taking on operational responsibility earlier this year, but his role is at risk
in the new structure and the work is being transferred to another area. The F&P project
has been closed, therefore the project team has now been disbanded and no longer able to
provide any oversight or support. If the current F&P Ops manager leaves the business, and
the work is transferred to a new manager, there is a risk that the current issues will take
longer to resolve and regulatory obligations may not be met. We are liaising with HR to
ensure that an appropriate owner is found and a remediation plan for the aforementioned
issues is finalised. This will be brought back to the next RCC/ARC.

38. There are a significant number of changes to roles and responsibilities caused by OE. Due
to the consultations, information on the changes is not available, and therefore keeping
employee F&P tests up to date is challenging. We are working with HR to identify people
leaving the business or moving into impacted roles.

External Threats

39. We have identified a growing trend of suspicious high volume Amazon voucher purchases,
relating to potentially vulnerable customers who fall victim to fraudsters persuading them
to purchase high value/large quantities and send to the fraudster. We have issued a number
of communications to raise network awareness and are supporting the Product Owner to
explore options with Amazon and to strengthen current controls in Horizon by limiting the
number of vouchers that can be sold/the amount or provide additional screen prompts for
staff, currently solutions are being worked on, including timescales for delivery.

40. Following investigation into a suspicious activity report, we identified that high risk
suspicious cash deposits from a Money Service Business (a money transmitter) were being
accepted, via our bill payment reseller client Capita. Money Transmission is assessed by the
National Risk Assessment as high risk for money laundering and such companies require
enhanced due diligence. Our investigation of the deposits and activity identified that there
was a complex structure involving numerous businesses between the customer and the
end recipient, with some activity overseas and a similar structure to known money
laundering typologies?. We are actively working with the Product Owner and Capita
to cease the relationship with the businesses involved, and a meeting with Capita is
scheduled for w/c 16th November 2020 to resolve. As a result of this case, we will work
with the Product team to undertake a review of the existing contractual and control
requirements related to Bill Payment re-sellers, and this will also form part of the Payzone

2 In the AML/CFT context, the term “typology” refers to the various techniques used by criminals to launder money or finance

review.
Supply Chain Compliance

41. One of the 3 FTE has been off with suspected Long-Covid, which together with rising
infection rates across the UK has impacted ability to undertake on-site assessments. A
combination of remote checking, interviews, area manager interviews and site visits to
low risk locations has been implemented.

42. The External Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS) assessment in October was completed
remotely with only one observation identified. The score for ACS was assessed as 104,
which is an increase of 10 from last year and maintains Post Office compliance within the
top 5% businesses in the UK requiring this accreditation, indicating that despite the
challenges over the last 7 months, compliance with ACS standards has improved.

43. An independent check of value stock picking accuracy at Swindon was supported. c.13%
of one day’s volume was checked and errors were identified in 1 in 109 items, despite the
items already having been subject to a 100% operational check, i.e. the discrepancy had
not been identified by the unit's own check. The outcome of the independent check has
been escalated to Supply Chain and the Historic Matters Unit for them to remediate.

3.2

Multi Principal Review of 1st line controls (report expected January 2021).

44. Our three regulatory principals, Capital One, BoI and POMS, are undertaking a joint thematic
review on the controls in place in the 1% line, including the work undertaken by the FS
Compliance team. The scope of this work is far reaching and covers, 1* line controls over
training, approvals, governance and compliance monitoring.

45. We are supportive of this review that will be a useful independent challenge and health
check on our controls.

46. We will share any key findings with this Committee.

Compliance Monitoring
47. Mystery shopping had resumed on a small scale from August covering Over 50s cover
and from the start of Q3 covering, savings and travel insurance.

48. Following the UK Government lockdown announcement on 31% October, with the
agreement of our Principals who take compliance responsibility for our FS business,
mystery shopping has been paused. It is expected in any case that sales of FS products
will be reduced for the future period (for example TI sales will be very low/nil).

49. Following the approach of the 1% general lockdown we will use remote measures to review
compliance performance. This includes quality of sales MI that reviews sales peaks,
cancelation and complaints data. Our BAU governance with the regulatory Principals
will continue so that any additional data from them (such as complaints made to the call
centre) can also be reviewed.

50. For the mystery shopping we have undertaken this year the results from protection business
have been generally good and within appetite. For Travel Insurance we will be using the
small number of shops undertaken before lockdown to assess with POI whether any
aspect of the revised sales process needs to be strengthened for future travel insurance
sales when we can hopefully travel again.

Management Comment provided by Tom Lee (Group Financial Controller)

“Iwas pleased to see the report confirmed my expectations, that a robust controls environment exists
over what is an important and complex area of the business. The nature of revenue recognition across
the organisation, driven by high volume of low value transactions with numerous interplays across
systems and stakeholders, will inevitably lead to variances arising. The processes and controlsin place
are designed so as to keep these variances to a minimum whilst seeking to resolve those that do arise
inatimely manner. We will continue to enhance this area and focus our effortsin the short term on
the actions outlined within this report.”

2. Effectiveness of the Second Line during Covid-19 (Ref.2020/21-07) 3.2

The purpose of this audit was to consider the impact of COVID-19 on
second line of defence functions across Post Office. This report covers
twelve second line functions and consolidates findings from the
interim report issued in July 2020 and three other deep-dive audit
reports.

We conclude that during its response to the first wave of COVID-19,
all second line functions continued to operate and are now better
positioned to meet the challenges of the second wave. We also

the identification of JML triggers. Failures of JML controls have also
been reported by the external auditors on numerous occasions.

AJIML Programme has been initiated by the business to identify and
address control gaps and weaknesses, with regular progress
updates provided to the ARC. JML controls were also covered
within Cyber Maturity Assessments in 2019 and 2020, which
showed a marked increase in maturity between the two reviews,
with maturity targets being met for two of the four domains
covering JML related controls. However, it is generally recognised
that additional work is required to strengthen and automate access
controls.

The purpose of this audit was to validate the work undertaken by
IT to support the business in identifying and remediating gaps in
the effectiveness of JML processes and to assess the state of JML
Processes across the business, with the intention of ensuring only
authorised users have access to POL systems.

We conclude that IT have been making steady progress in
addressing the JML control weaknesses. Considerable progress has
been made over the last two years to enhance controls, through
the implementation of SmartID, tying the creation and removal of
user access to SuccessFactors, and introducing additional checks
over access to key back-office systems.

However, we observed a continued reliance on manual processes
and insufficient coordination between teams responsible for JML,
privileged access and vendor assurance. The roadmap and action
tracker created by IT will support further improvements in JML
processes and we have highlighted additional actions that should
be included in the plan.

We consider the residual risk of unauthorised access to POL
systems to be substantially mitigated by the controls currently in
place, but based on the actions still required, we have rated this
report ‘Needs Improvement’.

Management Comment provided by Tony Jowett (CISO)

“This reportis very timely and helpful in our quest to sort JMLin Post Office. It re-emphasises that
effective JML requires HR and IT to work closely together and the review of all in scope is very
welcome. We agree with the action that we must create a roadmap/plan and would add an additional
one about creating a picture of JML that could serve as a dashboard. Many thanks to IA for shining a

lightin this area.”

4. Branch Hub (Programme Assurance) (Ref.2020/21-12) 3.2

The ‘Branch Hub’ programme was initiated in 2018 to delivera
new digital self-service channel, to replace or support traditional
channels for the interactions between postmasters and back-office
functions. The overall delivery of the minimum viable product
(MVP) and the adoption by Postmasters proved challenging, as
noted in previous audits.

Branch Hub has now demonstrated that it can deliver and that its

in February 2020, Branch Hub has been primarily driven in a short-
term tactical way to prove it could deliver. This strategy was
broadly successful as Branch Hub delivered its main objectives.

However, it did not fully succeed in overcoming the inherent lack of
trust and further constrained resources which resulted in some
previous audit weaknesses not being fully addressed. We once
again note that the programme lacks strategic direction and a
joined up approach on how future features should be linked. GLO
considerations have not been fully considered and embedded. We
also noted additional controls weaknesses associated with the new
delivery model. These gaps impacted on the overall programme
performance, contributing to the present challenges in fully
unlocking the committed FY20/21 benefits.

POST OFFICE LIMITED
RISK & COMPLIANCE REPORT

Title: PCI DSS Compliance Meeting Date: I 12th November 2020

Joseph Moussalli, PCI DSS Jeff Smyth, Interim Group
Programme Manager Chief Information Officer

Author:

Sponsor:

Input Sought: For Noting

The Committee is asked to note:
« What progress has been made during the last reporting period?
e What are the key risks?
for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight

The Risk & Compliance Committees (RCC) has requested a rolling update on PCI-DSS
programme progress.

Executive Summary
The programme consists of 2 core delivery streams:

1. The Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) workstream, which encrypts retail and banking
transactions from the Pin Entry Device (PED) to a PCI compliant zone in Ingenico before
onward processing to Global Payments (retail transactions) or VocaLink (banking
transactions).

2. The Target Operating Model (TOM) workstream which addresses use of PCI data by POL
in processes outside of the transactions occurring at the PED.

Over the course of the last period, 2 key milestones have been completed culminating in the
demonstration of a banking transaction going end to end between the PED and VocaLink.
Additionally, we have completed accreditation of our payments solution and are scheduled to
start a payments pilot through Global Payments on five counters in November

Overall the programme remains on track to begin a pilot with both payments and banking
transactions in March. However, due supplier capacity constraints (in part due to COVID), it
was agreed at the PCI programme steering committee that the Travel Money Card solution will
be delivered as a subsequent release. Unless these constraints can be addressed, and more
capacity becomes available, the timeline for a complete audit will move back to August ‘21.

The Target Operating Model workstream is progressing well and has progressed the secure
solution needed for the Financial Crime team and a solution for processing BIN ranges greater
than 6 digits.

Key updates in the last period:

e PIN pad deployment has been completed. All branches have PIN pads ready for P2PE
activation.
e Retail Payments:
o Ingenico completed the Global Payments accreditation on 19 October 2020.
e Banking transactions:
o Fujitsu, Ingenico and Vocalink completed the 3" banking key milestone - a
demonstration of a withdrawal from a POS located in the Fujitsu environment.
¢ Target Operating Model (TOM)
o Financial Crime Team: Detokenisation application build has been commissioned
with Accenture. This will be hosted on AWS by the Cloud Services team.
o Release I (New): BIN>6 processing workaround has started.
o Travel Money Card: Tokenisation solution agreed with FRES. Ingenico will need
to activate tokenisation in the platform to support this requirement.
e Pivot to Cloud. Working closely with the Pivot to Cloud team to manage dependencies
due to overlapping timescales.

e Finances: We envisage that there will be additional costs mainly due to the following
factors:
o Fujitsu overspend due to underestimating the complexity of the work.
o New release approach - Travel Money card to follow as a standalone release that
extends the duration of the programme by 2-3 months.
o Covid-19 costs.
o E-Portal / tokenisation.
o Additional resourcing costs.

The additional costs are currently estimated to be approximately £1.5m. The
programme will firm up the costs and present these to the governance forums PRB, IC
and Board once these are more well understood.

Questions addressed

1. What has been the progress since the programme last presented in May 2020?
2. What are the key risks and issues on the programme?

o Ingenico has delivered the 3 key development milestone. This milestone provides
a demo that a banking withdrawal can be made from a POS located in the Fujitsu
environment using P2PE through to AXIS and Vocalink.

e POca - JPMorgan has completed the development of its migration to the banking
framework.

« Good progress has been made with the Service contract with no major issues
outstanding. This activity is now expected to complete governance and sign off in
November 2020.

« Astanding executive meeting now occurs every 6 weeks with Executives from both POL
(Nick Read & Jeff Smyth) and Ingenico (Dan Martensson, VP Global Enterprise Sales &
Regional Marketing, and Paula Felstead, Global CTO). Ingenico continues to provide
commitment to achieve full accreditation with Vocalink by the end of January 2020.

Target Operating Model (TOM) Workstream Update

The focus of the Target Operating Model workstream is to review the Products and
Processes that use Card Holder Data and to remediate and remove them from the scope
of the PCI DSS audit where possible. If removal is not possible then PCI DSS controls will
be put in place. A plan has been prepared to remediate the products and processes.

« An additional TOM release has been planned this period - Release I: BIN >6 digits
workaround. Post Office products use BIN ranges greater than the six digits but the
Ingenico product does not process more than six digits for PCI compliant systems. The
Post Office team has worked with the business to adjust products and processes.
However, a substantial workaround solution still needs to be put in place. This
workaround is now being commissioned with Fujitsu, ATOS and Vocalink.

e High Level Solution Design HLD v2.6 has been approved by EAG. It includes the
solution for Travel Money Card using Ingenico tokenisation. This solution has been
agreed with FRES.

e Release A: Obfuscation of PCI data on screens and receipts. The solution has been
developed and deployed into production.

e Release B: Telephone payments. The build has been deployed into production ahead
of schedule.

« Release F (Quatrix): 14-day retention policy implemented on Quatrix. First Quatrix
scan completed (14/08). Results indicate that there are no unauthorised processes
using PCI DSS cardholder data. Mimecast (risk raised last month): A way forward has
been agreed on how to implement alerting rules and a request has been made to
Computacenter to implement DLP rules.

« Release G: PCI DSS compliant solution agreed with EAG for providing full PAN for the
Financial Crime and Banking enquiries team. Accenture has been selected to
implement the Ingenico detokenisation application that will be hosted in AWS.

e Release I (New): BIN>6 processing workaround. Work orders being agreed with
suppliers.

« Success Factors: Support and Support Plus training modules were released onto
Success Factors for Information Security and Data Protection to incorporate PCI DSS
training requirements.

« Change Giving: Change giving has been confirmed as out of scope as Change Giving
cards are not included within card schemes.

2. What are the key risks & issues on the programme?
The following are identified as key risks:

Risk: There is a risk that any changes needed to the Fujitsu/Ingenico software will impact
the plan. Fujitsu and Ingenico have given a commitment to meeting the current timescales
on the basis of no further changes.

Mitigation: Post Office has managed to descope some of the changes identified by
working with the business. At steerco it was agreed to implement two of the essential
changes — BIN>6 processing workaround and Ingenico tokenisation. TMC could not be
accommodated and so this will be delivered as a separate release. The steerco decision
aims to keep the implementation of the P2PE solution for banking on track but there will
be a delay to the PCI DSS compliance completion.

Risk: There is a risk that Santander cannot migrate services to route through Vocalink
within the timescales.

Mitigation: Post Office team is working closely with Santander to produce proposals
including costs and timescales. Santander has allocated resources to scope the work but
this is running at a slow pace. The Post Office Director of Banking Services has been made
aware of the issue.

Risk: There is a risk that Coronavirus may impact the delivery timescales for any supplier
across the entire PCI programme.

Mitigation: Post Office is working with all engaged suppliers to better understand their
contingency plans to ensure that delivery momentum is maintained. This includes the
examination of options to minimise delivery impact by understanding key delivery person
risks, supply chain risks and other indirect or latent dependency factors.

Issue: Due to the complexity of the solution further funds will be needed. Fujitsu is
forecasting an overspend of 10% - £504k; further funds will also be needed to
accommodate the change in delivery approach.

Mitigation: Post Office has challenged the forecast overspend with Fujitsu and will
continue to track and manage this issue. Further funding will be needed.

The latest forecast below was presented to the latest PCI programme steering committee.

The financial forecast will be updated once the revised delivery plan has been firmed up and
resourcing requirements have been confirmed. The table below now includes the Fujitsu
overspend and additional costs for the known essential changes. We are still awaiting quotes
for the remaining changes.

Once the costs are clarified, the programme will present the CR to governance at the earliest
opportunity. The plan is to present the request for additional funding to the Board for review
at its 26th January 2021 meeting.

Executive Summary

e We continue with our programme of work to develop higher levels of cyber maturity.
This month we are focusing on the work to secure our AWS cloud-based migration of the
Belfast Data Centre.

e We ran another fake-phishing attack with results that were very similar to those run in
previous exercises. Strengthening of user education and HR measures may be necessary
to make further gains.

e Our current cyber operations dashboard shows that phishing and data exfiltration from
our network continue to be our main issues. More joint and across the board effort is
needed to establish a cyber-aware culture.

Questions addressed

1. What is the latest update on the cyber programme with a focus on - what are we doing
to ensure our move to cloud is secure?

Securing Cloud for Belfast Exit
6. As part of the Belfast migration a key requirement is, how do we secure the cloud and
demonstrate we are at least as secure today if not more so in AWS than Belfast.

7. Firstly, we need to understand AWS public cloud offering.

AWS operates a shared

responsibility model between its customers and AWS; the below diagram illustrates where
the responsibility sits for each organisation
a. Post Office is responsible for all the services we consume and build on top of the
shared software and hardware provided by AWS. “We’re responsible for
security in the cloud”

b. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services
offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware,
software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services. “AWS is
responsible for security of the cloud”

CUSTOMER

8. AWS responsibility layer removes the management and security responsibility of a physical
data centre, therefore allowing the Post Office to focus time and recourses on protecting
our digital environment without the burden of a physical location. AWS is certified to;

a. ISO 27001 internationally-recognised standard for security management best
practices and comprehensive security control

b. Service Organisation Controls (SOC) 2 Report - evaluates AWS controls meet
the criteria for security, availability, and confidentiality

How has the Post Office worked to delivery security?

9. Securing the cloud is a key responsibility of the CISO, the cyber security team has been
integrated throughout the entire migration, managing the security delivery process;
a. Ensuring the delivery of infrastructure & applications follows Post Office
repeatable secure by design processes.
b. Collaborate with AWS professional service consultants and trusted 3rd parties
c. Implemented AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) which is AWS methodology
for deploying securely into the cloud, focusing on the following security areas
i. Identity & Access Management
ii. Logging & Monitoring
Infrastructure Security
iv. Data Protection
v. Incident response
d. Aligned Post Office Security Control Framework, based on NCSC (National Cyber
Security Centre) 14 Cloud principles for alignment to the wider business.
e. Conducted independent 3rd party IT Health Checks & Penetration tests on
services delivered into the cloud.

Cloud Security Maturity Assessment

10. We instructed a 3rd party to perform an independent cloud security maturity assessment
Six months into our cloud journey to:
a. Identify areas of strength in our approach to cloud security
b. Identify current gaps in maturity and the resultant recommendations
c. Define tactical and strategic objectives to improve maturity

11. We achieved an average score of 3.0 on the Capability Maturity Model Integration scale

(CMMI) with a rating of Defined. Illustrating we have built a solid foundation with
standardised repeatably processes, which will allow us to continue to mature.

Approach to ongoing security assurance

13. To obtain ongoing compliance to Post Office security controls - the security advisory
framework has been established for each application migrating to AWS which includes;
a. Design Review
b. Security Control Assessment
c. Risk Assessment
d. Security testing, IT Health Check & Penetration testing, utilising internal tools or
independent trusted 3" parties
14. The above process will be tracked, and metrics provided once the migration starts to
deliver further services.

Report: What are the results of the recent fake phishing attack and
recommendations?

15. Phishing attacks are most used as successful forms of cyber entry point into an
organisation. Using social engineering and phishing methods, cyber criminals rely on
people to gain access to an organisation. This is orchestrated by delivering malware
through emails as attachments or links which download malicious content on to a users’
machine or the network when clicked. To mitigate, Post Office replicates real-life phishing
simulation campaigns to understand the risk exposure and to educate colleagues.

16. Our stats for a fake phishing campaign in October 2020 are shown below:
Emails sent 4,047
Total colleagues reporting as a scam 1,154 4.2
Total colleagues “lured” *391
Post Office security measures initiated (average) 73 seconds
Total colleagues lured before mitigation 6
Skipped Training 178

17. For our defences to work correctly then we need users to report phishing emails rapidly
so that others do not then receive the emails - the AI engines can only do so much and
need user help to be accurate.

18. The two critical measures therefore are time taken for our security measures to recognise
this specific attack as dangerous (73 seconds) and the number of colleagues who clicked
or opened the attachment BEFORE these measures kicked is 6. This means that we could
be dealing with 6 infected machines. Where payload from the attack included ransomware,
then any one of those infections could result in a serious hit on our ability to operate as
an organisation. The ransomware could have the ability for lateral movement and to
replicate itself across Post Office.

19. Trends from all recent fake attacks shown in the diagram below:

20. Compared with recent fake attacks we have seen slight improvement towards reporting
of phishing emails, but on average across all he fake campaigns about 45% will read
phishing emails but not report it. Approximately 34% will report a phishing email.
Approximately 17% of lured users who read and clicked the email, only 6% will commit
to completing recommended training. This signifies a need to close the gap between
people reading the email and those who report emails. Crucially for those who click on
phishing emails, the gap between lured and training should be close to 0.

21. Whilst there has been some improvement in the response to the attacks, they have not
been material - meaning we have more work to do on the people aspects around phishing.

22. These stats show clear need for awareness across the business. As part of this we will be
conducting, Cyber Lunch & Learn sessions to ensure our colleagues can ask questions 4.2
about cyber in general. We will also explore with HR the potential for disciplinary action .
for repeat offenders.

23. Cyber will continue similar test attacks over the coming weeks and months - and we'll
continue to report back the findings. We'll be starting a more regular pattern of
communication over the coming weeks, to bring to life and highlight some of the tactics
used by attackers, some of the more sophisticated patterns of attack and to provide advice
for use both at home and at work.

Report: What are the highlights from the Current cyber dashboard?

24. Appendix 1 shows the current cyber operational metrics dashboard.

25. Key points to note are:

a. Phishing attacks continue to risk albeit the rate of increase has slowed. We
therefore need to continue with our work on fake attacks and user education.

b. There are significant volumes of users that trigger DLP personal mail policy —
again showing that we need to continue with user education.

c. Change Assurance and Compliance trends demonstrate a reduction in net new
actions, albeit activity within key programmes i.e. Belfast exit and PCI have
increased. We expect a further up-tick in actions from the nascent SPM
programme in the next few weeks.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Title: Joiners, Movers, Leavers Update Meeting Date: I 12 November 2020 43
. Tony Jowett, Chief Information . . .
Author: Security Officer Sponsor: Jeff Smyth, Interim Group CIO

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note the status and plans regarding the reduction of risk associated
with Joiners, Movers and Leavers (JML) - in particular those associated with Movers during the
current hybrid operating model, for onwards submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight

Actions to report on this occurred at the previous Risk and Compliance Committee (RCC)
meetings.

Executive Summary

In our continued focus on Joiners, Movers, and Leavers we have performed a deep dive on the
Movers process, following on from the previous report’s focus on Leavers. Our analysis covers
a period for which COVID-19 continues to be actively changing our operating model and
introducing new challenges. Short term and longer-term actions are included for movers and
an update is provided on the actions raised in the previous paper.

In addition, we have worked closely with Internal Audit who have reviewed JML across the
business and IT platforms. In line with this review we are drawing up a roadmap and plan for
improving JML within Post Office to give further clarity on dates, achievement, and
operationalisation of good JML practices.

Report

4.3

OF BrGe! Ny

1. In this report we are focusing in on the Movers process for staff and contractors as this
presents the next greatest risk to the business to Leavers and is a process that is likely
to be tested during the current and future Organisation Development activities.

What are the complexities that we need to address associated with the Movers
process?

2. Effective moving of role in POL is reliant on that the old- and new-line managers
informing People Team and IT what is happening and what corresponding data access is
required. Guidance is available for line managers with a detailed checklist on the Post
Office Intranet and People Team business partners reinforce this process.

cm For any Mover the ideal behaviour is that the access rights associated with the old role
are dropped and then rights are created in line with the needs of the new role.

4. The Movers process needs to cope with the different types of mover covering at least:

a. Formal role move resulting from a vacancy being made available, interviews and
job award

b. Formal secondment for up to a year from a substantive role

c. Informal secondment to cover a temporary absence or gap

5. There is a heavy reliance on line management in Post office to run the movers process.
Informal and Formal Secondments do not get tracked routinely on Success Factors - -
they only appear if line management remember to do it. Likewise, any associated
changes to IT data access — they only get changed if line management remember to do
it.

6. Good movers practice would also be backed up by a periodic data recertification activity
that would pick up an movers data access that was incorrect.

How well have managed those complexities during the period July-September 2020?

7. People Team do not routinely produce a report regarding movers in the same way they
do for leavers. The lack of such a report also means there is no routine oversight or
auditing of this process. Success is therefore heavily dependent on line managers doing
the right thing at the right time.

@

8. The People Shared Service Centre (PSSC) were able to produce a custom report showing
those whose role title had changed and from this a subset of people who were movers
was identified manually. By this analysis there were 34 people who had moved role
during this period - on average one every other day.

9. For each of those 34 people a check was performed with IT service desk to see if any 4.3
data change requests had been made by line management - as per guidance on POL .
intranet. The IT service desk confirmed that no such requests had been received for
these individuals from anyone.

10. In the end user computing environment data recertification checks are not performed or
coordinated centrally - they are reliant on individual data owners doing their own checks
as and when they deem it necessary.

11. The recommended improvement actions are:

a. PSSC to produce a monthly mover’s report (like the leavers report) to go to each
GE area for confirmation by line management and to go to IT Service Desk
(Target Jan 2021)

b. IT Service to develop the ability to automatically drop a mover’s access and
create new access in line with the new role (Target Jan 2021)

c. Develop a fit for purpose data recertification mechanism to catch any
inappropriate data access (Jan 2021)

d. People Team to continue with efforts to move PSSC to Service Now enabling
case management across People Team and IT (previously identified action -
dates as per roadmap/action plan and in progress with approvals)

What progress have we made on the actions identified in the last paper?

12. In the last paper we identified a series of actions around JML. Of these 11 were due by
end October.

13. Of the 11 due for completion
a. 6 have been completed
b. 4 are in progress with estimated completion dates in November. These are
i. Recruitment of JML/Controls analysts x 2 - we are searching for suitable
candidates
ii. Production of GE leavers report - with PSSC to produce draft report
iii. Privileged access additional approvals by CIO/CISO (feasibility being
investigated with PAM team),
iv. Spot auditing of 3rd parties where we currently have attestation only
(resource offered role and starting in December)
c. 1 pending PRB approval (PSSC move to SNOW)

What are the key points and actions arising from the recent audit of JML?

14. An audit of JML by Internal Audit (IA) has just been completed with a report to be
presented at this meeting.

15. The purpose of this audit was to validate the work undertaken by IT to identify and
remediate any gaps in the coverage of JML processes and to assess 4.3
whether these will address the requirements for all user types across all platforms.

16. A summary of the high-level findings of this report and an initial response to them is

Title: centre Disaster Recovery Meeting Date: I 12 November 2020
Author: Gary Walker, IT Director Sponsor: Jeff Smyth, Group CIO

Input Sought: For Noting

The Committee is asked to note the follow on plan regarding the Belfast datacentre disaster
recovery test.

Executive Summary

1. The Fujitsu Belfast datacentre currently hosts Horizon and other business critical
applications used to deliver branch counter services. Disaster recovery failover testing of
the estate is due annually. The previous test was performed in October 2019 and for 2020
the test date was agreed as August 29th 2020.

2. In 2019 the original test was to fail over on Saturday evening, deliver services from the
disaster recovery secondary site on Sunday, then fail back Sunday evening. This test failed
and a plan was put in place to remediate and re-test. This re-test was completed in
October 2019 but with a reduced test scope carried out over only one night which was
successful.

3. For 2020, it was agreed that in addition to the original failover and failback plan from
2019, we would run services for a full day of trading in the secondary (disaster recovery)
site before failback to the primary Data Centre.

4. During the 2020 test, failover to the secondary datacentre was completed within 4 hours
but this was 2 hours behind schedule due to a delay in failover of core networking
components. Fujitsu (post-test) subsequently completed investigation into the root cause
and mitigating actions have now been implemented.

5. Testing during failover resulted in 48 of the 51 tests completing successfully. There were
three Services which did not pass testing: (i) Debit Card transactions via the TNS service,
(ii) Telecoms and (iii) National Express transactions. Due to the 2 hour delay in failover,
there was limited time to troubleshoot the failed tests. As Debit Card transactions were
deemed a critical service for trading a decision was made for trading on Sunday on the
secondary environment to be abandoned and failback to production. This was to ensure
that all services would be available for start of day on Sunday.

6. The risk position is considered to be unchanged following this test as subsequent to the
test Fujitsu have investigated and implemented mitigated for all failed components.

7. Four options are available as part of our next step actions and one of these has been
recommended which is to complete only failed component testing and defer wider testing
to an appropriate point in the Belfast Exit programme

Report - What is the result of the 2020 failover test?

8. Due to Covid the test was deferred from the early part of the year which required a
reasonable amount of re-planning. The planning for the test commenced 10 weeks before
the test date, working with key business stakeholders and partners. Model Office were
fully engaged to ensure full regression testing across the platform. No major obstacles
were encountered in the planning however it was challenging to get full Business User
engagement for testing across all the services in scope.

9. A POL change freeze was implemented to take effect just prior to the event, but some
confusion ensued as this was out of alignment with Fujitsu’s change freeze. Better
alignment on this matter is needed in future and it has been noted as a lesson learnt.

10. Pre-failover baselining was completed successfully on Thursday and Friday (27th and
28th). All Go/No Go stage checkpoints were attended by IT Senior Stakeholders, Business
Representatives, POL Test Teams and partners. No blockers to a Go decision was voiced
on any occasion and Failover commenced as planned 19:00, Saturday 29th. A Gantt chart
showing progress versus plan is shown in the Appendix 1.

11. The comms plan was executed well with good communications and effort throughout from
all parties and partners. However, three Clients (Santander, Camelot and GlobalPay)
reported issues during the planned outage. It was subsequently confirmed that they had
been properly informed of the test timelines and impact, but they had not passed on this
notification internally. Positive confirmation from all partners has been added as a lesson
learnt for future tests.

12. Call bridges worked well with timely attendance noted and helpful input provided by all as
needed. Hourly reports were produced via Horice as an aid to monitoring stability and
availability during the execution of the test which provided an active view of the entire
transactional state across all branches and counters.

13. The plan expected the Core Services (banking) to be available at approximately 23:30.
Despite being approximately 30 mins ahead of schedule early in the plan Fujitsu informed

us at 22:38 that we were no longer ahead of schedule due to key network components
taking longer to failover (network stabilisation issue).

14. At 23:30 Fujitsu informed us that that they were now running 1 hour 10 mins behind due
to further restarting of underlying infrastructure to rectify the network stabilisation issue.
A follow up review was scheduled for midnight.

15. At 00:00, Fujitsu indicated the ETA for Core Services was now 01:30. The progress was
monitored closely, and core services were made available at 01:00.

16. After some initial slowness, testing commenced with notable results which included
Banking services being tested successfully at 01:30 am.

17. Testing of all other services commenced testing at approximately 01:45 where it was
reported that (i) debit card (TNS) transactions were not working. Two further test failures
occurred for (ii) Telecoms and (iii) National Express were reported.

18. The delay in the failover of data centres (due to the network stabilisation issue) resulted
in very limited time to diagnose and correct any issues by the ‘point of no return’ deadline
of 2:30 am, at which point the decision had to be made to fail back or remain in the
secondary disaster recovery site for Sunday trading. As no fix for the Debit card issue was
imminent, at 2:15 the decision was made to fail back to the primary datacentre to ensure
full service availability for Sunday trading.

19. The failover back to the Primary Data Centre was very successful being completed ahead
of plan by 1.5 hours, with no issues (see Appendix 1). The majority of batches completed
successfully with no processing issues found. Two files sent via the PODG (Post Office Data
Gateway) system were delayed by approximately one day due to the nature of how they
are created (they require input from other 3rd parties). It was agreed that deeper analysis
of impact to PODG should be done in future to allow better communication to processing
parties in future tests. This has been noted as a lesson learnt.

20. Horice was utilised on Sunday to double check that all transaction types were completing
successfully with volumes within normal Sunday trading levels.

21. Fujitsu agreed to perform full root cause analysis, evaluate and to advise in due course
with the expectation that remediation will be made as needed. At the time of writing this
report, the root cause of all failed elements have been rectified.

22. Post Test Weekend Observations and Comments have been documented in Appendix 2.

Report — Has the test altered the risk position?

23. Overall it is considered that the Fujitsu risk profile has not changed materially as a result
of this test. 48 out of 51 Services did (functionally) failover and all services failed back and
were successfully tested. During the failover, test transactions done in Model Office were
successfully replicated to the secondary site and evidence could be seen of these being
stored successfully on the Horizon database. Though the test cannot be considered 100%
successful, the failed components would not prevent POL from being able to meet key
service delivery obligations in response to a disaster.

24. The Current Risk Score is 6 (Medium) and remains so due to the following 2 factors:
e Full Days trading Volume in secondary datacentre not tested

e Data replication of full day’s trading from secondary back to primary datacentre not
tested, however, evidence of data replication was seen as a result of model office
testing (this proves the mechanism but not the ability to cope with a full days
transactional load)

Report - Next Steps

25. There are four options available to us with regards to further risk mitigation (if required).
Our recommendation and current plan is to proceed with option d:

a) Assurance of Failed components
Do not conduct a full failover again but seek to verify the 3 components that failed in
isolation. This will provide confidence that the components that failed have been
corrected. This gives nil cost impact as these activities can be tested in BAU. There
will be only minor interruption to BAU during testing. Note that 2 of the 3 components
were successfully tested in October after having the root cause of failure fixed.

b

5

Failover to secondary disaster recovery site, re-test failed components only

Conduct the failover again, but only retest the remediated components and then fail
back. We would not plan to run for the day in the secondary disaster recovery site.
This provides only marginally more risk assurance than option (a). Estimated cost of
£40,000 with expected outage to business of 8 hours over a Saturday night. Given
proximity to peak period, this would need to be done in 2021 but with close liaison
with the Belfast Exit programme as the underlying estate is fundamentally changing
as this programme continues to execute.

Cc

LS

Repeat the full disaster recovery test, with initial scope to remain in IRE19
for full day Sunday trading

Repeat the test with the full scope, including running on the secondary disaster
recovery site for a day. This would provide full assurance that disaster recovery is but
would be disruptive to the business as well as carrying the highest cost. Estimated
cost of £80,000 including additional supplier support and Project Management
resource to run the event. Expected outage to the business would be 4 hours Sat
night, 5 hours Sunday night and potentially more. Given proximity to peak period,
this would need to be done in 2021 but with close liaison with the Belfast Exit
programme as the underlying estate is fundamentally changing as this programme
continues to execute. The next appropriate long weekend would be over Easter.

d) Complete only failed component testing and defer wider testing to Belfast
Exit
Verify the 3 components that failed in isolation after remedial activity is undertaken
(option a), then move the scope of the wider disaster recovery test into the Belfast
Exit programme of work to occur once the virtual datacentres are ready. Once ready,
run an equivalent disaster recovery exercise. There would be no cost impact as this
activity is already covered under the Belfast Exit programme. However, the exercise
will look materially different to the existing physical test as the majority of services
will be resilient by design and therefore will only need limited testing

POST OFFICE LIMITED
RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

ae The Historical Operation of Meeting
aisle Suspense Accounts Date: a2 November 2020
Mark Underwood, LCG
Operations Director, Tom Lee, Ben Foat Group General
Author: Financial Controller & Tim Sponsor: Counsel & Alisdair Cameron,
Perkins, Head of Security, Group Chief Finance Officer
Safety & Loss Prevention

Input Sought:

The Committee is asked to note the findings from KPMG's review of Post Office’s historical
operation of suspense accounts for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight

.

Post GLO Settlement Programme SteerCo of 1 July 2020.
Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) and ARC of 13 July and 27 July 2020, respectively.

Executive Summary

1.

Allegations continue to be made that Post Office may have recovered sums from Postmasters
which were not ‘real losses’ to Post Office as they were housed in suspense accounts and
taken to profit by Post Office.

. KPMG were instructed to review Post Office’s current operation of suspense accounts. Given

the robust and transparent investigations process that is undertaken, their principal finding
was that how these suspense accounts are operated today should not result in Post Office
pursuing Postmasters for sums it had or could eventually take to profit (nor had any evidence
been presented to indicate this had happened).

. The ARC approved instructing KPMG to also review Post Office’s historical operation of

suspense accounts. This review involved looking at two suspense accounts - the Agent
Creditor Suspense Account and the Customer Creditor Suspense Account.

. The Agent Creditor Suspense Account. From their review of historical practice, KPMG has

found no evidence to suggest that amounts posted to this account relate to discrepancies
which should have been repaid to Postmasters.

. The Customer Creditor Suspense Account should only include sums that relate to outstanding

/ unmatched customer funds. KPMG's finding is that overall, a robust resolution process
appears to have been in place for each product type that is posted into this account and
branch affecting discrepancies should not be included within this account, which is a holding
account for customer’s money. However, KPMG has identified two exceptions — both of which
are caused by Postmaster error or failing to follow prescribed process:

i, Where Postmasters have accepted cheques made out to Post Office as payment for
certain services but have incorrectly recorded this transaction as having been paid for

in cash and the supporting information (which would include branch details) also then
becomes separated from the associated cheque when the Postmaster sends the cheque
to the Post Office Cheques Team to process.

ii. When, between November 2015 and April 2019, Postmasters failed to follow the then
prescribed two part cancellation process for MoneyGram Transactions, which also
coincided with unrelated connectivity issues.

6. KPMG has advised that further investigation into these two potential issues is difficult given
the lack of available data held within Post Office and is unlikely to add any further information
especially in relation to quantification to that already included in their report and this paper.
Further, if a branch were to have made such errors, they would manifest themselves as
shortfalls which if they dispute, the Historical Shortfall Scheme provides a mechanism for
such claims to be investigated.

7. HSF and Peters and Peters have however been asked ['
to advise whether these findings and the KPMG
report are disclosable as part of Post office’s ongoing disclosure obligations to those it has
prosecuted historically and as part of any future claims made against Post Office as a result
of historical practices, in both a civil and criminal context.

Questions addressed

What was the scope of KPMG‘s review, its limitations and findings?

Report

1. KPMG were instructed to perform a review into Post Office’s historical operation of suspense
accounts. The scope of this review was as follows:

e Conduct research into historical suspense account operating practices pre-March 2019,
holding discussions with key individuals and reviewing relevant documentation (where
still available) to:

i. Identify any additional relevant suspense accounts to the 4 which were identified
during their review of Post Office’s current operation of suspense accounts.

ii. Identify any changes in the suspense account operating processes during the
relevant time period, which would significantly alter the way the identified accounts
operated and whether these changes could have potentially had an adverse impact
on the Postmasters; and

iii. Understand whether the historical resolution processes adopted by Post office for
dealing with amounts posted into these suspense accounts were sufficient to
identify potential instances where amounts should have been reconciled against
branch discrepancies made good by Postmaster.

e Undertake historical analysis of balances held within the relevant suspense accounts for
the relevant time period (where data was still available) to establish whether postings
to these accounts have altered, and if so the potential impact.

e Perform a high level review of the Tier 2 investigation data arising over the past 12
months to inform their understanding of how amounts could get posted to the relevant
suspense accounts

KPMG’s Findings

2. KPMG’‘s review into how Post Office currently operates the relevant’ suspense accounts
concluded that, given the robust and transparent investigations process that is undertaken,
these suspense accounts should not result in Post Office pursuing Postmasters for sums it
had or could eventually take to profit (nor had any evidence been presented to indicate
Post Office had). This was because sums housed in these suspense accounts were either:

e not taken to a profit and loss account; or
e relate to unmatched transactions due to customers (not postmasters); or
¢ relate to surpluses rather than shortfalls.

3. KPMG’s review into the historical practices did not identify any additional relevant suspense
accounts to those which formed part of their review of current practices. Further, KPMG
were informed by Post Office employees, including the product team leaders responsible
for posting amounts to the relevant suspense accounts that no changes had been made in
the operating processes since they had been established?.

4. As such, KPMG‘s overarching finding from its review into how Post Office currently operates
these suspense accounts should therefore also apply to the historical operation of these
suspense accounts, though it should be recognised, as you would expect, Post Office’s
investigation into discrepancies has evolved and improved, with the introduction of the Tier
Two Investigation Team.

5. The two relevant suspense accounts identified by KPMG are the Agent Creditor Suspense
Account (ACSA) and the Customer Creditor Suspense Account (CCSA). Taking these in turn:

e The ACSA holds surplus discrepancies which Postmasters (as opposed to Post Office)
dispute being due back to them. In respect of this account, KPMG’s finding from its
review of historical practices is that is has seen no evidence to indicate amounts posted
to this account related to shortfalls which should have been repaid to Postmasters.

« The CCSA should only have items posted to it once it has been determined that they
relate to outstanding customer funds (as opposed to Postmaster shortfalls). Thus, branch
affecting discrepancies should not be included within this account, which is a holding
account for customer’s money. KPMG's finding is that overall, a robust resolution process
appears to have been in place for each product type that is posted into this account. This
process identified instances where amounts needed to be reconciled against branch
discrepancies prior to them being posted into this account However, KPMG’s has
identified two exceptions:

a. Where Postmasters have accepted cheques made out to Post Office as payment
for certain services but have incorrectly recorded this transaction as having been

+ Accounts into which Post Office places sums that could relate to discrepancies at a branch level and from which unmatched
sums are taken into the P&L account

2 It should be noted however that there is no formal documentation detailing what operational processes were or were not in
place.

paid for in cash and the supporting information (which would include branch
details) also then becomes separated from the associated cheque when the
Postmaster sends the cheque to the Post Office Cheques Team to process (“Post
Office Bulk Cheques Issue”).

b. When, between November 2015 and April 2019, Postmasters failed to follow the
then prescribed two part cancellation process for MoneyGram Transactions, which
also coincided with unrelated connectivity issues (‘MoneyGram Issue”)

Each of these are discussed in further detail below.

6. The CCSA was established in April 2010 and the ACSA was established in January 2012.
Prior to the establishment of the ACSA, such surpluses remained on Postmasters personal
accounts, which were not released to Post Office’s P&L account and remained on that
account until claimed by a Postmaster. Prior to establishment of the CCSA, the Client
Creditor Suspense Account was used to house unmatched customer monies (as well as
unmatched client monies). KPMG performed a high level review of transactions posted to
Client Creditor Suspense Account from 2005 (the earliest date for which data is available)
to 2020 and held discussions with the relevant Post Office employees who manage this
account. Limited documentation is available for the Client Creditor Suspense Account prior
to 2018, but no further potential issues to those noted above were identified by KPMG.

The MoneyGram Issue: Postmasters failing to follow the two part cancellation
process requirements for MoneyGram Transactions and unrelated connectivity
problems

7. In November 2015, Post Office made changes to the how MoneyGram transactions were
cancelled on Horizon. Postmasters were required to perform a two part cancellation process
whereby the transaction had to be reversed through the Postmasters till (the Horizon EPOS)
and also cancelled within the MoneyGram interface (also within the Horizon EPOS).

8. In April 2019 Post Office changed the process so that both elements were linked into a one
part cancellation process.

9. KPMG were informed by the Post Office MoneyGram product team that during the same
time period, MoneyGram transactions experienced connectivity issues.

10.The changes to the MoneyGram cancellation process resulted in an increased number of
errors being made by Postmasters when cancelling MoneyGram transactions. In addition,
connectivity issues resulted in an increase in unmatched MoneyGram balances that the
MoneyGram product team needed to investigate.

11.Post Office subsequently stood up a team of 8 individuals who undertook a large-scale
investigation with MoneyGram to try to resolve these unmatched items and identify

customers and Postmasters who may be due money back as a result of these issues. This
investigation ran during 2017 and 2018.

12.All MoneyGram transactions are date stamped, with each posting also including the branch
FAD code. As such, for each MoneyGram transaction, it was possible to identify the branch
where it was performed and when.

13.For each unmatched MoneyGram transaction, the investigation team reviewed whether
there was any contemporaneous data from the branches identified to indicate that a
MoneyGram transaction had not been cancelled in accordance with the two part process.

14.Where the data showed a MoneyGram transaction had been cancelled on Horizon but had
not also been cancelled on the MoneyGram interface, on the date in question, transaction
corrections were issued to move the loss to the Postmaster. The transaction correction
included enough detail for the Postmaster to correct the original error if the money had not
been collected by the recipient.

15.Where the data showed a MoneyGram transaction had not been reversed on Horizon but
had been cancelled on the MoneyGram interface on the date in question and where the
investigations team could identify the issue related to a branch error a transaction
corrections was issued to repay Postmasters.

16.Where the data did not indicate a branch error or indicated a customer loss the unmatched
sums were posted to the Customer Creditor Account.

17.Investigations did not include speaking to branches unless Postmasters contacted Post
office, regarding MoneyGram related discrepancies.

18. Enquiries have been made with individuals still at Post Office who were part of the 8 person
investigation team, including the Team Leader. Although weekly MI was said to be
produced, reporting on progress, none has been able to be produced owing to emails not
being retained (though they would likely be available via the mimecast archive). It has not
been possible therefore to determine to total amount returned to Postmasters.

19.What has been determined is that £615,178 could not be matched and was posted to the
CCSA in 2017. This was split across 1,804 branches with 97% having a balance of less than
£2,000 and the largest balance being £5,400.

20.Given the level of investigation undertaken by a separate team, the ease with which an
affected branch and potential branch shortfall could be identified and the level of exposure
at each branch, KPMG‘s view is that the risk that the £615,178 includes a significant balance

relating to Postmasters is low and this balance is more likely to relate to customer losses.
However, the lack of available documentation means a residual risk remains.

Bulk Post Office Cheques Issue: Postmasters Incorrectly Processing Cheques as
Cash

21.A number of products Post Office offers can be paid for through cheques which are made
payable to Post Office (as opposed to the client) For instance DVLA payments, These are
known as “Bulk Post Office Cheques”. There is a defined process for accepting such cheques

and then sending them to Post Office to process which, if followed correctly, should identify
any Postmaster Bulk Post Office cheque processing errors, with a Transaction Correction
subsequently issued.

22.However, if a Postmaster accepts a Bulk Post Office Cheque as payment but, in error,
records that the transaction was paid for in cash, more cash will be expected in the till than
is physically there.

23.1f when then sending the Bulk Post Office Cheque to Post Office, the branch information
which should accompany the cheque also becomes separated from the cheque - the
payment is made to the recipient but as there is no matching transaction on Horizon (i.e.
as it was processed as cash) it is difficult for the Cheques Team to identify which branch
has made the error and for a Transaction Correction to be issued.

24.If Postmasters realise the error they have made, they are able to contact the Cheques Team
to rectify the error. Further, the Cheques Team proactively attempt to identify branches
where there are high value (>£500) Bulk Post Office cheques with no supporting branch
information, but if the branch is not identified, the cheque value is subsequently posted to
the CCSA.

25.c£134k has been posted to the CCSA as a result of Bulk Post Office Cheques Issues since
it was established in 2010. Although a proportion of this sum could relate to branch
shortfalls caused by Postmaster error, it will also include:

i. Customer losses: e.g. a Bulk Post Office Cheque is processed but a corresponding
bill payment is not made / not made in full (for example, a DVLA transaction is not
processed through the till on Horizon or the DVLA interface but the cheque is
accepted and sent for processing. The cheque is banked by POL but DVLA will not
process the transaction or request payment as it is not on their system

ii. Matching Errors: e.g. the transaction is recorded correctly but the Bulk Post Office
Cheque becomes separated from its supporting information when being sent to Post
Office for processing. The customer's payment is correctly made, the Postmaster’s

26.KPMG's understanding is that it is not possible to identify what proportion of the £134k is

lack of available supporting information documented on the cheque.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

Title: Duplicate Transaction Corrections I weeting pate: I 12 November 2020
7 Tim Perkins, Head of Security, . Al Cameron, Group Chief Finance
Ractive Safety & Loss Prevention Spuruats Officer

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note an incident on 14/10/2020 where 571 cash surplus / shortage
duplicate Transaction Corrections were issued to 449 Branches in error along with the steps
taken to remediate the issue and avoid a reoccurrence.

Executive Summary

On 15/10/2020 it became known that 571 cash surplus / shortage Transaction Corrections
(TCs) had been duplicated. This was brought to light by several calls from branches to the
Branch Reconciliation Team (BRT) and the National Cash Centre Accounts & Reconciliation
Team (NCCART), which led to an investigation. The cause was quickly identified as an individual
within BRT who had bypassed the quality control mechanism which is for each batch of TCs to
be reviewed and signed off by a manager. In this case, the first issue of the TCs on 12/10/2020
had bypassed the quality control check, but the second time these were issued, the individual
followed the correct process.

To remediate this, all 449 branches were immediately sent a memoview (Appendix A) to
acknowledge and apologise for the error. A further TC to correct the error was arranged and
sent the same day 15/10/2020 to correct the branch accounts.

The incident was reported to the Historical Matters Unit for information.

A Branch Focus article was issued to the entire network along with the incident being included
in Amanda Jones’ regular communication to branches to remind branches to report anything
that looks strange or that they do not understand and to assure them we will listen and
investigate. (Appendix B)

The matter is being dealt with under the Conduct Code with the individual concerned, with the
first step being a full fact-find.

In parallel, investigations are underway with Accenture to establish whether a failsafe can be
introduced to prevent either the QA bypass or duplicate TCs being issued.

Questions addressed

1. How did this incident occur?
2. What steps were put in place to remediate the incident?

3. What further steps are being taken to prevent such an incident happening again?

Report

4. An incident occurred where 571 duplicate TCs were issued to 449 branches as a result of
an individual failing to follow the quality control process. In bypassing this process, the
individual sent the first batch without the prescribed check by a manager within the Branch
Reconciliation Team and also failed to check these off as a completed task.

5. The second time the TCs were issued, all relevant checks were made, but these checks
are designed to ensure accuracy of the TCs and the associated wording for branches and
would not check whether the TCs had already been issued since this should not be possible
under the process if followed correctly.

6. The incident came to light due to calls from branches which allowed a speedy investigation
and a remediation plan to be put in place.

7. The branches concerned were sent a memoview to explain what had happened and to
apologise for the incident. Appendix A

8. Additionally, the Historical Matters Unit were informed due to potential repercussions
within the context of GLO.

9. A branch-wide communication was issued on 15/10/2020 to report the incident to all
branches to ensure transparency of this issue since there is no fail-safe in place today.
This communication also reminded branches to contact the telephone number on TCs if
they have any concerns as a reassurance to them, although we know this issue was
contained to the 449 branches only.

10. The issue is being dealt with under the Conduct Code for the individual concerned and it
is expected the full fact find will identify improvement opportunities which will be
implemented over the next weeks and months, along with further supervisory checks.

11. Additionally, Accenture have been engaged to explore a technical fail-safe to either
prevent management controls being ignored or over-ridden, or preventing duplicate TCs
being issued.

12. These last two points are to be pursued by Alison Bolsover and Colette McAteer who
manage the Branch Reconciliation Team and have been added to their Q3 objectives.

Risk Assessment, Mitigations & Legal Implications

13. Post Office is addressing this issue consistently with the duties implied by the GLO
Common Issues Judgment into postmaster contracts, through its communications to the
affected branches and wider network, and by ensuring that affected postmasters are not
held liable for any financial impact the issue may have had to their branch accounts.

14. Changes were made to Post Office processes and controls relating to the management of
TCs as part of Network Operation’s remediation response to the Common Issues
Judgment. The incident outlined in this paper demonstrates the importance of ensuring
that those processes and controls are subject to ongoing review, monitoring and
assurance.

Stakeholder Implications

15. The impacted stakeholders in this issue were Postmasters. The actions taken to
communicate and resolve the issue mitigated the impact on Postmasters and, to date, no
complaints have been raised about the remediation actions taken by Post Office.

Next Steps & Timelines

16. The two actions in place; 1) the full fact find into the incident as part of the Conduct Code
and 2) the investigation into a technical solution via Accenture, to be completed by 30
November. In the event of a technical solution being preferred, this will be established as

a Prove plan / short project for consideration by PRB and sponsored by Amanda Jones /
Dan Zinner.

Duplicate Transaction Corrections
Last week some branches received duplicate Transaction Corrections for Cash surpluses/shortages in error. Thank
you to branches who called us to raise this issue. The team identified the problem and a compensating Transaction
Correction was issued on Horizon for acceptance on Friday 16 October to correct the situation.

The duplicate Transaction Corrections was a result of human error within the Branch Reconciliation team who issue
Transaction Corrections. The controls that prevent this type of error occurring are urgently being reviewed and we'll
be making changes to improve the process. Mistakes like this do happen, and we’ll be open about them with you.

If you receive a Transaction Correction notice and have a question or are concerned about it, the notice will include a
phone number to contact for more information. We've provided a full update in this week’s branch focus.

Transaction Corrections - Guidance

This is to notify Postmasters that last week 449 branches were issued duplicate Transaction Corrections for
Cash surpluses/shortages in error. This was as a result of human error within the Branch Reconciliation team
who issue Transaction Corrections.

As soon as we were aware of this error, we sent a memoview (MBS 273) to the affected branches. This explains
that the Transaction Corrections issued on Monday 12 October had been duplicated in error on Wednesday 14
October (appearing on Horizon on Thursday 15 October). A compensating Transaction Correction was issued to
appear on Horizon for acceptance on Friday 16 October to correct the situation.

The controls that should prevent this type of error occurring are under urgent review and will be updated and
amended where necessary, including retraining. However, if you are ever uncomfortable with a Transaction
Correction or the reason for it isn’t clear, please do call the telephone number which is always provided on the
Transaction Correction narrative to report this so we can investigate and make sure it is correct.

Thank you to those branches who did call us about this error. This enabled us to quickly identify the duplication
issue and resolve it for the branches concerned.

Thank you for your support and we apologise for the inconvenienced caused by this issue.

Environment
Christine Kirby, Financial Controls taal a
Author: Manager & Tom Lee, Financial Sponsor: Alledatr Ganapren, Group Chine
Finance Officer
Controller

Input Sought: Noting

The Risk & Compliance Committee (“RCC”) is asked to note the update on the Financial
Reporting Controls (“FRC”) environment, including improvements made since the last report to
the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”) in 2019 and details on future focus, for
onward submission to the ARC.

Previous Governance Oversight
e Prior year report was presented to ARC for noting on 23 September 2019.

Executive Summary

Since the last report to the RCC and ARC, the FRCF has continued to be improved through
process reviews and controls testing. This has enabled the FRCF to become more streamlined
and risk focused. Looking forward, the aim is for the FRCF to transfer to ServiceNow (or another
provider) in order to be more agile, efficient and to create synergies between Central Risk and
Financial Controls, as well as allowing PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to mitigate their
threat of self-review, as Post Office Limited (“POL”) currently use a PwC off the shelf tool called
TrAction which has been in place for 3 years.

The FRC environment has continued to be strengthened through enhancements in the biannual
Balance Sheet testing, quarterly Finance Director (“FD”) Balance Sheet reviews and Balance
Sheet reconciliation review processes. A finance working group has been established, in order
to drive improvements and efficiencies, specifically in relation to balance sheet related
processes, controls and responsibilities.

1. What was the status of the FRC environment when last reported to ARC?

2. What is the current status of the Financial Reporting Controls Framework (“FRCF”)?
3. What developments have been made to the wider FRC environment?

4. What do independent sources say about the FRC environment?

5. What is the future focus?

Report
Past and current status of the FRCF

6. The last report to ARC was in September 2019 at which point there were 500 controls split
across 26 processes, which addressed 535 individual risks. See Appendix 2 for more
details.

7. Throughout the year the Financial Controls team have performed end to end process
reviews across 8 of the highest risk and/or oldest processes, scoping out those which were
created/reviewed relatively recently as part of wider projects.

8. This has resulted in streamlining the controls framework. The FRCF now holds 438
controls, split across 26 processes, which address 306 risks.

9. The process reviews enabled risks to be streamlined through removal of bespoke risks
and focus on Financial Statement Line Item level risks which are more widely applicable.
This ensures that the FRCF is aligned clearly with its purpose of ensuring the Financial
Statements are not misstated due to error or fraud.

10. The remaining processes are being reviewed on a rolling basis, prioritising the highest risk
processes. Risk assessment is based on materiality, risk of fraud and level of manual
intervention, along with any known issues which come to light.

11. Of the 438 controls, 346 controls were issued for self-assessment in September 2020. The
remaining controls were either not operated due to frequency (i.e. annual, biannual,
quarterly) or were control gaps (a risk has been identified and control has been
designed but is not yet in operation). See Appendix 1 for more details.

12. Of the 346 controls issues for self-assessment; 96% were operating effectively (2019:
91%). The remaining 4% includes 1% of controls not self-assessed due to illness and 3%
of controls self-assessed but not operating. Reasons for controls not operating include

resource issues, delay in meeting deadlines and requests to change control ownership. All
controls not operating are followed up and investigated.

13. The results of the Control Self-Assessment (“CSA”) are reported to the Chief Financial
Officer (“CFO”) on a monthly basis, whilst providing an update on the wider FRC
environment.

14. In the prior year there were 28 control gaps, as at September 2020 there are 10 control
gaps. These are all classed as medium or low risk due to having mitigating controls and/or
due to being non-key controls. The remaining gaps are largely due to system limitations
and are therefore expected to be long term gaps.

15. Controls testing is performed by the Financial Controls team on an annual basis to ensure
each control is tested back to auditable evidence at least once a year. If a control does
not meet the expected standard, it is retested again within the year. The controls testing
results have improved year on year thanks to the feedback control owners gain through
the testing process.

Wider FRC environment

16. Balance Sheet reconciliations for standard risks GLs are submitted to Central Finance on
a quarterly basis and high risks GL reconciliations are submitted on a monthly basis. The
reduction of standard risk GL reconciliations to quarterly frequency is in part thanks to
improved reconciliation quality which has been a focus over the past 18 months.

17. Detailed Balance Sheet testing is performed by Central Finance on a biannual basis on P6
and P11/P12 balances. The GLs in scope for testing are selected based on risk rating. This
testing involves agreeing the GL balances back to auditable evidence in order to assess if
any adjustments are required.

18. FD Balance Sheet review files are prepared by Central Finance and shared with the
respective business units for their review on a monthly basis. FD Balance Sheet review
meetings are held on a quarterly basis to enable Central Finance and Commercial Finance
teams to place greater scrutiny over the Balance Sheets for each area.

19. A finance working group has been established to drive improvements and efficiencies,
specifically in relation to balance sheet related processes, controls and responsibilities. A
focus list has been established and work is under way to enact change in a swift and
positive manner with stakeholders from across finance fully engaged. Changes include
enhancements to underlying chart of accounts, establishing clear roles and responsibilities
and improving reporting processes.

20. During the year, the second annual Grant Thornton LLP (“GT”) audit over third parties
whose data POL rely on for revenue recognition took place. The scope of the audit was
data analysis, IT general controls testing and business process controls testing across
POL's largest service providers (e.g. Fujitsu Telecoms, BGL, DXC, JP Morgan). No
significant auditing findings or recommendations were identified. All minor observations
were fed back to the service providers and have been subsequently actioned.

Tab 7 Financial Reporting Controls Framework Update

21. Since the last internal audit of the FRCF (May 2019), there have been several internal
audits which involved substantive testing of controls in the FRCF including; post BOT
controls, accounts receivable controls, minimum controls standard (COVID-19 impact),
manual postings to revenue. These audits have identified control recommendations for
the relevant business units but no items have highlighted material issues within the FRCF.

Assurance over the FRCF

22. The most recent internal audit, manual postings to revenue, tested controls which had
already been tested by the Financial Controls team and found no difference in the results
of the testing. This provides assurance over the quality of the Financial Controls team
testing.

24. The external audit identified minimal management letter points, none of which concerned
the FRCF or other key FRC related processes discussed in this report. The audit findings
were principally related to differences of opinion on judgemental areas or the classification
of balance sheet items, neither of which are indicators of issues within the FRC
environment.

Governance Risk and Compliance tool

25. The FRCF is currently held on a tool called TrAction, administrated by PwC. Due to
increased independence rules, PwC are unable to perform non-audit services for audit
clients and therefore plan to cease POL’s use of TrAction by April 2022 latest.

26. POL have been looking to move to a new Governance Risk and Compliance (“GRC”) tool
for some time due to the system limitations of TrAction but this had been placed on hold
due to budget constraints.

27. The timing of POL’s requirement to cease use of TrAction has fallen in line with the Central
Risk team’s plans to move to ServiceNow for top down risk assessment from January
2021. In order to work towards a POL wide governance framework being on one GRC tool,
the FRCF will migrate to ServiceNow as phase 2 of the same project, with the aim of being
live in the system by end of March 2021, budget dependent.

28. This move will reduce manual actions (i.e. through approval workflows and automated
notifications), enable audit trail for changes and improve management reporting through
availability of comparative data. The shared tool will also help create synergies between
the FRCF and the top down risk assessment as the self-assessments for the FRCF will roll
up into the risks maintained by the Central Risk team.

Next Steps & Timelines

29. As well as acquiring a new GRC tool, the Financial Controls team are performing a FRCF
completeness review to ensure all financial reporting risks are mitigated. The review is a
lengthy process and is due to be finalised in FY20/21. The team also continue to perform
end to end process reviews to ensure that the FRCF remains up to date. The next
processes under review are loss prevention, record to report and bank & cash
management.

30. Continual development of the BS Recs and associated FD BS Review process in order to
get the right balance between independent central review and ownership by divisional
finance teams. In order to assist with this, we are investigating the potential of acquiring
a balance sheet reporting tool which would aide workflow, reporting and risk
identification.

31. The third party revenue data audit performed by GT is ideally going to be brought in house
for FY20/21. The internal resource will be an Internal Audit Senior Manager (3A) and a
Financial Controls specialist (3B), both roles of which are currently out in the market. The

roles will focus on performing data analysis, IT controls testing and business process

Brian Kelly, Finance Director - Tax,
Author: Treasury and Working Capital & Sponsor:
Tom Lee, Financial Controller

Alisdair Cameron, Group Chief
Finance Officer

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note:
i. the scope, purpose and status of the Agreed Upon Procedure (“AUP”) engagements
performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”)
ii. the findings and recommendations made by PwC
iii. the actions performed by Post Office Limited (“POL”) in response to PwC's finding
for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Executive Summary

Several contractual arrangements which POL have with third parties require POL’s external
auditors to perform AUP engagements to review specific processes, controls and policies in
place at POL with regards to each stakeholders interest. These partners are as follows:

Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (“BEIS”)
Bank of England (“BoE”)

Royal Mail (“RM”)

Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (“DVLA”)

The BEIS and RM reports are being finalised and should be complete by the end of November
2020. No material issues are expected.

The DVLA and BoE reports have been shared with each of the stakeholders. The stakeholders
have confirmed that they are comfortable with the findings noted.

The Treasury team have put in place an action plan to deal with the BoE recommendations,
most of which have already been completed. The remaining actions will be closed off by the
end of November 2020.

Questions addressed

1. What is the scope and status of the AUP engagements performed by PwC?
2. What were the findings and recommendations raised by PwC?

3. What actions have been performed by POL in response to the PwC findings?

Report
Overview of AUP engagements performed by PwC

4. BEIS AUP - review the accuracy of the financial covenant calculations which are reported
throughout the year to BEIS and compare the reported position, for a sample of months
across the financial year, to the management information from which they were obtained.

5. BoE AUP - provide a report on Post Office Limited’s processes surrounding the Notes
Circulation Scheme (NCS) and on the suitability of design and the operating effectiveness
of its controls for the financial year under review.

6. RM AUP - comparison of revenue figures reported weekly to RM back to underlying
financial records and cash receipts, for the financial year under review.

7. DVLA AUP - comparison of the annual statement provided to DVLA, showing the volume
of DVLA transactions performed in branches, back to underlying financial records.

BEIS AUP

8. PwC performed agreed the financial covenant calculations, produced and reported on a
monthly basis, back to the data sources from which the information was obtained. The
calculations were reperformed and understanding of compliance procedures surrounding
the calculation was obtained. The procedures were designed to ensure that POL has met
the requirements around calculations and reporting under the BEIS loan agreement for
the financial year under review.

9. The PwC report is yet to be finalised but based on discussions between POL and PwC no
significant issues have been identified. The only item to note, which will be included in the
PwC report, is that the reports provided to BEIS are based on numbers at a specific point
in time and are not retrospectively amended. This has no impact on period 1 to 11 as the
report is produced at month end close, with any late adjustments being minor. However,
at yearend the final numbers may not be agreed until months after the report is issued
which could lead to inconsistencies e.g. for FY19/20 the Annual Report and Accounts
(“ARA”) is yet to be finalised and therefore the numbers reported to BEIS in April 2020
may vary considerably to what will ultimately appear in the ARA. A reconciliation will be
included in the PwC report to reconcile the reported position to the latest draft ARA.

10. This is not deemed to be an issue as the adjustments made would not, in the instances
identified, cause a breach in the covenants. If a breach was to occur then BEIS would be
notified as part of the routine ongoing management interactions.

11. The BEIS AUP report is expected to be signed in November 2020.

12. The report is produced to provide an understanding and examination of the policies and

Circulation Scheme services (NCS). It looks at the Suitability of Design and Operating
Effectiveness of its Controls for the period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020.

13. Continued membership of the NCS Scheme is dependent on meeting the Bank’s reporting
requirements as well as its security standards.

14. The Bank of England Rules on the Note Circulation Scheme defines how Note Recirculation
Facility (NRF) declarations should be calculated.

15. PwC reported 28 individual findings in their audit of the NCS scheme (see Appendix 1), 12
of which were because of evidence not being available due to COVID-19 restricting access
to sites and therefore preventing physical inspection.

16. BoE have reviewed the reported findings and confirmed with POL at the October 2020
Quarterly Compliance call that they have no concerns about the findings due to their
immateriality.

17. No material control failures were highlighted, however, management recognise the need
to take action to ensure Post Office is fully compliant with the rules of the scheme and
maintain a good relationship with the Bank of England. The findings have been
summarised at a high level in paragraphs 18 and 19. The detailed list of individual findings
can be found in appendix 1.

18. Staff Knowledge, Training and Access:

e Limited evidence of staff training in the team;

e A-user access list for Team Drive, SharePoint and the NIPS system could not be
obtained for the full year;

e No evidence was provided to demonstrate that a review of the NIPS system user
access list was performed in the year;

e The spreadsheets used to calculate the daily NFR position should all be password
protected.

19. Other findings:
e Signed audit packs and CCTV footage from cash centres which validate key controls
have been performed could not be accessed due to restrictions in place for COVID-
19.
e Multiple instances when the Cash Centre Managers did not confirm the daily forecast
as per the agreed control

20. Whilst the findings are not material, management recognise the need to address the
findings and have agreed the actions in Appendix 2 with the Treasury team. Most of the
actions have been completed, with the remaining due to be completed in November 2020.
Note the findings will appear in the FY20/21 PwC report, despite being cleared, as they
will have been applicable for part of the financial year under review.

RM AUP

21. PwC performed a review of POL’s gross actual revenue for the year ending 29 March 2020.
This involved casting the ‘breakdown schedule’, agreeing the schedules to the POL General
Ledger and agreed the total gross revenue to the bank statement.

22. One exception was identified where the gross revenue per the GL and per the bank
statement was greater than the ‘breakdown schedule’ by c. £10m. This was an
overpayment to Royal Mail which was subsequently returned the following week -
management were aware, rectified this at the time and no further instances have occurred
as a result of controls in place.

23. As part of POL's requirements to provide all relevant information to PwC which could
impact RM revenue, POL also notified PwC of an issue regarding the application of new
stamp tariffs which occurred in Feb 2019, resulting in under settlement of c. £500k to RM
which was resolved post year end. This was noted in PwC's report but RM were fully aware
and subsequent settlement has been performed.

24. POL has also informed PwC about the stamps review (Project Frank) performed in the year
by KPMG LLP. PwC are due to sign a hold harmless letter to enable them to review the
KPMG report directly to ensure there is no impact on the AUP report or managements
associated representation letter. Once this has been closed off the PwC AUP report will be
finalised for signing, expected to be November 2020.

DVLA AUP

25. PwC performed walkthroughs of the end to end DVLA transaction process, reconciliation
of SAP data to Horizon data, sampling transactions to ensure they flowed through from
Horizon to the bank statement, analytical review of sales and remittances and
reperformance of key calculations driving the Annual (volumes) Statement provided to
DVLA.

26. PwC identified some minor findings in relation to daily reconciliation variances, which were
subsequently resolved, and sizable movements in sales balances in branches, which were
suitably explained. Additionally, an IT finding was included as a general point around user
access controls, which was noted in the main yearend ARA audit and included in this report
for completeness as it was in relation to branch system access controls.

27. Any reconciling differences noted were trivial (less than £5k) and ‘unusual movements’
noted in the analytical reviews have been backed up by management responses.

28. The report has been shared with DVLA and no issues have been raised by management.

Conclusion

29. Whilst PwC identified findings through their AUPs, POL management are comfortable that
these are immaterial and the overall outcomes of the AUPs demonstrate a strong control
environment across the business processes.

30. Any remaining findings and recommendations will be addressed where required ahead of
the FY20/21 AUP reviews.

Next Steps & Timelines

31. BOE - The remaining actions in relation to the BoE NCS AUP will be closed by 27 November
2020.

32. RM - PwC are due to sign the KPMG hold harmless letter so that they can review the Stamps
report and ensure that there is no impact prior to releasing the AUP report. Report expected
to be signed in November 2020.

33. BEIS - final review and clearances are underway and the report is expected to be signed
in November 2020.

34. DVLA - None.

the forecast figures that are provided at 10:30am and 13:15pm by
each cash centre to ensure the figures are reasonable and conform to
the Bank of England’s rules for NCS and NRF.

Specifically they check that:
‘The total NRF figure does not exceed the maximum gilts
available;

* The balance of NRF cash is consistent with previous
experience, or there is a known explanation; and

The amounts are reasonable in view of other known
information coming from the business, such as cash required in order
to meet winter fuel payments, and specific events such as bank
holidays.

‘CO3.1 - The NCS forecast spreadsheet has in built checks that
provide comparisons between forecast and actuals. The Treasury

Executive Summary

HM was set up during September as a ring-fenced Business Unit in order to centralise all
the work emerging from the three judgments under a new Director reporting to the Group
CEO and Chair; to allow Post Office Executive to concentrate upon current and future
business; and to ensure all current procedures are reflective of a new culture that will
prevent such Historical events every occurring again.

A revised governance structure has been based upon core elements of the existing Strategic
Portfolio Office (SPO) framework with changes to the approval processes. Key elements, as
discussed with the CFO and team are:

Budgeting and forecasting costs

- These are aligned to the current Post Office Limited (POL) budgeting and forecasting
procedures

Financial reporting and accruals

- No Changes made to process used previously
- Reporting improvements made by Finance team

Procurement

- POL procurement processes are used wherever appropriate and Procurement team

Financial communications with UKGI/BEIS-

- HM is to feed information via POL Finance to ensure data consistency and single point
of contact

Controls, both financial and over data accuracy

- No changes have been made to control procedures.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

Title: Financial Conduct Authority pricing I meeting pate: I 12 November 2020
rules changes

muthar Ed Dutton, Post Office Insurance Sponsor: Owen Woodley, Chief Commercial
Managing Director Officer

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note that:

- the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced proposals to prohibit ‘Price
Walking’ (competitive new business prices followed by renewal prices increasing during
contract) in Motor and Home Insurance, along with changes to Product Governance and
reporting of value metrics; and

- the insurance team have begun to mobilise a programme, overseen by a Post Office
Insurance (POI) Board committee, to respond effectively,

for onward submissions to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight
e POI Board discussions

Report

Background

1. The FCA have produced their Final Report on General Insurance Pricing Practices 18/1.3

2. They have been reviewing pricing differentials within household and motor insurance for
some time. Predominantly, their review work has focused on differentials between new
and existing customers.

3. Over time, customers who stick with their insurer can see their premiums increase
significantly compared to customers who shop around. This practice is known as price
walking.

4. Their work within this area is aligned to a wider Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
review which focuses on pricing in several market areas including general insurance and
broadband.

5. The FCA had already concluded that there is significant detriment within the market,
highlighting that overall, six million customers were being overcharged for their motor and
household insurance, with this overcharging totalling some £1.2bn.

6. There is some evidence that the impact of price walking is felt disproportionally by
vulnerable customers and older customers.

The Proposed Remedies

7. The core solution proposed by the FCA is that new and renewing customers should pay
the same price. This will not prevent the provision by firms of differing prices to customer
where the firm operates via different brands and channels.

8. This will require significant changes to pricing models across the industry.

9. There will be anti-avoidance measures in place to prevent firms from avoiding the intent
of the rules. These will be developed over the coming months.

10. Additionally, Firms will also need more formal processes for assessing products and the
FCA will be implementing piloted proposals on reporting value measures.

11. Note that these additional rules apply across GI and not to just household and motor
business.

12. Extensive MI reporting on compliance with the new pricing regime will also be required.

13. The FCA notes it will police markets vigorously and will be looking to implement attestation
and other requirements as part of this policing process.

14. Under SMCR, it will require firms to be clear on pricing accountability and to focus on fair
value, noting that the Boards of regulated firms should have a clear line of sight on pricing
practices.

Timin

15. The FCA is now consulting on these proposals.

16. The deadline for consultations on the paper is 25 January 2021.

17. The FCA then proposes to produce final rules and guidance in the second quarter of the

2021 calendar year, with an expected launch date within 4-6 months of that (although
the market is unconvinced that is realistic).

Potential Impact

18. Whilst the basic principles of the change are straightforward, there are a large number of
technical uncertainties around interpretation. Indeed, whilst the FCA have attended
various forums to explain their thoughts to Industry Bodies, it is apparent that conflicting
explanations or guidance on specific technical points have been given.

19. Ultimately, whilst the overall market value may reduce slightly, the basic impact will be
that value shifts from renewing policies, where margins will reduce, to new business
policies, where margins will be significantly higher than now.

20. Asaresult, the impact appears likely to differ very significantly depending on the size and
scale of existing business.

21. This could be:

© companies that have very significant back books of business where, if they want to
sell new business, their renewal prices will have to fall. Or,

o where large businesses are very complex — the are market comments regarding how
many different sets of prices very large consolidated firms like Aviva have in the
market - becoming compliant (in terms of governance, reporting AND pricing) could
be very complicated, difficult and expensive.

22. POI has recorded a risk that we respond poorly or too slowly - i.e. our pricing model
response is mis-judged and our commercial outcomes compared to the current outlook
are degraded, or that we are not ready to fulfil the regulatory requirements in terms of
our pricing, our governance or the new reporting.

23. However, having (until recently) shrunk our Motor and Home books over recent years,
there is the potential for this to be a material opportunity for POI, assuming we can
continue to write significant New Business volumes (at higher prices and positive margins)
relative to our current (small) mature book size.

Activity underway within POI to achieve compliance

24. Given the technical uncertainties, we are working directly with the ABI and BIBA to gain
greater clarity from the FCA, and to influence their responses to the FCA consultation
paper.

25. We are also already heavily engaged with our main partners (Ageas for Home Insurance
and BGL for Motor Insurance), as we have significant dependencies on each other to
operate compliantly in the future and to maximise the opportunity/mitigate any risk.

26. POI board has been very focussed on this change in market practice and is overseeing our
response via a Board oversight committee, led by a NED.

27. Weare in the process of mobilising a focussed change programme to ensure success.

28. The initial activity underway is to generate a more detailed impact assessment of the rules
on a set of workstreams, currently including technical pricing, MI and reporting,
underwriting partners, finance, governance.

29. This initial discovery phase will inform a more detailed programme scope, deliverables and
plan, and resource requirements.

30. Significant change investment and human resources will be required, and specialist
resource may be required for some elements.

31. We are reviewing some initial output of this phase for a couple of workstreams on Friday
13%" November with the POI Board Oversight Committee, as well as continuing to inform
progress on mobilisation of the programme.

32. The programme will follow POL change procedures, as well as be overseen by the POI
board, and we will enter the change governance process imminently.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

Risk & Compliance Committee

Title: Meeting Date: I 12" November 2020
Terms of Reference

muthar Rebecca Whibley, Senior Assistant Sponsor: Veronica Branton, Group
Company Secretary Company Secretary

Input Sought: Discussion & Decision

The Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) are asked to review and discuss the draft RCC Terms
of Reference, including, particularly, the membership of the RCC in light of the recent
organisational design changes and then approve the RCC Terms of Reference, subject to any
amendments as agreed by the RCC during its discussions for onward submission to the Group
Executive (GE).

Executive Summary

Following the adoption of the new Articles of Association for the Group in April 2020, the
Company Secretariat reviewed the Group Governance Framework and redrafted the Matters
Reserved to the Board and Committee Terms of Reference for all Group Companies. These
revised documents were adopted by the relevant Group Companies between April and June
2020. As a result the RCC Terms of Reference required review to align with these changes.
Further, the RCC Terms of Reference have not been reviewed since 2016. It is good governance
for all committees at Board and Executive level to have terms of reference and for these to be
reviewed annually.

As such, the RCC Terms of Reference have been reviewed to align with the new Governance
Framework, current practice and to reflect the agreed Terms of Reference structure for the
Group.

Given the recent organisational changes, it is understood that this will affect the membership
of the RCC and therefore the RCC is asked to discuss and propose the future membership of
the Committee as appropriate. The Committee is then asked to approve the Terms of
Reference, subject to any amendments agreed, for onward submission to the GE, who will be
asked to review and approved the Terms of Reference at its meeting in December 2020.

Multiple partner financial stability

Title: update Meeting Date: I 12 November 2020
7 Karl Oliver, Head of Commercial . Amanda Jones, Group Retail and
actives Partnerships Spurenars Franchise Network Director

Input Sought: Note

The Committee is asked to note the partner financial stability update for onward submission
to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight
ARC papers Sept’19 and Mar’20.

Executive Summary

1. Inthe ARC meeting Sept’19, we shared a paper outlining how we track the financial stability
of our largest partners and followed-up with a contingency plan in ARC March’20 which set
out how we would maintain PO services in the event of the closure of a large number of
PO's as a result of Partner financial collapse. This paper provides an update on the financial
tracking of the partners incorporating the known marketplace impact of covid.

2. Of our 6 major partners, 4 are classed as ‘Green’ (low risk) using our financial stability
measures. We do have concerns around McColls and WHS and both are currently classed
as ‘Amber’ (medium risk).

3. Appendix 2 shows key financial highlights for McColls and WHS. For McColls it highlights
slight improvements for cash and debt, with share price decline remaining a concern. For
WHSmiths it highlights the forecast loss of £70-75m but currently with good access to
cash/credit. Neither status has been adjusted and both will continue to be tracked closely
as AMBER.

4. Both businesses have been under considerable cost pressures for some time and the impact
of Covid has only served to exacerbate this. Our intention has been to work closely with
both McColls and WHS to agree pragmatic ways to help them move to a more sustainable
estate/model and therefore maintain PO services for customers.

5. As was highlighted in the report to ARC in September last year, we have limited access to
Analyst/Broker insights to understand the underlying financial health of some of our largest
partners. At the time we explored subscription to Thomson Reuters platform that provided
additional financial KPIs but this was discounted as it added ‘data’ rather than insight.

6. Our recommendation is that we re-look at options within a budget envelope of no more

than £30k. Options to be reviewed to include retaining access to an analyst and utilisation
of an ‘insight/knowledge marketplace’ (e.g. Gerson Lehman Group, GLG model).

7. Since we last reviewed the financial tracking and operational plans with RCC/ARC the
partner planning has informed the ‘early days’ covid response and worked well to accelerate
our set-up. We have taken the improved reporting and prioritisation from the covid planning
to strengthen the partner plan>

Questions addressed

8. How do we track the financial stability of our strategic partners?
9. What is the current financial status for each of our strategic partners?
10. What is POL doing to support/mitigate risk with the AMBER Partners?

Report
How do we track the financial stability of our strategic partners?

11. Following engagement with Risk, BEIS and finance the ‘financial resilience tracker’ was
established in P1, 2019 to formally review finances and significant account activity for our
6 largest partners. The financial measures where appropriate mirror those tracked by BEIS
and are reviewed by period looking for any indication of distress.

External distress signals would include profit warnings; cash constrained - low liquidity
headroom; prospective covenant breaches; Poor financial ratios particularly gearing,
operating margin, ROI/ROA; credit status downgrade; share price underperformance;
failed refinancing and/or new management team.

12. We currently track share price and trend, Experian ratings, key ratios (net debt vs EBITDA,
total debt vs equity and interest payment cover) and formal announcements from the
partner to create a RAG rating for each partner. Tracking of industry media & social feeds
and insight gained from relationships is included under internal measures, with any
significant events fed back through Retail Director updates. The P6, 2020 financial tracker
is included in Appendix 1.

« They have shared the detailed store disposal plan and how this impacts the operation
of POs in their estate. Their estate review will reduce their PO sites by 134 sites, from
607 to 473 (with c.50 completed so far). This 134 site reduction will be achieved through
the closure of 52 sites (37 closed) and sale of 82 sites (13 sold). They are reducing their
overall retail estate by c.350 sites over the same period.

e The remaining 15 sites for closure all have closure dates in this financial year. McColls
have served full notice on all sites and have extended past official closure dates to assist
when we have temporary operators in place (4 stores re-opened with temporary
Postmaster).

e We have proactively advertised all the ‘for sale’ sites through our ‘Run a Post Office’
website to help McColls find buyers, with 13 now sold; 50 are ‘under offer’ and the final
19 remain advertised.

Author: Joanne Welch, Change Risk & Sponsor:

Title: Meeting Date: I 12 November 2020

Dan Zinner, Group Chief Strategy
and Transformation Officer

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note an update on improvements implemented to better manage
Change, ensure the effective delivery of Change, and to approve further adoption and continued
improvement, for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight
e ARC update on 13th September 2019
e Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) update on 7th November 2019
e Internal Audit report dated 4th May 2020

Executive Summary

At the September 2019 ARC meeting, an update was provided on the current short-term focus
of the Chief Transformation Officer (CTO) and the centralisation of the Change function. The
CTO’s plan was focused on immediate improvement in the oversight and delivery of Change
(‘doing things right’) not on the Strategy (‘doing the right things’). It concentrated on three
areas: People, Process and Perception.

Since then a significant amount of work has taken place and the POL Change organisation has
evolved into a centralised, collaborative and effective function with clear accountabilities and
management. Capable and competent resources are on appropriately configured teams, the
quality of support across Change has increased, oversight has been enhanced through better
tooling, new rhythms and reports to provide transparency, and governance processes and
controls have been further improved and embedded to drive consistency.

To further support delivery of the CTO plan, a new “Change Control Framework” (CCF) was
developed. The CCF was deployed formally to the Change Community and wider Business in
February 2020 and has subsequently been captured for onward management within Archer
GRC tool. In July 2020, Internal Audit noted that that there was already a noticeable
improvement in the consistency and effectiveness of controls operation at programme level.
More information on the CCF can be found in the Reading Room.

Acontinuous improvement programme is in place and opportunities are identified and delivered
around our current processes, principles, artefacts, tooling and adoption. Our ongoing learnings
from post-implementation reviews, health checks, 1st/2nd line assurance and self-identified
gaps and weaknesses through our CCF also continue to drive improvements across Change.

While a lot of progress has been made, there’s still more to do. Focus over the last year has
been on the Change Community, and further work is now required to bring management along
on the overall Change vision and journey. This includes broadening stakeholder understanding
of, and conviction for, how ‘Change works’ at the Post Office to make the process more efficient,
and assisting the GE to role model appropriate behaviours of change management, including

Report

ie changes have been implemented across Transformation since the last ARC

update?

rhe September 2019, the CTO set out to embed Change processes and ways of working
through consistency, clarification and communication. Initial efforts focused on the Change
community and increasing understanding on how to consistently manage and resource a
project for delivery, before further engaging the overall business on Change. Three key
areas were focussed on (People, Process and Perception) and the following section outlines
what has been implemented so far in each of these areas.

2. Regarding the key deliverables relating to People, 3 sub-themes were identified:
a. Structure Change teams that are fit for purpose and leverage current resources to
ensure people are working within their scope and ability

i. Project Delivery Team manager in place since November 2019 to directly line
manage, develop and track (against performance metrics and project data
quality metrics) all Project/Programme Manager (PM), Business Analyst (BA) and
Project Management Office (PMO) resources, and ensure appropriate alignment
of resources to projects based on their scope and ability, and the project needs.

ii. Central cross-charging through our ServiceNow tool of BAU resources who work
on projects is now in place (e.g. SME, Product Owner, Solution Architect, lawyers)
which ensures better forward and historical visibility of all project costs and
appropriate accounting. In September, 60 BAU resources were cross-charged.

b. Increase the number of capable and affordable Change resources, not necessarily total
resources

i. We have rebalanced the Change Delivery Skills Group resource split from 47%
employees (FTE and FTC) on 31% August 2019 to 53% employees on 31%t August
2020 to lower overall costs, with the remainder filled by contractors.

ii. 100% of Skills Group pool resources undergo an induction, within 1 month of
joining Change, on the Change Excellence Framework and the 8 PM minimum
standards on which they must comply. We have completed 53 inductions in the
last 12 months. A BA framework has also been developed and will be embedded
in Q3. Both frameworks include compliance metrics.

c. Clearly communicate the value of the centralised Change support team structure and
roles and constantly ensure this is fit for purpose and cost

@

i. The centralised SPO function had 14 FTEs in August 2019 and following the recent
restructure in August 2020 now has 9.5 FTEs with an overall cost saving of 30%.
While the number of Change projects within has not reduced significantly,
efficiencies were made due to better IT tooling, focus on improved data quality
and more standardisation across processes. Focus is now on governance,
resources, assurance/oversight and further tooling improvements.

ii. Further FTE reductions were made with a ‘Portfolio of Change’ restructure from
8 portfolios in August 2019, down to 5 portfolios, removing 6 FTEs with an
annualised saving of over 40%.

3. Key deliverables relating to Process:
a. Operationalise Change routines and rhythms, ensuring consistency and speed across
the business
i. ServiceNow has been embedded and adopted and is used as our ‘single source
of truth’ for all project data. It is widely used to produce a variety of dashboards
and reports on all aspects of Change delivery including the monthly UKGI Change
update report, Portfolio performance metrics, project costs & benefits, Change
data quality, resource allocation etc. to drive key decisions by senior
management and support PMs in successful project delivery. We have 355 risks
and 305 milestones against 92 listed projects today versus 555 risks (included
duplications and poor data) and 55 milestones against 132 listed projects in
October 2019. (See Appendix 1 - Example of weekly project metrics dashboard)
b. Embed the Governance process and tools, with improved efficiency, effectiveness and
agility

i. To reduced administration and increase efficiencies the SPO has agreed and
documented a number of exceptional processes for activities which do not suit
the standard CEF lifecycle yet still require some light touch governance and
oversight (i.e. IT Risk & Resilience, Property CapEx, small BF2 client funded
projects, and NDA activities). These are inline with our Change Policy and the

CCF to ensure minimum control standards are reflected.

ii. The capture and sharing of project lessons learnt plays a key role in ensuring we
learn from our mistakes. The Change community and key stakeholders receive
a regular overview of key themes being seen in Post-Implementation Reviews
and Project Health Checks (See Appendix 2 - Key PIR Themes Report) and
appropriate remediation plans and controls improvements are agreed to further
strengthen our overall governance processes and CCF.

iii. The Business Readiness Assurance (BRA) process has been enhanced to ensure
earlier stakeholder engagement. New projects attend the Gating forum at project
outset to ensure their impacted stakeholders are aware of issues and have been
involved in developing mitigation plans. 100% (20) Projects received approval
first time in Q2 2020 versus Q2 2019 where 12 projects went through gating with
only 25% (3) approved first time and 58% (7) conditionally approved.

iv. Following CCF assessemnt, more robust processes and controls have been
implemented including reducing spend tolerance (from 10% to 2%) which
prevents any project from raising a Purchase Order or committing spend more
than 2% above their approved budget.

4. Key deliverables relating to Perception:

a. Foster understanding, conviction and alignment within the Change community on how
the PO “does Change,” which includes training and constant “on the job” practice in
new ways of working

i. More frequent communications are in place to build knowledge and engagement
e.g. a weekly newsletter, the All Hands Change monthly meeting, Communities
of Practice.

b. Bring management along on the overall change vision and journey

i. The GE/Investment committee have requested more transparency and a desire
to see that we are delivering change consistently and learning from our mistakes,
but there is still more work to do here in order to support the GE in role modelling
appropriate behaviours of change management including decisiveness and
consequence management.

5. This is all underpinned by the CCF which identifies all Change risks, control procedures and
remediation. The CCF has promoted a cultural shift, increasing awareness that there are
risks to be managed and the importance of adherence to our controls and processes. It has
driven accountability across Change with risk and control owners identified, and supported
enhanced oversight and assurance of change. Work is now underway to fully operationalise
the CCF with periodic assessment on the risks and controls.

How effective is the CCF in mitigating & managing Change Risks?

6. The CCF was developed with support from Internal audit in Q3 2019, deployed to the change
community in February 2020 and loaded into the Archer tool in Q2 2020 along with the
Change Risks (Enterprise, Intermediate and Local risk register risks). The CCF currently
holds 53 controls and includes all the checks, challenges, and reports to enable projects to
deliver on time, on budget, to the required quality to enable benefits to be realised. These
activities are in place at governance, portfolio and project levels throughout the project life
cycle until project benefits are transferred to business areas to track to fruition. (See
Appendix 3 for a summary of the CCF)

7. Control procedures have been strengthened by defining the activities undertaken, detailing
the type of control, its design, ownership and its frequency of operation. The relationship
between each control procedures and the risk it helps to mitigate/manage has been linked
within Archer and a standard operating procedure defining how SPO Risks and Controls
should be identified, assessed, tested, remediated and reported has been issued.

8. The controls were tested in January and September 2020 with overall control effectiveness
levels increasing by 51%. (see Appendix 4, fig.1-4) The testing cycle for each control has

been set based on its criticality and frequency of operation. Remediation plans were created
where controls were not fully effective. The next scheduled tests are December 2020. All
testing has been assured by the Change Risk & Assurance Manager to ensure controls
effectiveness levels assigned are valid and control owners have appropriate supporting
evidence. A thematic assessment of 1* line Portfolio Assurance has been completed with a
formal report produced. This report is included in the reading room.

9. Periodically Change risks residual scores will be re-evaluated based on environmental factors
and any improvements made to the control. The overall effectiveness of Risk Controls will
be re-assessed by the risk owners as remediation plans complete. Any additional
remediations will be captured at this time.

What lessons have been learnt and what will focus be on next?

10.This year 15 PIRs, 6 Project Deep dives and 1 Thematic review has been completed resulting
in 50 improvement recommendations. One common theme identified across these reviews
has been inaccurate benefits, either due to over estimation, erosion due to changes in
schedule or an inaccurate initial cost forecast. These recommendations have resulted in
updates to governance forum TORs, benefit & cost forecasting roles and responsibilities and
supporting RACI being developed, and additional business training planned for Q3.

1

in

.Business change management practices and suppliers’ learnings have also been highlighted
and are shared regularly with the wider change community via the PM Communities of
Practice. A detailed mapping of recommendations against SPO control area can be seen in
Appendix 4 - SPO Controls Assessment fig. 5-8.

12.The lessons learnt repository within ServiceNow has been embedded, with all projects
recording lessons throughout their lifecycle. There are currently 157 lessons logged. This
repository is searchable and is being used by project managers to identify lessons at project
initiation to help them succeed in areas where others have fallen foul.

13.In H2 we plan to focus on the wider business to improve their understanding on how ‘Change
works’ at the Post office and communicate our overall Change vision. This includes senior
management and the leadership teams (including the GE) and is particularly important and
timely following organisational changes. These session will refresh and reeducate Business
Sponsors of Change on our processes, controls and the importance of their role within
Change in particular, their accountabilities for benefit realisation throughout a project. This
will be supported by a quarterly Change communication to the wider busineses informing
them of latest updates and changes.

Next Steps & Timelines

We can return to the ARC in May 2021 to provide an update on the areas of focus identified
above if desired.

Author: Manager & Neil Davey, Operations I Sponsor:

Title: Meeting Date: I 12" November 2020 I

Payments Managing Director

Andrew Goddard, Payzone Bill I

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note the update on the previous Payzone Risk report last presented
to the Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) and Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC) in
January 2020, for onward submission to the ARC.

Previous Governance Oversight

This is an action from the previous ARC meeting.

Executive Summary

In the January 2020 risk report, Payzone presented 5 significant risks. 4 of these risks had a
risk score of 12 and above, with the remaining risk of Brexit being an unpredictable event,
qualifying as a ‘Black Swan’ through its potential to become significant.

Since January, we mitigated the 3 most significant risks of Terminal Communication Issues,
GDPR Requirements and Policies & Operating Standards, and also improved and matured the
management of the risk framework across the operation of the business.

As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, 4 new significant risks have been determined;
the commercial impact on Payzone’s clients, poor trading conditions, the dependency on 3"4
Parties, and the impact on retailer credit performance. We have been able to limit these new
risks to a score of 12 respectively, via a series of management controls and reporting.

The remaining risk from January is the ability for Payzone to deliver forecast revenues vs its
original plan. Given the impacts of the recent pandemic this risk has increased from a score of
15 to 20 to become our number 1 risk.

This paper details what steps Payzone has taken to improve managing risk and the movements
in our significant risks.

Questions addressed

Report

1. Throughout 2020, Payzone has invested time and resources on its people, teams, and
processes to improve the way it manages risk and improves the risk culture:

a. Risk Review Meetings: A risk pack is generated monthly and submitted to
Payzone's senior management team for review and discussed during the monthly
risk review meetings. The risk owners are challenged on the appropriate
mitigating actions that are being taken to ensure the suitability to achieve the
target risk scores.

b. Risk Structure: A risk structure has been implemented which has identified the
main risk within Payzone (ability for Payzone to deliver the 5-year plan) and
promoted to an intermediate risk within the Post Office’s Archer risk management
system. A diagram has been included in Appendix 1 to illustrate the structure.

c. Risk Awareness: Risk awareness and the role of the risk team has been
presented to the wider Payzone business via a business update. There has been
separate participation in the weekly team meetings in Retail, Operation and
Commercial so individuals can assess and take responsibilities in identifying and
mitigating risks in their jobs and teams.

d. Rapid Response Team: Payzone set up a rapid response team through the initial
stage of the Covid 19 pandemic and we also participated as part of the Post Office
Rapid response team. We helped mitigate a risk in the Post Office Current Account
contact centre and their service levels by setting up a separate virtual contact
centre using Post Office employees self-isolating.

e. Process Improvements: In 2020, Payzone have matured in continually
improving processes to offset risk, with examples in sections 3 and 4 of this paper.
Payzone have also set up their own Change Approval Board and Project Review
Board. The Change Board has a various number of pre-checks and conversations
with key stakeholders to identify risks prior to a change being presented to the
Board for approval. Any risks to the delivery of business change and projects are
covered in subsequent Change Approval and Project Review Boards.

f. Post Office Risk Reporting: On a monthly basis, an update of the significant
risks are reported to Payzone’s Risk business partner within the Post Office risk
team. This is then consolidated amongst other group risks on the Archer risk
management system. This helps us identify if we need any support or resource
in managing risk and leveraging if other areas of the business are having similar
risks and sharing mitigation practices.

g. Alignment on Group Policies: The Post Office Limited draft policies are now
being reviewed by the Payzone Quality and Risk manager, for feedback prior to
final submission. This allows Payzone to operate within the policy of the group and
understand if any variations to that policy will be required. This has been 14
completed as part of a wider project to adopt or align the policies within Payzone
to the Post Office group policies.

The progress made against the key risks is summarised in Figure 1 with the details
outlined in sections 2 & 3 below.

Key Risks

2. January 2020 Mitigated Risks

a. Terminal Communication Issue: In January 2020, the terminal
communication issue was the highest risk with a risk score of 20. The
mitigations included several IT software releases to improve the communication
issue during spring 2020. This has been reflected in a reduction of inbound calls
to the Helpdesk regarding terminal communication from 20% down to 4%.
Further development has been completed which will enable the ability to
complete pre-payment gas transactions on a single device. Asa result, the risk
score has been reduced to from 20 to 6.

b. GDPR Requirements: Work has been ongoing in conjunction with the Post
Office Data Protection team to improve the governance surrounding data
protection within Payzone. A data protection process has been implemented
which includes data breach reporting and subject access requests. A weekly
progress meeting between Post Office data protection and Payzone’s Quality and
Risk Manager has been set up to provide support and ensure progress of
activities. Training material is being created to roll out to all Payzone employees
by Q4 2020/21. The actions implemented have reduced the risk score from 16
to a to a target score of a 4.

c. POL Policies and Operating Standards: A project has been set up to align
Payzone with the Post Office’s key group policies. This proposal was presented
to the Sept 2020 PZBP board with the objective to review 2 policies per month
until FY Q4. It is the intention that the Post Office key group policies will be
adopted where possible. If there are material differences, then variations will
be created. The risk score has reduced from 16 to 6.

d. Forecast Revenues and Brexit: These risks remain and are discussed in detail
in section 4 of this report.

3. Current Significant Risks

a. Intermediate Risk - the ability for Payzone to deliver the 5 yr plan risk
score 20 (5:4)
This risk has been promoted to become the intermediate risk at group level. The
5-year plan on revenue and cost lines has been re-forecasted as a response to
the changing priorities due to the demands on the business from the Covid-19 14
pandemic. At this stage, we continue to monitor the changes in customer buying
behaviour (cash to digital) and the requirements / desire of clients to enter into
exclusive contracts as well as plans to migrate to digital payments. To date, we
are not seeing evidence of this and in fact, the engagement with clients is more

positive and we have advanced dialogue with clients (e.g. e-On, Allpay) and
retailers (e.g. Tesco & Coop) to migrate transaction volume to the Post Office
and Payzone networks.

b. Poor trading conditions in the current pandemic (risk score 12)
The lockdown in Q1 had a initial downward impact on the bill payment trading
conditions with us performing 20% lower against the original budget for the
quarter, due to the elderly and high risk shielding at home and our clients
working with customers to help them pay their bills through non cash methods
or offering free credit and payment holidays. We have seen positive recovery
during Q2 with both Energy and Resellers returning to perform -10% against
budget and parcels have performed +20% YoY, but transport continues to
struggle due to the fear of using public transport and working from home.
However, our digital transport solution places in a good position as post-Covid
conversion from cash to smart card will be prevalent. We have aided our
recovery by signing new Energy clients in Bright and Jersey and driven new
volume from eOn, EDF and via our platform partners, Siemens and Itron who
prefer to deal with us over competitors. We will drive additional future revenue
from a planned exclusive relationship with eOn on smart and from new deals
with Allpay and Capita.

c. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on clients (risk score 12)
We are starting to see some of the smaller Energy companies struggle and fail
due to bad debt and a lack of contingency in their balance sheets. Their
customers however are being absorbed by the big 6 suppliers and we have seen
100,000 new customers added to BG’s customer base (Robin Hood Energy)
which will drive volume to our branch and store network in Q4. The transport
industry is in disarray and largely propped up by the government since late
spring, which will continue until people can travel freely. Parcel companies are
thriving due to an uplift in online shopping and this will continue for the long
term, benefitting Payzone via relations with HubBox (start up operator). We are
aligned with PUDO strategy work to determine the potential to leverage the
Payzone network to support the POL PUDO aspirations.

d. The long-term impact of the pandemic on finances (risk score 12)
The current situation is highly changeable with the unknown impact due to the
sporadic shifts in local lockdowns around the country. The actions completed
within the credit management function has resulted in a reduction in retailer
debt to below the levels seen pre-pandemic. The pre-pandemic levels of failed
direct debit were at a level of 1.5% (£182k) per week and a collection rate of
95.5% (£174k). This has reduced to a level of only 0.5% for failed direct debits
and a collection rate of 100%. These exceptional levels have been achieved by
a combination of activities including improvements to the collection process to
collaborate with retailers that fail direct debits, improvements in the quality of
new retailers which has been aided with the implementation of a defined credit
policy, publicising card payments as well as cash payments. The aged debt
levels have also decreased which has been facilitated by a change to how the 14
inbound calls are processed. These calls are now routed to the Helpdesk which
has resulted in the credit team’s ability to dedicate more time to resolve the
older debts.

e. The dependency on third parties (risk score 12)

Tab 14 Payzone Risk Report

@

Throughout this pandemic there is a risk to business-critical activities that have
a high dependency on third parties which have a possibility for high exposure,
for example, PLS which provide Payzone’s engineering resource. The key
suppliers were contacted and requested to complete a questionnaire to
understand their business continuity plan arrangements in place to enable
service levels to resume during the pandemic situation. Regular calls are in place
with key suppliers to monitor the service during this changeable situation.
Additional governance surrounding the control of suppliers is currently being
implemented with the development of a procurement policy. The
implementation of this policy will ensure the controls in place for external
providers are robust and minimises the risk in this area
f. Brexit (Black Swan risk score 5)

The risk to the operation is low based on an appraisal of suppliers and technology
processes and the only risk relates to the broader macro-economic impact to
the UK economy. This is being continually monitored during the weekly group
Covid-19/Brexit rapid response team calls.

Risk Appetite

4. The approach Payzone is adopting to develop the risk appetite is to have the Quality and
Risk Manager be a part of the Post Office team reviewing and updating the Post Office
Risk Appetite. This will ensure that Payzone aligns where possible to the Post Office Risk
Appetite statement. Once the Post Office Risk Appetite has been approved by ARC the risk
appetite statements will be reviewed and agreed by Payzone Board during the April
meeting.

Conclusion

5. Significant work has been conducted which has achieved a reduction in the overall risk
scoring of the pre-pandemic risks. Whilst the COVID 19 pandemic has changed the key
risks in the business, the overall risk profile has not changed significantly. Continuous
monitoring of how COVID 19 has impacted Bill Payments is in place to ascertain changes
to customer behaviour, volume impact, competitor behaviour, and the impact on the
operating model.

6. Whilst there has been good progress in the risk framework and maturing the risk culture
within Payzone there is still work to be completed to introduce the risk appetite statement.
This will be conducted in line with the POL group risk appetite statement. The technology
and legal and compliance risk appetite statements are due for approval at the November
ARC.

Next Steps & Timelines
7. Risk appetite be generated and brought to the Payzone Board in Q4 '21.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Title: Law & Trends Report Hiei 12 November 2020 I
Author: Sarah Gray, Legal Director Sponsor: Ben Foat, Group General Counsel

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note the new or proposed material changes to laws and regulations
since the last Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC), for onward submission to the Audit, Risk &
Compliance Committee (ARC).

Executive Summary

There are 4 matters for the Committee to note (details of which are set out in the Appendix):

1. Restriction of Public Sector Exit Payments Regulations 2020
The legislation implementing the £95k cap on exit payments comes into force on 4
November 2020. The cap will apply to any non-exempt termination payments that
represent a cost the employer including, redundancy payments, employer pension
contributions, and payment in lieu of notice.

2. Revenue and Customs Brief No.12 - VAT Treatment on Compensation Payments
HMRC published its Revenue and Customers Brief 12 (2020) that introduced their new
position on VAT treatment of contractual compensation payments. The result of this
approach by HMRC will mean that most compensation, early termination and cancellation
payments will be considered as payments for supply and will be liable for VAT.

3 HM Treasury Consultation on new Economic Crime Levy - Update
The Economic Crime levy aims to raise approximately £100 million per year from entities
regulated for Anti- Money Laundering (‘AML’) purposes and support reforms to the
sustainable resourcing of economic crime.

4. VAT treatment of Bill Payment products
Following a legal challenge from Paypoint, HMRC have changed their view on VAT

treatment of Bill Payment products. This change will increase the VAT recovery rate for
Post Office and Payzone.

have provided this should be completed
for the usual timescale, which means
companies will have to correct any errors
over the past four years.

This means that Post Office must review
whether it has received or made
payments for contract termination,
liquidated damages and breaches of
contract since 2016, and review to
understand the VAT position.

The legal team have undertaken a review
into our standard template contract suite
to understand the VAT position on such
payments. The review has concluded and
advised that no changes need to be made

to the template documents as no
provision is made for termination
payments.

Legal are also ensuring that VAT payment
for termination fees is taken into

ensure this is reflected in the relevant

Consultation on

new
Crime Levy
Update

Economic

At the 2020 Budget, the
Government announced its intention
to introduce an economic crime
levy.

The levy aims to raise
approximately £100 million per year
from entities regulated for Anti-
Money Laundering (‘AML’) purposes
and support reforms to the
sustainable resourcing of economic
crime.

The proposals included, but not
limited to, a levy based on a
percentage increase of current AML

Post Office responded to the
consultation in October.

The expectation is that the official
response won't be until 2021, however
the draft legislation will likely be
published at the same time as the
response.

In its response, Post Office were broadly
in agreement that a levy based on
revenue was the most appropriate
mechanism to assess contribution. It
raised concerns that if contributions were
based on number of SARS this would
disincentivise businesses from submitting
SARS and this was inconsistent with the
AML public policy.

Post Office did raise a specific concern
regarding calculation of revenue. The
calculation of revenue is based only on
revenue raised from the regulated
activity (in Post Office's case, Travel
Money), however Post Office don’t earn

revenue directly from its regulated
activity, it comes from commission paid
by First Rate Exchange Services.

First Rate Exchange Services are a
regulated entity themselves and
therefore would also be subject to
payment of the levy. This would mean
that the levy would be collected twice for
one AML regulated activity. Post Office
hopes to obtain clarification on this point.

Post Office already pay over £2million as
a regulated entity and it is anticipated
that if we aren't exempt due to the
circumstances discussed above, the levy
is likely to be either additional tens or
hundreds of thousands.

4.VAT
Treatment of
Bill Payment
Products

HMRC have ruled that the income
earned from processing _ bill
payments for clients is now subject
to VAT and no longer VAT exempt as
it had been treated previously.

This rule change has come about
following a legal challenge made to
HMRC by Paypoint.

Post Office and Payzone (‘POL Group’)
are treated as one VAT Group for HMRC
purposes and therefore a joint approach
to this change is necessary.

HMRC are allowing the POL Group to
select a date to enact this change, the
sooner the change is enacted the
sooner the benefits can be claimed.

The POL Group will benefit financially
from this change as it will increase the
VAT recovery rate. It is anticipated that
this change will deliver an additional
c.£lm per year of additional VAT
recovery.

On top of this recovery, we may also be
eligible to submit a historic claim (going
back four years) for under-recovered
VAT. This would produce a one-off
windfall cash refund of c.£4m.

The POL Group cannot submit a historic
claim until the VAT change has been
corrected initially. The circumstances
around a historic claim are still in
discussion at this point, however we
understand than other companies have
done so which provides comfort to the
POL Group that we would also be able to.

A project cross functional group including
finance has been set up and there is
funding for an initial month and a half of
work.

Input Sought: Discussion

The Committee is asked to discuss the paper and to approve the remediation activity and next
steps which are:

e to complete the remediation activity on an expedited basis in coordination with the Post-
Conviction Disclosure Exercise and Historical Shortfall Scheme Activity;

e for the legal team to conclude the agreed actions in respect of the assessment of all
boxes stored at Oasis, on behalf of Post Office; and

e for the Group Executive (GE) to agree overall data governance accountability;
for onward submission to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC).

Previous Governance Oversight

The inappropriately archived branch files issue has previously been raised at the Risk &
Compliance Committee (RCC) and ARC meetings in September 2020.

Executive Summary

The paper addresses the situation in respect of the discovery of inappropriately archived branch
file documents whilst gathering information for responses to data requests from applicants to
the Historical Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”). It provides an update on the root cause analysis
(“RCA”), remediation activity and legal assessment of the Historical Matters-related and
Starling implications arising from the issue.

Increasingly management of data, in all formats, is a critical matter for all businesses. This

Paper notes the current, decentralised approach to data management in Post Office and
recommends that clearer accountabilities be allocated across the business

Questions addressed

1. What was the RCA for the inappropriately archived branch files issue?
2 What is the legal assessment of the implications for Historical Matters?
ca What is the legal assessment of the implications for Starling (the “worker” claim)?
4. What remediation actions have been / are being taken?

What is the legal assessment of the implication for GDPR/ DPA (are we compliant)?

6. What is the legal assessment of the implication for DSARs? (has/is POL responding to
these compliantly?)

7. What is the status of data governance in Post Office today?

Conclusion

1. Concerns regarding data management in Post Office have arisen as a result of the

discovery of a number of archived branch files which had neither been structured nor
indexed appropriately. A comprehensive remediation plan has been put in place and,
subject to approval from the Committee, will be rolled out in Q3 on an expedited basis,
in coordination with the Post-Conviction Disclosure Exercise and Historical Shortfall
Scheme Activity.

2: To ensure that Post Office complies with its ongoing duty of disclosure as part of the GLO
“post-conviction disclosure exercise (“PCDE”), the recommendation is for external
lawyers to review the indices of archived boxes stored on Post Office’s behalf by Oasis,
by conducting key word searches, and dip testing both indexed and unindexed boxes.
The dip sampling exercise will then determine the extent to which any further disclosure
needs to be made (e.g. if the contents of the dip sampled boxes do not contain
disclosable material, then no further review may need to be undertaken; if however they
do contain disclosable material then it may be appropriate to widen the sample under
review).

3 As the Historical Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”) is a voluntary scheme, Post Office does not
have any procedural legal obligations to review material. However, in exercising its duty
of good faith to Postmasters, Post Office is taking reasonable and proportionate steps to
identify sources of material which are relevant to an application and will be following the
same search and dip testing processes as for the PCDE.

4. Post Office's disclosure obligation in Starling is

By To ensure that the GLO and Starling teams are sighted on relevant Post Office data (and
therefore to mitigate against a similar issue occurring again) the following activities are
planned / in progress:

a. All branches will be contacted via letter and asked to check and disclose all records
being held locally that should be archived, with updated procedural documents
provided outlining the process for archiving.

b. Data Property Services and Network are working together to identify the data
owners of the boxes already at Oasis which do not have indices and to get the
indices completed when an assessment against GDPR compliance will be made.

@ The Compliance Director will circulate to Data Owners, as the accountable people
for record retention, copies of the retention schedules and remediation logs and
instructions on how to bring up to date. The retention schedules will also be shared
with the external lawyers, so as to ensure they are comfortable that all relevant

records held by Post office have been made available to them.

d. A communication from the General Counsel will be sent to the Leadership Council
on the obligation to assist and put in place measures to address any outstanding
issues identified by the Records Retention Programme and included in Business
remediation logs. Following which attestations will be requested from the Data
Owners that:

i Retention Schedules they are accountable for are accurate and up to date
and any new data sets being flagged to the Head of Cyber Compliance in
accordance with the Document Retention Policy.

ii. The remediation logs are being worked through to close any gaps.
iii. Minimum Control standards are in place.

6. Post Office must conduct reasonable and appropriate searches for information requested
as part of the DSAR process within GDPR. For the purpose of HMU requests, the HSS
data team have cross-referenced system data and conducted extensive searches in ten
different sources. This is time consuming but ensures Post Office is not in breach of
statutory obligations in respect of handling DSARS as these searches would be deemed
to be reasonable and appropriate.

a: Currently the Legal Hold Order that is in place in relation to the GLO and HMU work is a
recognised exemption to the requirement to hold information for no longer than is
necessary. The remediation logs from the Record Retention programme obliges the
business to have processes in place to delete all expired information once the hold order
is removed.

8. In respect to Post Office handling of FOI requests, the legislation obliges Post Office to
conduct reasonable and appropriate searches to locate in-scope information. FOI allows
Post Office to apply a time and cost exemption to locate the data, should these be
exceeded then the request can be rejected, including where searches are prolonged due
to poor record keeping practices. Therefore, as long as Post Office can evidence that the
necessary searches have been conducted then the risk of ICO intervention is low.

9. Data Governance in Post Office is managed through a number of different controls and
accountabilities. This is a decentralised approach and there is no single record depository
that enables the business to quickly identify and manage the data it holds. It is
recommended therefore that Post Office seeks to establish a single accountable unit for
data governance, supported by oversight from the CISO for data security and Compliance
for personal data protection.

Report

What was the RCA for the inappropriately archived branch files issue?

ie As previously reported in the September 2020 RCC, the data team, working on the HSS,
identified inappropriately archived boxes held at Oasis', our archive provider, which
might have relevance to the HSS DSARs. However, it was not possible to determine
quickly what was held in those boxes and whether the material in them was of any
relevance to the DSARs.

2. Initial investigations on a small sample suggest that branches have not being following
the archiving processes for branch records.
3. When a branch closes/closed an archiving process is meant to be followed. This involves

empty file boxes being sent to the branch and a list of requirements for archiving to be
completed. A list of contents is meant to be put in the archive box. Other than branch
name and FAD code, there does not appear to have been any external indication on the
contents of the box and Oasis do not open boxes at site.

4. The contents of the boxes may contain any branch balancing hard copies, Trading
statements, daily and weekly reports. They may also contain HR files such as P250
assistant verification and contractual information on the agent/postmaster.

What remediation actions have been / are being taken?

Ss Where the HSS data team have requested personal data for DSARS from incorrectly
indexed boxes, additional searches have been conducted with the business area to locate
the personal data. To date, the HSS team have been able to obtain the required data
through cross referencing across multiple systems data and combining information and
provide Post Masters with shortfall information.

6. Processes have been developed to ensure that we can meet our obligations or prove that
we have conducted the appropriate searches to meet the ‘reasonable and appropriate’
test.

Digital data / MI:

7. The Data Governance team in IT is conducting a review of the digital data/MI RACI.

8. There are 3 clear priorities to be progressed if Post Office is to manage its data asset
with the same degree of rigour as it does other enterprise assets. These priorities are:

a. ‘Fix the foundations’ - correct the weaknesses in core data management disciplines
and governance

b. Validate and deliver prioritised MI requirements to the business

G Confirm the approach and plan to progress the overall information strategy
(including development of a more detailed set of requirements, operating model,
and business case and to transition to a new MI organisation).

Branch document retention and archiving:

9. A plan is being implemented to ensure that any documents held in branches that should
be archived in accordance with the archive standards are disclosed, properly indexed
and submitted to Post Office's offsite storage (Oasis Records Management). Also, activity
is being undertaken to ensure that processes for record retention in Post Office, as

defined in the Document Retention programme are being actioned. A summary of the
plan is as follows:

a. All branches will be contacted via letter and asked to check and disclose all records
being held locally that should be archived

b. Area and Regional Managers will be briefed to support this process

a These communications will include updated procedural documents (which are

being updated by the Property and equipment Management Team) outlining the
process for archiving and what should and should not be included in boxes sent to
archives. This will ensure that the lifecycle and the integrity of the data is
maintained through to deletion.

d. Property Services and Network are working together to identify data owners of
boxes already at Oasis that do not have indices and to get the indices completed.

10. Document Retention process in back office functions:

a. A communication from the General Counsel will be sent to the Leadership Council
on the obligation to assist and put in place measures to address any outstanding
issues identified by the Records Retention Programme and included in Business
remediation logs. This communication will be issued once the revised structures
are confirmed, post 13th November 2020.

b. The Compliance Director will circulate to:

i. Data Owners, as the accountable people for record retention, copies of the
retention schedules and remediation logs and instructions on how to bring
up to date.

ii. Data Owners, copies of the Data Retention and Deletion Policy, Protecting
Personal Data policy and Cyber Information and Security Policy to ensure
that all control standards are being complied with and identify gaps that
exist.

iii. Internal and external lawyers, copies of record retention schedules for
analysis. This will enable the lawyers to be confident that all records held
by Post Office have been considered for Historical Matters.

a Attestations will then be requested from the Data Owners that:

i. Retention Schedules they are accountable for are accurate and up to date
and any new data sets being flagged to the Head of Cyber Compliance in
accordance with the Document Retention Policy

ii. The remediation logs are being worked through to close any gaps
iii. Minimum Control standards are in place
11. I GDPR considerations:

a. The RCA has now identified a number of boxes that have no indexes. These boxes
are to be considered from a GDPR perspective to ensure compliance with
obligations. This, in itself, does not constitute a breach of legislation, which would
only occur if we;

is Knowingly withheld personal data that had been requested as a result of a
DSAR. Post Office have conducted extensive searches for personal data
requested by applicants to the HSS. There are currently ten cross-business
searches conducted to locate information which will assist in the completion

of applications to the scheme. This level of examination would meet the
criteria of reasonable and appropriate as required by GDPR.

ii. Hold information longer than is necessary. The legal hold order that is
currently in place allows Post Office to retain that information until the order
is removed. Given that these files hold information relating to Branches and
Postmasters, and is therefore in scope of the hold notices, then we are
confident that this does not constitute any breach of GDPR obligations.

b. Should any unindexed boxes be found to contain personal data that should have
been included in a ‘release all data’ DSAR then Post Office would provide that
information to the requestor, if disclosable. It should be noted that outside of HMU
we have never had any reason to search branch file information to service a DSAR.

fen As part of the remediation plan, Data Protection will work with Property Services
and Network teams to;

i. identify the owners to allow the correct record retention schedules and
indexes to be applied. As there is no evidence that any individual has
suffered and harm, damage or distress then this is not a notifiable incident
to the ICO. Key to this is demonstrating that remediation plans are
progressed.

ii. consider whether any recent DSARs have been processed that would have
included requests for information from this source (Please note a search of
all non-HMU DSARs received in the last three years would not have required
any search of these boxes. For HMU DSARs we have been able to locate
information requested by alternative means).

What is the legal assessment of the implications for “Historical Matters”?

12. With respect to past prosecutions brought as a private prosecutor, Post Office owes a
post-conviction duty to disclose material to defendants that might cast doubt on the
safety of their conviction, and to make enquiries where there is a real prospect that the
enquiry would reveal such material. The method by which these duties are discharged
is through a “post-conviction disclosure exercise” (“PCDE”).

13. With respect to the Historical Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”), Post Office does not have any
procedural legal obligations concerning disclosure as it is a voluntary scheme. However,
following the GLO Common Issues Judgment, Post Office owes a duty of good faith to
postmasters requiring it to deal with postmasters fairly and transparently, a principle
reflected in the HSS's Terms of Reference and Q&A’s. Post Office is addressing this by
taking reasonable and proportionate steps to identify sources of material which are
relevant to an application (the standard adopted in conventional civil court proceedings).

14. In addition to this, Post Office has an obligation to conduct reasonable and appropriate
searches for Personal Data requested through the DSAR process. It is a reasonable
assumption that if the archived boxes were indexed correctly then these would be
considered ‘relevant filing systems’ for the purpose of GDPR and in scope for future
searches. However, given that the information required for the HSS DSARS has been
collated through other cross business searches then there is no breach of the GDPR.

15. Post Office initially addressed the impact by reviewing available indices to identify boxes
which might contain material relevant to the PCDE or HSS, and extract from those boxes
any material required to be disclosed as part of the PCDE, or which would be relevant to
the consideration of an HSS application.

POL00423571

16. Subsequent to receiving approval from the Historical Matters Steering Committee, for
both the PCDE and HSS, Post Office is addressing the issues identified through:

a.

Key word searches being applied (or in the case of previous searches, re-run)
across the expanded set of indices to identify boxes which may contain relevant
material, which will then be reviewed to identify relevant material;

Undertaking a “dip sample” exercise of a statistically representative random group
of indexed and unindexed boxes (c.100 of each) to assess the extent to which
they contain material relevant to the PCDE (which would be disclosed as part of
the PCDE) or the HSS work (which would be considered as part of the investigation
into a specific application).

The results of the dip sample will inform the next steps that may need to be taken
with respect to the remaining boxes (e.g. further reviews may be required if the
sample identifies significant volumes of material relevant to the PCDE and/or
HSS).

17. These steps (which are being carried out on an expedited basis in coordination with the
PCDE and HSS), combined with the remediation actions described above, will give
confidence that Post Office has addressed the obligations described above to review
known sources of materials for the PCDE and HSS.

What is the status of data governance in Post Office today?

23. Data governance in Post Office is managed through a number of different controls and
accountabilities. This is a decentralised approach and there is no single record depository
that enables the business to quickly identify and manage the data it holds.

Existing key controls

24. POL needs to manage its data to operate appropriately and effectively. In order to do
this a number of controls both at the enterprise, group and function level have been
established outlining levels of accountability and responsibility.

25. These controls are set out, principally, through the following policies:
a. Cyber & Information Security Policy (principally a technical IT policy)
i. Acceptable use standards
ii. Access controls standard
iii. Asset management standard

iv. Encryption standard
v. Information classification standard
vi. Network [IT network] security standard guidelines
vii. Platform security guidelines
viii. Platform security standards
ix. Secure development lifecycle guidelines
b. Document Retention and Disposal Policy

i. The Record Retention programme, completed in Q4 2019/20, identified the
Data Owners and data held, which was put into the record retention
schedules

ii. A GE re-prioritisation exercise in February 2019 resulted in the Record
Retention Programme'’s funding being halved (from £1.6m down to £0.8m)
and remediation being de-scoped, save for providing IT solutions to high-
risk areas to automate the adherence to these schedules for Telecoms
(Fujitsu), POI (Home insurance, pricing & analytics, Travel insurance, MI
and HR), the Brands database and HR (Success factors & SAP).

& Protecting Personal Data Policy

26. The Document Retention & Disposal and Protecting Personal Data policies set out the
control standards that Data Owners must ensure are adhered to. The key controls are:

a. As part of the design of a new product or service, or where a product or service is
being updated, product or service risks must be considered, mitigated and
documented before completion of design phase. This must include updating of any
related Document Retention Schedules;

b. The integrity and accuracy of data must be ensured at the point of collection.

G Data Owners are also responsible for maintenance and adherence of their
retention schedules. All Data Owners must ensure that the retention schedules for
their area are up to date. This is especially important when changes are being
implemented to business processes.

@

d. Data Owners must understand the complete information lifecycle (creation,
capture, index, manage, access, retrieve, administer, repurpose, share, retain,
dispose, preserve) for all data within their sphere of control.

e. Data Owners must ensure that they have defined the storage requirements for
the data under their sphere of control, and that this has been documented and
agreed. This particularly applies where encryption is required. This is a field within
the retention schedule.

27. Each team within each business unit has a record retention schedule in place. This
schedule details the records they create / hold, where they are stored, their classification,
retention period, storage instructions and end of period action.

28. These schedules are stored centrally on the CISO SharePoint Site and were produced by
the Record Retention Programme.

29. Once produced, each schedule was signed off and approved by the relevant GE-1
member (and supporting team) with responsibility for remediation, adherence and
keeping them up to date handed over to the relevant GE-1 member(s), in accordance
with the Group Retention and Disposal Policy. This responsibility was communicated to
each ‘Data Owner’.

Next Steps:

30. Completion of the remediation activity on an expedited basis in coordination with the
Post-Conviction Disclosure Exercise and Historical Shortfall Scheme Activity

31. Lawyers to conclude the actions in respect of the assessment of all boxes stored at Oasis,
on behalf of Post Office.

32. GE to agree which business function has overall accountability for data governance,
supported by oversight from the CISO for data security and Compliance for personal data
protection.

POST OFFICE LIMITED
RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

Title: Procurement Governance & Meeting Date: I 12 November 2020
Compliance Report

muthar Barbara Brannon, Procurement Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron, Group Chief
Director Finance Officer

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to review the report and note that no Procurement Risk Exceptions
submitted to the Post Office Limited Board since September 2002 and to consider and give
direction in respect of the contracts in the Procurement pipeline which are high value and at
risk of being awarded or extended non-compliantly.

The Committee is also asked to note the alteration in governance approved by ARC and to
advise on preferred governance processes in respect of subthreshold risk exception requests.

Previous Governance Oversight

e July 2020 - Quarterly Risk Report
e September 2020 - Board Report

Executive Summary

As a business in receipt of public funds Post Office Limited (POL) is bound by the Public Contract
Regulations (2015). PCR 2015 oblige POL to behave in a fair, objective & transparent way when
contracting with 3 party suppliers. Additionally, set procedures must be followed for spend
above £25k and £189k.

The purpose of this report is to set out both breaches to Post Office governance and key controls
around contracts and compliance to PCR regulation in the award of contracts.

The aim of collating this information is to drive improvement in awareness and compliance
behaviour across the organisation. The second and primary aim is to work with GE and Business
Units to commence commercial reviews in a more timely way ensuring POL obtains value,
commercial and contractual flexibility fitting the requirements and business strategy of the
organisation.

In March 2020, Post Office Board requested prior approval of all Exceptions. This was revised
in September 2020 to above threshold Exceptions >£189k only in a revision to existing
governance. From November 2020 sub threshold exceptions will be reported retrospectively to
RCC and to ARC.

A Procurement Risk Exception Note is required to accompany all Exception Requests and a
Legal Risk note for requests >£189k.

Questions addressed
1. How many and what types of procurement risk exceptions have occurred in the past
quarter?

Since the last Board report at the end of September there have been no Procurement Risk
Exceptions submitted to Board for approval.

We currently have a lapsed contract with our auditors, PWC which is an internal
governance breach. A compliant extension option exists to extend but they are currently
working at risk preparing an audit plan for 2020/21 while commercial terms are
negotiated.

2. What are we doing about it?
Active reviews continue with Business Units with the highest values relating to non-
compliance.

Our overall non-compliance value has reduced from £27.7m in July to £9.2m in November.

A number of material risks including the retendering of our Payments Processing services
[Global Payments] have been retendered, awarded and closed. The Customer Database
and Marketing Services [RAPP] process is in closing negotiations and will be resolved
before Christmas with a significant Opex saving.

A visual breakdown on all Open incidents at 5/11/20 is available in Appendix 1.

3. I What is in the current Procurement pipeline which is high value and at risk of being
awarded or extended non-compliantly?

a) £10m. EUC

A project has been initiated to re-procure End User Computer services for both Branch
and Colleague Services. The project has been delayed and re-baselined due to Covid
resource constraints. The revised plan targets April 2021 to award a new provider for
Colleague Services with Branch services the subject of a separate tender process. This
process will complete by end of May 2020 without further slippage. In both cases, the
termination assistance period will have commenced prior to award. The project is
currently gathering requirements to go to market however, the exit assistance period
was the subject of an earlier Legal Risk Note which has been updated and is attached
in Appendix 2.

b) £1.5M. Cheque Clearing.

A risk exception was submitted to Board in June 2020 to extend our cheque clearing
services with Barclays. An undertaking was made to retender the service within the
period of the 12 month extension. Due to resource constraints over the summer period,
the project started in earnest in September with a Project manager assigned in late

October. A review of the market has indicated that an OJEU process will be required
for an As Is solution. There is just adequate time left to do this, however, the gross
costs of the expiring contract combined with the RMG delivery costs make this a loss-
making service for POL.

A discussion paper is appended which sets out the challenges of identifying an
appropriate solution, and therefore the procurement process and associated timeline.
An alternative solution would necessitate a further 6 month contract extension in order
to adequately define requirements, allow for a process to be run, and a possible
transition process. Our external contract obligations in respect of cheque clearing for
Banking Framework require an 18 month extension.

ing Approval 17

c) CLOSED. £189k/aggregated £1.2m. Pipeline risk on Swindon software.

This has been resolved as of 11/11. A CAF process is now underway.
Procurement have been negotiating with an IT vendor for some time to bring a legacy
software contract into compliance via a reseller. The software supports our Swindon
operation and termination is not an option at present. Following acquisition by a US
firm, they have withdrawn from the process at short notice. Escalations are proving
productive and we are hopeful of resolving before ARC/Board. A PREN and Legal Risk
Note are attached for review within Appendix 2 in case this becomes necessary.

d) TBC - Common Digital Platform (CDP) Disaggregation.

Rather than procure a like for like service for application support and development IT
are using this opportunity to align CDP with the future IT strategy and disaggregating
the service. Hosting is already in the cloud and will compliantly transfer to the Back
Office contract before transferring to the POL CoE for Cloud in due course. Options for
application support and development [tendering certain pieces, moving non-customer
facing components compliantly into the existing Back Office Accenture contract, and
insourcing some elements] are under review with IT and Legal.

At present the application support and development services are unlikely to have been
completely retendered or moved to other existing PCR compliant contracts by
December as proposed to GE and Board and there are concerns in respect of resourcing
and funding.

The view, however, is that this will have been completely achieved before revised
contract end date in June 2021. The vast majority (by value) is expected to have been
completed by the end of January 2021 as set out in the original Board paper.

4. What are the key changes in the revised governance agreed with ARC in September?

Following review of the annual Procurement compliance report in March 2020, the Audit
and Risk Committee [ARC] have requested a revised approval process for all
Procurement Risk Exceptions.

Tab 17 Procurement Governance & Compliance Report & Barclays Cheque Clear

A revised process was been discussed with ARC in September and the following key
changes made:

17

1. Subthreshold exceptions will be retrospectively reported to RCC and ARC every two.
months. This will become a standing item at ARC rather than an annual report. ARC
will review this position within 6 months. A commercial, pragmatic approach to such
risk was endorsed by the Board in September.

2. Above threshold risk exceptions [>£189k] will continue to require prior approval from
Board

3. Above threshold Pipeline risks, sourcing options and recommendations*, progress
reports on for material procurements, and bi-annual strategic pipeline report will
continue to come to Board.

*It is particularly noted that Board wish to understand the available commercial options, procurement
routes and associated risks [both commercial and of legal challenge]; and proposed evaluation criteria
with sufficient time to discuss and influence if desired.

Prior to March 2020, sub threshold exceptions were approved by the relevant GE member
and SLP; and the Procurement Director. These exceptions were logged, with mitigation
plans to bring into compliance where exceptions were made for an ongoing requirement
rather than a one-off event.

RCC are asked to advise on preferred governance processes in respect of sub-threshold
risk exception requests.

Conclusion

Risk Exceptions are subject to extensive internal governance, legal and risk review, in line with
POL governance guidance on value and risk.

Individually, all large value non-compliant contracts have been reviewed by appropriate Post
Office governance forums with agreement on next steps and actions towards remediation
allocated where appropriate and/or available.

Executive support towards moving POL towards a more compliant footing is very strong, but
equally as important there is extensive support towards the cultural change required to ensure
that Procurement activities and outcomes will support longer term business strategies and we
reduce commercial risk making our 3" party arrangements fit for purpose.

Report

5. What are the potential consequences of non-compliant awards?

a) Pre-contractual remedies overview: During a Procurement, an aggrieved party can
seek an interim injunction suspending the tender or the implementation until the court
decides on an outcome.

b) Post-contractual remedies: The court can order an ‘ineffectiveness order’ rendering
the contract void &/or can award damages.

6. Why are these incidents of non-compliance occurring, and what can be done about it?

Non-compliant awards may be made for a number of reasons at the Post Office.

ig Approval 17

a) Low value, time constrained or highly sensitive/specialist engagements are not
uncommon.

b) Large commercial arrangements cannot often be easily competed or unravelled
without operational impact, and re-procurement may be subject to a pending evolution
of a supporting Business Strategy and/or completion of large, and complex technical
programmes of work to maintain or enhance services prior to a possible exit.

c) The contractual arrangements may pre-date PCR 2015 regulations or the contract
novated during separation from RMG, automatically becoming non-compliant at the
renewal point. Non-compliant awards are frequently made on a tactical basis to extend
contractual services while public tender processes are executed.

d) Delays to public sector panels of suppliers becoming available. The Post Office makes
extensive use of this low-cost route to market and new/refreshed panels are subject
to frequent delays from Crown Commercial Services. Single interim extensions [of
periods under 12 months] while tender processes are run are considered to be low
risk legally.

e) Changes in scope or value over the term of a contract may render the extension or
renewal of services non-compliant. Material changes to the scope of a contract may
render the whole contract non-compliant.

f) Disregard for, or lack of understanding of the regulations.

7. Why are we receiving this report?
A decision to collate this information into a single location was taken in the Autumn of
2016. The aim is to track and improve our overall compliance and commercial results as
an organisation, while also ensuring perceptions are accurate. However, it should be noted
that it will facilitate timely responses to Freedom of Information requests which adds risk
to the Post Office commercial landscape.

8. Are any of these breaches arguable on regulatory grounds or are they all breaches?

A full explanation of the individual compliance breaches for direct awards over £189k
[previously £164k & £181k] threshold is attached in Appendix 1. Each entry details the
nature of, and the value of the breach. The threshold is altered every two years based on
the FX rate between GBP and the Euro.

The Procurement Compliance Register does not at present give an indicative risk level
attached to the award. This information is provided to the accountable executives under
internal governance processes in the form of a PCR risk note before a contract above
threshold is entered into, and if necessary, under Legal Privilege. In addition, all
signatories to a contract have sight of the Risk note as part of the Contract Authorisation
Form [CAF].

All entries are compliance breaches. A period of challenge applies to each PCR breach once
an aggrieved party becomes aware or ought to have become aware. This risk finally
expires at 6 years from the date of breach. The defensibility of a legal challenge is outlined
within a Risk Note.

How many of the breaches were approved in advance and how many retrospectively?
All contracts entered into during this period were compliant with internal governance
processes on contract and commercial review.

Why were the approvals given?
The rationale for approval is relevant to the individual service and is detailed within
Appendix 1.

What were the unapproved, material breaches?
There were no unapproved, material breaches during this period.

Describe what you are doing about the breaches. Where we are in breach, do we have a

plan to come back into compliance and over what time period will that plan take effect?

a) A forward view of material contracts falling under each Business Unit is currently
prepared by the relevant Procurement Manager for discussions with their key
stakeholders. The maturity of this look ahead view does vary currently and is
consistently a high priority activity within the team.

b) Sourcing options papers are prepared for review by contract managers and key
stakeholders [risk, legal, security] with routes to market agreed. In many cases these
are dependent on evolving business and operating model strategies and the
Procurement team are actively involved helping to advise and review options as
thinking evolves.

c) Where a non-compliant award is proposed due to time pressure, Procurement are
actively working on long term mitigation with awards made on an interim basis to
meet urgent operational needs.

d) Each RCC member now receives a regular report on compliance within their business
unit[s].

e) A Risk & Governance process requires a Risk Exception report to be created for non-
compliant direct awards with GE sign off.

f) Awards over £189k must have prior Board approval before being entered into.

g) All Professional Services engagements must be approved in writing in advance by the
CFO/COO. A compliant panel of preferred consulting partners has been appointed and
proposed engagements outside of this panel are subject to additional review and
challenge.

h) Procurement provides training as part of the revised Induction process for new staff.
Training packs are being updated for existing staff and a new training module made
available on Successfactors. Ad hoc training sessions for interested Business Units are
also run.

i) Anew Intranet site has been launched for Procurement to improve visibility of process,
regulation, and the panels of approved compliant suppliers available to POL business
units.

j) Arevised POL Procurement Policy and supporting processes is in progress giving more
granular guidance.

k) Using Crown Commercial Services frameworks, panels of Preferred Suppliers are being
refreshed and updated across a wide range of spend categories to reduce time to
market, improve compliance and greatly improve commercial outcomes and legal risk.

1) A planned change to operational systems will, once live, give Procurement earlier
visibility of potential compliance issues eg: contractual value thresholds.

Risk Assessment, Mitigations & Legal Implications

ig Approval 17

13. As a business in receipt of public funds POL is bound by the Public Contract Regulations
(2015). PCR 2015 oblige POL to behave in a fair, objective & transparent way when
contracting with 3" party suppliers. Additionally, set procedures must be followed for
spend above £25k and £189k.

14. Failure to abide by the legislation or “slicing and dicing” contracts exposes POL to risk,
both as far the commercial outcomes of the contracts as well as the reputational damage,
legal remedies, censure & fines that can follow the discovery of a breach. Our compliance
to PCR can be requested under a Freedom of Information request at any time.

15. The PCR Compliance Register allows for the tracking of breaches to PCR regulations at the
Post Office and internal governance processes. One aim of collating this information is to
drive improvement in awareness and compliance behaviour across the organisation. The
second and primary aim is to work with GE and Business Units to commence commercial
reviews in a more timely way ensuring POL obtains value, commercial and contractual
flexibility fitting the requirements and business strategy of the organisation.

16. Contract and financial governance policy and processes at Post Office are set by the Legal,
Risk and Governance team with clear guidelines for staff availably on the Company
Secretariat team intranet site. This sets out steps to be taken to obtain financial and

contractual approvals prior to making a binding commitment to an external party. Non-
compliance to internal governance processes are also captured within this report.

Period

Detail of contract at risk of exception I This note is to explain the residual risk in relation to using a contractual mechanism
request and i called the Termination Assistance Period within the Post Office Limited (POL) End User
Computing (EUC) with Computacenter (CC).

The contract covers provision and support for all of POL’s Colleague, (e.g. Laptops,
printers, central login mechanism, etc.), Branch end user compute environments (e.g.
Counter hardware that executes Horizon, receipt printers, PEDs, etc.) as well as Shared
Services (e.g. components used by both Colleague and Branch such as Microsoft Active
Directory).

This contract has been in place since 30 April 2015 and POL has already utilised all
available compliant options for extension. Our contract will end on the 29 April 2021,
and this end date is known by other providers of similar services (DXC, Accenture and,
sec).

Based on the remaining time on the CC contract, the time to prepare for and then run
a competition(s), followed by the time to transition services, it is not possible for POL
to exit and transition all services before the 29 April 2021 contact end date, regardless
of which strategy is utilised.

POL will therefore need to utilise a contract mechanism called the Termination
Assistance Period (TAP).

The TAPs primary use is to allow Computacenter to continue to deliver live services
whilst a new incumbent (or POL) transitions services away.

POL must give CC at least 4 months notice, by 29 December 2020, to commence
services under the TAP which can then run for a maximum of 24 months, with an option
to extend the Termination Services for a further 6 months.

Procurement Risk Pipeline Form

The TAP must be used for exit activities only and cannot be used to simply extend or
transform the existing service.

The TAP was put in place during the preferred bidder stage of the procurement for the
current contract and had not been part of negotiations with the wider market.

Legal advice was provided in relation to that risk at the point of approval of the EUC
‘Agreement. This advice identified the risk as low as transition services over the TAP
timescales are not unusual for an ICT contract of this type and because it was envisaged
that, at the time of the use of the TAP, procurement(s) would be underway for
replacement services and so interested bidders would be motivated not to challenge.

This means that by April 2021, POL must be demonstrably and overtly in the process of
exiting the existing contract.

The procurement plan for replacing the current CC End User Compute contract is to
split the existing contract into 3 parts, each procured separately.

Current planning to support EUC IT strategy is three procurements, see key milestones

Why is the chosen option now at risk

At its meeting on O1 July 2020 GE endorsed a recommendation to compete the
procurement exercise for new contract(s), (3yr + 2yr), before April 2021 with transition
completed by Sept 2021.

This strategy provided the greatest opportunity for optimising savings (due to deal size)
and via a structured procurement. This requires an investment of £6.11M and is the
existing strategic direction (as of December 2019), albeit with greater utilisation of the
TAP than originally envisaged due to Covid19 delays. This would allow us to proceed to
market in a standard, structured fashion with a view of transitioning services to a new
supplier.

This potentially offers only lower (but predictable) in year OPEX savings which are
currently estimated at approximately <£750K. There is however a greater possibility of
obtaining on-going OPEX savings post 2022/23 (assuming 21/22 is lost due to transition
charges) as a result of the tendering activity. This could be in the region of £1.5M pa post
transition and transformation.

EUC Reprocurement Summary (Update since June Board)
The EUC programme has had several issues with resources and delayed decision making,
in particular:
© Delays have occurred in decision making for the EUC strategy and target
operating model for Branch and Colleague EUC Services which has had a knock-
on effect for the associated procurement strategy / routes to market.
© Delays occurred with regards to programme approvals and the DELIVER gate
artefacts, in particular, the required business case to progress from the PROVE
phase. This is in part due to challenges with multiple changes to programme
resources, in particular the PM role.
* Asa result, in July/August the Prove phase was re-baselined and a PROVE CR
approved at IC on 24" August which included additional PROVE funding
approval of £421k to January 2021.

Progress against revised PROVE Plan:

* The programme is now progressing on-track to the re-baselined plan and
budget with the DELIVER Business Case signed off and submitting to PRB 21/10,
tracking to approval at 24th November POL Board.

The programme is now resourced and progress towards the Pre-Market
Engagement event is being made with a Pre-Market Engagement Prospectus
and Engagement Day (virtual Teams meetings), however there are delays in
approval for this activity.

* Creation of the Print Specification and Direct Award assessment criteria, as well
as preparation of the Colleague EUC Further Competition pack is underway.

© The business case has re-baselined and re-evaluated resources needed to
complete preparations for issuing Further Competition Invitation to Tenders

approaches and detail risk mitigation
options if available]

As per the Legal Risk Note from Ashfords LLP dated 3" November 2020, there is a
residual risk based around how the TAP was included in the contract during the
preferred bidder stage. This risk remains.

There are several factors mitigating the residual risk of challenge:

* Suppliers who might be aware that TAP was not part of the original contract
will be included in competitions for the replacement services so less motivated
to challenge.

© Any challenge would be limited to damages rather than ineffectiveness and
lawyers are likely to advise against such a claim for a short ‘breach’ whilst the
procurements and completed.

* The OJEU Contract award notice set out the termination assistance will be
provided after the termination date

The total contract value to date is £66m and the further spend will not be close
to the maximum value of £300m in the OJEU

© Evenif the TAP could not be used to provide the Services post termination, it
is likely that the provision of the Services would fall under the ability to modify
a contract under Regulation 72(1)(b) of the Public Contract Regulation 2015 in
any event as a means to extending the services.

Any risk of challenge is further mitigated by POL requesting Termination Services,
including the provision of BAU services during the TAP.

To obtain the Termination Services POL must request them by way of a Termination
Assistance Letter.

The Termination Assistance Letter must to be sent to Computacenter by 29 December,
not less than four months before the end date of the contract.

TAP Changes: Owing to the timing of the procurements, supplier bids will not have been
received with details of transition plans/activities when POL needs to have issued the Notice
requesting Termination Assistance (29'" December 2020). This is likely to result in changes
needing to be made to TAP when supplier responses are received in Spring 2021.

according to Termination Assistance Notice may be amended using the Change Control
Procedure during the TAP, including to extend or reduce any time periods for the provision

to provide the Services with phased transition to a Replacement Contractor; and/or (ii)
provide Termination Services. While technically there is no clause entitling POL to extend
the TAP, the EUC Agreement does provide that POL can extend the provision of the
Termination Services and services that are the same or similar to the Services for up to 6
months beyond the TAP using the Change Control Procedure, which is akin to extending
the TAP beyond 24 months. Furthermore, POL can also reduce the period of the TAP using
the Change Control Procedure.

POL is only required to issue a Termination Assistance Notice to request Termination
Services during a TAP. Notwithstanding this there are provisions stating that POL can
request the Supplier to provide the Services during the TAP as well as the Termination
Services or on its own without any Termination Services. It is therefore unclear how POL
would trigger the TAP if it only wanted the Services to be continued and not any
Termination Services. Our advice would be that POL still issue a Termination Assistance
notice and detail any high level Termination Services that it may require at any stage
during the TAP, including access to information.

Background

POL and Computacenter (UK) Limited (“CC”) entered into the End User Computing
Services Agreement on 29" April 2014 (“EUC Agreement”). On 29 November 2019 POL
and CC signed a letter of extension to extend the EUC Agreement for a further 12-month
period commencing on 30 April 2020, which means the EUC Agreement will expire on 29
April 2021 (“2019 Letter of Extension”). POL does not have another option to extend
the EUC Agreement after this extension.

POL is considering re-procuring the services under the EUC Agreement. POL does not wish
to terminate the EUC Agreement early but wants to explore the possibility of triggering a
Termination Assistance Period (“TAP”).

This note provides a summary of the (i) procurement risks and (ii) commercial risks related
to triggering the TAP under the EUC Agreement.

Unless specified otherwise, defined terms under this risk note have the same meaning as
under the EUC Agreement.

Commercial risk note

Term and expiry

Under clause 66.1, the EUC Agreement commences on the date of signature (the Effective
Date, being 29" April 2014) (note that we have not seen a dated version of the EUC
Agreement but this is as detailed in the letter of extension) and expires at the end of the

Term (being the Initial Term and the Extension Period). POL does not need to take any
action to effect the expiry of the EUC Agreement.

POL-BSFF-0238386_0195
POL00423571
POL00423571

The Initial Term is 4 years from the Service Commencement Date (being 30 April 2015,
as per Schedule 1) and POL has 2 options to extend the Initial Term for Extension Periods
of up to 12 months each (clause 66.3).

The 2019 Letter of Extension specifies that the Term is extended to 29 April 2021.
Charges

During the TAP, POL shall continue to pay for the Services. The 2019 Letter of Extension
calculated the reduction to the Charges for the Services in FY19/20 and FY20/21. POL shall
additionally pay for any Termination Services, Knowledge Transfer or reasonable
assistance based on the Rate Card and as agreed in advance with POL. The Charges for
the Services and Termination Services shall be re-calculated for the TAP.

All outgoings and expenses, rents, royalties and other periodic payments in respect of
Assets and Sub-contracts transferred to POL or the Replacement Contractor shall be
apportioned between POL, CC and the Replacement Contractor, as applicable (paragraph
5.4, Schedule 8.5).

Termination Assistance Period

Duration

The TAP shall end no later than 29 April 2023 (not longer than 24 months after the expiry
of the Term (Schedule 1, Schedule 8.5 and 2019 Letter of Extension)), but POL has the
right to extend the Termination Services for another 6 months beyond the TAP.

The Services

During the TAP, CC is required to continue to provide the Services to the required Service
Levels and no degradation in the standards of the Services (clause 69.1; paragraph 6.1
Schedule 8.5).

Termination Services

CC shall additionally, if requested by POL, provide the Termination Services. To request
the Termination Services, POL must give CC a Termination Assistance Notice by no later
than 29 December 2020 (4 months prior to expiry (paragraph 2.3(c)(ii)(D), 2019 Letter
of Extension)). Note that under Schedule 8.5, paragraph 6.9, the notice period for a
Termination Assistance Notice is 3 months but this has been amended by the 2019 Letter
of Extension. POL is not required to give notice for CC to continue to provide the Services
during the TAP.

The Termination Assistance Notice shall specify: (i) the date from which Termination
Services are required, which may be up to 12 months prior to expiry of the Agreement;
(ii) the nature of the Termination Services required; and (iii) the period which it is
anticipated that Termination Services will be required, which shall continue no longer than
24 months after the expiry date. However please note that POL has an option to extend
the Termination Services for up to 6 months beyond that 24-month TAP period by giving
CC no later than 20 Working Days prior to the date on which the provision of Termination
Services is due to expire (Schedule 8.5, para 6.10). Paragraph 6.14 of Schedule 8.5 details
the scope of Termination Services which are mainly to assist and support the transition.

POL-BSFF-0238386_0196
POL00423571
POL00423571

Tab 17 Procurement Governance & Compliance Report & Barclays Cheque Clearing Approval 17

POL may terminate the requirement for Termination Services by serving no less than 20
Working Days written notice upon CC. This shall not have the effect of reducing the
maximum possible duration of the TAP being 24 months after expiry of the Term.

Changes to the Services and Termination Services:

Under the 2019 Letter of Extension, the Services and Termination Services provided
according to Termination Assistance Notice may be amended using the Change Control
Procedure during the TAP, including to extend or reduce any time periods for the provision
of any such Service or Termination Service. POL’s right to terminate the TAP early for
convenience after expiry of the Agreement would not apply as the clause does not survive
expiry of the EUC Agreement.

Exit Plan

CC is required to provide an initial Exit Plan within 3 months from the Effective Date then
provide the final Exit Plan no less than 6 months prior to the expiry of the EUC Agreement.

CC must review the Exit Plan annually and prepare a revised Exit Plan to reflect the
changes in the Services and submit it to POL. The parties must then agree the content
together. There is no provision for POL to initiate a request for changes to an Exit Plan but
practically speaking, POL may raise such request during the review process of an Exit Plan.

If the parties cannot agree the final Exit Plan within 14 days from CC’s delivery of the final
Exit Plan to POL then the matter will be escalated in accordance with Schedule 8.1
(Governance) to be resolved by both parties within 5 Working Days from the escalation
before going through the Dispute Resolution Procedure (paragraph 6.8, Schedule 8.5).
Until such dispute is resolved, the last approved version of the Exit Plan will apply.

Transition

The transition of the Services may be phased (paragraph 6.6, Schedule 8.5). If the
transition is not completed during the TAP, POL may request in writing that CC continue
to provide Termination Services and additional services, including that are same or similar
to the Services, on a time and material basis using the Rate Card (subject to indexation)
following the TAP and until the transition has been effected (paragraph 2.3(c)(iv), 2019
Letter of Extension). The notice period for such request is not specified.

Procurement risk note

Residual Procurement Risk

There is a residual procurement risk attached to the use of the TAP from the point
at which it was introduced into the EUC Agreement at the Preferred Bidder stage
of the procurement for the EUC Agreement because it did not form part of the
dialogue with bidders. Legal advice was provided in relation to that risk at the point
of approval of the EUC Agreement. This advice identified the risk as low as
transition services over the TAP timescales are not unusual for a ICT contract of
this type and because it was envisaged that, at the time of the use of the TAP,
procurement(s) would be underway for replacement services and so interested
bidders would be motivated not to challenge.

At this stage, this residual procurement risk still applies and the use of the TAP
has the potential to highlight this procurement risk as we believe that the market

POL00423571

erriance &

is aware that the contract is due to terminate at the end of April 2021 and therefore
will become aware that additional transition services have been agreed.

The use of the Services during the TAP

The Services and the Termination Services are identified separately in Schedule
8.5 of the EUC Agreement. Paragraph 6.1 makes it clear that CC has to provide the
Services during the TAP and that POL can choose what Termination Services it
requires.

Given that the procurements for the replacement services will be underway by the
time the TAP begins, POL may consider the provision of the Services during this
time is enabling the transition. There could be an argument made that this is not
the case unless the Termination Services are also being provided quite quickly into
the TAP, but this is not necessarily supported by the wording of Schedule 8.5. For
this reason the more quickly the re-procurements are carried out the lower this
risk.

Mitigating factors

Despite the risks attached to the use of the TAP outlined above, we consider that
there are several factors mitigating these risks of successful challenge so that they
remain low.

Firstly, we understand that the bidders from the original procurement who are most
likely to become aware that the TAP has been agreed post Preferred Bidder stage
given their knowledge of contract during the process are potential bidders for the
re-procurements and so they are less likely to be motivated to challenge at this
stage.

Secondly, any challenge would be limited to a damages claim because both a
declaration of ineffectiveness and a penalty will be time barred. Bringing a damages
claim when the timescale of the alleged ‘breach’ is limited to a few months while a
procurement process is completed is likely to be advised against by legal advisors
to a potential challenger.

The value of the Services during the TAP is estimated to be £5 million, which added
to the £66 million spend under the EUC to date, is well within the value of up to
£300 million set out in the OJEU notice. The OJEU notice also sets out that
transition services will be provided after the termination date.

Even if the TAP could not be used to provide the Services post termination, it is
likely that the provision of the Services would fall under the ability to modify a
contract under Regulation 72(1)(b) in any event. While we understand that CC
would be unlikely to agree to such an extension on the same terms and therefore
this way forward is not an option, it does assist with an assessment that the risk
of successful challenge in a Court is low.

Blue Yonder (formerly JDA Software Group) is an American software and consultancy
company that has ended up owning and delivering support to POL of a bespoke
version of the WMD (Warehouse Management Dispatcher).

Blue Yonder having initially agreed to work through a compliant IT Reseller
Framework in June of this year to bring the contract under compliance have reneged
and refused to operate in such a way this week (WC 2/11). The company have only
elaborated that they are not set up to work through resellers in this way and are not
willing to invest time or effort in an approach to payments that they will not use
elsewhere. We still have a need for the services, the renewal is shortly due, hence
this PREN-there are no other avenues to achieve compliance.

Context:
“Swindon Stocks” comprises a series of legacy IT systems focused around Galaxy

The Galaxy system acts as the main hub for the stock control system and holds master
data for all products and address details for Branch, Royal Mail, Parcel Force and third
parties.

In relation to products, Galaxy stores approximately 11,000 products 30% of which are
active at any given time.

* Holds a large variety of master data about items, delivery sites and supplier contracts
* Keeps track of stock availability

* Takes in orders from POL branches and other warehouse client sites

* Reserves stock, if available

* Consolidates orders per delivery address and Passes orders to WCS for picking, packing

Galaxy receives orders from branches, as well as Royal Mail and Parcel Force depots,
and fulfils them by interfacing with WCS and Mercia; note that it has both POL and RMG
users.

Galaxy acts as a hub, with WCS (aka WMD), Mercia, POLSAP, Royal Mail and Parcel
Force systems as spokes. A number of Access databases are used in conjunction with
Galaxy, assisting in the management of master data, and the formatting of branch and
client orders, all arriving from a variety of sources.

How does this product fit in?

JDA (now Blue Yonder) provide software that is used within the Swindon supply chain
stock centre to control the pick and pack/conveyor belt ~ “Warehouse Control System”
also known by the vendor as “Warehouse Management Dispatcher”.

The contract was a CSC (now part of DXC) sub-contract, accessed via Royal Mail. The
Deed of termination enabled POL to take a direct relationship with JDA to achieve
separation from Royal Mail along with other software and systems components at
‘Swindon this was compliantly done in 2015.

In 2016 when the Back Office IT contract was being let all of the Swindon systems and

Risk Report

This is a Legal risk report prepared in respect of an agreement to provide software that
is used within the Swindon supply chain stock centre to control the pick and
pack/conveyor belt - “Warehouse Control System” (“Agreement”) between Post Office
Limited (“POL”) and (“Blue Yonder”).

Background and Purpose

I understand the Agreement was compliantly sourced in 2015:
Blue Yonder provides a software (JDA Warehouse Management Dispatcher), and
support/maintenance for stock management systems located in Swindon (“Services”)

The Agreement is due to expire on 15th November 2020 and POL has secured the
Services beyond the expiry of the Agreement, via a reseller under the Health Trust
Europe (HTE) Framework Agreement. POL appointed SCC as its reseller under the HTE
Framework Agreement. POL has carried out. this exercise in order to compliantly source
the Services.

Whilst Blue Yonder were originally keen to provide the Services via SCC, they are now
refusing to do so on the basis that-they are not set up to work through resellers. POL is
still engaging with Blue Yonder to enter into the arrangement. If Blue Yonder refuses to
enter into an agreement via'the reseller, then POL will have to renew the Agreement
non-compliantly with Blue-Yonder for continuation of the Services.

The purpose of this risk report is to summarise the key risks to POL if the Agreement is
non-compliantly extended and the mitigating factors assigned to such risk.

(PCR)

The Services under the Agreement are
subject to PCR and therefore must be
competitively procured. POL has
exhausted all options to extend the
contract and therefore any further
extensions are deemed to be non-
compliant under PCR.

There is a risk of challenge by other
providers who provide similar services on
the basis that they were not afforded
the opportunity to bid for the contract as
the services were not procured
compliantly.

The risk of any such challenge under the
PCR appears to be low as I am advised <

While the practical likelihood of a third party
bringing a claim is low, if a challenge is indeed
brought, such a claim is likely to be successful.

Should a challenge be successful, this could lead
to damages being awarded to them and the
court could also direct the contract to be
terminated.

Oversight:

Previous Governance

A risk exception was approved by the Board in June
2020 to extend our cheque processing services for 1
year until 30 June 2021.

Executive Summary

Context:

Barclays provide cheque processing services for the out-
clearing of Personal and Business cheques that we accept
as a Method of Payment (MOP) at our Horizon Counters.
This includes Banking Framework processing services for
Cheque Encashment and Partner Bank Cheque Deposit
Envelopes which we are committed to providing until the
end of Banking Framework 2, that is the end December
2022.

These services commenced in 2011 under an OJEU
Tender Award, with the OJEU Notice stating a total
contract duration of 8 or more years. However, the
contract awarded was on a 5+3 basis.

Approval was granted in 2018 to extend our cheque
processing services for 2 years beyond the contracted
term with Barclays until 30 June 2020.

POL00423571

The contract was extended again last summer to 30 June
2021.

The Banking Team now own this contract under the
recent organisational review and are evaluating future
service options, to move away from high-cost paper-
based services using RMG and other couriers. Cheque
scanning at the counter to improve the service offer to
customers and remove the expensive costs of moving
cheques to a central processor is the most likely outcome
of this review.

Consequently, a project to build a business case for
cheque scanning at the counter is underway, including
running an RFI to help validate the supplier costs. The
plan is to start procurement in the new year subject to
approval of this business case and funding.

Questions asked & addressed

2. What is the background to this request?

3. What options were considered?

4. What is required to re-procure these services?

Report

What contracted services will need to be extended and why?

5. Cheque transactions support core services such as Mails (stamps and parcels); Bill
Payments (e.g., utilities); and PO Money Savings/ISAs. In 2019/20, a total of c1.9m
cheques and c8.4m Partner Bank Envelopes were processed, at an OPEX cost of c£1.2m.
By not continuing the current service with Barclays, it would result in cheques not being
accepted across our branch counters as a method of payment and breach our contractual
commitment on cheque deposit service with Banks. This would impact our credibility with
customers, require contract changes with our partners who accept cheques for their
services (e.g. DVLA, Bill Payments etc) and our ability to negotiate Banking Framework
3. We are committed under Banking Framework 2 to keep the deposit service until
December 2022.

What other options have been considered?

6. An OJEU procurement process could be prepared and launched for a replacement AS IS
service, however the current service loses c£3m p.a. mainly due to the Royal Mail
overnight pouch service (c£4.4. p.a.) and a minimum term of 2-3 years would have to
be offered to the market in order to make it attractive to bid. Hence, there is a wish to
explore other commercial options via an RFI which was issued to the market in on
4/11/20. This will provide key market information that will mean we are better informed
on what cheque processing option to procure (e.g., costs, solution risks and delivery
timescales).

7. In parallel we are also exploring the opportunities to include the Camelot/Postal Order
Corporate Banking contract which could help save on procurement, business and contract
management resource if one supplier can provide both services.

Banking Framework 3 will provide the opportunity to either significantly increase the ‘as is’
cheque deposit service price to banks, possibly increased further with the offer of processing
from a central point into clearing on banks’ behalf (as we do with our MOP cheques), or offer
an in-branch scanning solution if the RFI and resulting business case justify such investment,
in particular that the cost base can be moved to a predominantly variable basis given the
likely fall off in cheque volumes.

Financial Impact

The bulk checkout processing services are budgeted with 2020/21 OPEX forecasts at
a full year cost of c£1.1m. The Royal Mail Pouch service currently costs c£4.4m p.a.
This service was benchmarked in 2018 and there was insufficient geographical
coverage with another vendor to deliver against the overnight SLA’s agreed within

Banking Framework 2.

external procurement, legal advice has

Stakeholder Implications

8. The recommended approach outlined in this report is designed to minimise any impact to
stakeholders, with the contract extension providing continuity to support the existing
cheque transaction processing services. This will allow sufficient time for the business to
explore the optimal cheque clearing solution now that the entire industry has recently
completed the FCM industry programme.

Other Options Considered

9. We considered procuring the as-is service only, however we wish to explore alternatives
via a RFI as well as establishing realistic timescales for introducing any new solution so it
can be factored into the negotiations of new Banking Services (Banking Framework 3).

Risk Note

Author: Lucy Woods (Procurement) - Ashfords LLP Date: 23 June 2020

Summary
Post Office Limited (“POL”) is seeking procurement advice in relation to a 12 month
extension to its cheque clearing services.

POL can seek to use the exemptions in Regulation 72 of the PCR 2015 and the risk of such
exemptions being effective if challenged in Court is medium, but that when assessed
against the actual likelihood of challenge we consider this risk is low.

POL can further mitigate these risks of challenge by ensuring it publishes the required
notices in the OJEU.

Background

Post Office Limited ("POL") and Barclays Banks Plc ("Barclays") entered into an
agreement dated 7 May 2010 for the provision of cheque processing and related services
(the “Bulk Clearing Contract"). We understand that the Bulk Clearing Contract
originally had a maximum overall contract term of 8 years; an estimated value of £10
million; and was procured in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, now
replaced with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (the "PCR 2015"). The OJEU notice
referred to a term of 5 years with an option to extend ‘for three years or more’.

The Bulk Clearing Contract was amended:

*® on or around 28 September 2016, to extend the initial term to 31 October
2016;

e on 25 November 2016, to amend and restate the contract. The amendments
included an extension of the contract term to 31 July 2017; and

e in 2017 by a Deed of Variation to provide for an extension of the contact term
until 30 June 2018, along with an additional right for POL to extend to 30
June 2020. As part of this Deed of Variation, the parties also agreed some
commercial changes to the contract.

POL is now looking to agree with Barclays a further 12 month extension to the Bulk
Clearing Contract, which would extend the contract to 30 June 2021 (the “BCC Dov").
Such extension also provides for some further amendments to the contract terms,
including some amendments to liability for POL and Barclays and some review to the
charges over the extension term. POL would like advice on the procurement compliance
of the BCC Dov.

Behind the Deed of Variation there has been a complex background of the introduction of
the image clearing requirements in the industry (the “Image Clearing Obligation”). We
understand POL has continually reviewed the need to re-procure these services on the
open market, however the implementation of the Image Clearing Obligation has caused
significant delays to POL's ability to do that in a manner which does not affect services
and is value for money. Originally due to be completed in 2017, the Image Clearing
Obligation has seen the market struggle to meet the new obligations and as recently as
early 2020 the market has only just settled to a point where POL could look to start a
procurement with a sensible outcome.

Modification

The BCC DoV can be compliantly entered into provided that one of the exemptions set out
in Regulation 72 of the PCR 2015 applies because the changes to the Bulk Clearing
Contract represent a modification during its term. If one of the exemptions under
Regulation 72 cannot be used then the BCC DoV could be held to be an illegal direct award.

There are two exemptions we consider may apply to the BCC DoV, that under Regulation
72 (1) (b) and that under Regulation 72 (1) (c).

Regulation 72 (1) (b) allows for changes to the Bulk Clearing Contract to add additional
services provided that a change in contractor cannot be made because:

(a) of economic or technical reasons; and
(b) this would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs.

We consider it is very likely that the Image Clearing Obligation had an effect which required
the Bulk Clearing Contract to be extended past its original 8 year term using this
exemption, however the Court would decide on the facts whether that was the case.

To be able to use this exemption, the total value of the services following the BCC DoV
must not exceed £15 million. It is our understanding that the estimate total spend across
the services to include the 12 month extension of the BCC DoV is £11.5 million.

Our concern about the use of this exemption is that it relates to the ‘addition of services’
and not changes to the contractual relationship generally. We understand that there have
been various amendments to the commercial positions between POL and Barclays during
the term (including SLAs historically) and the BCC DoV provides for both changes to the
indemnity and liabilities of POL and Barclays and the charges for the services. Accordingly
there is a risk that these changes are not purely the ‘addition of services’. To the extend
POL is comfortable that these changes are absolutely necessary due to the addition of the
services for the increased term (and not due to the changing commercial circumstances
of the parties) then we consider this exemption could be used. If POL is not confident in
this position it can consider the use of Regulation 72 (1) (c).

Regulation 72 (1) (c) can be used by POL for the BCC DoV where POL can demonstrate
that the changes have ‘been brought about by circumstances that a diligent contracting
authority could not have foreseen’. The benefit of this exemption is that it relates to all
changes and therefore can include commercial changes as well as the addition of services
provided that the changes do not change the overall nature of the contract. Again there
would be a financial limit of £15 million for the use of this exemption.

In our view POL may find it harder to use this exemption given that the Image Clearing
Obligation has been in place since 2017 and so lack of foresight is more difficult to
demonstrate at this stage, however, it may be that the difficulties that the market would
face with the Image Clearing Obligation over the last 3 years could not have been foreseen.
Again, this would be for the Court to decide on the facts but we anticipate POL could put
forward quite compelling evidence on this front having, as we understand it, looked to re-
procure several times but considering that the market was not ready to be able to bid
effectively.

The use of either exemption requires POL to publish a Modification Notice in the OJEU. We
note this was not done at the last extension which increases the risk of challenge and

ig Approval 17

therefore we advise that this should be done this time to fully mitigate this risk (see section
on mitigation below). For the BCC DoV we consider the risk of not being able to use the
Regulation 72 exemptions as medium (but see below).

Consequences of an illegal direct award and likelihood of challenge
In the event it was held that the entry into the BCC DoV was an illegal direct award the
consequences of such a finding are:
a) a declaration of ineffectiveness which would bring the contracts to an end
with associated penalties; and/or
b) the award of damages by POL to the successful challenger.

To understand the likelihood of a challenge arising we need to consider the potential
challengers, which are those providers on the market who provide cheque clearing
services. A risk only crystallises if a challenge is brought.

Our understanding from POL is that the market has not been in a position to effectively
bid for these services if they had gone out to market at any point between 2017 and early
2020. To the extent this is correct then we can assume that the likelihood of a market
player wanting to bring a challenge is greatly reduced. POL needs to ensure that its
procurement strategy from early 2020 onwards allows for the services to be re-procured
in the most efficient way possible on the basis that the extensions are only being put in
place to cover the gap between the Image Clearing Obligations settling down to a point
where the market would be able to effectively bid and when a procurement could be
completed.

This assumption is supported by the fact that any market player who was interested in the
services would have been aware that the BCC Contract was due to end in 2018 according
to the OJEU notice and therefore POL may have expected a challenge before now, if there
was an appetite for a challenge on the market.

For this reason we would assess the actual likelihood of successful challenge as lower than
set out earlier in this note and would therefore consider it to be low.

Mitigations

By publishing notices in the OJEU in relation to the use of the exemptions set out above,
POL will be doing what it can to ‘notify’ the market and seek to set the time limit for
challenges running.

POL must balance this against the risk of highlighting the presence to the market of the
DoV however we would assume that the nature of the market is such that POL’s
relationship with Barclays is already well known.

For a claim for damages a challenger would have 30 days to raise a challenge from the
date they knew or ought to have known about the DoV. This time limit can be extended
by the Courts by up to 3 months where there is ‘good reason’ for doing so. Publishing
notices in the OJEU of the change will assist with an argument that the 30 days runs from
the date of that publication, although this will ultimately be determined by the Court.

For a claim for a declaration of ineffectiveness no challenge could be brought after a date
falling 6 months after the DoV was entered into.

Detail of contract being entered into /
extended.

Barclays provide cheque processing services for the out-clearing of Personal and
Business cheques that we accept as a Method of Payment (MOP) at our Horizon
Counters. This includes Banking Framework processing services for Cheque Encashment
and Partner Bank Cheque Deposit Envelopes. These services commenced in 2011 under
an OJEU Tender Award, with the OJEU Notice stating contract duration of 8 or more
years. The contract has been extended to 30 June 2020 with internal and external legal
procurement advice sought, including external legal counsel Stephenson Harwood.
Additional legal advice has been sought and obtained from external legal counsel
(Ashfords) in June 2020 which is attached.

How long are you asking the business
to tolerate /accept this risk?
(duration)

12 months Start date 01/07/2020 End Date(s) 30/06/2021

Why does this contract need to be
entered into / extended now?

What is the reason for the urgency?

In 2015 POL initiated a programme to meet the industry wide HMT and Cheque & Credit
Clearing Company (C&CCC) directive to transition from physical paper to image clearing
in 2017. Subsequently, the industry wide programme suffered significant issues and as
a consequence the full migration from paper to image clearing was delayed to Q4 2019.
We have received an initial recourse of £33k from Barclays for the issues and delays
and they have remediated to point of stability in Q2 2020.

Approval is now sought to extend the services for a further 12 months in order to re-
procure these services during this further 12 month extension to 30 June 2021.

Impact if Exception Declined

Cheque transactions support core services such as mails (stamps and parcels); Bill
Payments (e.g. utilities); and PO Money Savings/ISAs could not be processed, resulting
in cheques not being accepted across our branch counters as payment. This would
impact circa £0.7 billion of our turnover per annum [current annual value of cheque
payments].

2. Asummary that identifies the changes and updates to the policies and statements have
been added below:

Change Management Policy:

In this annual review there were minor updates, this included using the revised template for
the policy to be updated on, along with details of new personnel.
Policy Compliance View

This policy was significantly updated last year. The policy directs clearly what constitutes a
change, how changes should progress through governance and the change principles which
balance these aspects and seek to reduce the risks associated with change.

The Change Excellence Framework SharePoint site provides detailed oversight of all the
processes and controls in place.

The Strategic Portfolio Office also ensures that training is provided for all Heads of
Transformation Portfolio and Change resources, covering any changes to governance
processes. Any new resources are provided with more in-depth training to ensure their
understanding and compliance to the standards.

Conflicts of Interest Policy:
This has had a thorough reviewing covering the below additions:
1.3 - Inclusion of definition of a person connected with a director;

1.6. - Improved detail on directors’ duties under CA 2006 and compliance with the UK Corporate
Governance Code;

2.4 - New reference to the Post Office Conduct Code relating to business standards and greater
detail on the process for reporting.

2.4 - Procurement; new section on managing procurement conflicts, signposting the existing
declaration process.

2.4 — Directors; new section on considerations for directors when identifying and reporting
actual or potential, direct or indirect interests.

Policy Compliance view

A comprehensive update- we have agreed to explore with Co Sec areas to test for control gaps
as part of our second line compliance review.

Protecting Personal Data Policy:

No substantive changes, minor updates to section 1.7 to add Freedom of Information Act, 3.1
to include the eCase tool and 4.3 to refer employees to the Data Protection intranet page for
further help.

Policy Compliance View

Control Standards can be demonstrated as being met; however, these do require the action
and support of Data Owners within the business to ensure these are effective controls. The
working Personal Data Incident, Breach Management and Post Office Individual Rights
Procedures, demonstrate the controls in place and the minimum control standards stated are
being met.

Risk Policy:

The Risk Policy and Risk Appetite Statement are to be covered separately in Mark
Baldock’s risk update paper.

Policy Compliance View

Each minimum control standard stated within the Policy is currently operating. Evidence of each
control is either reflected in the corporate GRC tool or maintained by Central Risk who own the
risk registers, compliance with the policy is demonstrated through the Risk
Registers which provide a detailed oversight of all the processes and controls in place.

Freedom of Information Policy:
This is a new policy that LCG are proposing Post Office adopt.
Policy Compliance View

Given that this is an introduction of a new policy the attestation on the policy performance will
need to be made and carried out next policy annual review.

Assurance

Working with policy owners we are piloting the assurance process and sample testing policies
on a risk basis to review the policy standard and policy compliance.

The Key Policies Intranet Page has now been updated and reflects the following:

Input Sought: Noting

The Committee is asked to note the details of the insurance renewal for 2020/21 and
particularly the Directors & Officers Insurance Renewal..

Executive Summary

Post Office’s insurance cover has been renewed in line with the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee (ARC) paper dated 28 October 2020 at a total cost, in line with the estimate
presented, of £2.1m.

Following the ARC approval, the Crime insurance deductible was increased from £2m to £6m
and the corresponding guarantee from NatWest in favour of the Bank of England was raised
accordingly. A breakdown of the insurance premiums is presented in Schedule 1.

Report
D&O Insurance Renewal Challenges

D&O Market Contraction

1. The following factors have driven significant price increases in the D&O insurance market:
. Declining value of insurer investments (insurers invest premiums before having to
pay out for claims);
. Increased claims (Lloyds H1 predicted profits of $1.25bn deteriorated into a $0.5bn
loss. Lloyds ultimately expects to pay Covid-19 claims of over $4bn);
. Lower premium volumes (from reduced economic activity);
. The impact of the virus to the global insurance industry is estimated at over $200bn,
half of which is reduction in insurer investment values; and
. The potential for D&O claims arising out of (Covid-19 related) insolvencies in 2020/21
is of serious concern to insurers.
2. Asa result of these issues, market capacity has reduced, driven by some insurers
exiting D&O insurance and others taking more cautious, reduced positions.
3. Post Office Limited’s (POL) pricing was also impacted by:
. Horizon liabilities; and
. Lack of appetite from some insurers for financial institutions exposure (Lockton
explained to insurers that we are not a bank but provide banking services).
4. Schedule 2 sets out the experience of other corporates. For example, one retailer
experienced a 10x increase in premiums for D&O cover of £40m compared to £60m

the previous year. Lockton noted that those companies with higher D&O insurance
cover than POL’s £60m typically have operations in the USA.

5. POL’s £60m D&O policy has been renewed at a cost of £292,000, a 160% increase on
the 2019/20 premium of £112,500.

Why did the renewal run late?

6. On the 1 November 2020 renewal date, £40m out of the £60m of cover was in place.
By 5 November this was made whole with £20m of additional cover backdated to the
renewal date.

7. The delay was caused by market conditions whereby insurers introduced much more
stringent processes to underwriting risks. Most renewals now require senior
management sign-off and the interrogation of risk has become significantly more
rigorous, resulting in greater work for underwriters and a subsequent slowing of
renewal processes. Further, whilst renewal was initiated earlier than usual, insurers
were unwilling to engage in meaningful discussions until close to renewal, as they
dealt with renewals from the 30 September quarter date.

8. Historically, POL’s insurers have not required updated financials prior to renewal,
accepting receipt of these sometime after renewal. This year, late in the process,
these became a ‘must have’ before some insurers would provide terms. Insurers paid
much closer attention to the regulated and Financial Institutional aspects of the Post
Office business and required a detailed update on the Horizon issues. This arduous
process has not been unique to Post Office, however, and has been a challenge for
brokers and their clients across the market.
