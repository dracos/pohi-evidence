0.00 Usual introductions made, caution administered. DO declines the

presence of a solicitor at interview.

4.10 LA Basically if I go over the events of what's happened so far.
DO Ok
LA Bring us up to where we are now. This morning the Investigation team

received a call to say there was going to be an audit shortage at West End
Post office. The auditors had gone into the office and you had spoken to
the auditor and said it is going to about £40,000 odd short

DO Yes

LA Ok. I came to the office with my colleagues Jon Longman and Adrian
Morris. We came into the office and we introduced ourselves to you and
your two colleagues that were there. We then went with Caroline?

DO Yes

LA And went to the managers office at the Tesco store where we spoke to
her regarding the audit shortage, informally, by completing form CS003.
We also did the sarne for the other lady there, which was Sam. Sam
Holman, again same circumstances. Having spoken to those two we then
asked you to come to the managers office where you was cautioned.
Form CS001 and CS003 was completed. Obviously we then asked you for
consent to search your home property, which you gave us.

DO Yes

LA And those forms were completed. When back into the office I was handed
a number of items one of the items being a statement, which I believe is
in your handwriting?

5.43 DO It is yes.

5.44 LA Can I just ask you to read this statement for me, please.
DO I believe there to be a loss of around £40,000 in the office it seems to have

been building up over a period of several months. It appears to be in Main
Safe which is MM stock to make the stock unit balance I declare cash that
wasn't there. How this has accumulated I do not know I have tried to
search the units before but haven't been able to find where the loss could
be. I do feel that none of the staff have been involved in this loss.

LA And then your name is printed under there

DO My name is printed P O'Connell. OIC officer in charge.
LA Right. Can I ask you to sign that statement

DO Yes. Would you like me to date it

LA Yes and the time. Which is 14.54.

After we got the audit result from Sue Le May, who I believe is the lead
auditor there, it was just over £45,000 short.
We went to your home address
conducted a search of the premises, Nothing was seized at all from the
property. And then we have come on to here today now. Is that fair

bo Yes that's fine.
LA What's happened so far

12.12 LA Obviously the reason we are here today is the £45,000 loss
DO Yes
LA What can you tell me about that
DO I really can't tell you anything about that. It seemed to start sometime
last year in the middle of the year, about July or something.

LA About July
DO Yes it was about £10,000 loss. Which I kept trying to find.
LA Did you report it to anybody
DO No, I didn’t. I got, stupidly I should have done but I got a bit worried

thinking oh my god. I didn't want to try and get, cause this but um. I don't
know it just the money never seemed to physically leave the main safe.
The units always balanced.

LA Stock units

ibe) Yes.

LA You are talking about B, CD

DO Yes

LA Yes

DO Um main safe never seemed to be but every time I balanced at the end of

the week it would be like I don’t know maybe another £1000 wouldn't
match up. Or it would be £500.

LA Right.

DO And it would be like, oh I can’t physically see it gone anywhere. All
transfers would tally.

LA Do you do cash declarations every day?

DO Yes

LA Right what were the cash decs like on a daily basis?

DO Um I didn’t always do one in MM every day.

LA You didn't Right

DO Which is obviously what

LA Yes. It could have helped identify

DO Yes

LA The point when the money was going missing

DO Yes

LA Since July was it one lot of £10,000 that went missing?

DO It seemed just one lot of £10,000.

LA Right

DO Just wasn't there. But I couldn't see where it had gone out.

LA Right

DO Or gone in.

LA Yes

DO It just, but it still seemed that everything seemed to calculate. I know it's

really hard to understand what I am saying there. But it just seemed to
calculate before I couldn't figure out where £10,000 could have gone. It
didn’t seem as though it had physically gone.

14.15 LA Right so that was in July. £10,000

DO It just went up and up and up. The more I tried to figure it out, I think the
worse I was getting with it.

LA What was you doing to try and figure it out.

DO I don't know. I think because I was trying to cover it, it was making it
worse.

LA Cover it how...

DO I was declaring money that wasn't there.

LA How was you doing that then. What were you physically doing

14.39 DO Well if like it was £10,000 short I would say there was £10,000 more there

than there actually was.

LA What would you do, add £10,000 on to a particular denomination or what
would you do?

DO Well sometimes I would split it, between the £20's and the £5's

LA Right

DO Not the £5's the £10's.

LA You mean the £10.’s and the £20’s

DO Yes, £10.'s and £20’s sorry.

LA So what would you do were you balancing MM stock, would you go into
M, find out what the cash was, and then enter what you should have

DO Yes, that's what I was doing.

LA You wouldn't enter what you had on hand to get the discrepancy. Right

DO I do it. The way I would actually always done it before I was doing the
complete opposite.

LA Tell me what you was doing

DO Before I used to count all the cash I would declare it and find the

discrepancy. That's how I used to do it. But then it was just like do a cash
dec and find out what the discrepancy was. Does that make sense? No

LA You would do a cash dec to find out what the discrepancy was.

DO Before when I used to balance I would do a cash declaration.

LA Yes

DO I would count all the money

LA Yes

DO Then I would enter declaring it

LA Yes, right then it tell you

DO It would tell me a loss.

LA Loss or your gain

DO Then when the money didn't seem to add up, I was doing a cash dec. just

taking the cash dec

LA Nothing on it
16.03 DO Nothing on it. And finding out what the difference was.
LA So that would tell you how much money you should have.
DO Should have
LA So then what would you do
DO Then I would go and count the cash and I wouldn't have that.
LA Right. So then how would you balance.
16.15 DO I would just say I had it there.
LA You had what you should
DO Yes
LA What the computer telling you you should have.
DO Yes. The only time I noticed anything that was different and I can't

remember when that was, was two weeks, there was £500 in one week
and £500 in the other week and that was in £1 coins

LA How do you know it was in pound coins

DO Because the bag, they were less. I don’t know if you went in the office. On
the door we have a list of what's in the notes, what we are holding in
notes, what we are holding in coin in the safe.

LA Right

DO So on a Wednesday you've got a rough guide to know what should be in
there. I would take that out and check what we had.

LA Right

DO And then it would be like there should be like a £1000 in pound coins

LA . Right

DO And there was only £500 and then we went to the drawer on the side
which we keep it out daily cause while the safe is shut if we needed
change

LA Right

DO That was always the same. So nothing had been transferred and nothing
had moved and no one knew where it had gone.

LA Right. When was the last time that had been checked though.

DO That was done every week, the main safe was checked and the cash every
week

LA So at some point during the week somebody had taken a £500 bag of £1
coins and not knocked it off

DO Knocked it off on the door

LA Right

DO And it hadn't been added on other one that's in the drawer because we
have two lots, one that's in the drawer

LA Right

DO So it should have been added onto that.

LA Ok but what about the notes?. Obviously the coin
17.44 DO That's what I'm saying
LA Because on the notes
DO That's what I'm saying
LA So on the notes
DO I didn’t notice, that’s what. I can’t explain
LA If the notes weren't there back in July, you would have had. I don’t know
how much would you have had in the safe roughly?
DO I don't know
LA £5,000, £20,000, I mean are we talking a little bit of money or a lot of
money.
DO There is usually alot of money. I don’t fully understand what you are
saying.
LA If you are saying you write on the safe door we should have £20,000 of
twenties and £5,000 of tens.
DO But what was on the door was in the safe. That's what I couldn't

understand. What would be on the door would be in the safe. But it didn't
tally up. Because when I do a cash declaration there should have been
more in the safe.

LA So what you are saying is everybody is writing down, but if the starting
figure was right the week before and everyone wrote down what they had
had.

DO Yes

LA It wouldn't be, would it

DO No. All the transfers seemed to match up what went from the main safe,
to the stock units

LA Right

IL They couldn't have matched that because there is a discrepancy

ite) But what I wanted to make sure is what they had, that they had
transferred out of the safe what they had.

JL So the transfers agree

DO The transfers agree with what the girls had had in their drawers. From
week to week.

IL Right

DO You would look on the door and you would count what's in the safe with
what's on the door were completely different.

LA Well it would be.

DO Whether it was me trying to calculate it or trying to find out something.
Whether my figures ended up going up the wall in the end I don't know.

LA Who has access to the main safe then

DO We all do really

LA Why do you all have access

anybody?

DO No no I mentioned it to Sam and Caroline about September, they were
shocked.

LA What did you mention

DO Did you know if

LA What did you say to them in September.

DO I just said look I think you need to know there is a loss of £10,000 at the
moment I told them I am not accusing anyone (inaudible) if anyone can
throw a light on it, they said no, so I said that's ok fine. I do believe them.
They wouldn't touch it, they wouldn't do that. I know they wouldn't.

LA How do you know they wouldn't?

DO I just know, I don’t know I worked with them for such a long time. I just
know.

LA So in July on your weekly balance you was inflating the cash to cover for
money that wasn't there.

DO Yes

LA And this continued right up until

DO Now

LA Till now. And who did you tell in between apart from Sam and Caroline in
September, who have you told.

DO No one

LA Why haven't you told anybody

DO I don't know.

notes and the £10 notes are both showing £15,000 each.

DO Yes

LA So would it be fair to say that generally the amount of cash held in the
main safe is very low.

DO Yes it has been getting very low yes

LA So anything that's of a bulk value could be an inflated figure.

DO Yes

LA So if we go back to the office and get further balance sheets from May,
May time it may only have three or four thousand maybe a bit more.

DO Yes

LA Something like that. Right this is 17" December, M stock and cash there is
£43,513.

LA Right so that's the over inflation.

DO Yes

30.01 DO Yes. That wasn't there, that was like this

LA The twenty one, right, so you have made up a pouch then. Right.

DO Yes

LA But that would have been there, the rest

DO That was there yes

LA Cash for that week would have been correct

DO Yes

LA But you have gota cash in pouch

DO You see that was another thing if you look at that, if that money, I'd
included that money in the safe that would have made it twenty five, no
twenty one thousand, twenty five thousand. Yes

been asked of you.

DO That's fine

JIL If you are innocent and you are having trouble balancing why didn't you
report itto someone in Tesco's or Tesco's audit or whatever procedures
you have got in place. Why didn’t you put your hand up, when you

was losses in the office that you couldn't account for.

to cover up for the loss.

wouldn't find the missing money

done is honest or dishonest

40.28 DO Yes
IL By inflating the cash figures do you accept that.
DO Yes
IL And what she was saying to you it is a dishonest thing to do
40.36 DO It is dishonest yes
IL Because you are not reporting a true figure. Do you understand that.
DO Yes I understand
JL And that is an offence of what we call False Accounting

people. They can look at it and they can say the office has balanced and
everything is ok. They have got that amount of cash

DO Yes

It When In fact it is not true is it.

DO No. We were having problems when ordering cash

IL Yes. But the accounts you have produced since you been inflating the
cash they haven't been true

DO No they haven't

JL True balances have they. Therefore my colleagues trying to explain that
you have committed

DO Yes I

IL False Accounting. Do you accept that

DO Yes I do

LA Dawn, did you report anything to the Post Office Helpline

DO No I didn't tell anybody at all

LA Nothing at all. So nobody knows apart from the £10,000 in September. So
there is no record of it anywhere

DO No

LA Did you write down anywhere the losses, date of the losses

DO I might scribble on a piece of paper every now and then

LA But you have not got a list of dates

DO No

LA Or losses. How much it was

DO No

LA That sort of stuff

DO No

LA summarises that between July 2007, when a £10,000 loss was found
The losses have increased up to over £40,000

Each week inflating cash on hand to make M stock balance and apart
from September, not told anyone else of the losses.
