branch, and that it would remain closed until its conclusion. The nominated branches offered were: High St, Rayleigh,
Hambro.. A notice was placed on display at the branch detailing this information. I also asked the NBSC to notify the
Outlet Intervention Office that an audit was being performed and that the branch would remain closed until it’s
conclusion. allowed us access to the secure area and was not present in the secure area whilst the audit was carried out.
Brenda Howcutt was then advised that they should satisfy themselves that the figures of the audit team were correct.

Therefore we asked Brenda Howcutt if they would do their own independent count of all the cash on hand again,
which they did. Brenda Howcutt then confirmed that the figures of the audit team were correct.

I then telephoned yourself at 10:00 to report a preliminary suspected shortage of approximately £60000 and that I
would ring you back with the final figure once I had completed the audit. This T did at 16:41 to report an overall

would appreciate some assistance, I told him that Claudette Beaney lived a short distance away and was on a TB day,
he said he would phone her and get back to me. At 10:03 I called Carol Ballan (CA) and explained the situation I
informed her that I arrived to complete a cash check, but that Kevin Palmer spmr had arrived and told me that the
office was going to be approx 60k short and that his father in law was going to make it good by cheque today, she told
me that he would obviously be suspended and then called in for an interview, she then told me that she would be in
interviews throughout the day and could I speak to Paul Southin while she was unavailable. At 10:06 I phoned Rhys
Jones who originally raised the request for a cash check, he gave me the Security Managers details Joel Watson who I
phoned at 10:10 to inform of the situation at this office (The Grange) and that Kevin Palmers father in law would be
settling the shortage by cheque, he confirmed that if that was going to happen then he would not being calling the
police because it can be dealt with within The Post Office.
