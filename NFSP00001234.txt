Thank you for your enquiry via our website.

The NFSP are not managing the cases related to losses suspected of being incurred due to Horizon. We believe the
option to join the group litigation has closed at present but that may change. The case is being handled by a company
called Freeths, and we suggest you contact them if you have evidence that the losses you incurred were as a direct

result of Horizon.

Regards

I would like to know who is managing the case on behalf of postmasters regarding
Enquiry discrepancies and the Horizon system. I lost £15000 over my 10 year stint and still
believe it was a Horizon system fault rather than any misappropriation
