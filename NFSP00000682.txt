Dear Executive Officer

George has asked me to follow up his earlier email by re-sending the report, which it appears a few people are having
difficulty opening. Please find attached:
e The report in its original pdf format (just in case there was a problem in it being sending from George's account)
e AWord version of the report, copied over from the original pdf (and therefore with some of the formatting lost /
scrambled)

In addition, please see below the statement placed this morning on the NFSP website:

The NFSP has responded to the publication of an independent interim report on Horizon, the Post Office IT system.
George Thomson, NFSP General Secretary, said: “While we have never been presented with clear evidence that the
Horizon system had failed to meet its primary purpose, we are nonetheless reassured that the system has been found to
be robust in an independent survey, and we continue to have confidence in it.

He added: “We are also encouraged to see that Post Office Ltd (POL) concedes that there is scope for improvement in its
training and support programmes - issues which the NFSP has raised repeatedly with POL. We look forward to working
with members and with POL in the coming months to increase those support levels.”

Post Office Ltd has also issued a statement on the report's findings.

We also plan to issue a BSC today, which will be forwarded to Executive Officers in advance of circulation to branch and
regional secretaries.

Finally, you may be interested to view the statement which POL issued late yesterday in response to the report:

Paul
