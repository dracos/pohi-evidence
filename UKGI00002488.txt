Dear James

We are now commissioning updated registers from all teams for September. I have attached your latest risk register
for you to update.

Please forward me the updated file by close of play on Friday 3 October. If this is not possible, or if you have
questions, please contact me.

It is important to note that when updating your register ALL sections should be filled in. In particular, please note the
following:

® Complete the “Overall RAG Rating” rating (e.g. the drop down menu in cell D9) AND the “Overall RAG Rating”
description; (e.g. qualitative description of 50-100 words)

¢ Place BOTH the risk and mitigated “bubbles” on the heat map for your selected risks;

e Rate ALL risks and mitigating actions, in respect of BOTH probability and impact; and

e Please also move the old rating values to the “Prev” column and input the new rating values to the “curr”
column. This allows the risk team to monitor month on month changes.

e Under each risk for “[date of entry]” (i.e. the third row under the summary column for all risks) please input the

DATE THE RISK WAS INPUTTED NOT THE DATE THE RISK WAS AMENDED. This allows the risk team to monitor the

ageing of various tasks.

e Inthe reputational risk cell please include a comment on possible political risk/exposure, including whether this is

on a decreasing/increasing profile as 2014 progresses.

If you need support in relation to any of the points above, again please contact me.

Many thanks in advance,

Emma
