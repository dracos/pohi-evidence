Jane

Given we were unable to meet as planned this morning, as requested I attach a draft of a letter you might consider
sending to Tim Parker as a follow up to your meeting with him last Friday.

As you will see, it suggests (tentatively at present) the names of 3 QCs who appear from my own research to be likely to
fit the bill. Tony Peto QC was particularly recommended to me by Tom Weisselberg, whose views I sought on the basis
that he knows a bit of what this saga involves. Rodric, who has not had a chance to consider this in any great detail, may
also have views on other suitable alternatives as will you, I’m sure. Nonetheless, I attach the biogs of all 3 to give youa
sense of them.

In addition, the letter sets out a starter for 10 on the question of scope but is explicit in that it is offered purely asa
straw man to be knocked down/amended by Tim on Counsel's advice. But we have to start somewhere in giving
whichever of the barristers is ultimately chosen some idea of what they are taking on. Again, his diary has prevented
Rod from giving this in depth consideration, although the text has benefitted from a couple of exchanges with him
earlier in the day.

Do let us have any feedback and we'll get on to it right away.

Patrick
