3.1.7. Counter printer tear-off

The distance from the top of a pre-printed form is 0.06".

The distance from the tear-off position to the first printed line on the till roll is 0.07".
The minimum distance is 0.625" between the last printed line and either:

e The bottom of a pre-printed slip

e The tear-off position on the till roll

3.2 Mandatory receipts

The term mandatory is used for receipts that are produced automatically as part of the transaction; for
example, all APS receipts.

3.3 Welsh receipts

When issued from a Welsh office, customer receipts will have Welsh and English text; when from an
English office they will have only the English text. Any receipt or slip that has a bilingual version is
identified in this document; any receipt or slip that does not have a statement about a bilingual version is
printed in English only.

3.4 Duplicate receipts

Duplicate receipts are marked with the word ‘Duplicate’ and as many as are needed can be taken after
the original receipt and until a new session is started.

3.5 Receipt Fonts

Receipts are printed on the counter printer using the Epson default font that was selected by Post Office
Ltd. For example purposes only, the illustrative receipt layouts in this document use Courier New 10pt.

3.6 Definitions and Conventions

3.6.1 Session and Transactions IDs

3.6.1.1 Session ID
Session IDs have the following format:
¢c-nnnnnn
where cc is one or two digits
nnnnnn is a string with a value between 0 and 999999, with leading zeros suppressed

Within a branch, session ids are unique (although in busy branches they may restart from zero after a
period of several years).

3.6.1.2 Transaction ID

3.6.1.1.1 Transaction IDs within a session

Transaction IDs have the numeric format tttt (0-9999) and are unique within a session. The first
transaction within a session is Transaction ID 1 and the number is incremented for each transaction until
the session is settled.

3.6.2 Customer

To the Post Office Clerk the Customer is the person standing in front of him or her.

3.6.3. Amounts
The maximum field size for currency amounts on receipts is as follows:
99999999.99s
where ‘s’ is a minus sign for a reversal, otherwise blank.
Notes:
« No comma separators are used in currency amount fields on receipts.

e The pound and pence signs '£' and 'p' are used on some receipts; no other currency symbols are
used.

e There may be other limits imposed by reference data.

3.6.4 Signs

Signs (negative) are normally only shown on amounts (currency) for reversals, and if they cannot be
inferred. Where the net value of a summary is negative as a result of a reversal, the total will be shown
as negative. An exception is that negative sign is always used on customer receipts.

3.6.5 Reversals

For all conventional transactions a reversal is shown as negative, with a trailing minus sign to balance
out the erroneous transaction. The volume of any price within a group will be shown net of reversals (if
one product is remitted and then the remittance reversed, total volume for that product will be shown as
zero).

Reversals of remittances of stock that is held by volume, but where volume is not printed, are indicated
by a reversal indicator 'R’, printed to the right of the value field.

3.6.6 Time on receipts
All times shown on receipts are /oca/ time. That is they are either GMT or BST, as appropriate.

3.6.7. Field alignment
The general principle is for left hand fields to be left aligned, and right hand fields to be right aligned.

3.1.8 I Representing products in examples

Product names are driven by Post Office Ltd Reference Data, and as the Horizon System is developed
and improved, and business needs dictate, the names of products may change and products may be
added or removed. Consequently, the layouts are examples; actual product names may vary.

3.1.9 Representing line numbers in field definitions

In the tables of field definitions, the line numbers refer to the line positions on the example layouts.
Some receipts have repeated sections that may not be shown in examples, so the line numbers on a real
receipt may vary from the examples in this document.

4.2.1.GLB UCB: Simple VAT Customer Session Receipt

4.2.1.1 Description
Taxable transactions have one of the following VAT rate codes:
e $= Standard
« R= Reduced
° Z=Zero
e E=Exempt
Some transactions are not taxable, i.e. are non VAT rated, and thus have no VAT code.

This is the customer record of a session in which no tax is payable or the total gross value of taxable
transactions (excluding Exempt rated) does not exceed £250.

The customer receipt produced for sessions in which some tax is payable and the gross value of taxable
transactions (excluding Exempt rated) exceeds £250.00 is documented in section 4.2.2, the “Full VAT”
session receipt.

4.2.1.2 Frequency
Per customer session as described in section 4.2.1.1.

4.2.1.3 Notes

A receipt is only available for the last completed session. (Only the receipt from the last session, whether
it is a customer or back office session, can be reprinted.)

The Post Office Ltd products that are printed below the TOTAL DUE TO POST OFFICE line are defined
as Method of Payment products and are controlled by Reference Data. For example, debit or credit card
payments/refunds appear below this line and not as part of the transaction listing.

In order to provide the most accurate result, the ex VAT / NET sub-totals are calculated from the
associated gross totals, and may not match the sum of the ex VAT / NET amounts shown individually.

4.2.2. GLB UCB: Full VAT Customer Session Receipt

4.2.2.1 Description
Taxable transactions have one of the following VAT rate codes:
e $= Standard
« R= Reduced
° Z=Zero
e E=Exempt
Some transactions are not taxable, i.e. are not VAT rated, and thus have no VAT code.

This is the customer record of a session in which some tax is payable and the total gross value of
taxable transactions (excluding Exempt rated) exceeds £250.

The customer receipt produced for sessions in which there is no tax payable or the total gross value of
taxable transactions (excluding Exempt rated) does not exceed £250.00 is documented in section 4.2.1,
the “Simple VAT” session receipt.

4.2.2.2 Frequency
Per customer session as described in section 4.2.2.1.

4.2.2.3 Notes

A receipt is only available for the last completed session. (Only the receipt from the last session, whether
it is a customer or back office session, can be reprinted.)

The Post Office Ltd products that are printed below the TOTAL DUE TO POST OFFICE line are defined
as Method of Payment products and are controlled by Reference Data. For example, debit or credit card
payments/refunds appear below this line and not as part of the transaction listing.

In order to provide the most accurate result, the ex VAT / NET sub-totals are calculated from the
associated gross totals, and may not match the sum of the ex VAT / NET amounts shown individually.

4.4.3. PS UCB: Speed Bulk Postal Services Receipt

4.4.3.1 Description
This is the customer receipt for a Speed Bulk Postal Services transaction.

4.4.3.2 Frequency

One receipt is issued for each maximum of ten items per Speed Bulk Postal Services transaction within
a customer session.

4.4.3.3 Notes
Mandatory.

The Postal Services application does not have the facility to produce duplicate receipts. The Speed Bulk
Postal Services Receipt, which is not produced by the Postal Services application, does allow a
duplicate but, for consistency with other receipts, “DUPLICATE” is not added. Since the receipt is not of
any value and is not a proof of posting, this has been allowed as an exception to Section 3.3.
