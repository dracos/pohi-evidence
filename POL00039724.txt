Below are a series of attachments. The first two lines represent the draft papers to go to CEC in the first
fortnight in March. Please treat with caution since there will be a few tweaks to these (CEC have changed
their minds about positioning and George Hooper and I have to join this one up with his on process
management). But it will give you the gist. The one that reads CECCO13 is the outline of reasons for
conformance I mentioned yesterday.

Separately I'm sending the report Glenys Davies of PA and I knocked together on costs, benefits and actions
for non conformance. It's not well drafted but holds some clues about potential risks.

I'll send you the HEB report in paper form and’wonder if you could have it copied and return it to me.

And on the matter of ICL remedies, I checked with Keith Baines team, and there is no current process for
assessing the contribution of our incompetence to ineffectiveness of Horizon in such a way that ICL can
immediately get remedies. It doesn't mean they might not try in the future. If you want to pursue this further,
give Keith Baines a call. .

On the matter of other regular or otherwise reports to help you, may I suggest that you send a copy of your
terms of reference and a request for relevant data (old or new) to John Meagher, David McLaughlin, Douglas
Craik/Trevor Rollason and Dara Forde. They should be able to supply or point you towards data that indicates
risks around training. Bruce is also extremely helpful of course.

Hope this helps,

Clare
