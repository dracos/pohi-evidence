1.0 Introduction

This document reports on the issues that arose from two major incidents affecting the
Network Banking Service that occurred on 5" January 2004.

This report covers:
- How the problems came to light
- The impact on the branch service
- The investigation
- The resolution
- The root cause

- Actions and recommendations to prevent recurrence

2.0 Scope

The scope of this report is two major incidents that occurred on Monday January S" The first
affected all on-line transactions for some 30 minutes for a subset of the branch estate. The
second caused the loss of the Network Banking Service for an hour and a half to the full
estate.

3.0 Management Summary

The first incident caused 70 Post Offices to log calls stating that the Offline Indicator had
appeared on the screen. The advice from the HSH was to log off and log on again and this
resolved the Post Masters’ issue. The first call was logged at 11.45 and the problem was
cleared by 12.05. In that timeframe a further 400 calls were abandoned. The problem was
caused as a result of a software problem that Energis encountered while they were
undertaking maintenance work. The problem was overcome by Energis and this, together
with the availability of alternative routing, meant that the impact was minimised.

Correct escalation routes - including to POL - were followed.

The procedure agreed following the Off Line Indicator fails on 7" and 25" November was
invoked. This was to get a sample of FAD ISDN numbers to Energis within minutes. This
worked very successfully and ensured confirmation that the failures experienced by the Post
Offices which had logged calls were indeed amongst those which Energis would expect to see
affected by the problem that they had encountered.

The second incident in the afternoon of 5 January had the effect of losing the Network
Banking Service to the full estate for an hour and a half. It was caused by a failure in a Fujitsu
Services encryption router at IBM Warwick.

Version: 1.0

Company-in-Confidence Date: 06-FEB-2004

Upon the failure of the primary encryption router, fail-over to the secondary encryption router
should occur automatically. This did not happen.

Attempts by the Core Services Networks team to enlist IBM's assistance in resolving the issue
were delayed because the wrong support route was invoked.

Service was resumed following a software reboot of the encryption router.

Some symptom similarities with the incident in the morning and the "relatively" low rate of
calls to the HSH - some 80 calls in a one-hour window (with, again, some 400 abandoned) -
also contributed to unsatisfactory handling of this incident, including an unacceptable delay in
briefing POL.

Corrective actions are identified in a later Section but the primary ones are as follows

- the Core Services Network team procedure for requesting IBM support has been
updated. It should be noted that all procedures are reviewed on an annual basis, with
urgent changes being made as required.

- a change to the Hot Standby Routing Protocol on the encryption routers, that will
cater for the type of failure that occurred on 5" January and ensure fail-over, is planned
for implementation over the weekend of 17/18 January

- a manual procedure to effect failover has been put in place. This can be invoked
should automatic failover not be successful.

- plans for enhancements to Business Continuity Testing in this area will be reviewed,
with initial proposals by 30th January. This will be followed by a wider review across
other areas.

- the necessity for promptly advising POL of such incidents has been re-inforced to POA
service managers

- Energis to propose revised criteria for advising Fujitsu Services of operational change
activity and how the likelihood of a change being service-affecting is assessed

4.0 Description of the fault and service failure

4.1 Symptoms and Business Impact

4.1.1 Symptoms as seen by Branches

In the first incident, from 11.45 for a period of some 20 minutes , 70 Post Masters called the
HSH as they were unable to perform on-line transactions on the Horizon equipment because
the Offline Indicator was present. The advice from the HSH was to log off and log on again
and this resolved the Post Masters’ problem. There would nevertheless have been some impact
on customers who were visiting Branches.

Version: 1.0
Company-in-Confidence Date: 06-FEB-2004

In the second incident no Post Master, from around 14.50, would have been able to perform
any Network Banking transactions on the Horizon system, for about an hour and a half. This
would have had a corresponding impact upon customers who were visiting Branches.

No Network Banking transactions were processed through the NBE and onto the relevant
Banks.

4.1.2 Symptoms as seen by Fujitsu Services

On the first incident, HSH received 70 calls by 12.00 stating Off Line Indicator with a
further 400 calls being abandoned. SMC had seen Fatal Events on Warwick Encryption
Router 2. Energis saw a drop of FRIACO ports (a maximum of 3000) and then saw them
restore 10 minutes later.

On the second incident, SMC saw Fatal Events on Warwick Encryption Router 1. This was
followed by the HSH receiving about 80 calls within an hour - with a further 400 abandoned.
No issues were visible to Energis.

4.2. Detailed explanation of the incident

The first incident was caused by maintenance work that Energis were undertaking to tidy
tables on a network router at Watford. This was expected to be routine work that should not
affect any live service. Hence none of their customers, including Fujitsu Services, should have
been affected. In undertaking this work, however, Energis encountered a software problem
and then had to revert the router to its previous state. The dial plan between Fujitsu Services
and Energis provides for alternative routing, which, along with the swift rectification by
Energis, explains why affected Branches were able to successfully retry their transactions.

The software problem referred to above is a Cisco problem. Energis have advised that in terms
of service impact it is safe to refrain from tidying the relevant network tables until further
information on the problem is obtained.

The second incident was attributable to a failure on Encryption Router 1 at Warwick and
the subsequent failure to fail-over to Encryption Router 2.

The delay in getting Encryption Router I back up and running was primarily due to the Fujitsu
Services Core Services Network Team not using the correct procedure for enlisting IBM's
assistance. Essentially the team contacted some IBM staff directly rather than using the
correct route which is via the TSD. It was unfortunate that the IBM staff who were contacted
initially were not able to assist, but it is recognised that the wrong procedure was used by
Fujitsu Services. By the time that the appropriate IBM staff were involved the router had
rebooted itself and the service was thus restored.

Ref: CS/REP/177

Date: 06-FEB-2004

The core dump from the failing router has been examined by Cisco. Their response has been
that from the evidence available they are not able to determine any cause for the encryption
router failure. Neither does the evidence assist as to the reboot.

The failure to fail-over to Encryption Router 2 is now understood (following the investigative
work undertaken over the weekend of 10/11 January) and an enhancement to the Hot Standby
Routing Protocol is planned that will deal with the situation that occurred on the afternoon of
5® January. This situation being that Encryption Router I had lost its encryption tunnels to the
Horizon Data Centre but in other respects was functional.

It is noted that Business Continuity testing across the link from the Horizon data centres to
Warwick has to date been effected by generating a hard fault (removing the cable) at the data
centre end. The incident in the afternoon of 5“ January has shown that some changes to future
Business Continuity testing are required and there is a corrective action in a later section to
cover this.

It should be noted that, additionally, senior management in POA and, onwards, senior
management in POL were advised of these issues during the day.

6.0 Problem Management

The first incident was well managed and appropriate procedures were followed. The
instigation of the timely provision of the ISDN numbers for affected Branches to Energis for
investigation was successfully used for the first time. There was timely escalation within POA
and into POL. Energis rectified the problem quickly. Problem (PM0000447) has been logged
for the incident.

Energis did not consider that it was necessary to advise Fujitsu Services via an OCP of their
intention to carry out the tidying of the network tables. This was because it was not expected
to be service-affecting. As a result of this incident Energis have been asked to review the
criteria for determining the need for an OCP and how the likelihood of a change being service-
affecting is assessed. Their proposals are expected in a week's time.

The second incident (logged as PM0000448) was not well managed. In addition to the
technical failure that prevented automatic failover to Encryption Router 2, the use of incorrect
escalation routes into IBM delayed resolution. The delay in formally advising POL of the
problem was unacceptable. Fujitsu Services staff were endeavouring to fully understand all
aspects of the problem so that a complete picture could be given to POL, but got the balance
wrong between that and the necessity for early advice to POL. Corrective actions in these
areas have been identified and are recorded in the next section.

The fact that there were some similarities between the symptoms of the two incidents
undoubtedly clouded the issue.

A Post Incident Review was held the following morning between POL, POA and IBM and
actions were identified. For completeness the following section encompasses those actions.
