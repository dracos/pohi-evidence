David,

Today we gained verbal agreement from RMG that we would come off red alert. This is however subject to
them finally validating today’s data which is planned for Monday at 2pm. I did finally get to speak to Stephen
Windsor-Lewis who is very supportive and happy that we are finally at this stage. I suggested that after we exist
Red Alert that I would arrange a lunch/dinner for us to restart our relationship to which you will be invited.
