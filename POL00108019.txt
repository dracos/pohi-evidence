Subjec Re: Call

I think we should add Kevin, Angela Chris Mark, Lesley and Simon as they can update where they are with
the various work streams. And indeed you can update us from the Board.

Theresa - pls can you circulate a meeting request?

Paula, we then need a separate one to one.

Alwen if there were ques raised at the Board meeting that were not dealt with I would like to understand
what they were and who raised them so that they can be addressed individually.

Susan

Subject: Re: Call

Hi Susan, actually, that makes sense: I have a 10.30am regular call with Alwen and Lesley on JA. As you
are now leading this, you could take the slot, we could update and then you could update me on where we
are in the process.

Could you let Theresa know whether she should stand them down; or the opposite and indeed bring in any of
the others (chris, Mark, Angela, Kevin) on the call initially to update me on the programme? We could
then stay on afterwards. However, it is quite ok, if you just want to do it 121 but I do need an update
sometime today, as well as us catching up

Re the update, I would like chapter and verse as much as possible. I know it won't be fully defined yet
but I’m expecting that we will have an outline. You will undoubtedly have many items to add, but these
are the questions in mind this am:

+ list of work streams, who is leading each, what they think the work plans for each stream will need to
cover, what they are currently doing/by when, etc

* update on SS cases - as you didn't come in yesterday, I still don't know the mix of what SS are looking
at - prosecutions or not

* any more breakdown of past prosecutions - how many are false accounting? You were going to look into
what data could be had from RM? Is it correct that we don't have the files?

* resource update for each workstream, stakeholder involvement, possible names for independent chair

* update on SS: what approach, their demeanour, costs, timings

+ plans for using JFSA - where and how; have you or Alwen spoken to them this week? (It can't just be me
that has the good relationship.)

+ Monday's meeting: what do we want from it and what prep therefore needs to be done; have we let JA/JFSA
know re SS attending? (Think you said yes)

* the Board were supportive of our forward outline. They are deeply concerned about historic risk and
possible associated compensation. what info can we give them at this stage to help them assess the risks?
Who are we planning to use in terms of external support? I will need something for them by the end of
this week in terms of an update, which can refer to Monday's meeting. We may, as we have done on strategy
need a weekly email.

+ Can we do some horizon scanning (board terminology and unfortunate in this instance!) to work through
as many risk scenarios as possible, and then pre-mortem each. Feel free to pull in Martin E to help with
this, or any of the programme

* Insurers - alerted, response, status?

I think that’s sufficient from me, as I said, please add. I have also copied Alwen, as there were very
detailed notes from the Board all of which needs feeding in properly, I know you met last night, so you
will have some already; and Alwen will also have some thoughts as well as actions to add.

speak soon, Paula
