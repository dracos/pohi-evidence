Subject: More on BE/0158102

Gareth,

Background to this problem:

Contention between balancing and CABSProcess resulted in the only stock unit rolling over having not written the
discrepancy properly to local suspense.

There's a lot more information, and a messagestore extract, on PC0158102.

Real problem here is that the PM is making sustained losses and obviously the system problem muddies things (though
in fact I think the only effect it had was to lose an £1883 loss, not to cause it). But I would welcome a second opinion.

I can let you have printed trading statements and balance reports, if you have time to look at this.
