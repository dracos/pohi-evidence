conditions for CSR Acceptance have to be satisfied. The parties agree that the CSR

the CSR Operational Trial Review Period have expired. If the Contractor is correct that
the Disputed Category A Faults are of medium severity then the thresholds in paragraph

condition for CSR Acceptance is that a timetable has been agreed to resolve all
outstanding category (b) faults.

Catagory A faults is a category (a) fault then CSR Acceptance has not been achieved as
‘at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period.

if, as at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period, a timetable has not been
agreed between the parties to resolve all outstanding category (b) faults, then CSR
Acceptance has not been achieved as:at the end of the CSR. Operational Trial Review
Period. Such a timetable has not been agreed.

as follows:

In the period between the date of this Agreement and 17th September 1999 (the

Faults, the Disputed Category B Faults (if agreed or determined to be category
(b) faults), and. (if appropriate) the ‘Unagreed.Fault; and

(ii) a single timetable for resolution of outstanding category (b) faults (including any
Disputed Category A Faults determined to be, or recategorised as, category (b)
faults).

The joint workshop will be chaired by Keith Baines of POCL and Tony Oppenheim of the
Contractor and will be ‘charged with the production: of agreed resolution plans, the
le for their implementation, and general project management of

“Agreement as to resolution of faults having been hampered by differences as to.the
data, the parties will agree as soon as possible within the Limited Trial Period an
appropriate set of measures (including data gathering and testing) to determine:

+ the extent of the disputed faults and

+ the efficacy of any agreed resolution plans.

The Contractor shall make available:to POCL as soon:as possible all data available to
the Contractor relevant to any of the Outstanding Faults, including, without limitation, all
system recorded data relating.to the incidence of rebooting of counter terminals
(relevant to Al 298).

The parties will involve Peter Copping as Expert in the activities referred to in this
paragraph 2. There may be occasions-on which the Expert is asked to determine an
issue as between the parties in.accordance with'the provisions of Schedule A11 (for
example he may be required to determine the status of the Unagreed Fault) but
otherwise (save as expressly contemplated in this letter) his role will be as facilitator and
adviser to the parties in their efforts to achieve successful resolution of outstanding
issues.

The provisions of Schedule A11 relating to the Second Acceptance Test shall be varied
as follows:-

3.1 Notwithstanding paragraph 3.1 of Schedule A11, the only elements of the Core System

,

3.2.1 any fault arising upon the re-testing referred to in paragraph 3.1 above;

me to light only as a result of that corrective work; and

323. (subject to paragraph 3.3 below), any other substantive fault (a “Substantive
New Fault") which arises in the live environment prior to CSR Acceptarice and

Schedule A11.

3.3 The parties agree the following in relation to Substantive New Faults:-

3.3.1 no fault which was observed and categorised as a fault prior to the end of the
CSR Operational Trial Review Period shall be raised as a Substantive New Fault
thereafter unless, in the reasonable opinion of POCL, the nature of the fault
shall have changed or its effect, impact, seriousness or frequency shall have
become greater since the end of the CSR Operational Trial Period, in each case
so as to have, in the reasonable opinion of POCL, a material adverse effect on
POCL's business or operations;

3.3.2 no Substantive New Fault which is categorised as a category (b) fault shall
count towards the threshold in paragraph 2.2(ii) of Schedule A11;

3.3.3 notwithstanding paragraph 2.1(iv) of Schedule A11, the failure to agree a
timetable to resolve a ‘Substantive New Fault which is a category (b) fault
arising after 3 September_1999 shall not prevent CSR Acceptance; and

3.3.4 for the avoidance of doubt CSR Acceptance will not occur if there is a
Substantive New Fault which is categorised as-a category (a) fault.

If upon CSR Acceptance there remains any Substantive New Fault which is a category
{b) fault arising after 3° September, 1999 and in‘respect of which a timetable has not
been agreed for its resolution, the parties shall agree such a timetable by 15th
November, 1999, in default of which either party shail be entitled to request the Expert to
specify such a:timetable, which shall then be binding on both parties.

If by 17” September, 1999 there remains any Substantive New Fault which is a category
0) fadit.reportéd to the Contractor on or prior to 3 September, 1999 and in respect of
which 4 timatable has not been agreed for its resolution, POCL shail not withhold its
agreement to thé timetable proposed by the Contractor if the Expert shall have stated in
writing, prior to CSR Acceptance, that:-

3.5.1 the Contractor's proposed rectification plan is in the Expert's opinion likely to
resolve the Substantive New Fault by the date specified by the Contractor
therein; and

3.5.2 resolution of the Substantive New Fault by that date would, in the Expert's
opinion (having listened to the representations of both parties), be likely to mean
that the Substantive New Fault would not have a material adverse effect on
POCL's business or operations.

POCL warrants that none of its employees or contractors directly involved in the CSR
Acceptance process is aware of any fault in relation to the Core System which has not
already been reported to the Contractor and which that employee or contractor knows
would constitute a Substantive New Fault, categorised as-category (a) or category (b), if
and when'so reported
