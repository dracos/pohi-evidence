Gavin,

Can you please find out whether bugs in the Horizon system have ever been specifically discussed in any proceedings your firm has
run for Post Office Ltd. This would include the Agent Debt cases you handle.

Thanks, Rodric

Rod
It would be helpful if we can show that horizon bugs were discussed openly in our court cases.

We know that the falkirk bug was discussed in the Misra case, can you find out if there are any other examples where bugs have been
discussed in court.

I would appreciate if you treat this as a priority. We need the answer by 3pm Monday.

Simon
