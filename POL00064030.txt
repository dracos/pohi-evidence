Re: Mr J Kirk & Request for Authority for Disclosure of
Information

Dear Mr

On the 25 January 2007 I sent the associated letter and copies of Authority for
Disclosure of Information” forms to Miss Janet Skinner. To date I have not

received a response. Accordingly to assist my investigations would you please
ascertain if Miss Skinner is prepared to give me authority for such disclosure?

For information I no longer require disclosure in respect of Kensington
Mortgages Ltd, GE Money Motor Finances, Friends Provident or Welcome
Financial Services. However I still request authority in respect of the Halifax
PLC and any other financial institutions that Miss Skinner has a financial
relationship with.

I have associated with this letter 2 further copies of 1 partly completed
“Authority for Disclosure of Information” form, along with some blank forms.
If Miss Skinner agrees to give her authority I would ask that she complete
the two “Halifax plc “ forms and give details of any other accounts with other
financial institutions to which she is a signatory and complete two authorities
for disclosure forms in respect each financial institution (this is of course
with the exception of the 4 institutions mentioned in para 2). Could the 2
copies of each authority then be returned to me at the address below?

In view of the pressing nature of this matter would you please respond to me
within 7 days of receipt? If you have any queries please do not hesitate to
contact me on the number below.
