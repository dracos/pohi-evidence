IT Supplier Tiering

User Guidance CarninerEalhy

Sensitive

Purpose:
This pack aims to provide the necessary guidance for Contract and Vendor Managers to determine the
tiering of each Supplier.

Tiering determines the approach appropriate to each vendor (e.g. governance and reporting) based on

the supplier’s impact to the company, value of the relationship, risk and criticality of the services provided
etc.

Instructions:
1. Conduct a tiering review of your Supplier portfolio- see slide 4

2. Populate the tiering results spreadsheet with the outcome for each of your suppliers:
oluk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/POA001/itcomms/Vendor%20Management/Admin/Tiering/Tiering%20Results/March%202018?csf=1&e=V

iPYer
3. Once a year (at a minimum) the VMO will issue a reminder to revisit and adjust the tiering
accordingly. This tiering has been revised since its inception in 2018.

Please do not alter this pack. Contact VMO with any questions.

Instructions to determine Supplier Tiering

Commercially
Sensitive

* On the slide below, consider each column in turn and the relevance of the statement in relation to your supplier
* Determine a Score for the supplier from A (1 — 10)

* Highlight the box(es) applicable — please ensure only 1 boxis highlighted on the columns (vertical) boxes
* Total the number of highlighted boxes in each row (B)

* Multiply A X B to give you the score under column C

* Column D- Y/N, do the Contracted services have SLA’s that back off to a Client Contract that could impact POL with severe financial
penalties. If ¥, the VM/CM at their discretion can rate the outcome of that risk (1 low — 10 high) and if deemed relevant will impact on
the Tiering outcome i.e. add the score of D to column C. Just one score to add to column C

* Tiering will be determined Tier 1 = 56 - 70, Tier 2 = 36 - 55, Tier 3 = 16 - 35, Tier4=1-15

* N.BCustomer: definition is as per user of the service i.e. internalusers or end user e.g. Post Office customer. You should only have one highlighted in
each column hence the max score would be 60
* Impact on Business: Please consider reputation of Post Office should the Vendor’s service be adversely impacted for example
