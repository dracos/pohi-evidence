On 17 September you appointed me as Independent Advisor to this project with the terms of
feferance set out in Annex A anc a reporting date of 16 October. On 16 October I reported to
i you orally that we had been unal{e to reach agreement on a commercial basis for
proceeding. but that wa had mad 1 considerable progress on the development of a satisfactory
Implementation plan, and we dls :ussed what further steps If any might be now be
considered, in making that rapor. J used the charts attached as Annex B.

This report and Its attachments ¢ dd nothing of subsfance to what I tofd you on Friday, and fs
therofore designed primarily to ¢ st on record the results of my assignment.

The discussions which I held with the parties, and the information developed for
those discussions, were all without prejudice and confidential, and should therefore
only be used with the cons int of all the parties, as should the infarmatian in,this
report

‘THE PATH OF THE DISCUSSIONS - COMMERCIAL

Annex 6 chart 2 provides a g aphical overview of what fappened fn numeric tems. The right
hand number (-2310M) repre ients the NPV of ICL's cash flows over the life of the project
with fulure cash flows discoui.ted back fo October 1998 values at a discount rate of 6.6% .
(6% real plus 2.5% Inflation). Of thls number £232M has bean expended to date. All numbers
on this chart exciude amount to be set aside to a contingency fund. The core case Impact
on [CL was developed by ICL and KPMG (acting for me) on the basis of assumptions agreed
with ail three parties but whic 1 ICL consistently maintained were averly pessimistic as
regards (1) POCL volumes and (ii) a schedule of migration to ACT (20%:40%:40% of the
remaining accounts transfert 1g over the last three years of the contract} that was both
‘sooner and faster than they 113d been planning on. It did not appear to me that that there had

been sufficient (or perhaps at y) real discussion of this key place of information between BA
and ICL. ©

Little work has been done thus far on the effect of commercial sensitivities around the core
case beyond project continge icles. If a deal were to ba done, part of the due diligence

exercise mentioned below weuld be to test the solution for robustness agelnst a range of .
commercial sensitivitles,

On 6 October, very soan afte the care case had been agreed, the public sector bodies
offered contract extensions o° 2 and 4 years for BA and POCL respectively; POCL also
offered to consider picking ug the hardware costs of the refresh that any extension would
make necessary and to exten i payments to ICL over the contract term (now 2009) to cover
banking transactions. (CL anc KPMG evaluated this offer as reducing the NPV deficit from
~£310M to -£242M.

ICL stood by its opening stant 6 of requiring a modest positive ratum® over the whole life of
the project, notwithstanding +t ectearstatementto the vamtrary in your letter of 15 September
to Mr Todd. This would appecr to require a positive NPV of at least £30-60M before

“. contingency, which ts tho left har d side of the chart, ICL did however make.a number of 26
useful suggestions for reducing ¢r sharing tisk.

l emphasised to ICL that accept nca of their objective would bo tantamount to accepting that
the public sector bodles had bea 1 lagely or wholly responsible forthe cost averuns and.
delays and that this was simply 1ot a conceivable proposition within the constraints of the
exercise on which we were enga 3ad and which would not be seeking 10 concem Hself at all
with the right and wrongs of the daims and counterclaims being made by the parties.

By Friday 9 October It was clear that the parties warp stuck despite some progress on BA
termination rights reloase date end on funding fssucs. I was concemed that neither (CL nor
POCL ware taking a sufficiently realistic view, In ICL’s case, of the reat consequences of the
project terminating, and in POG -'s case, of the scale of the commercial opportunities
available ta thom if, but probabls only Jf, the project wentahead. (Indeed I suspect that one
of POCL's problems has besn 1ire lack of a robust business plan to fet them make
Judgements about thelr longer tam future and the sort of investments that they should be
prepared to consider to bring it. 1bout - this Is only now evolving) S

{was also reasonably sure that here was a potential solution which aught to be acceptable to
all parties. Accordingly I undert:.ok to develop my awn view as to what such a solution might
look like and this was delivered to the parilas first thing on Monday 12 October.

My proposal ts set aut (a Annex: C. It sought to provide to ICL a modest (2% IRR) retum on
Its future cash flows after contlr gencles {to which Intra group profits should also be

contributed), I estimate that this equates to a pre-contingency NPV over the life of the project
Of -£154M.

However, during the weekend shan my proposal was being put together a number of late
madelling changes were comin} through from ICL, the most Important of which Is referred to
In the ‘Comments’ column for I3m 1,1 of the schedule to my proposal. These adjustments
wore subsequently shown to be valid and the actual effect of my proposal was therefore to
raduce the NPV to only -£203t.. Although for the reasons explained below this difference has
fever come back onto the tabl:- for discussion, I have shown In the addendum to Annex C an
example of how this could havi: bean corrected - largely by applying lower price deflators -
had a further concession been hought appropriate.

On Tuesday 13 October both EA and POCL said they would be prepared to seek to put
\ogether a deal on the Ines coi Aained in my proposal, but ICL's position was essentially

Later that day POCL agrecd wil the PO board a Proposal whereby POCL would offér to buy

” beena continuing concem for Ii. I was Informed af this canfidantially first thing on
Wednesday moming, 14 Octobi r and counselled that it should nat be put to ICL unless and
until {CL were prepared formally to abandon thelr insistence on a positive retum/braakeven
‘aver the life of the project. This advice was taken and [CL ware merely advised by Mr
Sweetman that POCL did have 1 further proposal to make but would only do so following
ICL’s agreement to abandon the ¢ previous stance. ICL. again remained unmoved, so this
further suggestion has not been out to them, nor for the same reason has my own addendum
to my proposal. I would In any e"ent seriously doubt that both of these Proposals should have
been made, so the summary chi rt shows the £120M reducing the previous -£203M NPV to
-£83M. It should also be noted tl at the mechanics of the POCL offer had stilt to bo worked

out and there may ultimately hat e been some countervailing reduction in (ater payments to

FUNDING

Loan facilities of £200M have be 1n exhausted and additlonal finance of over £300M would
be needed to complete the proje:4 were no changes to be made to the contract

ICL have taken the stance that It paront company Fujitsu is not prapared to play any further
‘part In supporting ICL or Pathway In refinancing current losses or in ‘financing the contract
going forward, and that therefore slither the public sactor bodies have to make the Project
financeabie on a non-recourse bs sis-or provide finance thomselves. Ihave equally .
consistently insisted that this Is at unrealistic position to adopt and that any solutlon that *
Seeks to place the burden of own: ship on the public sector bodies is totally untenable,
Annex B chart 7 refers). The pub {o sector bodies had agreed to explore a number of
relatively minor steps that might f elp to make the project more financeable.

Valso believe that In insisting on a solution Involving no write off In (CL’s or Pathways
accounts, ICL seem to be excass! rely concamed about the Implications of these accounting
tatters upon their relationship wit Fujitsu and on thelr plans for the flotation of {CL, while at
the same time taking a surprisingl; relaxed view of the Implications of contract termination
and litigation on both. If there fs to be any further discussion of ways forward it will be
necessary to have direct discussia with Fujitsu to understand better the Pressures which ICL
may be under,

THE WAY FORWARD

Ihave formed the strong view dur ig the last month that the continuation of the Project is
likely be of Teal benefit from a nur ber of angles - Post Office customers; POCL, bothasa
business and as a social service, ad all those dependent an it; {CL's reputation and future;
and that of Its employees and sub- :ontractors. I also believe that tho proposals made during
the last month, particularly f the flr al POCL offer were to bo extended in whole or In part,
Should provide enough of a positivi: incentive to {CL to proceed with the project as compared
with the consequences to them of is fallure. However confident ICL may claim to be as to
the strength of their contractual cas, I belleve they are significantly underestimating the
time, the cost and the uncertainty cf litigation on this scale and of its consequences for their
business. plans, \ ant aware however that these and other scenarios are the subject of
separate enquiries,

If there were to be a solution on the lines of my proposal, I would draw attention to items 8, 9
and 10 of the schedule to Annex C, (cunning sores’ list, past Claims and due diligence) all of
which will be crucial. I would alsa u ge that as soon ss 8A can be satisffed that it has a

ADDENDUM TO THE INDEPENDENT ADVISER’S PROPOSAL

As indicated in the comments to 1.1 above there was a late and unexplained difference of £72M inthe fflects of the extension of the contract term. This
difference has pow been pxplained jo my satisfaction and it accordingly becomes appropriate to seek ways of further adjusting the terms of the Proposal to
relnstate my ofiginal intention of a 2% IRR for ICL. for the remaining life of the contract. The table below reproduces the first part of the schedule to the
Proposal with amendments to achieve thjs; the pringipal new proposal being the inffodugtion of a further relaxation of the Price deffators built inte the

contracts (2.3). Given ICL’s continuing insistence on achfeving a break-even over the life af the project, this revised proposal has NOT been communicated .

tothe parties, and Is appended hera solely to indicate that there are ways In which the original alm could still be delivered. All changes fo the Proposal as

Proposed way Forward for the BA/POCL Programme

Lo Introduction

Due to.the way in which the contract has been handled by the sponsors, especially the
Bencfits Agency, ICL is fazed with ever increasing costs, declining volume in full
* pperation, no certainty abcut when full operation will begin and the consequent
impossibility of financing tho. completion of the programme without a thorough
+ restructuring of the originil contract. It is completely inconsistent with the RFT
concept to argue, as Grahanr Corbett has done, that ICL should write off ‘its past costs
and look only to the future Under PFI the contractor's expenditure on the design,
build and finance phases should be remuncrated during the operational phase. In the
- discussions with Graham C‘orbett, ICL has put forward a number of proposals for
solving the problems. This. saper sets out the ICL position. :
In parallel with the HM Tre ssury review, ICL has engaged in confidential discussions
with the Post Office to explure proposals in which tho Post Office would take 2 50%
(less one share ) equity fale in ICL Pathway. Athough such a proposal has merits in
its own right, it could als provide the.key to making possible the wiext stage of
funding for the programme provided that an acceptable commercial deal can be
agreed. The essential points for the equity proposal are described in the attached note
by Sir Michael Butler dated 9 October. :

2. Proposal Objectives

ICL believes any settlemen: naust provide « fair way forward for all partics, and must
provide ICL Pathway with a fair chance to at least break-even over the contract. The
committed funding by ICL to date stands at some £250m, with the expectation that &
further £250m of funds vill. be needed to complete the programms. ‘Whereas

- originally it would have techn reasonable to expect to put non-recourse funding in
place after full acceptanca in July 1997, we are still a very long way from reaching 8
position where this woull be possible, In all the circumstances, ICL dacs not
consider it reasonable to try to make a distinction between the past and the future, as ~
Graham Corbett has sough .to do.

3. Components of th : Solution

In addition to the equity p:oposition there are four key components for an acceptable
solution; contract term, contingency artangements for known and future tisks,
achievement of contractui] acceptance, and appropriate pricing arrangements. Each

component has elements of flexibility, which taken together can provide an acceptable
resolution for ICL Pathwa . This paper desoribes one such combination.

4. Contract Term

The ‘sponsors have indicatd that they may be prepared to consider a contract
extension with ICL Pathway to end March 2007 for BA and to end: March 2009 for
. POCL, BA state that they wuld migrate all non- ACT benefit payments to full ACT
by the end of their contract, on a 20%, 40%, 40% basis, starting in fiscal year 2004/5.
This amounts to maintainig the period of full operation in which ICL receives
revenues at five years but de ivers a sharp decline in volumes within that period.

POCL’s offer to extend the ¢ ontract to 2009 is much more helpful, especially ifPOCL
and ICL Pathway form:a dys amic partnership to open up now streams of revenue.

Furthermore POCL have indicated that they may be prepared to fund the essential
equipment upgrades and rep acements required in the post office network in 2006,

5. Contingencies for snown and fature risks

_ Discussions between the prties have highlighted and helped define the outstanding
differences on the imple:aentation plan and its detailed timetable ‘for project
completion. The major arca: requiring contingency arrangements are:

- pro;ramme risks leading to delay

-con ractual acceptance including process and sign off
-BA and POCL business volumes

- fraud risk

~ service level agreement penalties

» programme costs

Although the above contingencics are being further refined between the parties ICL
Pathway has included a ccntingency of £100m (£60m in NPV terms) in its business
case to cover the likely cufcome-on these risks, This figure could double if the
acceptance issue referred t below is not resolved.

We recognize, however, ‘hat all parties share a mutual interest in mitigating and a
preventing such risks mi terializing. ICL. Pathway has offered the sponsors the
principles of an incentive ) lan whereby if specified contingencies can be, avoided, the
associated cost savings cait-be shared on a 50/50 basis. This would offer the sponsors

the prospect of cost reductions, and ICL, Pathway the opportunity for a modest return

on its investment in the programme. The main intent, however, is to incentivise all

parties to work together t effect a prompt delivery of the benefits arising from the
programme. This has not+ orked well in the past.

6. Contractual accept! ace

The speed of the acceptance process has been highlighted as probably the most critical
programme risk. Given our experience since 1996, any revised programme must give
us assurance that the contract will not be terminated at somo date in the second half of
1999 ona relatively minor tuchnical point.

ICL proposes that programnic acceptance must be managed in a staged approach, with
cach stage having its own. self contained, acceptance arrangements. Deferred, or
conditional acceptance, with teomination rights preserved for Ister stages is
unreasonable, ‘

‘We recommend that accept nce of the first stage scheduled to go forward for national
roll-out in July 1999 is batdled as part of tho HM Tréasury review process and is
completed by the end of De sember 1998,

The BA components of this first stago, covering use of the Paymont Card for Child
Benefit, and the Order Bos k- Control Service have beon subjected to extensive joint
testing and have had oper itional exposure im over 200 post offices for very many
months and are known to v ork well for staff and customers alike. ‘There'is no reason
to delay acceptance.

The sooner full-acceptance js achieved the better since non-recoursé funding depends
on it,

7. Pricing Arrangem ents

Given the BA’s desire to get away from the usc of the Payment Card as soon as
possible, and the need for prices to bear some of the burden of the increased costs.
ICL have proposed that th contracted prices set in May-1996 should rise in line with
inflation throughout the ¢ »tract period. This effectively offers the sponsors a fixed
price contract in real term:. .

It would be possible to co sstruct a payment mechanism for BA based upon an annual
fee structure, agreed in ad rance, and based upon BA's best view of volumes aud their
ACT migration plan, This would provide some flexibility to the BA in the speed and
choice of benefits to mign te to the Payment Card, prior to the final migration to ACT.
It would also provide ICL Pathway with a predictable revenue stream.

We see the arrangements ‘or POCL continuing as at present with the only key change
being that the banking volumes are underwritten at 90% of best forecast volumes,
‘This reflects the fact thet achievement of such business rests exclusively with the
business drive within POICL.

So far Graham Corbett aid the sponsors have based their positions on ICL’s
acceptance of writing off its past expenditure as a loss. Moreavaer, given the risks, the
: prospects of profits in the fiture appear dim. This is unacceptable in principle for a
PEL contract and it would make it impossible to secure the financing necessary to

ICL PATHWAY Dose

“# ICL have no wish to.cut aiross Graham Corbett's efforte to Promate a solution
to the problenis-in the ,BA/POCL programmes. We will therefore concentrate
exclusively on the ICL pn posal for the Post Office to take an cquity stake in
ICL Pathway. Though it could provide the key to unlock the programmo’s
problems, the proposal has merits in its own sight. *

e ICL is not aware of the Secretary of State’s thinking on the future of the Post
Office. But whatever'the sutcome of his review, it seems to us that the Post
Office and Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL) in particular, will need to be
enabled to operate as a nodem, entrepreneurial, commercial business if-its
Jong-term future is to-be as ured.

© Because the ICL Pathway system has been designed with Smart Cards in mind,
it can be developed to setve the Government’s needs for more user-friendly
and cost-cffective dealing with the citizen.. If the Post Office has a major
equity stake in ICL Pathwiy, it will be better placed to help in this process as
well as being able to incnase its eamings, assuring the future of tho POCL
countrywide network, .

« POCL needs a world-class (T system for many of its operations. ICL Pathway
could help to re-enginecr i s business processes to make it more competitive.
ICL would be ready to centribute its own skills in this field, into the joint
venture. ? s

© POCL and ICL working tigether would make a powerful team which could
exploit other new commercial opportunities, including retail banking and
export initiatives for postal systems.

* JCL believes that during the duration of the contract (as agreed in the current
negotiations) the present 12L Pathway management should remain in place.
But ICL would hope that the Post Office would but 50% (less one) of the
shares; and would, of cour!e, welcome Post Office representation on its board;
and would be open to proposals for changes in management structure or
ownership thereafter.

© ICL wishes to take it as an assumption that the present negotiations will ™
succeed, But it needs to pcint out that the consequences of failure would leave
POCL very exposed, Witho 1f a modern IT infrastructure.
