HEALTH & SAFETY REPORT

The Board noted the report and asked for benchmarking statistics
and commentary to be included in future reports. The Chairman
asked that we ensure the benchmarking is relevant. Paula Vennells
assured the Board that it was robust with supply chain using the
Cash in Transit industry benchmark;

the Board asked for more details at the next meeting.

STATUS REPORT — ACTION UPDATE

POL11/9(b) — Irish Government guarantee

Paula Vennells updated the Board that there appeared to have
been no loss of confidence following the change in the Irish
Government guarantee. Existing customers had been sent a letter
over a year ago when the changes were known and new customers
had different terms and conditions highlighted when they purchased
the products;

the Chairman asked if there was any evidence of customers
reducing their balances to below the new threshold;

POLB11/13(e)

Les Owen clarified that he had been available for interviewing
Financial Services Director applicants — but had withdrawn from the
interviews because of personal knowledge of one of the candidates;

the Board was notified that Nick Kennett has been appointed and
will start on 17 July 2011. The Chairman invited Nick Kennett to the
next Board meeting to give an overview of his first impressions of
the Financial Services Business;

POLB11/16(b)
the Board noted the Travel Money Card paper and Martin Moran
explained that the new Travel Money Card could be used to replace
existing products such as the Postal Order as part of a wider pre-
paid card strategy. The new card was chip and pin enabled and
this was why the new card was not provided by the Bank of Ireland
as they did not have the appetite to invest in the new technology.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S UPDATE

Paula Vennells advised the Board that Supply Chain negotiations
were ongoing. The business had written to colleagues to advise

them of the offer and had set up processes to get their feedback.
The CWU may undertake a “consultative” ballot;

Matthew Lester asked for a matrix of all the pay negotiations across

the Group to be pulled together. Jon Millidge agreed to ask Peter
Walls to undertake the exercise in time for the September Board.

The Chairman agreed that this would be helpful to look at the risk of
arbitrage;

Paula Vennells confirmed that Chris Day would be joining the
Business as CFO on 1 August. The Chairman asked that he be
formally appointed to the Board at the meeting if the FSA point was
covered (POLB11/24(c);

the new Director of Insurance for POFS — Rob Clark, would be
invited to present a report on insurance at the October Board;

Les Owen queried the reporting structure asking if Rob Clark should
report to the Financial Services Director of POL. Paula Vennells
explained that the future structure was part of the negotiations
which were ongoing;

Consumer Credit Licence:

Technology: Paula Vennells confirmed that the new POL IT Audit &
Control Board would pick up all the issues and actions from the
SAS70 audit and that Ernst & Young were not sitting on the Board.
Matthew Lester asked if the Audit picked up other systems as well
as Horizon. Paula Vennells explained that when the issue came to
the last POL Board and the RM ARC it referenced other Group
systems as well as Horizon. Jon Millidge to ensure Alex Smith is
aware;

Matthew Lester asked that they also pick up the Separation issues
for technology. Les Owen emphasised that the advantage of
asking Fujitsu to comply with SAS70 audits meant that we could
rely on those reports. The Board discussed the best way to engage
with Fujitsu. Paula Vennells explained that she was meeting them
and would raise the issue;

a detailed technology paper to cover these issues to be presented
at the next POL Board meeting;

Network Development: the Board was advised that the Pilots were
progressing although there were some issues with the NFSP who
were unhappy with the transition agreements and compensation
being offered. Paula Vennells suggested that the Board is updated
on the Network Transformation programme at the next meeting;

(I) the launch of “The Post Office Story” has already produced some
good feedback. There could be a problem with measuring the
effect on colleague engagement and satisfaction as the new Group
baseline is not due until September, and the POL programme will
have been running for 6 months by then. The Chairman suggested
Paula Vennells discuss the issue with RM CEO to try to find a more
effective solution, as this needs to feed into objectives;

(m) NS&l Update: Martin Moran confirmed that NS&I are withdrawing all
products except Premium Bonds from POL. (Premium Bonds
account for 80% of sales.)

had arisen to date.

POLB11/32 STATE AID

monthly meetings might be necessary from September this year
moving to seven per year from April 2012;

ANY OTHER BUSINESS

The ATM paper was noted. The improved terms were welcomed by
the Board, although the paper would have benefitted from
competitor/market benchmarking. Martin Moran to supply;

the Chairman questioned whether POL was robust enough in
challenging its contracts. Paula Vennells acknowledged that

analysis and benchmarking;

the next Board Meeting to be advised — first two weeks in
