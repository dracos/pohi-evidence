Management Summary

Background / History

Initial Go Live (IGL) of the Pathway benefit payment system commenced
23/9/96 at the Leonard Stanley Post Office near Stroud and was extended to
nine other offices in the Stroud area from 21/10/96. These installations were
subject to a degree of special attention which precluded carrying out a
standard Delivered Quality Audit at the time of implementation. Whilst
recognising that the implementation at these offices may not be
representative of what may be expected during the roll out stage, it was
considered important to make a formal attempt to capture issues and learning
points from the IGL implementation, utilising Delivered Quality Audit
methodology. Five of the IGL offices, including Leonard Stanley, were visited
on 29/11/96 for this purpose.

Audit Purpose

To inspect the installations and interview Post Office staff, noting issues and
opportunities to improve Pathway products and services arising from the
implementation activities of Pathway and our sub-contractors and from early
early operating experiences using the Pathway system.

Summary of Findings
Five problems known to the Help Desk had been experienced at several
locations:
PUN Bar Code would not read; keyed in successfully
Replacement PUN would not activate card
Historical payments not associated with new card
Receipt shows Help Desk No as 181 - 1234567
Postmaster’s weekly report prints out wrong week number.
A range of other opportunities to improve the system were noted including:

To ensure that site surveys identify where an improved electrical earth
is required so that installation plans allow sufficient time and resource.

To ensure that site survey and installation teams are fully aware of the
overall sizes of equipment, including wiring.

Extension of the range of on screen options offered as Proof of Identity
to speed transactions and possible extension of the range of
acceptable inputs.

Revision of the Manual and other reference materials to correct errors
and omissions.

Modification to beneficiary documentation to ensure Proof of Identity is

available for card collection and Casual Agents have available the
Beneficiary’s card to enable collection of benefit.

1.4 Key Customer Comments

The main areas for improvement suggested by Postmasters were:

Batching of card deliveries.
Review of the cost / benefit of Registered / Recorded delivery of cards.
A “parking” clip for the bar code reader.

A holder for receipt forms.

Selection of a printer with smaller footprint.

Duplicate prints of the weekly report.

Clarification of the first payment date for beneficiaries who collect on a
4 week cycle.

Improvement of the Postmaster’s weekly report.

2 Action Summary
Actionees identified against the Audit findings detailed in section 3.3, are
responsible for definition and implementation of an appropriate improvement
plan.
Where the Customer Comments in section 3.4 suggest an improvement the
Pathway nominee is responsible for determining the feasibility of
implementing the suggestion and definition of an action plan, where
appropriate.

Implementation activities all took place
on time and as expected.

BT installation was acceptable ; the box
was moved subsequently by WTL.

The WTL installation engineer was

“ outstandingly helpful.”

EXEL arrived on time, did a good job
and cleaned up, taking the packaging
away with them.

which is a busy day. Basic training

said and the on screen information
(details not recalled). Trainees were
asked to complete an assessment form
and return it to the trainer, who was to
provide ongoing support. In the event
the feedback was generally positive but

the trainees felt that future trainees would

feel less inhibited, if they had to make
negative comments, if the forms could
be returned confidentially to a central
location

The equipment has all been reliable and
looks good.

Cards arrive on time, batches are correct
condition good.

Cards are delivered in small batches

(1 - 2) using different services:
Registered Mail (£3 + 1st Class Post)
Recorded Delivery (£0.60 + 1st Class
Post) Sometimes two deliveries are
received in a day, each involving a
small number of cards. Concern was
expressed at two levels:

- the expense to Pathway of using
Registered Mail, especially since the
cards are arriving 3-4 weeks before
expiry of the previous Benefit Book.

- the expense to the Postmaster of
phone confirmation of card receipt:

the Post Office makes an allowance for
phone calls but it was claimed to be
insufficient to cover all PO related costs.
PUNs appear to be arriving in good time,
3-4 weeks before the preceding benefit
counterfoils are exhausted, which may

The Postmaster’s end of week report JD
would be improved by breaking the list

of transactions into blocks of 5, by

printing the total number of transactions

at the bottom of the list and by printing

the Report in duplicate.

Contact with Sorbus has been satisfactory:
1 contact only when PUN bar code would
not read (see A3).

CMS / PAS Help Desk is very good. (This
from someone trained in Customer Care

by a Building Society and by the Girl Guide
movement.) Responses are generally quick
and accurate.

Current keyboard is fine: Lift keyboard is SH
expected to be less convenient, being
larger, in the confined counter space.

(A clip to hold the current magnetic stripe
reader would be preferable.)

A “parking” clip for the bar code reader SH /RMcD
would be helpful. (Question asked

whether the reader had to flash all the

time. I explained the difference of the

Welch Alleyn unit.)

The printer is considered too big for the DC / SH

with a vertical orientation, similar to the

lottery terminal, to reduce the footprint.

A card wallet has been provided (by AC
POCL?) with 2 spaces for cards. In the

Stroud area 8 cards are in common use at

POs, can a holder be made available (for

sale to customers?) (gas pay, gas token,
electricity pay, electricity token, council

tax, council rent, water and benefits).

The PUN makes no reference to which JW
benefit the card applies to. One

customer attempted to collect a card

when an income support book expired.

There was a period of confusion before

it was established which benefit

the customer was seeking. Amended

wording of the PUN would be helpful,

meanwhile CMS help desk procedures

should confirm which benefit the

customer is seeking.

End of day processing includes an JD
apparently redundant step. The steps
are:

Touch Tick symbol

Confirm?

Touching Tick symbol merely

returns user to main menu, but

there is no alternative option,

so why not return automatically

to the menu.

Customers who receive benefit on a 4
week cycle have nothing to remind them
when the first payment is due. Once a
payment has been made, the receipt
gives the next due date, but before

this they visit the PO each week, being
told there is no payment due instead
of coming in 4 weeks after the last
counterfoil in the preceding book.

The suggestion that card activation
could trigger a nil receipt with a next
payment due date is unlikely to be
feasible. Possibly the PUN should
remind customers to make note of the
date on the last counterfoil and work
forward 4 weeks.

Cards arriving in penny numbers

(see CA8).

Peritas very good (previous experience
with Camelot).

No problems with EXEL.

Postmaster questioned whether
additional terminal(s) would be available
in future. I advised yes, 1 per counter
position.

Different installers brought the training
equipment and the live system:
concern expressed about continuity.
(Not an issue for roll out.)

Cards are arriving well before they are
required: change of name during the
period leaves customer collecting a
card in their old name. (Ms Christmas

Loss of PUN and possible change of
address are causes for concern if cards
arrive well before benefit books expire.
Training took place, as arranged, on a
Monday which made it difficult as a

result of constant interruptions; Monday
is a busy day.

No space for a signature on a Nil Receipt.
(There is no declaration to sign so no
requirement for a signature.)

Cards delivered in small batches (see CA8).
Postmaster’s weekly report could be
improved (see CA10).

A smaller printer would be helpful

(see A2, CA15).

WTL cleaned up “fairly well”

As a new computer-user the training was
good and took place on a good day,
Friday. The manual is OK as a reminder
if you have already done a task in training.
Questioned whether an alternative
method to record card receipt could

be arranged instead of the phone

calls. Explained the future approach.
Concern at the expense of card
distribution (see CA8) especially since
books are distributed by normal post.
Weekly report could be improved

(see CA10).

No problems with BT.

WTL excellent.

excellent support when dealing with an
alternative payee.

Card swipe unit replaced following read
failures: handled well.

Irritated by having to phone in for small
number of cards in each delivery, with
possibly 2 deliveries per day, Registered
/ Recorded, (see CA8). Suggested
sending cards out batched weekly or
fortnightly since users have books to use
up.

Customers who collect benefit on a 4
week cycle have difficulty keeping track
of when 1st card payment is due

(see CA21).

Leonard Stanley do not use the Total DG
Transactions information from the
Postmaster’s weekly report for reporting
purposes. They count the total number
of receipts and report this instead. This
is at variance with practice at the other
offices and will have the effect of
understating their count by the number
of outstanding payments encashed in a
single transaction. Which approach is
correct depends whether the information
is used for: Pathway reporting or POCL
reporting.

Postmaster wants more customers on the

system asap for simplicity.
