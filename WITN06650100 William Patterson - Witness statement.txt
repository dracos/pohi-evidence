Dated: 28 September 2022

POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST CORPORATE STATEMENT OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED

I], MR. WILLIAM PAUL PATTERSON (known as Paul Patterson), will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | ama director of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) and am duly authorised to
make this statement on its behalf. | am personally committed to doing everything
possible to support the Inquiry’s process. The Human Impact phase of the Inquiry
reinforced the devastating impact on postmasters lives and that of their families.
lam truly sorry and, on behalf of Fujitsu, wish to apologise to the postmasters for
our role in this. As a company, we are fully committed to the Inquiry process, to
understand what went wrong, and to learn from it.

2. | make this statement in response to the Inquiry’s Rule 9 Request for a corporate
statement addressing issues relevant to Phases 2 and 3 of the Inquiry (the
“Request”). This Request was dated 17 August 2022 and required a response
by Friday 16 September 2022. | am informed by Morrison Foerster, the
Recognised Legal Representative for Fujitsu in the Inquiry, that an extension to
this deadline has been agreed for the response to the issues relevant to Phase

3 to 14 October 2022. Accordingly, this statement deals only with the issues

Page 1 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

relevant to Phase 2, namely Questions 1 - 43 as set out in Appendix 1 to the
Request.

The Chair has asked for a ‘Corporate Statement’, that is a statement usually
given by an individual of sufficient seniority within a relevant body to encapsulate
a wider range of information than the individual's personal recollections and
which exhibits or refers to a range of relevant contemporaneous documents.

| do not have first-hand knowledge of many of the matters which are set out in
this statement given the period which it covers. As such | explain at the outset
how the information in this statement has been compiled. For the purposes of
preparing the responses | have been assisted by a team of individuals within
Fujitsu and Morrison Foerster. This is due to the vast amount of documentation
and sources of evidence which have had to be reviewed for a time period
stretching over 25 years. This team has provided to me the documents which are
referenced in this statement and exhibited at FSL_03/1 to FSL_03/144, and
which are the principal source of my knowledge of its contents.

In general, responses to questions are drawn from documentary sources. These
documents have been exhibited and/or referenced in accordance with the
Inquiry’s Protocol on Witness Statements.

Inevitably, a detailed request of this nature in the context of a factual background
which covers such a large period of time and involves so many technical details,
voluminous documentary material, and a large number of individuals (many of
whom are no longer at Fujitsu) presents challenges. | do not myself have detailed
technical knowledge of the Horizon System and am very much reliant upon

Fujitsu staff with the relevant technical expertise.

THE HORIZON SYSTEM
7. The term “Horizon” is often used to collectively describe the IT systems provided
by Fujitsu (and its various predecessor entities) to Post Office Limited (“POL”)
(and Post Office Counters Limited (“POCL”), as it was previously known).
Technology has, however, evolved significantly during that time and, accordingly,
the system and associated services have also changed and evolved to reflect
changing business requirements. The various phases of the Horizon System,
including its genesis in the “Pathway Programme” are set out below.
Pathway Programme
8. In 1996, Pathway Group Limited’ (“Pathway Group”) was awarded a tripartite
agreement with the Department of Health and Social Security (the “DSS”) and
POCL to provide a solution (internally within the Pathway Group known as the
“Pathway Programme’) envisaged to:
a. “Bring automation to all 38,000 counter positions of the 19,300 Post
Offices currently in the network’; and
b. transform Benefit Payments from a paper based to a card based
service by providing “magnetic strip cards to 19 million benefit
customers in order that they may collect their payments.” (FSL_03/1).
9. The development of the Pathway Programme proved significantly more complex
than the contracting parties had anticipated. There followed a period of extensive
negotiations between the contracting parties. However, the DSS determined that

it no longer wished to proceed with the Pathway solution and, in May 1999, the

1 The relationship between Pathway Group Limited and Fujitsu is described in more detail in paragraphs
below.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

DSS and ICL Pathway Limited (as Pathway Group was then known, “ICL

Pathway”) entered into an agreement terminating the tripartite arrangement.

10. The departure of the DSS reflected a fundamental change to the Pathway
Programme. One of the core functional specifications of the system which ICL
Pathway was contracted to provide — an automated system for the payment of
benefits — was no longer part of the project. Rather than abandon the project
completely, a decision was taken to complete the computerisation of the Post
Office branch network, preserving that aspect of the original Pathway
Programme. That system became known as the “Horizon System” or
“Horizon”.

11. The Horizon System has changed over time in response to changing POCL /
POL requirements. However, there have been three broad ‘phases’ of Horizon:

a. ‘Legacy Horizon’;
b. | HNG-X or ‘Horizon Online’; and
c. | HNG-A or ‘Horizon Anywhere’.

Legacy Horizon

12. “Legacy Horizon” was the original iteration of the Horizon System, in operation
between 1999 and 2010.

13. Legacy Horizon used Riposte software from Escher, a third-party specialist
provider to post offices in other countries, to replicate data between counters at

the branches and correspondence servers in the data centres.

14. Within the period 1999 to 2010, the Horizon System went through a number of

substantial changes.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

HNG-X or ‘Horizon Online’

15. HNG-X or ‘Horizon Online’ was rolled out to the majority of Post Office branches
by 31 August 2010. HNG-X was a replacement of the Legacy Horizon system.
The core technical change of HNG-X was the replacement of the Riposte system
with a system of direct transmission from the counter to the data centre.

HNG-A or ‘Horizon Anywhere’

16. HNG-A or ‘Horizon Anywhere’ was progressively rolled out to branches from
2016. The development of HNG-A was driven by the need to replace ageing
Windows NT4 branch counter technology with a Windows 10 operating system.

CONTRACTING PARTIES AND FINANCING

17. During the time that the Pathway Programme and the Horizon System has been
in place, a number of changes have been made to the various contracting
entities. Set out below by way of background is a description of these changes
and the relationship of the various entities to Fujitsu and its parent group.

Corporate Structure

18. ICL Pathway was first incorporated on 19 January 1995 under the name
Maidhaven Limited. On 5 April 1995, Maidhaven Limited changed its name to
Pathway Group Limited and, on 15 June 1995, a Special Resolution was passed
to allot shares as follows to:

a. International Computers Limited (“ICL”) (47 shares?);
b. — Girobank PLC (“Girobank’) (36 shares); and

c. DeLa Rue PLC (“De La Rue”): (15 shares)

2 By 31 January 1996, this had been increased to 49 shares.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

On 29 May 1996, Pathway Group changed its name to ICL Pathway and, in
September 1996, the share capital of ICL Pathway was increased by 20,000,000
ordinary shares of £1, all of which were allotted to ICL. By 25 February 1997,
the remaining shares held by Girobank and De La Rue were transferred to ICL,
at which time ICL’s shareholding stood at 20,000,100 shares.

As shown in the annual return dated 7 February 2000, in August 1999, ICL
Pathway’s share capital increased again to 151,700,100 ordinary shares of £1
(an increase of 130,700,000). On 27 March 2002, ICL Pathway then changed its
name to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited.

During this time the sole shareholder of ICL was ICL PLC. This entity was
majority owned, ultimately, by Fujitsu Limited (the exact corporate structure can
be provided to the Inquiry separately if required), and ICL PLC became a wholly
owned subsidiary of Fujitsu on 30 September 1998. The names of ICL and ICL
PLC were changed on 2 April 2002 to Fujitsu Services Limited and Fujitsu
Services Holdings PLC, respectively, when the relevant ICL entities rebranded
as “Fujitsu”. The contract for the Horizon System was then novated from Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited to Fujitsu Services Limited on or around 1 April 2003,
as it remains to the present day.

Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited was dissolved on 3 January 2013. Fujitsu
remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu Services Holdings PLC
Separately, Post Office Counters Limited changed its name to Post Office

Limited on 1 October 2001.

Financing

24. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain how Fujitsu financed the cost of
developing new software for the Horizon System prior to the national roll out.

25. The Pathway Programme was based on a Private Finance Initiative (“PFI”)
structure, with the cost of designing and developing the contract solution to be
financed by the service providers. Project financing through a variety of banks
was obtained in addition to a variety of service provider working capital
arrangements.

26. ICL Pathway Asset Company Limited was established as a fully owned
subsidiary of ICL Pathway to act as a special purpose vehicle for funding
(FSL_03/2).

27. In addition to the financial arrangements explained above, Fujitsu draws the
Inquiry’s attention to the provision of a capital injection by Fujitsu Limited into ICL
PLC to restore its consolidated net worth in accordance with banking covenants
ICL PLC held at that time. The capital injection was effected by the issue of
263,400,000 new ordinary shares in June 1999. Fujitsu Limited paid
£131,700,000 for these shares.

28. The financing arrangements were altered when ICL Pathway entered into the
agreement with POCL dated 28 July 1999, with the removal of the PFI structure.

OVERVIEW OF ICL PATHWAY’S BID FOR THE HORIZON PROJECT

29. Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to provide an overview of ICL Pathway’s
bid for the Pathway Programme and to answer certain questions about that
process.

30. The opportunity to tender for the opportunity to deliver what later became known

as Horizon was advertised on or about 30 August 1994 by a notice published in

Page 7 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

the Official Journal of the European Communities (the “OJEC Notice”)
(FSL_03/3).

31. The OJEC Notice was placed on behalf of what were then known as:

a. the DSS (which was also commonly referred to as the Benefits
Agency ((the “BA”)) in documents referred to in this statement); and
b. POCL.

32. The contractual opportunity was broadly described as the computerisation of
post office counter services including the support of authorisation, payment and
accounting for the DSS and other Government departments.

33. ICL expressed its interest to tender and submitted to DSS and POCL (the
“Contracting Authorities”) a statement of capability and interest on or about
23 September 1994 (the “Statement of Capability and Interest”) (FSL_03/4).

34. The Statement of Capability and Interest was expressed to be from ICL and a
“consortium” of partners comprised of:

a. De La Rue Group (said to be the Uk’s leading provider of magnetic
card and associated technology at the time),

b. | Hambros (investment merchant bank experienced in PFl commercial
structuring),

c. An Post (the state owned provider of postal services in Ireland),

d. Escher Group (the supplier of the Riposte software solution), and

e. Girobank (a financial services company owned by Alliance and
Leicester at that time).

35. The Statement of Capability and Interest indicated that, for the computerisation
of post office branches, ICL had “chosen to work with the Irish Post Office, An

Post, and the software consultancy group Escher, to ensure that these

37.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

requirements can be met with an integrated solution specification designed for
this purpose”. This was because An Post had successfully automated its post
office counter business and had used software developed by Escher Group to
do so. This system had “put An Post's counters business in an ideal position to
develop the full potential of its retail sales ability and advance its customer
service standards”.

ICL and other prospective service providers which responded to this OJEC
Notice were provided with a prospectus entitled “Bringing Technology to Post
Offices and Benefit Payments” on or about 5 October 1994. They later received
on 19 October 1994 a Request for a Statement of Capability issued on or about
(the “POCL/BA Request for a Statement of Capability”) (FSL_03/5). The
purpose of the POCL/BA Request for a Statement of Capability was to provide
more information about the tender opportunity and to allow the BA and POCL to
shortlist potential prime contractors on the basis of their respective ‘Statements
of Capability’. Shortlisted service providers were to receive a more detailed
specification of requirements in due course.

The POCL/BA Request for a Statement of Capability sets out a procurement
strategy at Annex A. This refers to POCL/BA’s intention to select a “single prime
contractor... to source a strategic IT infrastructure... for all POCL applications,
and to develop the initial BA benefit payment application”. The strategy also
refers to potential prime contractors being required to set up and operate a “pilot
system and service”. The initial state of the pilot was to “be a demonstrator which
must establish credibility of the prime contractor's proposed solution, both from

a technical and usability perspective, whilst the latter state (to be referred to as

Page 9 of 77
38.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

the operational trial) will focus on refinement of the solution and final proving of
the detailed operational aspects prior to roll-out of the infrastructure”.

A provisional timetable for the procurement process is also set out Annex A to
the POCL/BA Request for a Statement of Capability. In summary, this provides:

a. Stage 1 — Establish Playing Field (August — November 1994). The

purpose of this stage was to establish whether there was sufficient
interest and capability to run a full competition in line with the
procurement strategy.

b. Stage 2 — Innovation and Clarification (December 1994 — March
1995). This stage was to involve the issue of a Statement of Service
Requirements document (the “SSR”) which service providers were to
respond to by submitting written proposals. Shortlisted service
providers were then to be invited to enter into contract negotiations in
parallel with mounting their demonstrator programmes.

c. Stage 3 — Contractor Negotiation / Pilot Commencement (March —

September 1995). The objective of this stage was to agree the draft
contracts for the application development and service provision and
for demonstrations of the proposed solutions to occur. This process
was aimed at evaluation and risk assessment of potential solutions.

d. Stage 4 — Evaluation and Selection (October — December 1995).

During this stage, the service providers were to be asked to submit
tenders on the basis of agreed draft contracts, following evaluation of
which a prime contractor would be selected.

e. Stage 5 — Pilot Operational Trials (after December 1995). Following

the selection of a prime contractor the operational trials were to

41.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

commence to, (i) refine and prove the preferred prime contactor’s

solution for the IT infrastructure and BA application, and (ii) establish

the detail of a roll-out programme.
Annex B to the POCL/BA Request for a Statement of Capability contained a
questionnaire which all service providers responding to the request were
required to complete. This included questions about financial standing of the
service provider and any consortium members.
ICL submitted a Statement of Capability on or about 19 November 1994
(FSL_03/6). This contained information about ICL’s and its consortium
members’ relevant capabilities and experience. It also stated that the ICL
consortium had established a joint team at a location to analyse and define in
detail the proposed solution, recognising that the full SSR had yet to be issued.
A separate bid opportunity was also advertised at this time for what was known
as the Automation of London Post Offices (“ALPS”) project or the ALPS/ESNS
project. This programme was intended to introduce by August 1995 some level
of automation at Post Office branches within the M25 region. This was to include
an Electronic Stop Notice facility (‘ESNS”) to mitigate fraud in benefits
distribution. ESNS did this by accessing a national ‘stop list’ of benefit books to
perform validation checks on order books presented in Post Office branches by
recipients of benefits payments (FSL_03/7). Whilst we have not been able to
identify the original bid materials for this opportunity, it was a tender which ICL
won and worked on before the completion of the “Bringing Technology to Post

Offices and Benefit Payments” Procurement in May 1996.

WITNO06650100

In 1995, ICL, De La Rue and Girobank established a new company, Pathway
Group, to participate in the tender process and to perform any subsequent
contract if it won the tender.

On 13 April 1995, the DSS and POCL issued the SSR to shortlisted service
providers, including the newly established Pathway Group (FSL_03/7). The SSR
contained a detailed description of the functional requirements behind the
services to be provided following the procurement.

In terms of the proposed commercial and contractual basis of the procurement
opportunity, paragraph 8.3.3 of the SSR states that the service requirements
were to be met by a service contract or contracts which conform to the
requirements of the PFI.

Pathway Group submitted a proposal in response to this SSR on or about
8 June 1995 (the “Pathway Group Response”) (FSL_03/8). This was a
substantial document extending to hundreds of pages. The Pathway Group
Response contained technical proposals and specifications regarding Pathway
Group’s proposed solution to deliver the “Benefit Payment Services” and the
“POCL Strategic Infrastructure Services”, in additions to details relating to
matters such as Quality Management Systems.

Finally, Annex 6 of the Pathway Group Response sets out details of relevant
experience qualifying Pathway Group, its various shareholders and its proposed
sub-contractors to deliver the opportunity specified in the SSR. This information
includes reference to the ALPS / ESNS project ICL had delivered to Post Office
branches within the M25 motorway boundary, which is relevant to a question
which the Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to answer in relation to prior experience ICL

had in relation to delivering automated payment or accounting systems.

47. The procurement process led by the Contracting Authorities continued and
Pathway Group became a shortlisted service provider. The other shortlisted
service providers are understood to have been IBM and ‘Cardlink’ (see for
example the minutes of the Pathway Group Board meeting on 15 March 1996
(FSL_03/9)).

48. By the end of 1995, a draft contract and commercial terms were shared and
commented on by shortlisted service providers (see for example a first draft of
Pathway Group’s response to the draft contract dated 29 December 1995 at
FSL_03/10). However, it is apparent that the Contracting Authorities perceived
various shortcomings and risks with the Pathway Group Response. These risks
were the subject of scrutiny and questions by the Contracting Authorities during
the early part of 1996. Key risk areas perceived with Pathway Group’s Response
were noted in the minutes of a Pathway Group Board meeting on 15 March 1996
(FSL_03/9) as being:

a. _ Financial structure;
b. Fraud liability; and
c. Reliance on Escher.

49. Nevertheless, on 29 February 1996, the Contracting Authorities invited Pathway
Group to submit a formal tender (see the letter from Patricia Kelsey, Head of
Procurement for BA/POCL, to Jim Morley, Programme Director of Pathway
Group, FSL_03/11). Pathway Group put in its tender submission on or about 21
March 1996 which, after some modification to respond to the invitation to re-
tender issued on or around 16 April 1996, was re-submitted on or about 22 April
1996 (see the Managing Director's Report prepared for the Pathway Group

Board meeting on 25 April 1996, FSL_03/12).

Page 13 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

50. Subsequently, on or about 15 May 1996 Pathway Group was awarded the
service contracts to computerise all the UK's c.19,000 Post Offices and
simultaneously automate the system for paying DSS benefits to at least
19 million claimants. The arrangements were set out in three related contracts
dated 15 May 1996 (the “Related Agreements’):

a. | anagreement between the DSS and Pathway Group for, inter alia, the
provision by Pathway Group of services relating to a benefit payment
card (the “DSS Agreement’);

b. an agreement between POCL and Pathway Group for, inter alia, the
provision by Pathway Group of the “POCL Service Infrastructure” and
“POCL Services”; (the “POCL Agreement’); and

c. an agreement among the DSS, POCL and Pathway Group for the
supply of a service infrastructure and the provision of certain services
which were of common interest to both the DSS and POCL (the
“Authorities’ Agreement”)

51. Shortly after the Related Agreements were entered into, Pathway Group
changed its name to ICL Pathway and arrangements were made to increase
ICL’s shareholding in ICL Pathway. Less than six months after the allotment of
these shares, ICL became the sole shareholder of ICL Pathway.

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PILOT OF THE SERVICES SOLUTION

52. Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to describe and explain the key stages in
the design and development of the Horizon System during the period 1996-2000
and this is addressed in the following sections of this statement.

53. Under the Related Agreements, it was ICL Pathway’s responsibility to design,

develop, integrate and establish a services solution. Under the PFI principles

Page 14 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

governing the Related Agreements, once accepted and rolled out, ICL Pathway
could recoup its solution investment from charges based on transaction volumes
across the remaining terms of the Related Agreements.

54. In the Pathway Group Response during the tender process, Pathway Group
recognised that the service solution would take significant time to design and
develop and that benefits such as fraud encashment ‘savings’ would be delayed.
It was on this basis that proposals were made by Pathway Group to take a
phased approach to the implementation of existing solutions which could then be
built on to deliver successive increments of functionality? (FSL_03/8).

55. The contractual requirements of the service to be provided had been articulated
by the Contracting Authorities during the tender process and were set out in the
Related Agreements. Solution responses provided by ICL Pathway were also
incorporated into the Related Agreements and later into the agreement signed
between ICL Pathway and POCL in July 1999 (the “Codified Agreement’).

56. The parties agreed in the Related Agreements and during the governance of the
design and development programme to develop components of contractual
services up to a certain level of functionality so that these service components
could be trialled in pilot sites and upgraded with new layers of functionality or
service components.

57. The Programme Delivery Authority (“PDA”) was established by the Contracting
Authorities to oversee design, development and implementation work. The PDA
was comprised of individuals from POCL and DSS, in addition to external
consultants. In or around April 1998, the PDA was replaced with a team within

POCL led by the Horizon Programme Director, a POCL Board position, who had

WITNO06650100

POCL signing authority in relation the Authorities’ Agreement (FSL_03/13 and
FSL_03/14).

On or about 16 August 1996, the first version of a master plan for delivery of the
programme was issued by the PDA (FSL_03/15). This initial master plan set out
strategic milestones and provided detail in relation to parties’ activities and
responsibilities as well as a framework for ongoing management. The third and
final version of the master plan was issued by the PDA on 8 April 1997 (the
“Master Plan”) (FSL_03/16). This document noted that any further changes
would be subject to the formal PDA change control process.

In summary, the Master Plan envisaged the following strategic milestones:

a. Release 1A, also called the ‘Initial Go Live’: to implement software
introducing Child Benefits payments by card. It was planned to be
installed at a single Post Office branch by 23 September 1996,
followed by further installations of the same at an additional 9 Post
Office branches by 21 October 1996.

b. Release 1B, as another component of the pilot phase: to introduce the
automation of the Order Book Control System (“OBCS”) at
approximately 200 Post Office branches, which was to go live and be
made available for customer use by 28 April 1997.

c. Release 1C, to extend OBCS functionality and introduce the Benefit
Payment Service (“BPS’) for restricted live use by 30 June 1997.

d. Release 1E, to extend OBSC and BPS functionality and to introduce
Electronic Point of Sale Service (“EPOSS”) functionality and
Automated Payment Systems (“APS”) for use in full trial by 8

September 1997.

Page 16 of 77
60.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

e. Release 1, would contain all agreed Release 1 functionality from
Release 1A to 1E for full use by 21 November 1997.

There were factors and events which led to deviations from the Master Plan.

EARLY DESIGN ACTIVITIES

61.

62.

63.

Under the Authorities’ Agreement, the parties were required to agree a detailed
specification of the services so that a detailed design document of the service
architecture could be produced (Clause 401 of Authorities’ Agreement,
FSL_03/17). Paragraph 2.2 of Schedule B7 of the Authorities’ Agreement
required Pathway Group to supply the Contracting Authorities with a Functional
Specification within one week of execution of the Related Agreements and for
this be agreed by a target date of 30 June 1996.

The Functional Specification issued by Pathway Group on 22 May 1996 stated
that it had been prepared with a view to it being converted into the Service
Architecture Design Document (“SADD”) required by Clause 401.1 in the
Authorities’ Agreement (FSL_03/18). In this way, it was intended that there would
be a “complete description and unbroken audit trail of changes proposed and
changes agreed”. Version 6 of the Functional Specification is dated 26 July 1996
(FSL_03/19).

A SADD was also prepared by ICL Pathway‘. Fujitsu has not yet located a
complete copy or final version of the issued SADD, although it is understood that

the SADD was issued on or about 27 September 1996.

4 Pathway Group Limited changed its names to ICL Pathway Limited with effect from 29 May 1996

INITIAL GO LIVE

64. The Initial Go Live (“IGL”) was based on software Release 1A, which facilitated
the automation of the payment of child benefits and piloted the use of payment
cards at 10 branches in the Stroud area.

65. Arelease notice for IGL was produced by ICL Pathway on or about 6 September

1996 (FSL_03/20). The release notice entitled “ICL Software Baseline Release
Notice Issue 1” provides:
“the Release Notice for the IGL1 Software Baseline...contains the definition of
the contents of the baseline and provides a checklist of media and associated
documentation to be used in the Build of the IGL1 Live system. This software
baseline reflects the software that was used during the UAT testing prior to
6/9/96", where UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

66. The release notice states, however, that: “at the time of publication of this
document, further problems are being investigated which are likely to require
further updates to this software baseline. Such updates will be provided as
‘patches’ to this baseline, and will be covered by separate Release notices. Refer
to PinICL for the latest status of problems found during UAT’.

67. PinlCL was a proprietary incident management system which Pathway used to
manage any incidents arising during the development and subsequent operation
of the services being delivered to the Contracting Authorities.

68. An update to the release notice was subsequently issued on or about
17 September 1996 entitled “IGL1 Software Updates Release Notice Issue 2.0”

(FSL_03/21). This provides:

“This document is the Release Notice for updates to the IGL1 Software
Baseline...The revised baseline reflects the software that has been upgraded
following UAT testing, in the period between 11/9/96 and 17/9/96’.

Update 2.0 of the ICL Pathway IGL1 Software Baseline also refers to key team
members who were involved in the development and testing of Initial Go Live
(FSL_03/22).

The first installation of Release 1A occurred on or about 23 September 1996 at
the Leonard Stanley branch in Gloucestershire. This was followed by installations
of Release 1A at a further nine Post Office branches from 21 October 1996.

At each of these Post Office branches, a single set of counter equipment was
installed to support Initial Go Live, comprising a PC, a printer, a bar code reader
and a magnetic card reader. Only one counter position per Post Office branch
was installed.

On 29 November 1996, the Pathway Quality Manager at that time, David Groom,
visited five of the IGL Post Office branches (Whitehall, Caincross, Ebley, Kings
Stanley and Leonard Stanley) to carry out a quality audit involving an inspection
of the installation of Release 1A and a discussion with the postmasters working
at those branches on their experiences of implementation. The audit findings,
including key customer comments, were recorded in a quality audit report
prepared by Mr Groom in January 1997 (FSL_03/23).

A Lessons Learned report was prepared by ICL Pathway in November 1996.
This report includes a summary of the design and testing work that was
undertaken in relation to the IGL phase and sets out resultant lessons learned

(FSL_03/24).

THE PILOT PHASE (RELEASE 1B)
74. As set out in the Master Plan (FSL_03/15), a Pilot phase was to follow IGL. This

pilot phase began with Release 1B which is understood to have provided the
OBCS, in addition to minimal elements of the EPOSS service necessary to
support OBCS. Release 1B was installed at approximately 190 branches in the
North East, South Wales and South West of England from May 1997 onwards.
75. Prior to the installation of Release 1B, post office branches required:

a. ‘Outlet’ surveys and preparation;

b. User Awareness;

c. User Training;

d. Installation of equipment at branches; and

e. Support Services.

76. Further details of the implementation activities associated with Release 1B are
contained in the Implementation Strategy dated 30 May 1997 (FSL_03/25), and
in the documents cross referred to in that release strategy.

77. \n terms of cotemporaneous programmatic documents, the “Release 1b - Order
Book Control Service Processes and Procedures” document (FSL_03/26) sets
out the elements of the OBCS service application to be delivered in Release 1B.

78. There were delays to and issues with the implementation of Release 1B. In the
minutes of the ICL Pathway Board meeting on 7 May 1997 (FSL_03/27), it was
reported that Release 1B was “working satisfactorily” in only one Post Office at
that time. Terry Austin, the then Programme Director, reported to the board that:
“The late release of Issue 1b had been principally as a result of bugs in the
connection between the Post Office and the HQ Data Centres. Considerable

regression testing was necessary following resolution of these bugs, in order to

Page 20 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

check that other parts of the system were not affected. This had impacted on the
timescale for Release 1c, now expected to be six to eight weeks late (ie August).
By the end of the week we hoped to be back on course with Release 1b, in a
total of twenty Post Offices”

79. Then Managing Director of ICL Pathway, John Bennett, also reported that
surveys of the post offices continued and “there were many which appeared to
have inadequate counter space and other facilities, including electrical, ISDN etc
links.”

80. Consequences of the delay were summarised by Mr Bennett, as including the
“the likelihood of achieving a roll-out to significantly less than the projected
number of Post Offices by the year end”.

81. Itis also apparent from these minutes that both POCL and the Benefits Agency
were involving external consultants to review programme progress. Mr Bennett
said that the PDA had asked Andersen Consulting to review progress. POCL
declined to be involved in this review and had instead asked French Thornton to
conduct a separate review.

THE PILOT PHASE (RELEASE 1C)

82. The objective of Release 1C was to introduce the BPS (consisting of (i) Card
Management Services, or “CMS”, (ii) Payment Authorisation Service, or “PAS”,
and (iii) Benefit Encashment Service, or “BES”). Further details of the content of
this release are set out in the “Release 1c Contents Description” dated 22
September 1997 (FSL_03/28).

83. Release 1C was to be implemented at the 10 IGL Post Office branches operating

Release 1A and the approximately 190 Post Office branches operating Release

Page 21 of 77
84.

85.

86.

WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

1B. Release 1C went live on or about 20 November 1997 at 205 Post Office
branches with approximately 330 counters (FSL_03/29).

There were delays to and issues with Release 1C’s development and
implementation and this resulted in a re-planning of release delivery and changes
to the programme timetable. By the early summer of 1997, it was reported to the
Board of ICL PLC (sole shareholder of ICL) that Release 1C had slipped from
August to October 1997 (FSL_03/30). One of the reasons cited for this delay
was the complexity of the solution. Issues were recorded in ICL Pathway’s PinICL
database as incidents and were tracked and reported as part of agreed testing
of Release 1C.

A subset of these incidents were recorded in a document entitled the “Known
Problem Register at 1c” dated 26 August 1997 (FSL_03/31). By way of
background, the Known Problem Register (or “KPR”) was used by ICL Pathway
to record known problems which were not intended to be resolved by means of
product change in a target Release. It was intended to provide visibility of such
problems for evaluation of the business risk to BA/POCL and/or ICL Pathway.

It is understood from the KPR for Release 1C that the assessment of whether an
issue could be added to the KPR was undertaken by an ICL Pathway PinICL
Impact Assessment Team (or, “PIAT”). Incidents recorded in PinlICLs were
classified according to the priority at which the incident was being progressed.
The classifications used were: (i) Category A - Programme stopped; (ii) Category
B - Progress stopped; (iii) Category C - Progress restricted; and (iv) Category D
- Non-urgent. These classifications were based on business impact assessments
conventionally defined as: High, Medium, Low and None. For further information

regarding the classifications applied in ICL Pathway’s PinICL records, please see

Page 22 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

the submission made on behalf of Fujitsu on 13 September 2022, in response to
a Rule 9 Request dated 29 April 2022.

87. Matters relating to the implementation of Release 1C were recorded in Weekly
Progress Reports relating to each of the POCL designated regions (see for
example, FSL_03/32 in respect the North East region, and FSL_03/33 and
FSL_03/34 in respect of the South Wales and South West region). Technical
deficiencies identified during Release 1C were escalated through the PinICL
system, as described above, and formed the subject of various reports and
change documents such as the, (i) Phase 1c - Post Implementation Report dated
31 March 1998 (FSL_03/35), (ii) monthly Release 1C Operations Reports such
as FSL_03/36, and (iii) Release 1C Change Request — Lost Transactions &
Duplicate Payments Change Request dated 21 January 1998 (FSL_03/37).

88. On 19 September 1997, an ICL Pathway Memorandum (FSL_03/38) was
produced in relation to Model Office Testing activities for Release 1C. The memo
was prepared by Terry Austin and explains that the baseline codeset for Release
1C submitted for Model Office testing was to be finalised on 19 September 1997,
with Model Office testing due to start on 6 October 1997.

89. Release 1C then went live on or about 20 November 1997 at approximately 200
Post Offices branches (FSL_03/29).

NR2 DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PREPARATION FOR ACCEPTANCE

90. Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to identify and explain which factors caused
or contributed to the delay in implementation of the live trial of the Horizon

System.

Page 23 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

91. In responding to the Inquiry’s request, Fujitsu sets out high level explanations
that were reported at the time of the causes and contributions towards delay to
the programme, and does not warrant their accuracy.

92. The previous section of this statement addresses delays which occurred to the
Pilot phase of the programme. There were consequential delays to the
remainder of the plan for Release 1 and Release 2. Towards the end of 1997, it
is understood that there was a re-plan to withdraw Release 1e and Release 2
and create a New Release 2 (“NR2”) as described in version 2 of the “New
Release 2 Contents Description” document prepared by ICL Pathway
(FSL_03/39).

93. The aforementioned document stated that NR2 was being planned to be used
as the baseline release, “to enable the Live Trial and contractual acceptance
process”.

ACCEPTANCE PREPARATION IN 1997

94. A procedure for acceptance of the Operational Trial had been prepared by the
PDA, of which the third and final phase was Live Trial (FSL_03/40). The
procedure specified that the Live Trial was to be made up of three stages:

a. Acceptance Preparation;
b. Acceptance Testing; and
c. Contractual Acceptance.

95. The final stage of Contractual Acceptance was to be confirmed by the
Acceptance Board within five working days of the end of Live Trial. The
Acceptance Board could either reject, accept or partially accept the ICL Pathway

Services. This decision would then be given to the Release Authorisation Board.

Page 24 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

96. The procedure also contained requirements for the establishment of an
Acceptance Board, Acceptance Groups, and the responsibilities of key roles
such as the Acceptance Manager, the Acceptance Incident Manager and other
extensive Acceptance Preparation activities.

THE RELATIONSHIP TO CAPS

97. The Customer Accounting and Payment System (“CAPS”) project was a DSS
managed development project. It is Fujitsu’s understanding that there was a
dependency between this CAPS project and the Live Trial and Acceptance of
NR2. The system ICL Pathway was developing was required to interface to the
CAPS system, meaning the progress of CAPS affected Pathway Releases.

98. Itis amatter of public record in the NAO report prepared by John Bourn in August
2000 that there were delays to the CAPS project and that this had an impact on
the design and development of the services solution ICL Pathway was
responsible for delivering.

THIRD PARTY AND INTERNAL AUDITS OF PROGRAMME DELIVERY

99. It is understood that BA, POCL and ICL co-sponsored and commissioned an
independent review by PA Consulting into the weaknesses and risks in the
programme.

100. In addition, Fujitsu has identified and disclosed to the Inquiry internal audit
reports containing references to contemporaneous actions which were
undertaken by ICL Pathway concerning its performance. For example, a series
of internal audits were undertaken which contained analysis of and
recommendations to improve quality management issues. The audits continued
over a number of years but, initially, they were referred to as (mid stage quality

audits (‘MSQA’”) and cited criticisms in the PA Consulting report. For example,

Page 25 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

a Report on the “Release 2 Process Improvement Programme” produced on or
about 18 June 1998 stated:

“A review of the Pathway project (Release 1) was carried out during 1997 by PA
Consulting Ltd (PA). One of the observations raised during that review was that
while ICL Pathway possessed processes and standards, their deployment and
subsequent compliance by members of the project team could be improved. A
corrective action programme was put in place inside Pathway to address the
many observations and recommendations made. This report presents the results
of that programme, culminating in the sequence of Mid Stage Quality Audits
conducted between December 1997 and May 1998” (FSL_03/41).

THE IMPACT OF THE PFI STRUCTURE

101. Under PFI principles ICL Pathway bore the risk (and therefore the cost) of delays
to the acceptance of the contract solution. There were exceptions to this, for
example, if it could be shown that the delay was caused by certain actions or
omissions by the Contracting Authorities (such as delay to the development of
CAPS releases), but the onus was on ICL Pathway to demonstrate that delay
should result in extensions of time and compensation.

102. At the end of 1997, ICL Pathway was facing significant potential financial losses
over the lifetime of the contract as a result of the Pathway Programme.

103. A position paper dated 5 March 1998 (the “ICL Position Paper”) set out, on a
without prejudice basis, the ICL position that the DSS had ‘breached’ basic PFI
principles and was not meeting its obligations in relation to the availability of the
CAPS system (FSL_03/42). In addition, the ICL Position Paper highlighted a

number of core issues relating to the initial specification and changes to the

Page 26 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

Contracting Authorities’ requirements, which adversely impacted the stability of
design and software developments to meet these changing requirements.

ISSUES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF NR2

104. Fujitsu understands from contemporaneous reporting that there were issues with
the development of NR2 and this was causing further risk and delay to the plans
to take NR2 to Live Trial.

105. By March 1998, it was reported internally at ICL Pathway that during testing of
various ‘product drops’ there were a high level of category ‘B’ priority PinICLs not
achieving the required time for fixes (FSL_03/43). The reason for the delay was
reported to be the “high Development workload”. It was also reported that the
category ‘A’ priority rating for PinICLs was not being fully utilized as there was a
reluctance to set PinICLs to ‘A’ priority due to its definition of “Programme
Stopped”. Slower progress than planned was being made in a number of the
test phases. In particular, EPOSS and BPS system tests were behind plan.

106. In an internal ICL Pathway note prepared on or about 29 April 1998, it was
reported that the Live Trial was being scheduled to occur in January 1999,
followed by national rollout commencing in April 1999 (FSL_03/13). However,
there were issues arising from Reference Data and the testing of EPOSS as
much of the detailed functionality of EROSS was, in effect, contained within
Reference Data, and the contract level specification was open to a range of
detailed interpretations. The note stated that to objectify this detail, ICL Pathway
and POCL had agreed to develop the service through prototyping and this activity
had identified many issues related to the automation of existing business

processes and took longer than planned.

Page 27 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

107. Issues agreeing the Release Contents Definition (the “RCD”) of Release 2 were
also identified as a factor. Significantly, the note refers to the RCD striking a
balance between the principle enshrined in the “Final (Drop Down) version of the
contract that not all functionality will be delivered in the first general release and
the concerns expressed by sponsors as to those features and functions they
were prepared to live without for a period”. The Authorities had not signed off
the RCD, instead indicating that sign off would only occur if certain conditions
were met. The note submits that this, together with various changes which
seemingly went against the above-mentioned principle, had “destabilised the
design baseline”.

108. Over the summer of 1998, testing of NR2 continued but there were issues with
the release being identified in testing and delays to forecast completion of testing
activities which potentially impacted planned timescales for the commencement
of national roll out. The “large number of incidents (PinICL's) to be resolved” was
identified to the ICL Pathway board in August 1998 as being a key risk to the
plan for national roll out to commence in April 1999 (FSL_03/44).

RENEGOTIATIONS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS AND PREPARATIONS

FOR ACCEPTANCE

109. The above-mentioned disputes and delays to the Pathway Programme had been
escalated within Government. An independent review commissioned by HM
Treasury Review in 1998 was expected to issue a report of its findings in July
1998 (‘HMT Report’) (FSL_03/45).

110. The report explored 6 options for proceeding with the programme, of which two
were recommended and would be the subject of further ministerial discussion

(FSL_03/46).

Page 28 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

111. Option 1 proposed the introduction of a benefit payment card to co-exist with new
POCL banking and financial services that would allow benefits to be paid by
automatic credit transfers (“ACT”). The DSS would then transfer to full ACT at
that time.

112. Option 2 proposed reducing the scope by removing the benefit payment card
component completely, relying solely on POCL to develop an ACT based
benefits solution, and entailed ICL Pathway being compensated for the reduced
scope of contract.

113. There then followed a period negotiation as to the future of the Pathway
Programme which ultimately continued until the Related Agreements were
terminated in May 1999 and a new agreement, the Codified Agreement, was
entered into between ICL Pathway and POCL in July 1999.

CSR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TESTING

114. Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to identify and explain the acceptance
criteria for the Horizon System as well as other associated questions regarding
the testing which was undertaken of the system prior to its acceptance. In
addition, Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to identify and explain the factors
which caused or contributed to the delay in acceptance and roll out of the Horizon
System.

115. On the issues of robustness and fitness for purpose of the Horizon System, the
Inquiry has also asked Fujitsu to explain what was known by ICL Pathway at the
time of acceptance and national rollout regarding the accuracy and integrity of
the data recorded and processed on the Horizon System, and the extent to which
deficiencies in the Horizon System were capable of causing or caused apparent

discrepancies or shortfalls in branch accounts.

Page 29 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

116. Acceptance of the Core System Release (“CSR Acceptance”) was based on
criteria described in the Codified Agreement. Schedule A11 of the Codified
Agreement provided that Acceptance Tests were to be performed against agreed
Acceptance Specifications during a Core Observation Period. CSR Acceptance
was to occur if certain thresholds of Acceptance Incidents and_ their
classifications were not exceeded during the three week Operational Trial
Review that followed the Core Observation Period.

117. Each Acceptance Test was envisaged to demonstrate that the relevant
Acceptance Criteria had been met. Acceptance Criteria for each of the
contractual service areas were specified in the relevant schedules of the Codified
Agreement and are set out in Part 2 of Appendix 1 to this statement.

118. The Acceptance Tests to be used for CSR Acceptance were described in the
agreed Acceptance Specifications listed in Annex 2 to Schedule 11 by reference
to Contract Change Notes (“CCNs’). Generally, these Acceptance Specifications
established responsibilities between the parties for executing the testing
described in the specifications. The relevant acceptance specifications are more
particularly set out in Part 1 of Appendix 1 to this statement. Each party
nominated a Test Manager and other representatives to conduct acceptance
testing.

119. In a later version of the Codified Agreement (FSL_03/47), the following testing
documents were referred to as being relevant to the Operational Trial: The
General Testing Policy, version 2.0 (30 September 1996) (FSL_03/48); The
Testing and Integration Strategy, version 2.0 (30 September 1996) (FSL_03/49);
and Revisions to the Testing and Integration Approach for Pathway Release 2,

version 2.0 (24 October 1997) (FSL_03/50).

Page 30 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

120. POCL and ICL Pathway were operating a Live Trial of the CSR release in 299
Live Trial Post Offices by the time the Codified Agreement was entered into
(FSL_03/51). 23 more Post Office branches were also due to be added to the
Live Trial cohort. This Live Trial was being conducted on what was known as LT1
(short for Live Trial 1). LT2 (short for Live Trial 2) was to follow.

121. KPRs were also prepared for CSR. As explained above, these documents
recorded known problems which were not intended to be resolved by means of
product change to the Core System Release prior to the Live Trial (e.g.
FSL_03/52). Further details of the release content of CSR LT2 are set out ina
document entitled “ICL Pathway Core System Release Contents Description”
which was issued on or about 25 June 1999 (FSL_03/53).

122. Two of the pre-conditions specified for CSR Acceptance in Schedule A11 of the
Codified Agreement were that the thresholds for faults should be met and a
timetable should be agreed to resolve outstanding faults. The fault thresholds for
CSR Acceptance provided that there should be no high severity (category A)
faults, no more than 20 medium severity (category B) faults, and no more than
10 category B faults in respect of any one CSR acceptance specification
(FSL_03/54).

123. As explained below, these pre-conditions were not achieved and CSR
Acceptance was not achieved by the 16 August 1999 target date specified in the
Codified Agreement.

124. In these circumstances, paragraph 3.1 of Schedule A11 to the Codified
Agreement entitled ICL Pathway to a period of three months to remedy the
outstanding defaults at its own expense and to re-submit the Core System

Release for its second CSR Acceptance Test (FSL_03/54). The basis upon

Page 31 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

which the parties agreed to continue working after 16 August 1999 was set out
in the Supplemental Agreement dated 20 August 1999 (FSL_03/55). At the end

of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period on 16 August 1999, there were:
a. 9 faults (the “Agreed Category B Faults”), which both parties agreed
were category B faults, being Acceptance Incidents 342, 361, 371,

211, 372, 390, 395, 314 and 408;

b. 3 faults (the “Disputed Category A Faults”), which ICL Pathway
considered to be category B faults but which POL believed were

category A faults, being Acceptance Incidents 376, 298 and 218;

c. 2 faults (the “Disputed Category B Faults”), which ICL Pathway
considered to be low severity category C faults but which POCL
believed were category B faults, being Acceptance Incidents 378 and

391; and

d. 1 alleged fault (the “Unagreed Fault”), which ICL Pathway believed
was not an Acceptance Incident but which POCL believed to be a

category B fault, being Acceptance Incident 369.

125. The Supplemental Agreement recorded the parties’ agreed programme of work
with a view to achieving CSR Acceptance and release authorisation by
24 September 1999. This included, (i) a further “Limited Trial Period” between
the date of the Supplemental Agreement and 17 September 1999, and (ii) joint
workshops for the purpose of agreeing resolution plans for the Agreed Category
B Faults, the Disputed Category B Faults and, if appropriate, the Unagreed Fault.

PA Consulting was also involved in these workshops.

Page 32 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

126. On 24 September 1999, CSR Acceptance and authorisation by the Release
Authorisation Board for national rollout were deemed to have been achieved by
the terms of the Second Supplemental Agreement signed that day (FSL_03/56).
The Second Supplemental Agreement recorded the following 13 Acceptance
Incidents (as well as category C faults) as outstanding at the date of the
Agreement: Acceptance Incidents 211, 218, 298, 314, 342, 369, 372, 376, 378,
390, 391, 408 and 412 (FSL_03/56)°. The parties agreed to use reasonable
endeavours to resolve each Acceptance Incident in accordance with rectification
plans set out in the Second Supplemental Agreement and a new Acceptance
Resolution Timetable.

127. For each Acceptance Incident listed in Part B of Schedule 1 of the Second
Supplemental Agreement, Schedule 2 contained a reference to an existing
rectification plan in addition to certain new ongoing obligations for the parties as
set out in Schedule 5. Schedule 2 also sets out the basis upon which each of
the outstanding Acceptance Incidents could be closed. Appendix 2 to this
Statement contains a table setting out the referenced contemporaneous
rectification plans.

128. The Second Supplemental Agreement required ICL Pathway to use its
reasonable endeavours to resolve each of the outstanding Acceptance Incidents
in accordance with the obligations therein, rectification plans listed at Schedule
2 to the Second Supplemental Agreement and in accordance with the
Rectification Timetable. Further, by paragraph 3.6 of the Second Supplemental
Agreement, ICL Pathway was required to “co-operate and join with POCL in

providing such information to the Post Office’s auditors as such auditors may

° Part B of Schedule 1 to the Second Supplemental Agreement.
Page 33 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

reasonably require in order to satisfy themselves that the audit reports of the Post
Office and POCL should not be qualified or contain a fundamental uncertainty
paragraph as a result of the circumstances giving rise to Acceptance Incident
376”.

129. The Second Supplemental Agreement required POCL to conduct, on a weekly
basis, the creation of a cash account from individual transaction data received
by it across the TIP interface. POCL was to compare these cash accounts with
the electronic cash account received from ICL Pathway across the TIP interface.
Any discrepancies between these accounts were to be reported to ICL Pathway
and investigated by it with any necessary co-operation of POCL. A charge was
payable by ICL Pathway to POCL for POCL’s performance of this TIP Integrity
Checking process.

130. If POCL decided to postpone the resumption of roll out, by Clause 6 of the
Second Supplemental Agreement the parties were required to meet as soon as
reasonably practicable with a view to agreeing and documenting a plan for
retesting and demonstrating satisfaction of the acceptance criteria which had not
previously been satisfied. A revised roll out programme would then take effect
once the acceptance criteria had been demonstrably satisfied (FSL_03/56).

131. Summaries for input into delivery meetings between ICL Pathway and POCL
which occurred in October and November 1999 set out progress against the 13
outstanding incidents (FSL_03/57, FSL_03/58, FSL_03/59, and FSL_03/60).

132. At the meeting of the ICL Pathway Board on 24 November 1999 (FSL_03/61), it
was reported that Horizon had been rolled out to some 1,856 Post Office
branches. Nevertheless, it was also reported that a major acceptance review was

taking place later that day to examine the “three big acceptance incidents” which

Page 34 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

were un-resolved. The principal concern at this stage appears to have been the
operation of reference data in the end-to-end model.

133. On 14 January 2000, a Special Delivery Meeting took place between ICL
Pathway and POCL to review progress and determine whether roll out should
resume on 24 January 2000. In a note of that meeting circulated to ICL Pathway
and POCL, it was noted that certain Acceptance Incidents remained unresolved,
although each had an “agreed way forward and robust checks in place to address
the original concems’. \t was then agreed that (i) if actions were in place to
address the outstanding elements of agreement, and (ii) if no issues arose prior
to signing a third supplemental agreement, there was no requirement for a further
meeting (FSL_03/62). Those outstanding elements of agreement were described
as including the completion of the final weekly checks to confirm the satisfactory
deployment of the Accounting Integrity Control Release, and a review of decision
activities by POCL’s lawyers.

134. On 19 January 2000, a Third Supplemental Agreement was concluded
(FSL_03/63). Among other things, the Third Supplemental Agreement required
POCL and ICL Pathway to continue co-operating in order to, (i) comply with
obligations in relation to the Help Desk, (ii) develop operational procedures to
support the accounting integrity control over the TIP interface, (iii) introduce new
and detailed processes in relation to TIP data transfer rules, and (iv) improve end
to end management of Reference Data over the Core System.

135. By Clause 5 of the Third Supplemental Agreement, ICL Pathway warranted that
it had conducted, with reasonable skill and care, an analysis of the effectiveness
of the design of the Accounting Integrity Control Release and associated

measures described in Clause 5 and Schedule 4. Further, ICL Pathway

Page 35 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

warranted that it had accurately reported all material results of such analysis to
POCL and agreed that it would develop, test, deploy and provide POCL with
adequate documentation of, “processes designed to prevent recurrence of Cash
Account Discrepancies which result from incorrect manual adjustment of data by
[ICL PathwayJ’. In respect of bi-directional product types or methods of payment,
ICL Pathway also agreed that it would develop, test and deploy either software
(for existing products) or processes (for new products or payments introduced
after the date of the agreement) “to prevent recurrence of Cash Account
Discrepancies which result from incorrect treatment of the sign (+or-) of data
values at the Pathway to TIP interface”.

136. Additionally, to address specific reference data errors introduced in respect of
certain products referred to in Schedule 4, ICL Pathway agreed to co-operate
with POCL and assist POCL to prevent recurrence of similar unintended effects
of reference data changes by:

a. developing a diagnostic tool (the “attribute checker”) to predict the
effect of applying all reference data changes;

b. assisting POCL to put in place appropriate authorisation processes;
and

c. co-operating with POCL to define business rules and procedures for
applying the attribute checker and the above-mentioned authorisation
processes.

137. Further, until the end of the TIP Integrity Checking Period, ICL Pathway agreed
to make available “appropriate experts to explain to POCL [ICL Pathway’s]
analysis of all root causes of Cash Account Discrepancies and the measures

which [ICL Pathway] implemented in order to prevent the recurrence of any Cash

Page 36 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

Account Discrepancies which would not have been detected by the Accounting
Integrity Control Release’.

138. Finally, by Clause 6 of the Third Supplemental Agreement, the parties agreed to
amend paragraph 3.6 of Schedule G01 of the Codified Agreement in the manner
set out in Schedule 5 to the Third Supplemental Agreement. In summary, this
introduced new obligations and new or amended definitions such as “Cash
Account Error” and “Data Error’. ICL Pathway was required to apply, throughout
the term of the Codified Agreement, “all defensive measures and checks
described [in Schedule G01] in order to detect Data Errors and Not Data Errors”.

139. Widespread errors were defined as errors, discovered by ICL Pathway (whether
through Help Desk calls or otherwise), affecting cash accounts in more than 100
Post Office branches in any one Cash Account period. In respect of widespread
errors, ICL Pathway was required to (i) notify POCL immediately in accordance
with the procedures set out in the CCD entitled “TPS Reconciliation and Incident
Management” and (ii) undertake the activities specified in more detail in the
remainder of Paragraph 3.6, including transmitting repaired transaction data to
POCL over the TIP interface and issuing Manual Error Reports to POCL.

140. On 20 March 2000, POCL informed ICL Pathway that the four-week TIP Integrity
Period had elapsed without the discovery of any Cash Account Discrepancies
not found by the Accounting Integrity Control Release. Further, POCL indicated
it had received satisfactory explanations from ICL Pathway for the Cash Account

discrepancies found (FSL_03/64).

‘STEADY STATE’ SERVICE

141. In early 2000 rollout activities had resumed and by the time of the ICL Pathway
Board meeting on 23 February 2000 (FSL_03/65), it was reported that the rollout
had reached 300 post offices branches in a single week and the 3,000 branch
rollout milestone would soon be reached.

142. Issues continued to be reported in relation to the progress of the programme,
including major issues with ICL Pathway’s service performance to the Post
Offices now operating CSR. For example, by May 2000 at least two corporate
“Red Alerts” had been raised in relation to service performance (FSL_03/66).

143. An internal audit report had been conducted of the Horizon system help desk
during this time (FSL_03/67). This audit referred to concerns about the quality
of service being provided by the Horizon System Helpdesk and, in particular,
concern about a number of specific SLA measures (answering of calls within 20
seconds (80%) and 40 seconds (99.9%), and the failure to answer a call before
the caller rings off (abandoned calls) which should not exceed 1%.

144. In examining these matters, the audit refers to the ‘Wednesday Peak’. This was
described as the weekly ‘spike’ of work on Wednesdays associated with Cash
Accounts and Balancing. The workload on this day was described as
“anomalous” and was providing “real challenge” in balancing the need to meet
SLAs while operating within a sensible staffing model that takes account of the
total call pattern over a week. Consideration was being given at this time to the
implementation of Interactive Voice Recognition systems (IVR) to mitigate the
problem that the “phone is just allowed to ring until such time as the PM gives up

or is answered by a Helpdesk Agent”. However, it was also noted that any

Page 38 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

benefits associated with introducing IVR had to be measured against increasing
public hostility to such mechanisms.

145. Other issues discussed in the audit report included the confusion caused by the
parallel operation of the Horizon system help desk and POCL's National
Business Support Centre, as well as the impracticality of resourcing the Horizon
system help desk to meet the Wednesday spike in calls. It recommended re-
positioning POCL's National Business Support Centre so that it operated in front
of the Horizon System Helpdesk and not in parallel. In this way, the NBCS could
act as the primary interface for postmasters and filter “only those calls as are
appropriate to the HSH”, thus reducing call volumes and improving response
times. The report also observed that the parallel positioning of these two call
centres was inefficient as mis-directed calls had to be routed to the alternative
centre and this was causing confusion for Post Masters when deciding which
centre to call.

146. Fujitsu understands that operational issues will be addressed further in Phase 3
of the Inquiry.

END USER CONSULTATION

147. The following section of this statement addresses the Inquiry’s questions in
relation to consultation with end users (i.e. postmasters and other branch
employees, referred to collectively as “postmasters”).

148. Fujitsu has identified a number of methods by which feedback was sought from
postmasters. These include:

a. User Satisfaction Surveys: The format and content of the survey is set
out in the “User Satisfaction Survey & Measurement Process for

Implementation” (FSL_03/68). Appendix 1 to this document provides

Page 39 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

examples of the questionnaires to be used in respect of various
activities, such as when modification are made to a Post Office branch
or cabling is installed. No completed versions of this questionnaire
have yet been identified.

Service Visit Reply Cards: It is understood that Service Visit Reply
Cards were completed by engineers during call-outs to Post Office
branches. A feedback card attached to the Reply Card allowed the
postmaster to briefly comment on the quality of the service provided
by the engineer during their visit (including any related contact through
the Horizon System Helpdesk) (see for example the ICL Pathway
“Customer Service: Service Management Operations Manual” from
1998, FSL_03/69) . The feedback resulting from these Service Visit
Reply Cards have not yet been located. However, Monthly Progress
Reports prepared by ICL Pathway prior to completion of the national
rollout, such as that for December 1999, note that Service Visit Reply
Cards were being retumed relatively regularly at that time and that the
percentage of satisfied responses was generally high. (FSL_03/70).

Management Care Visit Programme: The Management Care Visit

Programme is said to have involved senior ICL Pathway
representatives visiting selected Post Office branches and collecting
feedback using a predefined interview pack. It is understood that the
Programme was due to be performed annually. ICL Pathway planned
to attend a small number of Post Office branches towards the end of
1997 with around 200 more due to be visited in 1998 (FSL_03/71).

The ICL Pathway Monthly Progress Report for January 1998 notes,

Page 40 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

for example, that the Programme had been completed for 1997,
concentrating entirely on Release 1B. Although the satisfaction rate
for 1997 was over 90%, criticism centred on the logistics surrounding
postmaster training (FSL_03/72). Fujitsu understands that the
Management Care Visit Programme will be examined in more detail
during Phase 3 of the Inquiry.

d. Telephone survey: A telephone survey of Post Office branches that
migrated from IGL to Release 1C was undertaken. The ICL Pathway
Monthly Progress Report for November 1997 notes that the survey
raised “some positive comments and some concerns” but reiterated
that the issues raised during the survey were being progressed.

e. Separately, as noted in the ICL Pathway Monthly Progress Reports
for February 1998 (FSL_03/73) and April 1998 (FSL_03/74), it
appears that POCL also undertook a survey of 50 Post Office
branches, which was later supplemented with interviews with a further
20 postmasters. It appears from these Monthly Progress Reports as
though POCL presented the results of the surveys to ICL Pathway,
which ICL Pathway then used as input into future training events.

THE CASH ACCOUNT AND MODIFICATIONS INTRODUCED BY THE IMPACT

PROGRAMME

The Cash Account

149. Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to describe issues identified during the
development of the software known as the Cash Account prior to national roll out
and to address certain questions about the modifications to the Horizon system

introduced by POCL’s IMPACT programme.

Page 41 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

150. By way of background, the Cash Account was a formal report of the accounting
position for Post Office branches and provided a periodic summary of all
transaction activities within the branch (FSL_03/75). The report was produced
once for each Cash Account Period, normally 1 week but could be a 2 or 3 week
period (to allow for holidays, for example). The Cash Account was derived from
the balance totals relating to stock units and included a report on the current
position of each branch's Suspense Account (FSL_03/75).

151. It is understood that, within branches at the commencement of national roll-out,
the Cash Account was prepared using a paper-based system. One of the
functions of EPOSS in the Horizon System was to produce an electronic copy of
the Cash Account. Once finalised, the electronic Cash Account was stored and
transmitted to POCL’s TIP system (FSL_03/75). Until the amendments
introduced by the POCL’s Impact Programme (described below), the Cash
Account was printed out by postmasters, who were required to physically sign
and send Cash Account forms to POCL’s Chesterfield offices for relevant
reconciliation and accounting processes to be undertaken by POCL.

152. The primary vehicle for recording issues arising from the development and
testing activities prior to CSR Acceptance and national roll out was the PinICL
system. Fujitsu has conducted searches of PiniCL records dated before
24 January 2000 (being the resumption of national roll out following the
suspension to investigate accounting integrity issues escalated during
Acceptance Testing).

153. As a result of these searches, Fujitsu has identified approximately 2,000 PinICLs
containing the phrase “cash account”. Of these, approximately 250 PinlICLs were

recorded as incidents relating to the Cash Account as a ‘product’ and, of these,

Page 42 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

approximately 50 PinICLs contain the words “imbalance” or “discrepancy”
(including variations of these words). Fujitsu has disclosed to the Inquiry, and
subsequently to the Inquiry’s Expert IT Witness, all PinICL records created
before 31 December 2000. This includes all the PinICLs referred to in this
paragraph.

154. Two of these PinICLs (PC0036116 and PC0034332, FSL_03/76 and FSL_03/77,
respectively) relate to Acceptance Incident 376 which was the subject of scrutiny
pursuant to the acceptance approval arrangements discussed above. In relation
to Al 376, investigations were undertaken by ICL Pathway to determine the
cause of the issue and rectify it (FSL_03/78). Following analysis of “all
occurrences where the (TIP) derived cash accounf’ did not equal the “actual cash
account’, |\CL Pathway contended that there was “no suggestion or indication”
that there was a fault in the “calculation or reporting of the actual Cash Account’.
Following further monitoring of branches on the live estate, in late 1999, it
seemed to become apparent that many instances of the reconciliation issues
were caused by deficiencies in the Reference Data controlled and supplied by
POCL to ICL Pathway (FSL_03/79).

155. In September 1999, Pathway proposed an Acceptance Resolution Plan for
Al 376. The proposed rectification was the accounting integrity control described
above set out in a high-level design document, ‘Logical Design for EPOSS/TIP
Reconciliation Controls’ (FSL_03/80).

156. Other Acceptance Incidents also scrutinised as part of those arrangements were:

a. Al 211 (identified April 1999), relating to a receipts and payments

mismatch on the Cash Account. The incident was believed to have

Page 43 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

been fixed as part of the changes to the balancing process introduced
at LT2 (FSL_03/78).

b. AlL378 (identified July 1999), relating to the Cash Account sub file not
containing Cash Account records, which held up the processing of the
Cash Account within POCL’s back end systems. A fix was applied and
POCL was to conduct monitoring to determine whether the issue re-
arose (FSL_03/78).

c. Al394 (identified June 1999), relating to re-prints of the Cash Account
showing differences from the original report. The issue was attributed
to postmasters undertaking certain actions when completing the Cash
Account report. To avoid these problems, a modification to the ‘Report
Broker’ was introduced at LT2 (FSL_03/78).

d. Al410 (identified July 1999), relating to transactions received in the
daily transaction file not being represented on the electronic Cash
Account. ICL Pathway suggested that POCL adopt a process that
would enable them to achieve its business objective “without doing an
illegal reference data change” (FSL_03/78).

157. Ata special meeting on 14 January 2000, POCL approved the start of the roll out
on 24 January 2000. POCL noted that there were further checks to be completed
by TIP in relation to the deployment of the integrity control, and reserved its right

to suspend roll out until TIP had completed these checks (FSL_03/62).°

® During the meeting POCL and ICL Pathway also noted that further work needed to be done on
reaching contractual agreement on the third supplemental agreement.

WITNO06650100

Changes to the Cash Account introduced by the Impact Programme

158. A business process change programme was announced by POL (as POCL was
then known) which would change the accounting procedures undertaken by
postmasters in their branches. This was to be facilitated by the introduction of a
new POL finance system known as “POLFS’”, which the Horizon System was to
interface with. Modifications to the Horizon System and associated services
performed by Fujitsu were required and these needed to be defined, impacted
and managed using the contractual change mechanisms of the Codified
Agreement.

159. Fujitsu understands that the Impact programme was initially referred to by the
parties as the End-to-End programme. It was renamed Impact Programme
(IMProved ACcounTing) by POL towards the end of 2003 (FSL_03/81).

160. Initially, the Impact programme was split into a number of projects:

a. Impact Project 1 and 3 (described in a contract variation entitled CCN
1131) (FSL_03/82); and

b. Impact Project 2 (described in a contract variation entitled CCN 1132)
(FSL_03/83).

161. Both CCNs were to be introduced in a new release of software known as Release
S60 that would upgrade the Post Office branch estate (FSL_03/82). There were
to be further projects aligned to later planned releases (S70 and S80), generally
delivered annually by Fujitsu.

162. More detailed explanations of the POLFS programme and the associated
modifications anticipated to Horizon are set out in the solution definition

document for “POL SAP Finance System (Release 1)” (FSL_03/84).

Page 45 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

163. Other design documents which Fujitsu has identified and which are exhibited to
the Statement are described in the table at Appendix 3 to this statement.

THE HNG-X OR ‘HORIZON ONLINE’ MODIFICATION

164. The Inquiry has asked various questions of Fujitsu about the technical issues
which arose during the pilots of HNG-X and the steps that were taken to resolve
these issues prior to the acceptance and roll out of HNG-X.

Overview of the HNG-X Acceptance Process

165. The progress of the HNG-X system through the Live Pilot and into rollout is
intertwined with the HNG-X Acceptance process. The HNG-X Acceptance
process, which refers to the Live Pilot, is set out at Schedule B6.3 of the HNG-X
Agreement, as amended from time to time (see, for example, Version 5 of the
HNG-X Agreement dated 23 February 2009 at FSL_03/85).

166. Progression through the HNG-X acceptance process was controlled by a series

of HNG-X Acceptance Gateways described as follows in:

HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 Readiness for Router Roll Out
HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 Readiness for Data Centre Migration
HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 Readiness for Live Pilot

HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4 Readiness for Branch Migration
HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 5 Readiness for XP Roll-Out’

HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6 End of Live Monitoring

167. In order to pass through an HNG-X Acceptance Gateway, the following

conditions needed to be satisfied:

7 However, by the time of Version 7 of the HNG-X Agreement dated 10 May 2010, Acceptance Gateway
5 was no longer being used (FSL_03/86).

Page 46 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

a. all the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria in relation to that particular HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway had to be achieved;
b. there were no outstanding HNG-X Acceptance Incidents with High
Severity; and
c. the number of HNG-X Acceptance Incidents with Medium Severity
were below specified thresholds, and agreed workarounds were in
place for all Low and Medium Severity HNG-X Acceptance Incidents.
168. There were various meetings held to oversee the pilot and rollout and to manage
these acceptance processes, some of which are referred to below in this
statement. These include, for example, acceptance board meetings and joint
progress meetings. According to Schedule B6.3 of the HNG-X Agreement, the
Live Pilot was to commence after Acceptance Gateway 3 and end at Acceptance
Gateway 4. These Gateways were achieved on 21 January 2010 (see the
Acceptance Report for HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3) (FSL_03/87) and 29
June 2010 (see the Acceptance Report for HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4
(FSL_03/88 and FSL_03/89) respectively.
Acceptance Gateway 3 and Start of Live Pilot
169. The live pilot strategy that was adopted was to comprise three sequential phases:
a Low Volume Pilot, a Medium Pilot, and a High Volume Pilot.
Low Volume Pilot
170. On 21 January 2010, the Acceptance Board gave a qualified approval to proceed
through Acceptance Gateway 3 (Readiness for Live Pilot) (FSL_03/87). It was
reported that there were 146 Low Severity Acceptance Incidents and 2 Medium

Severity Acceptance Incidents. The Acceptance Board decided that its decision

Page 47 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

was subject to the delivery of “high priority fixes in “Reset 4”— to be delivered as
part of Maintenance Release 01.08”.

Medium Volume Pilot

171. According to the minutes of the Horizon Release Authorisation Board meeting
dated 28 January 2010, it was planned at that time for the Medium Volume Pilot
to begin on 28 January 2010 with 10 branches migrating, followed by a further
250 branches migrating between 1 and 4 February 2010 (FSL_03/90). The
Service Review Book for February 2010 records that 7% of all incoming calls to
the Horizon Service Desk were from branches that had migrated to HNG-X,
despite the fact that only a small percentage of the Post Office branches were
using HNG-X (FSL_03/91).

172. It is recorded in the slide deck for the HNG-X Joint Steering Board Meeting of 18
March 2010 that the restart of the Medium Volume Pilot had been approved and
that the pilot would re-commence on 18 March 2010 (FSL_03/92).

High Volume Pilot

173. The High Volume Pilot proceeded on 25 March 2010. The next day, the High
Volume Pilot was suspended due to live service issues experienced by HNG-X
migrated branches. This involved approximately 400 branches being unable to
trade for four hours on 25 March 2010 (FSL_03/93). There were database
hanging incidents on 26, 27 and 29 March 2010 and the Belfast Datacentre had
a power supply issue overnight on 30 March 2010 (Delivery Assurance Weekly
Update — 1 April 2010: FSL_03/94). For periods of the trading day on 26 and 27
March 2010 there was a complete loss of HNG-X service (FSL_03/95).

174. On 31 March 2010, Fujitsu's service delivery of the HNG-X contract was put onto

an internal “Corporate Red Alert” (FSL_03/96).

Page 48 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

175. A Corporate Alert Manager was assigned to oversee the matter (FSL_03/97) and
regular communications were shared with POL by Fujitsu. For example, see the
email dated 21 April 2010 from Vince Cochrane to various POL recipients
(FSL_03/98) and the email dated 17 May 2020 from Jim Singh to various POL
recipients (FSL_03/99). The problem was thought to have been caused by an
Oracle database issue (FSL_03/100). A ‘patch’ was developed and sent through
by Oracle to Fujitsu. This was reported to have been installed on 4 April 2010
(HNG-X Joint Progress Meeting dated 15 April 2010: FSL_03/101).

176. The Service Review Book for April 2010 noted: “the HNGx rollout programme
was still suspended and a number of HNG service impacting incidents were
experienced. The on-going root cause analysis and subsequent corrective
actions for the BAL/BDB issues are being reported on a daily basis by our
Problem Manager as part of the Red Alert. Daily progress reports have been
made available to [Post Office]’ (FSL_03/102).

177. On 6 April 2010, James Stinchcombe (Principal Solution Architect) was
requested by Alan D’Alvarez to conduct an independent technical review into the
stability of HNG-X (FSL_03/103).

178. On 27 April 2010 Mr Stinchcombe completed work on a report regarding recent
problems with the Post Office service titled “Post Office Red Alert — Independent
Technical Review” (FSL_03/95). It appears that this report was also shared with
POL on 27 April 2010 (FSL_03/104).

179. The report provides the following context to Mr Stinchcombe'’s findings:

“There have been a number of problems with the Post Office service over the
last few weeks, with the most severe being complete loss of the HNG-X Service

on 26th and 27th March, with Horizon Banking being severely impacted on 1st

Page 49 of 77
WITNO6650100
WITNO06650100

April (with 80% of transactions failing). This has resulted in the account being
placed on Red Alert. As a result, an independent technical review has been
requested to look at the specific problems and also take a wider perspective.
This is short assignment to provide feed back to both the account and the Public
Sector business unit.
This report is split down into the different areas considered and provides
recommendations on how things can be improved. Given this is a short
assignment it has not been possible to do a comprehensive review of all areas
of the solution and where further investigation by the account would be desirable
this is included. The problems that are causing the Red Alert are not a single
issue and there is no “magic bullet” to solve them. The teams need to continue

to resolve the known issues while continuing to investigate the problems. It is

likely that additional issues will emerge as the solution continues to be

investigated.”
180. The report contained various recommendations which are summarised in the
table below:
Excerpts from report narrative Recommendations
Capacity
The live system has good capacity | R1: Urgently review the

monitoring, with performance data
being available in near real time. This
has allowed a comprehensive look at
the capacity of key components of the
system.

The evidence from the capacity
monitoring shows that the problems
with HNG-X are being caused by
stability issues rather than capacity. It
is the instability of the service (as
highlighted in the next section) that is

implementation of a hardware upgrade
for the servers for NPS. This will be the
most effective solution to the problem.

R2: Consider in the very short term,
whether simple measures could be
made to reduce memory usage on the
NPS (e.g. by reducing the Oracle
cache size or turning off some
services) to improve stability.

Recommendations

“timeouts”.

R3: Do not allow further rollout of HNG-
X until the BRS is stable and keeping
up (maximum of 1 day behind).

R4: Engage an expert in Oracle
performance to review the
performance of BRS to understand the
existing performance and how to
improve it.

R5: Review Volume Testing with
regards to memory usage for agents /
BAL to ensure that memory footprint
on servers is accurate.

R6: Consider information from those
HNG-X Branches already live to see
whether data being generated is
representative.

R7: Complete performance & stress
testing before rolling out HNG-X to full
volumes.

Stability

As covered in the previous section,
many problems in the current solution
seem to be being caused by “stability”
issues (i.e. things don’t work correctly)
as opposed to capacity (i.e. there is
insufficient resource to do the work).

Due to the operational immaturity of
HNG-X, it is to be expected that there
will be some problems, however many
of those already identified have not yet
had fixes applied. This makes
diagnosing the remaining problems
difficult.

More importantly, during the recent
period of instability there have been

R8: Apply all known fixes to live that
will resolve stability issues as quickly
as possible. This is needed to reduce
both the likelihood of failures and also
allow the remaining problems to be
diagnosed.

Excerpts from report narrative

Recommendations

more low level failures than would be
expected. This in turn has resulted in
more recovery actions. Since the
recovery itself has a number of
problems (see “Recoverability”) this in
tum causes significant business
problems.

Recoverability

There is clear evidence from the
solution that both Horizon (as a result
of the PCI changes) and HNG-X are
not able to recover correctly from
failures.

The most worrying are reconciliation
BIMS exceptions — these are failures
that require manual intervention by
both Fujitsu and Royal Mail. Many of
these failures result in end customers
of the Post Office not being paid
money (the exception shows that a
bank believes it has paid out the
money, whereas the Horizon/HNG-X
system knows it did not pay out in
reality).

R9: Urgently Review causes of failures
causing BIMS exceptions for both
Horizon and HNG-X. Ensure these are
fixed before further rollout of the HNG-
X solution.

Supportability

One of the problems with the live
system at the moment is the ability to
monitor the solution. There are two
broad areas that need to be monitored:

+ Failures in the solution — technical
faults that may or may not result in loss
of service.

+ “Wellness” — is the system behaving
as expected at a business level?

The second is particularly important as
it makes up for any shortfalls in the
monitoring solution. It is also needed to
ensure it know (sic) that the system
has recovered from any failures.

R10: Review current issues with
monitoring solution to make sure they
are given appropriate priority. Ideally,
these should be fixed before HNG-X is
rolled out further to ensure that
incidents can be responded to in a
timely way (this is understood is (sic)
being considered as part of the second
work stream in the Red Alert).

R11: Review approach to monitoring of
live based on lessons learnt with the
current problems to see if the solution
provided is sufficient — particularly with
the need to monitor “wellness” in

Excerpts from report narrative

Recommendations

There are a number of known
problems with the current monitoring
solution and as a result often the first
thing operations know there is a
problem is when Post Masters phone
up to say there is a problem. Working
out what is the root cause of the
incident is then difficult as many
problems end up with similar behaviour
as far as the Post Master is concerned
(e.g. timeouts).

business terms that are understood by
Post Office.

R12: Review how problems are
diagnosed on HNG-X in the light of
recent experience to understand the
gaps and their business impact.

R13: Until the CTO joins, consider
nominating one of the senior architects
to provide technical leadership across
the design teams and provide a single
point of contact.

181. Meanwhile, the High Volume Pilot remained suspended whilst the criteria for

182.

restarting remained under review. In addition, “major incidents” were reported to

have occurred on 5 May and 7 May 2010, at the HNG-X Joint Progress Meeting

of 13 May 2010 (FSL_03/105).

Oracle subsequently reported to Fujitsu that three changes (one bespoke patch

and two setting changes) should provide a fix to the database problem (Delivery

Assurance - Weekly Update on Post Office / HNG-X 13 May 2010: FSL_03/106).

This was implemented and, on 9 June 2010, the High Volume Pilot was restarted

(HNG-X Joint Progress Meeting of 24 June 2010: FSL_03/107). On 21 June

2010, Fujitsu’s corporate Red Alert on the HNG-X contract was downgraded

(HNG-X Joint Progress Meeting of 24 June 2010: FSL_03/107).

ACCEPTANCE GATEWAY 4 AND COMPLETION OF ROLLOUT

in relation to

Acceptance Gateway 4 (Readiness for Branch Migration) and approval to

proceed through it was granted as follows:

WITNO6650100

“Approval is given to proceed through AG4. This approval is given without
prejudice to any claims for loss or damages arising out of the delays to the date
of planned completion of end May 2010 up to the date hereof and in respect of
any additional delay arising out of the default of Fujitsu” (FSL_03/88 and
FSL_03/89)

184. The High Volume Pilot completed on 30 June 2010 and the full branch migration
rollout began on the same day (FSL_03/108 and FSL_03/109).

185. The Acceptance Report for HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4 is exhibited to this
statement (FSL_03/88). This report details the technical issues considered by
the HNG-X Acceptance Board in reaching its decision.

CONCLUSION

186. This concludes Fujitsu's response to the Phase 2 aspects of the Inquiry’s
Request. Fujitsu is continuing to consider the Phase 3 questions put to it in the
Request, and intends to respond by providing the Inquiry with a further witness

statement.
