Lucy,

Tam afraid, we didn’t make any further progress on this and I know the deadline was yesterday. Whilst the
Royal Mail archive personnel initially seemed willing to assist us, they have yesterday referred it to their
legal team, who were reluctant to release any documents to us. They were going to speak to Rod Williams to
understand why we need this, but I don’t know if such a conversation happened.

My view is still (as per the attached e-mail) that given that the external auditors have not re-reported any
concerns over the Credence IT control environment, this could be interpreted that the shortcomings noted in
2010 have been remediated.

Best regards,

Johann

Hi Johann,

I will need to produce a draft statement and have it reviewed by counsel so Thursday 8 November is the absolute

deadline. If you could let have your comments so far that would be helpful.
Kind regards,

Hi Lucy

We still haven’t found any relevant documents. When is the absolute deadline for this? Would you like me
in the meantime summarise my conclusion on the subsequent papers that we have reviewed?

Dear Michelle,

As discussed yesterday, we are looking for Royal Mail Group Audit Committee or Audit, Risk &
Compliance Committee (ARC) minutes for meetings that took place during 2010 & 2011. It appears the
Post Office Limited Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee was not formed until 2012 so we believe the
relevant information must be in the Royal Mail Group meeting minutes.

Within these minutes the relevant search terms will be:
Credence

Credence IT Controls

Credence change controls

IT Controls update

Many thanks in advance.

Best wishes,

Rebecca

Hi Michelle,

Ah, maybe I was given the wrong number.

Thank you for agreeing to look into this. I am sorry to be a pain but it is very urgent (it relates to ongoing
litigation which is currently before the High Court — you might have seen it in the news). Are you able to
look into it sooner or ask someone who might be able to do this sooner in your team? Again I apologise for
the late notice — we are working to strict deadlines set as part of the trial process and we have been

struggling to track down these documents as we believed they were at the Postal Museum, but it appears
not.

Thank you in advance.

Best wishes,

Rebecca

Dear Michelle,

Further to my voicemail, I work at Post Office Limited and we are looking to access the minutes from the
Royal Mail Group Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee meetings from before the split, namely 2010 &

2011. I was given your details by Jamie Ellul from the Postal Museum who advised you might be able to
help.

Are you able to send me these documents?

Many thanks,

Rebecca
