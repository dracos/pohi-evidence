POST OFFICE LTD -v- KHAYYAM ISHAQ
CASE POLTD/1011/0186

Thank you for your minute. During the course of the interview the suspect refers to an
assistant who I understand was in training but undertook some responsibility in the office
including balancing. Can this individual be contacted and spoken to as a witness. I
understand he is Mr Limair Liaquat. Clearly if it appears that he may have been involved in
any dishonesty then he will need to be cautioned prior to any personal questions being put to
him.

I note during the course of the interview that the office closed in February 2009. Were Post
Office Ltd aware of this closure and was it audited at any stage afterwards?

I understand that 400 sheets of stamps were missing during the course of the audit. Would
anyone working in the office readily know that they were missing or that there was a
discrepancy between the figures being declared and the actual physical stock that was
present?

The suspect appears to be saying the following:-

1 He did not undertake any balances.

2 He relied on old figures to populate the balance sheets.

3 He did not check any stock.
