Subject:RE: REGINA VSEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT TRIAL- 15TH MARC

01/03/2010 10:35
Jarnail,

Thanks for the information, which I've now read through.

I think I can summarise the situation as follows:

1. Ms Misera says initially identified that the sub post office was
short of cash by about £80 - £90K

2. She tried to cover this up while she repaid the loses which she
thought was due to staff theft

3. By the time of the audit in Jan 2008 she was £73K short suggesting
she had made good about £10K of the losses

4. When she went to court, she saw an article in Computer Weekly
indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the
bandwagon.

5. Note that there is no evidence to support any of the cases
referenced in the Computer Weekly articles and there is case law showing
the reliability of Horizon. (The case of Marine Drive which I think was
referred to in the Computer Weekly article.)

However I don't see how anything here changes the fact that she falsified
the accounts or that money was missing.
POL00058502

POL00058502

What I still don't understand is exactly what it is that the defence is

claiming in terms of where exactly Horizon might have "lost" this money
rather than her or her staff stealing it. Therefore unless we can get a

clear statement as to exactly what is being looked for and when the system

allegedly made mistakes, I don't think there is anything I can do. (I do
appreciate that it is up to the Prosecution to prove Horizon is reliable
rather than the defence to prove it isn't, but it is always difficult to

prove that there are no errors - particularly over such a long period of
time.)

Surely it is down to the Post Office investigators to get to the bottom of
exactly where there is anything in dispute. At that point I might be able

to assist with some technical knowledge to help interpret the various logs
to support such areas of dispute.

I'll leave Penny to continue the discussions she is currently having with
the Post Office investigators until there is something concrete for me to
investigate.

Regards

Gareth,
Thank you for your E-Mail of 1st March 2010.

I now enclose Defence Expert's 4th and 5th reports after his conversation with you of the 12th
February 2010. As izon Expert you need to telephone Charles McLachlan, his mobile
telephone number i: ito arrange a meeting where you can discuss all his reports and
his concerns about the Horizon so you can deal with it and rebut it which you have done in your long
telephone conversation about his various hypothesis and then write a detailed report which would go
to someway of progressing and concluding this matter and importantly preserving the Horizon system.

May be the simplest and practical way of dealing with this whole question is to find a shortest span of
logs, analyse it, disprove or rebut what the Defence Expert is saying in his reports.

Just a reminder you are an Expert for Fujitsu, you will be giving evidence in Court, the Judge and Jury
will be listening to you very carefully and a lot will hang on the evidence.

The way forward is for you to arrange an immediate meeting with the Defence Expert and conclude
this matter once and for all.

Kind regards.

We are clearly not going to be able to provide the response requested by
POL Legal at this late stage and within the requested timeframe.

In POL Legal's urgent note of 8 February (attached) relevant timeframes
were identified - we will commence retrieving those transaction records
which fall within the current formal request. If there is a preferred
order for the remainder of the formal request please revert and we will
conform.

Please note that all other prosecution support activity will cease until
this request has been filled.

Also, you should note that I am warned for Court tomorrow, Tuesday 2
March, in Bolton for the case relating to Fishpool, one of Helen

Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT TRIAL - 15TH MARCH

On Behalf Of

URGENT
David,
Thank you. I would be grateful if Mr Jenkins is asked the following:-

1 In relation to the Eleanor Nixon statement, the information we
received that although Maureen Lyme states she cannot remember specific
Offices she has stated that pre August 2005 Offices were using a
separate

system for debit / credit card transactions called Streamline. Offices
would put debit / credit cards through this system and produce a
receipt,

which could be keyed into the Horizon terminals.

Some Postmaster / Clerks would key in the information into Horizon as
cash,

instead of debit / credit cards resulting in a shortage in Offices. If
Post Offices contacted Chesterfield at the time any Branch discrepancies
were dealt with, and sorted out with the individual Post Offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect account produce and not
a

problem with the Horizon system. No information is available for any
Correction Notices pre August 2005. So the Nixon statement is unlikely
to

have any relevance for our present case of Misra.

2 The areas where Mr Jenkins says for POL to respond should be
deleted
from his statement.

Mr Jenkins needs to comment on the third interim report received from
the
Defence Expert.

The quality of training of SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins
POL00058502
POL00058502

expertise.
However I wonder if he might be prepared to comment on how it might be
possible to examine the Horizon data to investigate mistakes.

We are keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can
efficiently test their theories against the Horizon data. We do not
want

them to say that they will not have time before the Trial. we
anticipate

that it would not be very difficult to test their theories against a
short

but represented span of data example from the months when Mrs Misra has
admitted to false accounting. (15th November 2006 to 14th December
2006,

16th May 2007 to 16th June 2007, 14th November 2007 to 15th December
2007

and 9th January 2008. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider
practical and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test
their theories.

I also refer you to my E-Mail to you of Friday Sth February 2010 at
15.39
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

Thank you in anticipation of your help.

Kind regards.

Penny, we need a massive favour that I'm sure will cost us quite a few cream cakes.

Is there anything you can do to pull out the stops to provide what Jon is looking for within the
timescales. Maureen will provide the necessary paper work on Monday.

Thank you for considering this.

Jarnail has just telephoned me and asked me to get transaction log data for the above PO from 1st
December 2006 to 31st December 2007. The logs need to be ordered through our current process
and then given to Gareth Jenkins at Fujitsu to analyse and confirm by witness statement whether
there are any errors within the Horizon system for the transaction log period. Jarnail would like the
statement by Friday 5th March 2010.

Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010

Dear Ms Hogg,

I have heard from Gareth Jenkins who informed me that he had a 90 minute
lengthy discussion with your Expert Charles McLachlan as long ago as Friday
12th February 2010.

In the meantime I now enclose the replies to the third disclosure request.
However if any of the items you have requested have not been dealt with if
you can give a reason wanting that item then of course the prosecution will
consider those. As always I am continuously and constantly keeping the
disclosure under review.

THIRD DISCLOSURE REQUEST
1 That was the contract in the form it was served.

2 We are well aware of our statutory duty of disclosure as you know the
prosecution have reviewed a large volume of material. The only material
POL00058502

POL00058502
disclosable is Callender Place as we know Mr Jenkins is making full
investigations so the full position can be ascertained.
TRAINING
1 The training material is at West Byfleet Post Office. Presumably you

want simply an opportunity to inspect or view it on site.

2 We do not understand the relevance to dates to which your Client
received the documents. The real issue is did she steal the money or make
mistakes. This is an issue for the experts when they look at the Horizon
data.

3 See above.
4 —
5 The prosecution is under no obligation to provide witness statements.

You have full details of the witness and can contact him if you wish.

6(a) This statement is in the most useful format. The purpose of this
statement was to provide material in digestive form. Logs are impossible
to follow unless undertaken by an expert. We do not see the relevant calls
made prior to your Client's taking Office. We have provided the
information in the most useful form in the light of the data.

(b) The analysis data confirms that.
7(a) You have been provided with all available training material.
(b) What are the real issues in the case.

(c) Are we looking at the quality of the training but Mrs Misra made
mistakes which will be investigated by two experts. In fact the real issue
in this case, did she steal the money or deliberately attribute it to
mistakes by her and the training background is information only.

8 We believe we have complied with our disclosure obligation. Whether
any mistakes were made. Experts can examine them themselves.

9 We stand by our position. Our response is that there has been a
misunderstanding, there is no reason to put this in a statement form. If
it carries to trial it carries with it a risk that your expert and your
Miss Hogg will become witnesses in the case which is highly undesirable.
We suggest you re-consider.

10 We have already answered this request. There are no back up teams no
more than the Police Force investigating crime. Investigators consider all
reasonable explanations. Your Client did not give an explanation other than
other people were responsible. If your Client had made mistakes that will
be ascertained by two experts in their enquiries.

11 Costs is a consequence of Royal Mail contractual relationship with
Fujitsu. Our duty of disclosure is whether material which undermines the
prosecution case and supports your Client's defence. We hope if the
experts look at a short span of information ie the period where your Client
falsified her records as set out in our previous letter. We hope it will
not be necessary to examine records for 5 years. Your Client was inflating
figures over a long period. If this were as a result of mistakes over an
extended period we think analysis over shorter period of falsifying
accounting offences by your Client did not appear to remedy large loss.
There appears to be a long standing pattern of discrepancies which would
appear in a short period as it would be on the long extended period. If
mistakes are found in a short span of data the Crown will obviously review
its position as to acceptability of your Client's plea.
POL00058502

POL00058502
(b) Our disclosure obligation do not require us to justify why data for a
5 year period is so expensive.
12 We anticipate the areas are for the experts to discuss.
13 The audit was not completed.
14, 15 We have disclosed all information in our possession. We are

not required to serve witness statements. It is clear that Steamline has
no relevance.

16 We are not prepared to make any promise in relation to criminal or
civil action. The issue is whether problems referred to was happening at
Byfleet is something for the experts to examine.

17 ‘The equipment is being updated. The original equipment is preserved
after updating has occurred.

18 Prosecution Counsel has reviewed the case of Hosi. There is no
material that requires disclosure.

19 Please refer to our answer to paragraph 8. Prosecution Counsel has
reviewed all material. We are still investigating Callender Place. We
recognise our duty of disclosure is a continuing one.

20 We repeat our answer in respect of Callender Place.

1 Review of evidence available as of 12" February 2010

Introduction

This report has been updated to reflect the witness statements provided by Gareth
Jenkins and the telephone interview conducted with him on 12" February 2010.
Gareth Jenkins was asked to comment on the West Byfleet and the requests in
relation to Callender Place, Falkirk for the first time in the week commencing 1*
February 2010.

1.1 Hypothesis: The User Interface gives rise to incorrect data entry

1.1.1 Source of problem ~ training and support: full and complete training
materials and training records have yet to be provided. In addition a log
of calls and response to the NBSC would provide further evidence as to the
understanding of the users at the West Byfleet branch.

Additionally: Gareth Jenkins during a telephone interview conducted on 12"
February confirmed his response in the witness statement dated. 2" February
relating to my 2" interim report at 2.1.3.10 “It is the responsibility of the
clerk to ensure that the Debit Card payment was successfully authorised by
the MA and to check the response received. Should they not do so and
assume it was processed and touch “Fast Cash” to clear the basket without
looking at the screen, then indeed the system might record a Cash
Transaction. (bold added).

1.1.2 Source of problem — user interface: there has not been an opportunity to
conduct a usability review to date; in addition, the logs included in Andy
Dunk 2" witness statement refer to problems with the touch screen which
require the screen to be calibrated. It has not been possible to test whether
this could give rise to incorrectly captured user actions.

Additionally: Gareth Jenkins during a telephone interview conducted on 12
February confirmed that if the touch screen requires calibration it is possible
that the user could touch the screen to activate one button and a different
button would be activated. Gareth Jenkins asserted that the size of the buttons

makes such an event unlikely.

1.2 Hypothesis: The Horizon system fails to properly process transactions

Charles McLachlan 1

1.2.1

1.2.2

On instruction of Coomber Rich Solicitors
Yard House, Basingstoke, RG21 7NX

Source of problem — End to end EPOSS transaction flow: the equipment
failure user guide provided identifies at subsection 14 a process for
identifying lost EPOSS transactions. The implication is that EPOSS
transactions can be lost due to equipment failures. Without access to the
sub post office data records and the intermediate data records in the end
to end process it will not be possible to identify the extent to which this may
explain the accounting discrepancies.
Additionally: Gareth Jenkins, during a telephone interview conducted on 12"
February confirmed: that copies for the sub post office data records are
maintained by means of an message audit log for 7 years in the Fujitsu data
archive; that no request has been received by Fujitsu for any of the records
relating to West Byfleet; that such requests are routine and a Fujitsu employee
is engaged full-time in servicing such requests; that Fujitsu have an established
process for delivering the messages in the audit log into a readily interpretable
form accessible in an Excel spreadsheet. Further, Gareth Jenkins explained
that Fujitsu use an ORACLE database to load the messages and output both
consolidated branch data at the stock item level and raw data at the transaction
level that is sent to the Post Office Limited SAP accounting system and MIS
systems respectively. He explained that one of the functions of the SAP
system is to identify transaction errors. Gareth Jenkins advised that the Post
Office Product Branch Accounting department would be best placed to
comment on transaction corrections and ‘rems’ (remittances of stock to or from

branches).

Source of problem — Poor integration: the helpdesk reports provided in Andy
Dunks 2™ statement identify a series of problems with the network, printer
and the pin terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give
rise to inconsistent data capture and transmission at the sub post office.

Additionally: Gareth Jenkins confirmed, in a telephone interview conducted
on 12" February, that if the printer failed to produce a readable document
because of ink or cylinder problems, then branch terminal would consider the
document to have been printed and if the operator acknowledged the printing
without examining the receipt then it was possible that the receipt could be a
“decline” or “refer” document for a card transaction which the operator then

over looked. Consistent use of the [Fast Cash] button to clear the stack would

Yard House, Basingstoke, RG21 7NX

then result in the declined card transaction being treated as a cash receipt. It

is noted that such problems were reported in Andy Dunks 2" statement.

Source of problem - systems issues causing incomplete/inconsistent
processing of transactions between sub post office and central systems: the
reports provided in Andy Dunks 2" statement identify a number of cases in
which the user was required to ‘re-boot’ the terminal. It has not been
possible to test whether this could give rise to inconsistent data records in the
sub post office.
Additionally: Gareth Jenkins asserted, in a telephone interview conducted on
12 February, that the treatment of messages would always ensure that there
was a matching set of credit and debit transactions maintained both at the
branch and centrally. However, he pointed out that the replication between the
branch and the centre relied on a 35 day retry cycle and, in the event of a flood
or other prolonged break down in branch access, inconsistencies between the
branch records and the central records could arise and would then have to be
resolved manually. Further, he explained that the audit log archive maintained
by Fujitsu would record when a terminal ‘re-boot’ occurred and it would be
possible to determine if this had given rise to any pattern of transaction

discrepancies.

Hypothesis: Errors in operator data entry are not properly reconciled by
the Post Office finance function or by the Horizon system: without access
to the system files it is not possible to determine whether this is the case.

Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of EPOSS transactions end to end:
without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine
whether this is the case.

Additionally: Gareth Jenkins, in a telephone interview conducted on 12”
February, explained that these reconciliation processes are conducted by the
Post Office Product Branch Accounting function and the system data files
would have to be provided by this function. Fujitsu are not aware of any

request to provide this information.

1.3.2. Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of other transactions end to end:

without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine
whether this is the case.

accounting and the sub postmaster is.
prepared to permit electronic
observation of the use of the Horizon
system. The use of a camera or

the report dated 19th November 2009.
Ithas not been possible to conduct
electronic observation of the use of the
Horizon system at the identified post
office because the Post Office has not
released the sub postmaster from their

and the Post Office has not facilitated
any arrangements to install the
