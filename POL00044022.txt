Dear Steve,

R v Sefton & Nield
Liverpool Crown Court
Trial Week Commencing 15' April 2013

Please see enclosed letter from defence. I appreciate you have trawled the helpline log for
2005, but the defence are now suggesting that an audit was carried out as a result of the
supposed losses incurred in 2005.

Is there any other way of confirming that an audit was conducted in 2005 at the office and
if so the reason why the audit was raised and the results of this audit if any?

Solicitor
