Penny,

We discussed this event when it occurred while CABSProcess was running (at 7pm) but we didn't explain why it might be seen at
other times - and if you were ever questioned about it, it might confuse you.

Basically it happens when one process has locked the messagestore (usually only very briefly) and another process tries to
access the messagestore at precisely the same time.

The worst offender for doing the locking is CABSProcess, but it can happen at other times too.

Whether it causes a problem or not depends on a) what the second process is trying to do and b) whether that process handles
the error situation in a sensible way.

All the checks we have made have shown that, in the vast majority of cases, what is being done has no financial impact and
doesn't affect the integrity of the system in any way, and/or the error situation is handled sensibly.

So when I check these ARQs you are sending over,

* first I try to identify the two processes involved

* then I assess whether the second process could conceivably have failed to handle the situation, and if so would it have
any financial or operational impact

Hope this isn't too much information.

Anne
