Changes to the plan &

* Legal activities have been added for the QC to advise POL on strategy and
process for reviewing past/current criminal prosecutions given the findings of
the Second Sight interim report dated

« Improvements project plan has been restructured to reflect an end to end
approach rather than an analysis per sub group

¢ Communication plan still needs more detail.

Risks Ce

A risk workshop is scheduled for 15" August. At the workshop we will
identity the key risks, their potential impact and mitigation plans. They
will be tracked each week at the weekly steering board.

Below are the risks highlighted in the board paper 26" July 2013:

the reputational and brand risks that could emerge if we don’t handle the overall
resolution process carefully;

*the risk to NTP if concerns around how we treat sub-postmasters leads to lower take-up
of the new models;

* the opportunity cost arising from the significant amount of senior management time that
will be taken up in handling this process;

* the potential destabilising impact on the NFSP, who are feeling exposed to the whole
issue because of accusations from some sup-postmasters that they failed to represent
their interests; and

* the process re-engineering that may be required for our IT, training and support
systems will add further complexity and risk to the existing transformation programme.
