                    POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY



           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RUTH SIMPSON




1. This statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and relates

   to the RULE 9 request dated 5th May 2023, which relates to my experience at

   Marine Drive Post Office and my involvement in the litigation against Lee

   Castleton. At that time, I was responsible as a Sub-Postmistress for the Post

   Office, at First Lane, Hessle.



2_ l confirm that I gave a statement on the 19th of October 2006 and attended at

   Court, as a witness, in proceedings to which that statement related, I gave

   evidence on behalf of the ost Office [LCAS0000121].




3. I confirm I have had the opportunity to consider the statement I made once

   again, and I confirm the content is a true account of my recollection, of the

   experience I had at Marine Drive Post Office. My recollection is limited to the
                                    •

   Yorkshire Bank PLC, progressing to the bank branch manager, a role I

   remained in for 23 years. In 1999 I left the Yorkshire bank to be a Sub-

   Postmistress for the Post Office. From the year 1999 to 2015, I worked as the

   Sub-Postmistress, at First Lane Post Office, in Hessle, until my retirement in

   2015.



6. During the year 2004, I was asked by a lady called Cath Oglesby, who was my

   then line manager at the Post Office, to stand in as Sub-Postmistress, at Marine

   Drive Post Office, following the suspension of the Postmaster there, Lee

   Castleton. I was informed that the suspension was due to the discovery of

   unauthorised losses.



7. I therefore ran the Marine Drive Post Office, between 23rd March 2004 and 21st

   April 2004. Cath Oglesby was my line manager before this date and with whom

   I had a good working relationship. Cath Oglesby remained my line manager

   during the time at Marine Drive Post Office. I am unable to recall the frequency

   of my communication with Cath Oglesby, before or during my time at Marine

   Drive Post Office, due to the passage of time. I believe I would have provided

   regular updates given the circumstances.



8. In relation to the eekl balances at the Post Office, whilst I was there, I can

   only comment om the information in        y statement made 19th October 2006,

   which I refer to, as I have no further recollection. I can see that:

   Wednesday the 31st of March 2004 there was a shortage of £101.95.

   Wednesday 8th April 2004 a surplus of £19.38
                                                                                    WITNO9400100
                                                                                 W ITN09400100




   Wednesday 14th April 2004 shortage of £10.76

   Wednesday 21st April 2004 surplus £0.02



9. From my recollection, I do not think that I would have been concerned by any

   of the differences, shortages or surplus. I can say this, as whilst I was a Sub-

   Postmistress, in broad terms, I used to consider a balance of less than £20

   either way, acceptable, given the volumes of cash and transactions.



10.1 cannot add anything further regarding the Horizon IT system that was in place

   at the Marine Drive Post Office, to that, that is within my original statement made

   19th October 2006. Specifically, in relation to the lottery error notices, I do not

   recall any issues with Horizon. In relation to the shortage of £101.95, my

   understanding and recollection is that this was pinpointed to the Monday of that

   week and attributed to human error. I cannot remember anything further

   regarding the computer IT freeze and reboot of the screen, than what is in my

   original statement of 19th   ctober 2006. 1 do not recall any further investigation

   regarding these issues.

      p. [POL00073768] — Email from Stephen Dilley to Mandy Talbot on 12

         January 2007 outlining the hearing on 11 January 2007.



12.1 cannot remember the details of any of the conversations that took place

   between myself and Mr Dilley. I do recall that I never met Mr. Dilley in person,

   our communication was via email and telephone.


13.1 do not recall being made aware of anything about Mr Lee Castleton's case,

   other than I was asked to give evidence regarding my time at Marina Drive Post

   Office and the experience I had there.



14. In relation to software updates to the computers at Marine Drive Post Office



   what is in my original statement [LCAS0000121]. I cannot therefore comment




   do not know the date of this second hearing. I cannot recall the specific reason

   or issues raised on this occasion, due to the passage of time. I simply remember

   attending twice.


1 . 1 recall being notified (at the relevant time) of the outcome of the case

   [POL00004325]. I refer to the correspondence [POL000988 2 . I had attended

   as a witness, to give evidence of my time at Marina Drive Post Office, I therefore

       did not have any personal interest in the case or view upon it. I therefore cannot

       say if I was surprised by the outcome of the case, l attended as a witness, as I

       had been asked to and given a statement, I was then asked to give evidence

       about what I had experienced, as a Sub-postmistress during my time at Marina

       Drive Post Office.


   17. I cannot add cn ° h is further to the on in .i statement I rnde on 19th October
