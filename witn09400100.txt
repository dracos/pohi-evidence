POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

|, RUTH SIMPSON, will say as follows...

1. This statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and relates
to the RULE 9 request dated 5th May 2023, which relates to my experience at
Marine Drive Post Office and my involvement in the litigation against Lee
Castleton. At that time, | was responsible as a Sub-Postmistress for the Post

Office, at First Lane, Hessle.

3. | confirm | have had the opportunity to consider the statement | made once
again, and | confirm the content is a true account of my recollection, of the

experience | had at Marine Drive Post Office. My recollection is limited to the

content of that statement and the documents provided to me by this inquiry, as
it relates to an experience | had in 2004 which is now 19 years ago. | confirm
that that in drafting this statement | sought legal advice and assistance from

Elizabeth Rowley, a solicitor at Andrew Jackson LLP.

5. My career has been over a period of 39 years. In 1976, | started work at

Page 2 of 14
WITN09400100
WITNO9400100

Yorkshire Bank PLC, progressing to the bank branch manager, a role |
remained in for 23 years. In 1999 | left the Yorkshire bank to be a Sub-
Postmistress for the Post Office. From the year 1999 to 2015, | worked as the
Sub-Postmistress, at First Lane Post Office, in Hessle, until my retirement in

2015.

. During the year 2004, | was asked by a lady called Cath Oglesby, who was my
then line manager at the Post Office, to stand in as Sub-Postmistress, at Marine
Drive Post Office, following the suspension of the Postmaster there, Lee
Castleton. | was informed that the suspension was due to the discovery of

unauthorised losses.

. [therefore ran the Marine Drive Post Office, between 23rd March 2004 and 21st
April 2004. Cath Oglesby was my line manager before this date and with whom
| had a good working relationship. Cath Oglesby remained my line manager
during the time at Marine Drive Post Office. | am unable to recall the frequency
of my communication with Cath Oglesby, before or during my time at Marine
Drive Post Office, due to the passage of time. | believe | would have provided

regular updates given the circumstances.

. In relation to the weekly balances at the Post Office, whilst | was there, | can
only comment from the information in my statement made 19th October 2006,
which | refer to, as | have no further recollection. | can see that:

Wednesday the 31st of March 2004 there was a shortage of £101.95.

Wednesday 8th April 2004 a surplus of £19.38

Page 3 of 11
WITN09400100
WITNO9400100

Wednesday 14th April 2004 shortage of £10.76

Wednesday 21st April 2004 surplus £0.02

9. From my recollection, | do not think that | would have been concerned by any
of the differences, shortages or surplus. | can say this, as whilst | was a Sub-
Postmistress, in broad terms, | used to consider a balance of less than £20

either way, acceptable, given the volumes of cash and transactions.

10.1 cannot add anything further regarding the Horizon IT system that was in place
at the Marine Drive Post Office, to that, that is within my original statement made
19th October 2006. Specifically, in relation to the lottery error notices, | do not
recall any issues with Horizon. In relation to the shortage of £101.95, my
understanding and recollection is that this was pinpointed to the Monday of that
week and attributed to human error. | cannot remember anything further
regarding the computer IT freeze and reboot of the screen, than what is in my
original statement of 19th October 2006. | do not recall any further investigation

regarding these issues.

11.1 confirm | was contacted by a solicitor, Stephen Dilley, on behalf of the Post
Office, and he asked me to be a witness for the Post Office, regarding my time
at Marina Drive Post Office. This was in the case against Mr Lee Castleton. |
have considered all the correspondence | had with Mr Stephen Dilley:

Pearce LLP on 22 August 2006;

Post Office witness at trial; and
p. [POL00073768] — Email from Stephen Dilley to Mandy Talbot on 12

January 2007 outlining the hearing on 11 January 2007.

12.1 cannot remember the details of any of the conversations that took place
between myself and Mr Dilley. | do recall that | never met Mr. Dilley in person,

our communication was via email and telephone.

13.1 do not recall being made aware of anything about Mr Lee Castleton's case,
other than | was asked to give evidence regarding my time at Marina Drive Post

Office and the experience | had there.

14.In relation to software updates to the computers at Marine Drive Post Office
and the Tivoli log during my time there, | have no recollection of this other than
what is in my original statement [LCAS0000121]. | cannot therefore comment

as to any relevance or effect of either of these now.

15.1 do recollect attending at Court on a second occasion and giving evidence. |
do not know the date of this second hearing. | cannot recall the specific reason
or issues raised on this occasion, due to the passage of time. | simply remember

attending twice.

16. | recall being notified (at the relevant time) of the outcome of the case
[POL00004328]. | refer to the correspondence [POL00098862]. | had attended

as a witness, to give evidence of my time at Marina Drive Post Office, | therefore

Page 6 of 14
WITNO09400100
WITNO9400100

did not have any personal interest in the case or view upon it. | therefore cannot
say if | was surprised by the outcome of the case. | attended as a witness, as |
had been asked to and given a statement, | was then asked to give evidence
about what | had experienced, as a Sub-postmistress during my time at Marina

Drive Post Office.

17. | cannot add anything further to the original statement | made on 19th October
2006 or the documents | have been provided with, as | have little recollection
due to the passage of time. My reflections upon the case and of my involvement

are therefore also limited.

STATEMENT OF TRUTH

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
