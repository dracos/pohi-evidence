Date of Incident Time of Service Outage Time Service Restored
8" February 2006 08:50 10:42

Service Impacted Debit Card & ETU service experienced 100% transaction timeouts across
the whole Post Office Limited infrastructure.

Scale of Impact: 100% loss of service for DCS and ETU was identified at 08:50 through the
systems management toolset.

Investigation by the SSC (3” line support) and development team immediately took place and
service impact was identified as being due to ‘Cryapi’ key having expired.

A new key was applied to the affected servers in the Bootle data centre and full operational
service was restored by 10:42 with both services running successfully through the Bootle data
centre.

A decision was made upon the advice of our technical experts, that the new key will be applied to
affected servers in the Wigan data centre through a controlled change process this evening.

What happened?

At 08:50 events were seen on Tivoli. The message, stated “cryapi key expired” for “key
44_3243_60119_10002”. SSC and SMC began investigations and a PINICL PC0131994 was logged.

At 09:03 it was reported that calls began to come into the HSD, and the POA Duty Manager was
alerted. Immediately following this, further calls between the POA DM, SSC and SMC established
that there was a 100% loss of transactions on DCS and ETU.

The SSC and development team were immediately diagnosing the problem and continued working in
the background until a replacement key was ultimately created and successfully implemented to
restore the service.

At 09:14 management escalation commenced throughout both POL and POA.

At 09:50 a technical bridge was invoked. This confirmed that the security key had expired. A
resolution plan was confirmed in the 10:15 technical bridge.

At 10:45 it was confirmed that DCS and ETU services had returned to service at 10:42. This was
following the updating of the security key at Bootle. The application of the same security key at Wigan
is scheduled for 18:00.

The full impact of this incident is that between 08:50 and 10:42 there were a total of 23819 DCS and
31464 ETU transaction failures. It should be noted that numerous retries are typically attempted in
such a situation.

The following shows the number of transactions experienced over the last four Wednesdays. Please
note that there is typically an increased volume of transactions at the end/start of the month:

01/02/2006 DCS 16080 ETU 18476
25/01/2006 8971 17973
18/01/2006 7948 17852
11/01/2006 7583 16841

The comparison suggests several attempted transaction retries.

The transaction comparison between 08:00 and 16:00 for the last 4 Wednesdays is recorded as
follows to indicate the expected transactions for the day:

01/02/2006 + DCS 115410 ETU 53555
25/01/2006 76829 ETU 50896
18/01/2006 67542 ETU 50644
11/01/2006 64956 ETU 49177

By comparison on 08/02/2006 the totals from 08:00 to 16:00 were as follows:

The existing (TK) key expired at approximately 02:00 today and the SSC alert system highlighted and
reported this just before 09:00. As a result of this alert, a search was carried out and the key
identified. The key was ultimately passed to the key custodian in the data centers who in turn installed
the new key via a re-boot of the servers. This was completed at approximately 10:45.

The process of TK renewal is as follows:

The KMA automatically generates a task notifying the requirement for a key replacement on the KMA
workstation, stating that the new key needs extracting from the system. The key extraction is a
manual process carried out by the Key Manager and involves extracting the new key on to a floppy
disk that is in turn copied on to the appropriate server at Wigan & Bootle.

This task generated, is of one line and can vary in amount per day from as little as 10 tasks to as
many as 200. They are often different tasks generated by the KMA on the Task list, and all but 1 or 2
of these tasks that are generated, are due to pre CSR+ activities and can be ignored. On a daily basis
the Key manager identifies any that require attention and deletes the rest. Once these tasks have
been removed they are unrecoverable and the only record is that "a task" was generated. No details
are available. There is also no record of tasks generated or sent to the KMA.

Without conformation of receipt of this task, it can be presumed that there is a possibility that the task
may have been inadvertently deleted.

The task is the only form of notification given to the key manager that the key is going to expire in the
