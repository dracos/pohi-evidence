Susan

Thanks for this. I'm slightly reluctant to include wording that requires confirmation from the MP back to Jo.
I've tweaked it slightly to make it an opt out. I need to submit the draft before five. If possible can you check
the tweaks and let me know if you are happy with this wording?

Kind regards
Peter

Peter - thanks for this just a couple of points, which I have inserted in red

I recognise that there may still be cases where subpostmasters wish to put their
circumstances forward for review. Post Office Ltd is continuing to work closely with the
JFSA, Second Sight, and James Arbuthnot MP to put in place a working group that will
provide current and former sub postmasters with a process where they can present their case
for investigation by Second Sight, and mediation overseen by the parties of the working
group.

Details of this working group and the process whereby subpostmasters can put their cases

forward for investigation are still being finalised between Post Office Ltd, the JFSA and
Second Sight. Please ensure your constituent is happy for their details to be passed to Post
Office Ltd as I shall ask that they contact you and your constituent directly once the
necessary processes have been finalised and are in place."

Hi Susan
Thanks for this. The branches and names (where they have been identified) are below:

Navenby Post Office (Paul Sanderson) [Stephen Phillips MP]

Kings Road Post Office, Brentwood

North Cornelly Post Office (Philip Dauncey) [Huw Irranca-Davies MP]
Pontycymmer Post Office (Dixie Davies) [Huw Irranca-Davies MP]
Bishopton Post Office (David Woodrow) [sent direct]

Worstead Post Office (Allison Henderson) [Norman Lamb MP]

lam required by private office to submit replies to these in the very near future and wanted to run
some proposed wording past you to make sure you were comfortable with it:

"I recognise that there may still be cases where subpostmasters wish to put their
circumstances forward for review. Post Office Ltd is continuing to work closely with the
JFSA, Second Sight, and James Arbuthnot MP to put in place a working group that will

group.

Details of this working group and the process whereby subpostmasters can put themselves
forward for investigation are still being finalised between Post Office Ltd, the JFSA and
Second Sight. I have passed your details and those of your constituents to Post Office Ltd
and asked that they contact you directly once the necessary processes have been finalised
and are in place."

Could you let me have any views on this wording as soon as possible please.

On the draft paper, from a quick read it looks very good. I had a couple of initial thoughts which I'll
send through separately.

Very many thanks

Peter - I have attached the latest draft to this email, this draft was created following two meetings with
the JFSA and SS, and sets out the process we have agreed. We have sent it to them and are waiting for
their feedback. The process map is near the front of the pack.

Can you let me know which are the sub postmasters and the MPs so we can check whether we already
have them on the list.

Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks

When we met at the end of last month you mentioned that there was now a process in place
agreed with the JFSA to handle new cases relating to the Horizon system. We have received a
few more letters from MPs that I need to reply to quickly - could you please send me details of
the workflow?

Many thanks
