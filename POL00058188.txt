Susan: The letter is fine and yes, that is the right name (Kay Linnell}. We are making progress but now need more {much
more) data and an updated list of cases that will comprise the sample. lan is contacting Janet Walker re the latter. As
yet we have only NINE cases confirmed from Janet (Caroline JACK; Gareth & Tracy ETHERIDGE; Kevin BARRON; Jenny

CY DELL; Jo HAMILTON; John DICKSON; Terence WALTERS; Tim BRENTNALL; and Tracey Ann MERRITT). Janet did show,
on her latest spreadsheet, a further THREE cases that are “Awaiting” {presumably where she is waiting for confirmation,
from the SPM and the constituent’s MP, approval to submit the case to us for inclusion in the sample). Also (of course)
we as yet have no cases submitted by the JFSA. Ido have some matters that I'd like to discuss with you on the Caroline
JACK case when you have a moment.

Many thanks Ron.

Ron — Janet has asked for a letter from POL re the independent forensic accountant review. This was what I was
proposing to send does it reflect what you think has been agreed and is the name of the accountant correct?

Also how are you doing, have you managed to make any progress?
Thanks

Susan

Dear Mr Arbuthnot

This letter is to confirm that Post Office Limited have budgeted a sun of £5000 to pay for an independent forensic
accountant to review the 2™ sight investigations on behalf of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance. Payment will be
made on receipt of invoices from the independent forensic account and I believe that Kay Linnell has agreed to act in
this capacity.!
