the office and the transactions undertaken in that particular week.
11.00 Is Yes
DM What is your procedure in your contract for dealing with losses and
gains
Is I have to cover the losses and gains
DM Ok so lets just say that you have a £50 over what would you do, what
would your contract say you can do with the £50
Js We usually do, if it was over we would put itin a bag and it would stay in
the safe. If we get an error notice back it would be cleared with it.
DM So you would remove that money from the till
Is Yes
DM Again what if it was a similar amount short
JS Then if the money was there to put back we would use the money that
was over if is is a large amount I would have to put it back myself witha
cheque.
DM So you would make your losses good
Js Yes
DM And you can remove any gains as per your contract

accurate account of the conversation.

15.28 DM So the audit took place and the result was an overall shortage of
£59,175.39. The breakdown of that is the cash element £58,942.41
short. The stock was £292.27 short and your postage was a surplus of
£59.29. Giving an overall shortage of £59,175.39. Are you happy with

that

Js No im not happy at all.

DM Do you accept that that is probably, I don’t know if that was the figure
that you were expecting

Is Nol wernt

DM You have indicated £40,000

Js Its just been going up and up and up for the past 5 months.

DM When was your last audit at North Bransholme

Js When I took it over

DM May 2004

Js Yes

16.41 DM Do you want to give us your account of why there is over £59,000 short

in your account.

Is If I had the answer I would give you it but I haven't. It started of £7,500
and its just basically gone up and to be honest I just thought that
whoever was taking it would be putting it back. I mean I can prove to
you, im here because I want to prove that {am innocent. If you want to
search my house you can, if you want to search my banks you can. I
have nothing to hide what so ever, I am nota thief.

DM When you said you had a shortage of £7,500 when was that
Js Back in January this year

shortage of £7,500, did you complete the balance that night
17.43 Is Yes

DM Does your office have individual stock units

Is It did we were running on individual stock units up until June last year.
That was because one of the women went on sick and it was mainly
because of that person that we were on individual stock units because
their stock unit was always, well, the balancing was always really bad it
was sometimes over £100 and we had customers coming back saying
she had short changed them of £100 and in one week we had 3
customers saying that she had short changed them off £100.

DM And who was this

Is Katherine Ayres. So that’s why it went onto individual to start with. But
when she went on sick basically there was only me and Colleen Kates
and Theresa Holmes. Theresa went on holiday for 2 weeks, Katherine
went on sick so it only left me and Colleen so it was just impossible to
keep it on individual. Which is why we moved

DM OK so in January we have got this £7,500 loss. Just try and recap as
much as you can to what happened when you balanced and you found
that shortage.

18.18 Js Iwas in the early hours the next morning and I didn't roll over that night,
I went in the next morning and rechecked everything, got everything
rechecked and it was still the same

DM And who was in that week

Is Me, Theresa, Wendy and Katherine
DM So she was back off sick leave

Is Yes

19.20 Is She came back in December but her unit was always short anyway
DM Right what do the staff have to make good their own losses
Is Yes unless they have balanced under and ive balanced over then we

would give it because it could have been something that had been
passed wrong but everything that was given to them and everything
that was given to me was checked by me or by them. But her stock unit

was wrong anyway.

DM So this £7,500 what stock unit was it in

us It was showing up in AA because that's the main stock unit we were all
using then.

DM Right so it was a shared stock and everyone was using AA.

Is Yes

DM What was the shortage in

Is Cash

DM And what did you do

20.14 Is I just made the cash look like it was correct

DM And how did you do that

IS Just by making it as if it was there but it wasn’t and then had a word
with one of the girls I worked with and she went off sick

DM Who was that

Is Colleen Kates

JS goes on to explain that this was a planned absence to have a

JS explained to Colleen there was a loss but not the

amount.
DM So you made your cash look like you had £7,500 more

21.12 Is No
DM Did you add it onto £50 or muts
Is No not £50's because there is only a couple of times we have had a large
amount of £50’s and ive remmed them back anyway.
SB Did you inflate it by just the full amount in one denomination or did
you spread it amongst denominations
Ms Well I just spreaded it between £10 and £20
DM Why did you do that instead of showing the loss
Is Because it was a £7,500 loss and it’s not something im in a position to

make right and to be fair and I know it sounds stupid and ive never been
in that position before never.
JS explains that her first few weeks at Bodmin Road were terrible with

big losses.
DM With this £7,500 what benefit is it to hide it rather than show it
Js I thought that whoever was taking it was putting it back.
SB Why would you think that
DM Because ive never been in that position before. Ive never ever had a

balance show a large amount of money and the only physical way that
sort of money could of not been there is if it has been removed from

there.
SB But if somebody stolen £7,500, why would they put it back.
Is I don't know
SB Why would you think that they were going to put it back.
IS I don’t know stupidity, I really don’t know. I wish I did know
DM What made you think that somebody had taken it as opposed to a

mistake being made

JS Because that amount of money just doesn’t go missing.

23.12 DM Did you phone anyone up

Js No

DM So if you have not been in that position before why didn’t you phone
and get advice

JIS Beacause all I could think of was if I was having to pay, because of the
fact that I have to cover the shortages and the gains I were the one who
has to be responsible for it.

DM But by adding it onto your cash when it wasn’t there, do you think that
was responsible.

Is No

DM Did you know it was wrong to do that

JS Yeah its defrauding isn't it

DM Its falsifying an accounting document and falsifying what is in the office
after you have already said the reason for the balance

SB Did you know it was a criminal offence to falsify your accounts.

Is Yes like ive said it sounds daft really. It's a large amount of money and!
hope it gets found. I can be investigated in any way and I have nothing
to hide.

Discussion takes place to decide when office went into branch trading

DM So the next week what happened at the balance

Js It was the same short again

DM And what did you do with the cash

3s I falsified it on again

SB You say by the same what do you mean the same. How much was it out
the following week.

Is £9,500

SB So it wasn't the same then was it

25.25 Js No
DM It was an extra £2,000
SB Gone up by another £2,000
Is It just kept going up
SB OK lets take it in stages. You have just had your first loss of £7,500 in

the January and the following week it's gone up to £9,500 so £7,500 is
the previous loss so your have rolled that loss forward and you have
ended up with another £2,000 loss

Js Yes

SB Just to go back to what you said a few minutes ago that when the
£7,500 went missing you thought whoever was taking it would put it
back so now you have got within a week you have 2 instances where
£7,500 went and then another £2,00 gone

Is Yes

SB What did you think then that the person was going to put that back

Js To be honest really I have just, yeah I did. lve never been in this

SB Somebody with 10 years experience, you may not of come across losses

as high as that each and every week but you have certainly as you said
you had one for £800. Did that person put it back or have they stolen it

from you.
SB recaps on JS experience
SB What staff was in the 2™ week
Is The same
SB So you have the same staff and 2 instances. What was said to the staff
27.30 Is Just to keep their eyes open really because mistakes were being made

27.41 Js They just said they would. I said that shortages were going by and they

just needed to be careful of what they were doing and to keep their
eyes and ears open basically

SB So do you believe the shortages have occurred by the staff being
incompetent and handing it out to customers

IS I would say its been confident its not been handed out to customers
because there have many times that customers have come back and
they have been short changed so if it was being handed out they
wouldn't come back and say they have been short changed.
Discussion about the customers returning to complain takes place.

SB When you were on individual stock units, how was the balancing within
the office
29.24 Is Quite good actually. It was up and down but it was usually in Theresa or

ours that she had given me something back or we had not given her it

hack.
SB So why in January did you not go back to individual balancing
Is Because I was short staffed at the time
SB Well short staffed just means you use less stocks less units out doesn't it
Is Yes I know
SB it makes no odds you have one staff or 51 staff it depends if you room

to have 51 individual stock units at least then you would know where
these losses occurred if someone from behind the counter

Is There has been an incident a few weeks back ive gone in on Sat
afternoon. Ive basically gone in to do to sort the popos out because I
was having a week off and I checked the draws before I left and there
was money stuffed in a draw underneath a card

SB Could you trace that back to someone

30.32 Is Who had been there was Katherine and Wendy
SB And who was in charge when you were off
3s Colleen, but she came back from being off sick on the Friday came to

work on the Monday and then she was only there that week then off on

holiday.
DM Who has keys for your office
JS I have them on a Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday, Katherine always

has a set as she is listed as a key holder as she lives 2 minutes across the
road. The other set goes between Theresa and Wendy.

DM When you said Katherine has a set of keys, does she have the safe keys

Js Yes and door keys

DM So if you suspected Katherine of taking this money, why did you let her
have keys

Js Because she was literally 2 minutes across the road

DM But if she is taking the money, that your going to have to be responsible

for, why let her have a set of safe keys

JS When Colleen carne back for the week that I was off, Colleen refused to
let her have any keys because, I don’t know why but she is not having
the keys.

SB Your in charge, you have got one member of staff saying she is not
letting another member of staff have keys. If this member of staff is the
one you suspect of pinching the money of you but you still as Diane
said to you, you still insist on giving her a set of keys and basically the

run of the office.
1s Yeah
SB Its like letting a kid loose in a sweet factory isn't it

up getting there late and that’s the reason why ive always let her have
the keys. She always had the keys before I went there
32.32 SB What time do you normally get in
Is lam meant to be there at 8.15 but I don't normally start till 8.30 by the
time I get there
SB So its only 15 minutes. What time does the office open
IS 8.30
SB What time does Katherine get in
JS One morning she was there at 8.10 and another it didn’t open till 9.
SB Why not change your hours, put it forward or leave the house earlier.
Why do you suspect Katherine
33.15 Js She has been, when I first took the office as manager when I took it off
Caroline Rand the first thing I was ever told was to watch her because
she is not to be trusted. For what reasons I don't know. I know she was
investigated whilst working for United News I know it was to do with
money but I don’t know what for. She was Cleared and reinstated but it
is basically what people have said just don't trust her, she cant be
trusted. She doesn't really divulge anything about her life but a few
months ago her son came to the office and he was absolutely off his
face, I said to her the next day your lad was in her yesterday and he was

35.05 JS No
DM Does she have some sort of hold over you
Is No
DM You have got to see it from our point of view. When you first went there

you were told don't trust her she has been investigated

Is Everything was fine

Discussion took place on individual stocks and the losses that customers
were returning to the office saying they were short changed.

Js Her stock unit (KA) was down by £1400, customers kept coming back,
to be fair it was customers you get to know them, you know who they
are and you know who would and who wouldn't lie and you can tell and
one of them was a disabled person who came back and said she had
shortchanged them by £100. I wouldn't say go ahead Katherine pay
them back its quite alright

SB {understand that. The shortchanging the customers by £100 anid its
happened on a few occasions. To shortchange a customer by £100 is an
awful lot

Js Yesitis

SB Beacause counting the money out in front, the customers arnt soft

when your counting out in front. But you have still allowed her

1S No cos what I do is I print of a transaction log, I print of what that
customer has taken out I pri nt off what they paid and they give me
what they have got

SB But you didn't do a cash declaration and check what cash she should
have in her draw.

Is No

SB Also, after she had shortchanged the first customer, what did you say to

is an awful lot

Js Yes I do, it is an awful lot of money, I don’t like to shortchange
customers

DM DM clarifies that the north bransholme was on branch trading in
23/11/2005 TPO

DM When in branch trading did you move each week to the next balancing
period (BP)

as No

DM So you rolled it for a month

Is Amonth Yes

DM How often did you do your cash declarations then

Is Once a month

DM So your cash decs were only once a month. So when you say the first
shortage is £7,500 round about January, are you sure it was Jan and not
earlier

Is Yes round about Christmas time coming into January

DM So could it have been in that Trading Period.

Js We had a lot of payouts because it was Christmas so we had a lot of
cash in the office

DM So this £7,500 would that be in branch trading 10 covering December
