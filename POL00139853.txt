John

As Jarnail has stated BTO are fully briefed and are aware that I will not be providing statements in
light of the Second Sight report with consultation with Legal Services..

The Crown has already requested via BTO my comment on each of the cases submitted in relation
to how Horizon affects the evidence in the reports.

I have requested they speak to Martin regarding this prior to any answer given.

Regards

Robert

Robert.
I had a conference call with the lawyers on Friday evening. Feedback from Martin Smith (having spoken to
BTO) is that the PF will be engaging with you with the aim for you to provide a statement in respect of the

Second Sight report and the impact it will have on prosecution cases.

If you receive such a request of that or similar type nature, please refer the matter to Legal Services.
