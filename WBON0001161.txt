Hello Amy,

As requested our response to your below email.

All fine apart from a couple of minor amendments that I have made to paragraphs 59 and 60, which I trust are
helpful.

Best regards,

Chris

Andy,

Re Pleading 21 and our meeting on 22 June when you requested a summary of what “Horizon “does”, I am pleased
to attach a summary broken down into service line activity.

I trust that this addresses your question albeit in a slightly different manner possibly than you may be expecting,
due to the complexity of the service supply.
Best regards,

Chris
