~~~ GRO.

Many thanks Harriet. I'm in no rush for any answer. I just want to make sure
that the Minister is alert to the possibility that she too will be mis-informed.

Best regards, Ron Warmington

Dear Baroness,

Further to the article written by Tim Ross in this weekend's Sunday
Telegraph (see: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-
mail/11778288/Post-Office-under-fire-over-I T-system.html ), I have
as yet received no acknowledgement from Westminster in regard to my
July 22nd and 28th emails to Mr Freeman and to the Prime Minister.

The possibility seems to exist that Mr Freeman was inaccurately
briefed on the results of our firm's investigation. As stated below, we
have concluded that there were, and probably still are, systemic flaws
within Horizon.

With regards,

Ron Warmington

Please pass this email directly to Mr Cameron. Thank you.
Dear Mr Cameron,

As yet I have received no response to my below-copied email to Mr
Freeman. In it, I am challenging the words he used in the House in
summarising my firm's Reports on the Post Office and its Horizon
operating platform. In that you also incorrectly used similar words in
UKG1I00005279
UKG100005279

the House, I respectfully look to you to ensure that more care is taken
on this matter so that broad reassurances are not again mistakenly
given.

With kindest regards,

Ron Warmington

Dear Mr Freeman:

I am puzzled, and not a little distressed, by your summarisation, in your
recent email to Mr Ian Warren, and more importantly in Parliament, of
my firm's Interim and Part Two Reports (there were, in fact, three
Reports). You have summarised our Reports with the following words:
"Second Sight have produced two independent reports, in 2013 and
2015, both of which demonstrate that there is no evidence of systemic
flaws within the Horizon system which could cause the issues
reported". That is NOT a correct statement. I respectfully draw your
attention to paragraphs 21.27 and 26.8 of our Report, and to the
following additional paragraphs:

9.3; 9.6; 9.12; 10.10; 11.8; 13.8; 21.3; 21.4; 21.8; 21.30; 21.31; and 22.10.

You may have noted, from reading our Reports, and also from Post
Office's Rebuttal Documents, that Post Office has continually focussed
attention on the system itself (i.e. ‘Horizon’, and its successor system,
‘Horizon Online’), and even more narrowly on the software, rather than
on the entirety of the operational platform used by its
Subpostmasters. It follows that even if there had never been any
systemic flaws in either version of the system (that being a contention
with which we do not agree), that would not mean that the operational
platform as a whole was always fit for purpose for all of the tens of
thousands of users. As we have stated in our Report, it was not.

I have attached here a copy of our Briefing Report - Part Two. In that
UKG1I00005279
UKG100005279

copies of this Report are already in the public domain, releasing a
further copy to you does not constitute a breach of our Confidentiality
Agreement.

Tam available at any time, subject to the constraints imposed (by our
Confidentiality Agreements with Post Office) on my firm, myself and on
my colleagues individually, should you call for any clarification.

With best regards,
