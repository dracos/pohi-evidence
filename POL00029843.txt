                                       NOTE:
                         DELOITTE REPORT - QUESTIONS FOR POL


     1. In this Note references to the 'Deloitte Report' are references to Draft 16 of the
             report "Horizon: Desktop Review of Assurance Sources and Key Control Features —
             Draft for Discussion" dated 23rd May 2014 and provided to us on the 26th
             February 2015. We have noted, and in settling this Note are mindful of, the
             status of the Deloitte Report as being that of "....a work in progress which may
             contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information
             which is subject to change...." (Deloitte letter, 16 January 2015 and headed "Project Zebra
             consolidated report... ...").



      2. Page 31, paragraph 'g.' of the Deloitte Report identifies a method of posting of
             'Balancing Transactions', that is, the posting of "....additional transactions
             centrally without the requirement for these transactions to be accepted by the Sub-
             postmasters...." The paragraphs goes on to indicate that, "Whilst an audit trail is
             asserted to be in place over these functions, evidence of testing of these features is not
             available..."


      3. Later extracts for this paragraph are also of concern:
                          — "For Balancing Transactions... ....we did not identify controls to routinely
                                 monitor all centrally initiated transactions to verify that they are all
                                 initiated and actioned through known and governed processes, or controls

                                                                                                    Page 1 of 4

                                                                                                     POL00029843

                 to reconcile and check data sources which underpin current period
                 transactional reporting for Sub-postmasters to the audit store record of
                such activity...."


            — "Controls that would detect when a person with authorised privilege access
                 used such access to send a fake basket into the digital signing process could
                 not be evidenced to exist."


4. This material is potentially disclosable in cases where a convicted defendant
    had raised, as a part of his defence (either expressly or by implication), the
    suggestion that:
        — POL or some other third-party had manipulated, interfered with or
            otherwise compromised Horizon; or


        — Horizon had created or was the victim of a system generated but
            inexplicable loss/entry/transaction(s); or


        — The defendant simply had no idea how the relevant loss arose.


5. That is not to say that the material is presently to be disclosed, only that we
    cannot determine that issue without further information. It may be that, once
    we have seen all of the available information, we conclude that the duty to
    disclose does not bite in relation to this material.


6. In a telephone conference with Rodric Williams of POL and Andrew Parsons
    of Messrs Bond Dickinson we were informed that the Deloitte Report was
    correct where it identifies a method of posting of 'Balancing Transactions'. We
    were instructed that it was possible to 'inject' a transaction unilaterally into a
    branch's accounting records without the consent, approval or indeed
    knowledge of the SPMR; an 'injected' transaction could be a negative-value



                                                                                            Page 2 of 4

                                                                                                     POL00029843

    transaction; it is not clear as to whether or not that'injected' transaction would
    be visible to the SPMR or a defence expert witness; there is one recorded
    occasion upon which Fujitsu has used the procedure. We were further
    instructed that there was no facility or capability to 'edit' any existing
    transaction.


7. We have seen a report dated 2nd March 2010 concerning the use of a Balancing
    Transaction. We are told that this is the single occasion upon which the
    process has been used since the 1St January 2010. It cannot be ascertained
    whether or not the Balancing Transaction process had been used prior to that
    date because of (entirely proper) retention policies.


8. In order to advise properly on this topic, we seek the answers to the following
    questions:
      i.    Is or would the use of the Balancing Transaction function, or any effect
            thereby achieved, be visible:
                   a)     to an affected SPMR either:
                         i.   upon the immediate occasion of its use; or


                        ii.   at some point after use, e.g. by notification, appearance on
                              Horizon, in branch accounts etc.


                   b)     an auditor when conducting a branch audit?


                   c)     when data is provided to or obtained by a prosecution expert
                          witness?


                   d)     when data is disclosed to a defence expert, for any purpose?


                   e)     in the final audit trail?



                                                                                            Page 3 of 4

                                                                                                     POL00029843

      ii.   How and in what circumstances may the Balancing Transaction
            function be utilised?


     iii.   Who may use the Balancing Transaction function, in terms of authority,
            access, etc.?


     iv.    What measures, controls or processes are in place to routinely monitor
            centrally initiated Balancing Transactions, and to check and reconcile
            data sources?


      v.    Similarly, what measures, controls or processes are in place to prevent
            any unauthorised use of the Balancing Transaction function? Here we
            note the reference in the Deloitte Report to 'fake' transactions;


     vi.    What records are maintained of any use of the Balancing Transaction
            function?


    vii.    Is POL/Fujitsu sure that the Balancing Transaction function has only
            been used on a single occasion since 1st January 2010? And if not, why
            not?
