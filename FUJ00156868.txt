1 Introduction

1.1 Background

One of the key services provided by Fujitsu under the HNG-x contract is the Audit provision. This
service provides Audit data stored by an approved and legally tested procedure. The integrity of data
retrieved for audit purposes is guaranteed at all times from the point of gathering, storage and retrieval
to subsequent despatch to the person making the request. Controls have been established that provide
assurances to Post Office Ltd Internal Audit (POLIA) that this integrity is maintained.

Approval of this document will sign off the project approach. This will allow the project to commence with
appropriate project sign offs at each designated project stage.

Further details on the audit process are available in Audit Trail Functional Specification document.

1.2 Reasons for Enhancement

It is important to state that the current process described in 1.1 Background will not be changed by this
enhancement. However the current storage used for the audit data has the following constraints:

e The current storage technology is at the end of normal service life

e Ongoing support will cost more and is not guaranteed for the rest of the HNG-x Contract period

e Fujitsu see an unacceptable risk to the Prosecution Service without adequate support in place
for all system components

e At the current rate of transactions it is expected the current storage will be full by summer 2014

e In addition, the Transition Support Service (TSS) CCN, due to be signed in September 2013,
extendsthe operational window to March 2017 from the current termination in March 2015. This
extension means the current storage arrangements need to be extended to meet this new
requirement.

Fujitsu therefore recommends that new storage is introduced under the current service arrangements in
line with agreed strategy for storage under the Belfast Refresh Project aligned to TSS. A workshop
between Post Office Technical and Security Teams and Fujitsu will be arranged to sign off the technical
solution.

2 Project Approach
2.1 Guiding Principles

The following principles will be applied:

e The project planned will not change the current approved process for storing and retrieving audit
data.

The introduction and usage of the new storage will at appropriate stages be health checked by
external agents. In addition, Fujitsu is seeking a legal opinion from external counsel to confirm
the rules of legal admissibility of evidence that any changes to the current storage system will
need to take account of.

2.2 Project Strategy

The project will be completed in three stages:

2.2.1 Stage1
The following activities are planned:
1. The new storage will be introduced in both Belfast data centres.
2. Once the storage is live all new audit data will then be stored on both the old and new storage.

3. Asecurity health check and penetration test will be conducted and the new storage solution
signed off for the storing the new transaction data when all actions and observations (if any) are
mitigated.

4. The new data feed to the old storage will be switched off and the new storage will become the
data store for the audit data.

2.2.2  Stage2
The following activities are planned:
1. The existing audit data on the old system will be copied to the new storage.

2. Avsecurity health check test will be conducted and the recall of the existing audit data on the new
storage solution will be signed off when all actions and observations (if any) are mitigated.

3. The new storage becomes the primary operational store for all audit data

2.2.3 Stage3
At this point the following alternatives are available:
Recommended solution:

Decommission the old storage in order to save ongoing maintenance costs for the old storage and
mitigate the end of life state of the old storage.

Optional if Post Office has a business need or requirement:

Extend support on the old storage as a back up facility for old cases (this shall be subject to an
additional charge to Post Office as we will be maintaining additional sources of the existing audit
data).
