Subject: Mediation Scheme - please can you review
Attachment: Mediation Scheme Communications Plan 18.12.2013 V2.doc
Hi All,

Please find attached an update of the draft comms plan for the Mediation Scheme (I had a catch-up with Belinda
yesterday on the train back from Birmingham). If possible could you review and let me know what you think (today if
possible or by 2pm tomorrow). Anything in red I’m not sure about and I’d particularly like your views on, for example
the approach with the media.

I’m going to sit down with Belinda and the team tomorrow at 4 to get their views/input and then I'll collate all
comments and send a revised version to all for a final review.

Ruth, I’ve added a deadline of 6'" January for reactive lines and media Q&A. You have my draft Q&A — if you could
review that then we can sit down towards the end of the week and get to a place where we are happy with the Q&A
and pick out the key messages. We can then send to the rest of the team to review.

In the next week or so we will also have a case tracker in place. This will let us know where every case is within the
process (I will highlight the cases that have been mentioned in the media etc so that we can see quickly where they
are). In terms of media and MPs this will mean we will know when a potential issue may hit the media / MPs and can
be well prepared for it. With MPs we will need to take face to face engagement on a case by case basis — it very much
depends on the expectations of the applicant and how engaged the MP is.

Thanks so much

Sophie
