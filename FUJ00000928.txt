SUMMARY OF CHANGE:

Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu Services”) provides, amongst other things,
Services and Applications to Post Office Limited (“Post Office”) under an Agreement
between them dated 28 July 1999 (as amended, in particular by CCN 1100) (the
“Agreement”.

Post Office wishes to implement changes to the processing of transactions and
related summaries and data in order to achieve the objectives set out in the
memorandum of understanding dated 29 September 2003 between Post Office and
its principal IT suppliers, Fujitsu Services and CSC Computer Sciences Limited. The
programme to introduce those changes is divided into a number of projects, each an
“Impact Project”.

Work Orders have been agreed by the Parties under which some or all of the
Requirements Analysis Stage, Solution Specification Stage, Solution Build and Test
Stage and Implementation Stage have been or will be undertaken in respect of
Impact Project 2.

This CCN (“S60 CCN Two”) sets out the changes to the Agreement necessary to
reflect the new and/or modified Services required for Impact Project 2.

This S60 CCN Two incorporates and consists of CCN number 1132a and the
following Attachments:

1131b).

Changes to the Agreement (Attachment 1);
Changes to CCDs (Attachment 2); and
Changes to Schedule 10 in connection with S60 CCN One (Attachment 3).

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH HMEDIUM-+LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:

To amend the Agreement for the introduction of new and/or modified Services
developed as part of Impact Project 2.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

1.

Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree that:

(a) the Agreement and certain CCDs will be amended; and
(b) certain new CCDs will be introduced,

as set out in this S60 CCN Two.

Subject to Section 6 below, the amendments to the Agreement described in
Attachment 1 (other than amendments to be made to Schedule 10) and the
amendments to each CCD or CRD agreed by the Parties in connection with
such amendments to the Agreement or Impact Project 2 will take effect from
the date when:

(a) testing and acceptance of Impact Project 2 have been successfully
completed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Work
Order under which such testing and acceptance were undertaken; and

(b) the amendments to the Agreement related to Impact Projects 1 and 3
have become effective in accordance with the “Details of Change”
section of S60 CCN One.

The date that the amendments referred to in Section 2 above become
effective is referred to herein as the “Project 2 Effective Date”. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the events described in Sections 2(a) and (b) have both
occurred when this S60 CCN Two is approved by the Parties, the amendments
referred to in Section 2 shall have effect retrospectively from the date when

Branch of the function or service described by that new or amended provision
is dependent on the relevant component of Release S60 being activated in
that Branch by Post Office, Fujitsu Service’s obligations in respect of the

5. The amendments to Schedule 10 described in Attachment 1 shall become
effective on and from 1 October 2004. For the avoidance of doubt, the figures

Table) are annual amounts to be added to the pre-existing annual amounts in
the Operational Charges Table in paragraph 2.2 of Schedule 10. The
additional amounts that shall be payable in each month from October 2004 to
March 2005 (inclusive) as a result of the increased Charges agreed under this
S60 CCN Two shall be one sixth of the applicable amount stated in Section 6
of Attachment 1. The same approach shall apply in respect of the amounts set
out Section 6.1.3 of Attachment 1 which relate to the SI Commitment Fee
described in Paragraph 4.1 of Schedule 10.

6. IThe amendments to Schedule 15 described in Attachment 1 shall take effect
from the Project 2 Effective Date unless on that date there are less than 30
days remaining in the Service Level Measurement Period in which the Project
2 Effective Date falls, in which case the amendments to Schedule 15 shall take
effect from the first day of the next Service Level Measurement Period.

7. To the extent that the provisions of this S60 CCN Two (including, without
limitation, all of the provisions herein that describe changes to the Agreement)
and the provisions of all CCDs and CRDs introduced by or agreed in
accordance or connection with S60 CCN Two (the “S60 CCN Two Provisions”)
address matters that are also covered in the Conceptual Designs, Design
Proposals, Work Orders or any other documents associated with Impact
Project 2, the S60 CCN Two Provisions that deal with such matters shall and
shall be deemed to supersede and replace the provisions of such Conceptual
Designs, Design Proposals, Work Orders and other documents dealing with
the same matters. In the event of any remaining conflict or inconsistency, the
S60 CCN Two Provisions shall have precedence over the provisions of such
Conceptual Designs, Design Proposals, Work Orders and other documents.

8. I The amendments to Schedule 10 described in Attachment 3 shall be effective
from 1 July 2004.
