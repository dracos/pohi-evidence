Subject: CASE NO 21392 - Prosecution v K Wylie

Dear Jarnail,

Tenclose advice from Harry Bowyer. I know it will be unpalatable, but for what it may be worth I
share his view. In the instant case, our response must be dependant on time scales for completion of
the inspection. We are only just beginning to see these issues raised by defence solicitors and the
sooner we grasp the problem the better. If you want any more do call, otherwise I will await the
outcome of your consultations before responding to the defence.

sincerely,

Andy Cash
