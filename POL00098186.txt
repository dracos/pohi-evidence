Summary of issue as requested.

The 14 branches impacted had to fulfil 4 conditions:-
* Were operating in Trading Period (TP) 9 2010 on 10"* December 2010 (one branch was actually in TP10).
¢ Deleted a stock unit (SU) on or before 10th December 2010.
e Prior to deletion that SU had declared to and/or cleared a discrepancy from Local Suspense (LS) at the end of
TP8 or TPY.
¢ Had not rolled into TP4 2011 by 3 July 2011.

The discrepancies of 2010 were all proper to the respective branches.

Problem

e Revised archiving strategy was introduced in October 2010.

e  LSrecords were written in to a table (BRDB_RX_BTS_DATA) at the data centre. These netted to zero as
expected.

e The LS record was due to be archived in TP4 2011.

@ When a SU is deleted in branch it is immediately “logically” deleted at the data centre.

e After 205 days the SU record was “permanently deleted”.

e As these branches had not reached TP4 2011 the LS record for that stock unit was “orphaned” making it
ineligible for archiving.
At the end of TP8 2011 the orphaned record was picked up along with genuine current LS data.
At the end of TP9 2011 the branch was forced to clear the 2010 value along with any discrepancies generated
within the current TP.

@ The same events occurred in 2012

Branch Impact — The 2 Branch Trading Statements will contain an anomaly with the discrepancy transferred differing
from the value resolved by the 2010 orphaned LS value

- 12 branches have resolved the inappropriate discrepancies under bau processes. The largest loss has occurred
in a WH Smith branch totalling £226.28.

- The 2 branches with the largest unexplained discrepancies alerted Finance Service Centre (FSC) in 2011 after
settling the discrepancies centrally. These discrepancies were resolved with no inappropriate payments being
made.

- The same branches alerted POL when the same discrepancies appeared in 2012.

FSC Impact — In both 2011 and 2012 unexpected “open” values appeared within the Local Suspense ledger of the Post
Office Finance system POLSAP. The account should clear down to zero each trading period for each branch.

- In 2011 the values relating to the 2 branches above were associated to equal and opposite values held on the

branches’ Customer Account and cleared. The other values were written off to Profit & Loss as no explanation
could be found.

Resolution
1. The relevant orphaned amounts have been archived.
2. Revised archiving strategy introduced in July 2011 prevents a reoccurrence of this specific error type.
3. Acheck to ensure the LS account nets off to zero is being considered at Fujitsu.
4. FSC will write to all non Crown branches impacted to summarise what has happened. The intention is to return
any incorrect losses but not to attempt to recover resultant gains. Letters will go through Legal prior to
despatch.
