C) Memo

To: Jarnail Singh
From: Jon Longman

Date: 6th April 2010
Subject: Mrs Seema Misra - POLtd 0708/0249 (CRM258932JSX)

1am writing in reply to your memo of 1st April.

I understand that the defence have now reviewed the disc (exhibit PT/02) containing some
430,000 transactions and would like to have hard copies of all the transactions (13
months) to make their analysis easier. 1 do not consider this to be a reasonable request by
the defence as to print that amount of data would probably run into thousands of pages.
As they have the disc I would propose that they can either print off all the transaction data
themselves or print specific dates to assist with their analysis.

Currently, the case has been listed for trial for 7 days week commencing 1st June 2010. As
previously advised a number of witnesses are unable to attend this date and I recall that
Warwick Tatford could not attend this date either. You mentioned that the trial date may
be moved to 21st June and I would be grateful if you could confirm as soon as possible
whether this is the new date so that I may advise the witnesses.

{ will forward to you a copy of exhibit GJ/01

With regards to the defence request for all the helpdesk calls from 1st January 2005 to
31st December 2009, I now have the disc containing this information which I have copied
and will forward it to you together with a witness statement from Andy Dunks.

twill also be sending you a witness statement from lan Venables of Fujitsu regarding new

hardware installed at West Byfleet. I am currently awaiting this statement and once this is
received I will send you all the items mentioned above.

Yours Sincerely,

Jon Longman
