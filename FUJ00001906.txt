2 Introduction

2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is:
* To specify the End of Day Reconciliation and Settlement file format between the-NBX and the

Settlement Slave Financial Institutions (A&L_and CAPO),host systems where-reflecting the role ofthe
NBX is-acting.as theSettlement Master (see section 2.4).

* To provide the development teams-with sufficient detail to develop theagree the NBX — Reconciliation
File format.with the interested parties.

‘+ To provide a consistent communications vehicle amongst the development teams which have
responsibility for developing the various components comprising the application.

2.2 Scope

This document applies to the interfaces between the NBX and Financial Institutions where the NBX is acting as
the Master for reconciliation and settlement. It contains the detail of the Reconciliation and Settlement file
records sufficient to support the financial services being delivered by the NBX.

The Reconciliation (REC) File contains only Financial Transactions e.g. those transactions that change a
financial position - such as Withdrawal, Withdrawal Reversal, Deposit and Deposit Reversal. The purpose of
the file is to allow the reconciliation of all Financial Transactions between the NBX and each of the connected
Financial Institutions. The REC file does not include certain transactions with no financial impact, such as
Balance Enquiry and Pin Change, and thus does not provide a vehicle for calculating total transaction volume.

I This als will be used for both magnetic cards and for EMV cards; no EMV fields are notincluded because they
play no part in FI reconciliation or settlement.

3 Overview of Reconciliation Interface

3.1 Data Description

This interface describes the issue of reconciliation and settlement data at the end of each business day from
the NBX for each of the slave Financial Institutions.

3.2 Derivation and Use of Data
The NBX logs details of all transactions during the business day.

At the end of the business day timed events at 20:00 trigger end of day messages to slave Financial
Institutions to notify the FI that the NBX has started its End of Day processing for the current business day, and
has changed to the next business day. ‘End of day’ messages to slave Financial Institution's

are as specified within each of the NBX Financial Institution AIS documents._AVter the Agents have sent the
End Of Day message to the F' all new transactions for that Fl will have the new Settlement Date (incremented
by 1 day). Within the NBX all messages have a Settlement Date as day, month and year only. The
Settlement Date is equivalent to the business day and spans from 20:00 the previous day to 19:59:59 current
day (Settlement Date) and is also the same as NBX_DATE on the Reconciliation File. All messages within a
unique transaction (ie R3, A1, E1) have the same Receipt Date (including time) and Settlement Date.

Eq. Business Day from 24/08/2004 20.00.00 to 25/08/2004 19:59:59 Settlement Date = 25/08/2004

There are confiqurable cut off times (eg.20.10) used to specify the time until a reversal can be included in the
file for the Settlement Date being settled.

used to construct the files used for Reconciliation and Settlement,

‘The Agents store transaction information in a database. The Reconciliation and Settlement file generation
process is triggered off by the change over to the new business day and after the End of Day messages have
been sent to the Financial Institutions (CAPO and A&L) from the NBX.

These time periods are defined by parameters.

The amount requested for settlement by Post Office Ltd will be in line with the contents of the Reconciliation
file, plus any manual adjustments that are necessary.

Appendix C (section 10) contai

1S a table of the events and timings related to End of Day processing.
3.2.1 File Description

‘The Reconciliation and Settlement File will contain a file header at the start of each file, followed by a detail
record for every financial transaction that has been acquired by the NBX for the settlement day including failed
and declined transactions. Non-financial i.e. Balance enquiry and PIN Change Transactions are NOT
included in this file.

A transaction sub-total record will occur-be writtenapproximately every forty transactions and a file summary is
‘written at the end of the file, following the last sub-total record. This will consist of a single line for the
interface. A summary trailer detailing the net position of the Client follows the summary line records. The file
is terminated with a trailer containing a count of all records in the file with the exception on the header and
trailer records.

A detailed description of these records can be found in Section 4.

4.1.1. General Record Element Definitions

The following sections define the list of reconciliation file data elements as they relate to each record format, together with which record they are present in.

4.1.2 File Record Format Types

The following records will be passed from the NBX to the Financial Institution Interface for Reconciliation and Settlement:

Message Type

Description

Header Record (HR)

Each file will contain 1 of these.

Transaction Detail Record
(TDR)

Each file will consist of 0 or more detail records, one for each financial transaction, which took place
during the business day. The Financial Transactions are Deposit, Deposit Reversal, Withdrawal (all
types), and Withdrawal Reversal as appropriate to the Fl

Transaction Sub-Total
Record (TSR)

Each file will contain 1 of these for every 40 records or less e.g. if the file contains 45 Transaction
Detail Records then there would be a Transaction Sub-Total Record after 40 of the Transaction Detail
Records followed by a further 5 TDR records and the another Transaction Sub-Total Record. The
Transaction Sub-Total Record contains the Acquired Total, Issued Total and Failed Total

‘Summary Detail Record
(SDR)

Each file will consist of a minimum of 1 of these. This record contains the Settlement Total for the FI
Counterpart (2.9--LiNK Member banks) — currently n/a for Post Office Direct Interfaces CAPO and
A&L as each direct interface currently does not connect to member banks, therefore there will only be
1 of these record types per file.

‘Summary Trailer Record
(STR)

Each file will contain 1 of these. This record contains the Net Settlement Total for the FI.

File Trailer Record (FTR)

Each file will contain 1 of these. This record contains the total number of records on the file for the
settlement date, excluding the header and trailer

Note: Where there are no transaction detail records for a business day a file containing no detail records will be produced. This file will contain a HR, TSR,

‘SDR, STR and FTR record and totals must be zero.

4.1.3 Reconciliation File Data Elements

The reconciliation data elements used in the NBX — FI records are listed below.

The information presented here is also included in different contexts in other sections, mainly section 4.2. However, the information in this section 4.1 takes

precedence over any other section, where the information is included

The table in section 4.1.4 includes Reconciliation file element names, descriptions and the length (fixed) of each element. It should be noted that the acquirer

fields would not be populated by this interface as the NBX is creating this file for an Issuer.

The entry in the format column corresponds to any of the abbreviations shown in the following table

X(n)

Alpha Numeric characters with a length of n e.g. X(3) = alpha numeric with a length of 3

+(0)9.99

Signed Numeric characters only with 2 decimal places — the n in the brackets refers to the number of
positions before the decimal place e.g. +6731678.50 = +(7)9.99. This type of field, represent a monetary
value. Leading zeroes are suppressed, fields are aligned on the decimal point, signs are floating and currency
fields do not have a currency symbol associated with them. This type of field is not packed.

‘3(n)

Unsigned numeric characters only with a length of n e.g. 345 = 9(3). This type of field represents a count of
transactions. Leading zeroes are suppressed (except for RECOUNT-COUNT) and the field is not packed.

~(7).99

Signed numeric characters only with 2 decimal places. This amount is suppressed if the value is zero in
addition leading zeroes are suppressed, fields are aligned on the decimal point, signs are floating and
currency fields do not have a currency symbol associated with them. This type of field is not packed

In the field Recon-Amt-Issued, type ~{7).99 for example, in the case of a negative value the sign takes one of
the 10 characters, therefore -999999.99 being the maximum deposit while a withdrawal can exceed a million
pounds.

~(n)9.99

Signed Numeric characters only with 2 decimal places — the n in brackets refers to the number of positions
before the decimal place e.g. -6731678.50 = -(7) 9.99. This type of field, represent a monetary value.
Leading zeroes are suppressed, fields are aligned on the decimal point, signs are floating and currency fields
do not have a currency symbol associated with them. This type of field is not packed.

File Elements

Definitions

The following definitions are included here to provide clarity on the use of the terms Declined and Failed Transactions within the File Element Table:

A Declined Transaction is a transaction which has not been approved by the Issuer for a reason which is indicated in the response code returned by
the issuer e.g. Insufficient Funds; Stolen Card; expired Card ete

‘A Failed Transaction is a transaction which has been declined e.g. this may be due to the Late Response to a withdrawal request; a format error in
the response from the issuer, a key encryption error ete

The Failed totals include both Declined and Failed Transactions as described above.

Acquired Totals are currently not applicable for the purpose of the Reconciliation File — this file is always produced from the view of the recipient i.e.
the Issuer.

Issuer Totals are applicable to the Reconciliation File — this file is always produced from the view of the recipient i.e. the Issuer.

4.1.4.2 Abbreviations used within the Description field of the File Element Table.
WDL Withdrawal Positive i.e. the value that the FI will owe the Post
Office
REV Withdrawal Reversal Negative i.e. the value Post Office Limited owes the FI

5 Transfer Structure

5.1 Transfer Grouping

This transfer supports the file transfer of a batch file containing the Reconciliation and Settlement data for a
single business day.

A file header is written at the start, followed by a detail record for every transaction that has been acquired by
the NBX on behalf of the Financial Institution including failed (declined) transactions for the business day. A
transaction sub-total record occurs approximately every forty transactions.

file summary is written at the end of the file, following the last sub-total record. This is comprised of a
sequence of summary line records. A summary trailer detailing the net position of the institution follows the
summary line records.

The file is terminated with a trailer containing a count of all records in the file with the exception of the header
and trailer records,

The file is sorted by reconciliation time, RECON-TIME, sequence, then by the reconciliation trace number,
RECON-TRACE-NUMBER. This is to ensure that when more than 1 transaction has the same time they are
sequenced by the trace number. See File Attributes in section 5.2.1
