Dear Brian,

One of the witnesses in the Castleton case is Greg Booth who was the temporary sub-postmaster at Marine
Drive branch from 21 April to 28 May 2004. Greg is currently the manager of the Newbury Post office branch,
401 Scalby Road, Scarborough, Y012 6TQ.

Greg spoke to me last week and reported that his computer froze on Wed 25 or Thurs 26 October 2006 (I will
clarify which day) whilst he was serving a customer and part way through a transaction. The transaction had
not been settled. It related to a postage label. When he logged back in again, the computer had lost the
transaction of £1.27. The computer did not prompt him to try to recover it. Greg is away this week, but I will
be contacting him upon his return to obtain a supplemental witness statement about this point. Prior to then,
Greg's evidence was that he had never know the system to lose a transaction. In this particular case, Greg
was £1.27 up because he had taken money from a customer. However, I anticipate the reverse would have
happened if he had been paying money out.

Although this is for a small amount, the principle on the face of it seems concerning because it suggests that
the Horizon system can, (albeit rarely), lose transactions. Castleton's solicitors will try to exploit any
                                                                                                           FUJO0155767
                                                                                                        FUJO0155767



weakness and we must be prepared for a possible attack on this point.
Our Counsel has requested that Fujitsu review the Newbury Post Office's Horizon data for those days period to
see if you can tell whether the system froze and lost the transaction and what the explanation may be.

We have to serve Witness Statements very shortly. I will have to prepare a supplemental Witness Statement
for Greg Booth dealing with this and may possibly need to take a further Witness Statement from somebody at
Fujitsu, depending on your explanation. Accordingly, I would be grateful if you could look into this and come
back to me as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely
