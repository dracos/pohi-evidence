BETWEEN:

(1)

Post Office Ltd whose registered office is situated at 148 Old Street, London EC1V
9HQ (“Post Office”); and

(2) Fujitsu Services Limited whose registered office is at 22 Baker Street, London W1U

3BW ("Fujitsu Services").

RECITALS

WHEREAS:

(A) By an agreement dated 24 May 1999 originally entered into between Post Office (then
known as Post Office Counters Ltd) and ICL Pathway Limited and subsequently

2002, pursuant to the Change Control Procedure contained therein;

(E) The Parties have agreed to the extension of the term of, and the making of certain

further changes to, the Codified Agreement with the aim of achieving, inter alia, the
following joint objectives (the “Joint Objectives”):

(a) the introduction of immediate and sustained reductions in certain Post
Office costs;
(b) subject to certain agreed exceptions, the continued provision to the Post

Office of services equivalent in their business outcome to the services
provided immediately prior to the introduction of the changes;

(c) fixed and variable pricing with variable elements based on the use of
particular service components and numbers of Branches, Counter
Positions and Transactions;

CONFIDENTIAL,

(e) improved joint working practices and the introduction of a new systems
integration relationship involving the pursuit of opportunities for both
Parties to share the benefits of any cost reduction initiatives through a
new Systems Integration Partnership ;

(f) the maintenance and enhancement of the customer relationship

On 31 August, 2006 the Parties signed CCN 1200 which extended the term of the
Codified Agreement and introduced certain further changes; and

This Agreement is the Codified Agreement as amended by CCN 1200, including the
Schedules thereto, the CCDs and CRDs.

On 26 September 2013 the Parties signed CCN 1400 which made certain changes to
the Codified Agreement to reflect Post Office's intention to transition the Services to a
new Towers Model. Under CCN 1400, the Codified Agreement was extended for a
transitional period until 31 March 2017, with certain Services expiring on 31 March 2015
(unless otherwise extended), to enable Post Office sufficient time to complete the
procurement process for transitioning to the Towers Model and to appoint suppliers for
each of the Towers (including Replacement Services).”

NOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

PART A: RELATIONSHIP
Funding Condition

Post Office may at any time prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date deliver to Fujitsu
Services a Funding Notice.

During the Conditionality Period the provisions of Part A of Schedule A6 shall apply.

Where Post Office delivers a Funding Notice prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date, the
provisions of Part B of Schedule A6 shall apply with effect from the date of receipt by
Fujitsu Services of such Funding Notice.

Where Post Office does not deliver a Funding Notice prior to the Conditionality Expiry
Date, the provisions of Part C of Schedule A6 shall apply with effect from the
Conditionality Expiry Date.

Where Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services in writing prior to the Conditionality Expiry
Date that it will not deliver a Funding Notice, the provisions of Part C of Schedule A6
shall apply with effect from the date on which Fujitsu Services receives that notice in
writing.

Post Office shall ensure that during the Conditionality Period Fujitsu Services is
provided with confirmations by way of issue of a purchase order or a series of purchase
orders or otherwise in writing in respect of HNG-X Development to be carried out in
accordance with the HNG-X Programme Plan against which Fujitsu Services may raise
invoices for HNG-X Development Charges when entitled to do so in accordance with
the provisions of Schedule D2 and to the extent such Charges fall within the estimated
aggregate HNG-X T&M Budget in respect of a particular Planning Period (as set out in
the budget report to be delivered in accordance with paragraph 11 of Schedule B6.2)
("Purchase Order Cover"). In the absence of such Purchase Order Cover and failure by
Post Office to provide it within seven days of written notice from Fujitsu Services
requesting that Post Office do so, the provisions of Part C of Schedule A6 shall apply
upon expiry of such notice.

Post Office shall provide to Fujitsu Services, upon its reasonable request from time to
time, information that Post Office is reasonably able to disclose, without breaching any
confidentiality restrictions, for the purpose of updating Fujitsu Services on progress
being made by the Post Office in securing funding such that Post Office may deliver a
Funding Notice, and the steps being taken by Post Office to secure such funding.

In the event that, during the Conditionality Period, Project HNG-X is terminated by Post
Office for Default pursuant to Clause 47.11.1 and Post Office does not deliver a Funding
Notice to Fujitsu Services on or prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date, Post Office shall
not be entitled to recover any loss or damage from Fujitsu Services on the basis that
had this Agreement been duly performed according to its terms Post Office would have
delivered a Funding Notice on or prior to the Conditionality Expiry Date.

Preferred Systems Integrator and Systems Integration Partnership

It is Post Office's present intention to confer upon Fujitsu Services the role of Preferred
Systems Integrator with a wider scope of operation than the Infrastructure and with the
potential to include all Relevant IT Systems in that scope. The role of the Preferred
Systems Integrator and the manner and timing of its appointment are set out in further

detail in Schedule A1 to this Agreement.

In its role as Preferred Systems Integrator (if appointed) Fujitsu Services shall pursue in
particular those Joint Objectives listed in Recitals (E)(d) and (E)(e).

The Parties shall, with effect from the Amendment Date, establish and operate the SIP
in accordance with the terms of Schedule B1.2.

as a CCN to introduce a replacement operating system for NT (as envisaged by
paragraph 1.4 of Schedule C3) has been agreed by the Parties, any references to “XP”
in any of the Schedules, CCDs or CRDs, or to “Microsoft”, as the provider of XP, shall

practicable following receipt of the notice and the Change Control Procedure shall be
used to agree any consequential changes to this Agreement including, without
limitation, the extent to which the HNG-X Project Price should be lowered to reflect cost
savings resulting from the cessation of such work and the impact on the Requirements
Baseline if such development is no longer to be completed.

The removal by Fujitsu Services of any application code and/or infrastructure relating to
a POL Service Type disabled in accordance with Clause 10.5 shall be dealt with under
the Work Ordering Procedure.

Once a POL Service Type has ceased operation in accordance with Clause 10.5, such
POL Service Type may only be recommenced pursuant to the Change Control
Procedure set out in Schedule A3.

On the proviso that the Superstock Service hasn't been early terminated in accordance
with Clause 8 of Schedule D1, it shall cease on 31st March 2012. Post Office may, by
giving Fujitsu Services not less than three months’ written notice prior to that date,
request that the provision of the Superstock Service be extended for a period specified
by Post Office (ending no later than 31st March 2015) in which case:

10.8.1 Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to extend the relevant
supplier and/or Sub-contractor agreements for the period requested by Post
Office on the best terms reasonably available;

10.8.2 if Fujitsu Services is able to secure an extension from its suppliers and/or Sub-
contractors, the provisions of this Agreement dealing with the Superstock
Service (including, without limitation, the Charges) shall be amended under the
Change Control Procedure to reflect that extension and the terms agreed by
Fujitsu Services with its suppliers and/or Sub-contractors; and

10.8.3 Fujitsu Services shall provide information concerning the costs of such an
extension on an Open Book basis.

Positions and Branches respectively for the purposes of the Operational Charges and
the limits set out in Part 1 of Annex A to Schedule D1.

Fujitsu Services shall supply Post Office, on terms to be agreed between the Parties
under the Change Control Procedure, with such training systems and documents as
Post Office may reasonably require for the purposes of training Post Office employees
in the use of any Services provided under this Agreement.

Connections (the “Branch Telecommunications Supplier”) in substitution for the
relevant public carrier used by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement;

12.3.3 the appointment by Post Office of the Branch Telecommunications Supplier
shall be in accordance with terms agreed by Post Office with the Branch
Telecommunications Supplier, taking into account (i) any notice periods

Fujitsu Services should be no worse off (i) financially and (ii) in relation to risk or
liability, under the revised Agreement than it is under the existing Agreement;
and

12.3.9 the matters to be addressed under the Change Control Procedure to give effect
to Clause 12.3.8 shall include, without limitation, amendments to the Third Party

Post Office), project management, billing management, changes to central data
processing, security of the Alternative Network Arrangements and the impact of
the Alternative Network Arrangements on the HNG-X Services.

Documentation, Specially Written Documentation and Developed Documentation at no
additional charge.

Fujitsu Services shall maintain and keep up to date the Core Document Set.

representative of Post Office at times and locations to be mutually agreed between
Fujitsu Services and Post Office (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

the Consumables. In the event that a high level specification is unavailable in relation to
a Consumable because it contains information confidential to the manufacturer, Fujitsu

of approved products referred to in Clause 14.3:

14.6.1 Fujitsu Services will be entitled to recover from Post Office and Post Office shall
pay any and all reasonable additional costs and expenses incurred by Fujitsu

incurred as a result of Post Office's use of such product; and

14.6.2 Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of any contractual remedies which Post Office
may have arising from a failure of any Equipment installed in Branches to the
extent that such failure is directly associated with Post Office's use of such
product.

In the event that a Consumable is unavailable before the expiry of this Agreement (or, in
relation to agreed Consumables, before the expiry of such shorter period as the Parties
may agree), Fujitsu Services shall, at its own expense, source an alternative acceptable
consumable.

In the event that a Consumable is unavailable and an alternative cannot be sourced,
Fujitsu Services shall not be relieved of its obligations to provide Services under the
terms of this Agreement.

The price of any Consumable, or alternative supplied under Clause 14.9, shall not

IPR owned by Third Parties

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all Intellectual Property Rights in Horizon
Third Party Software and Third Party Items (excluding Intellectual Property Rights in
Third Party Items required to be assigned to Post Office pursuant to Clause 29) shall
remain vested in the relevant third party proprietor of those rights.

In consideration of the payment of the relevant Charges:

30.6.1 subject to Clauses 30.11 and 30.12, Fujitsu Services hereby grants or shall
grant, as the case may be, to Post Office a perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3),
royalty-free, irrevocable and non-exclusive sub-licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software);

in each case where Fujitsu Services has procured the rights to grant such sub-
licences; or

30.6.2 subject to Clause 30.11, if Fujitsu Services is unable to procure the right to grant
the sub-licence referred to in Clause 30.6.1, having used all reasonable
endeavours to procure such right, Fujitsu Services shall procure that the
relevant third party grants to Post Office a royalty-free and non-exclusive
licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software),

and shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that such licence is perpetual
(subject to Clause 30.6.3) and irrevocable.

30.6.3 Each of the sub-licences and/or licences granted or procured pursuant to this
Clause 30.6 in respect of Horizon Third Party Software shall terminate upon the
later of:

(a) the occurrence of Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout

Agreement or, in the case only of “Windows NT Workstation” (identified
as Horizon Third Party Software in Schedule B4.1), the date when that
software is no longer used in the provision or receipt of the HNG-X
Services in accordance with this Agreement.

Each of Post Office's sub-licences and licences under Clauses 30.6.1 and 30.6.2
respectively shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions imposed by the
licensor, provided that any terms of any such sub-licence or licence shall not detract
from the rights granted to Post Office hereunder. Without prejudice to the generality of
the foregoing, Post Office accepts the licence terms relating to the Escher Upgrade
Software set out in Schedule B4.1 and that such terms satisfy the requirements of this
Clause 30.7.

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to enable a third party engaged by
Post Office to use Horizon Third Party Software subject to and in accordance with this
Agreement on behalf of Post Office provided that such third party shall have entered
into an appropriate Agreed Form NDA.

Post Office shall be entitled to copy Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third
Party Software in order to create as many archival or back-up copies of the same as are
necessary. When copying such software, Post Office shall include the original machine
readable copyright notice, and a label affixed to the media identifying the software and
stating: "This medium contains an authorised copy of copyrighted software which is the
property of [the Third Party Software Owner]."

In respect of any Non-standard Third Party Material to be (i) included in or used as part
of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities,
or (ii) used to provide or receive the HNG-X Services over the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure, Fujitsu Services shall procure such rights for Post Office to use those
materials as are set out in Clause 48.8, such rights only to be granted in accordance
with the provisions of Clause 48.8 (in each case as if references to Fujitsu Background
IPR were to the IPR in the Non-standard Third Party Material). Without prejudice to Post
Office's rights and remedies under this Agreement, in the event that Fujitsu Services
cannot procure such rights, it shall not procure the development or make use of that
Non-standard Third Party Material in connection with this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Post Office and shall, at Post Office's request and at no additional
charge to Post Office:

30.10.1 provide Post Office with such information as it may reasonably request in order
to understand and assess the reasons for, and the benefits of, the use of that
Non-standard Third Party Material (including, without limitation, identifying any
alternative software or materials which possess substantially equivalent
functionality, performance and interoperability to that of the Non-standard Third
Party Material and in relation to which the above rights can be obtained with
minimum additional costs or restrictions); and

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services may be unable and, if so,
shall not be obliged to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Clauses 30.6.1, 30.6.2 or 30.17
(as the case may be) in respect of an item of Horizon Third Party Software or a Third
Party Item in the event that an act or omission of Post Office gives rise to a right for the
proprietor of the relevant item of Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item to:

30.11.1 terminate its licence to Fujitsu Services of the relevant item of Horizon Third
Party Software or Third Party Item;

30.11.2 terminate its licence to Post Office of the relevant Horizon Third Party Software
or Third Party Item; or

30.11.3 require Fujitsu Services to terminate its sub-licence to Post Office of the
relevant Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item.

In the event that Post Office is in breach of a sub-licence of an item of Horizon Third
Party Software or a Third Party Item granted pursuant to Clause 30.6.1 and Fujitsu
Services reasonably believes that Post Office's breach will result in the termination of
Fujitsu Services’ right to use such Third Party Item:

30.12.1 Fujitsu Services shall give Post Office notice in writing specifying the breach
and requiring Post Office to remedy that breach within 30 days of receipt of
such notice; and

30.12.2 if Post Office fails to remedy the breach within 30 days of receipt of such notice,
Fujitsu Services may by notice in writing terminate the relevant sub-licence.

In the event that a sub-licence is terminated pursuant to Clauses 30.11 or 30.12.2,
Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any failure or delay in providing any Service to the
extent that the failure or delay is caused by the cessation of Post Office's right to use
the material or thing the subject of that sub-licence, provided that Fujitsu Services has
used its reasonable endeavours to continue providing the affected Service or Services
to the extent possible and to mitigate the impact of the failure or delay. Fujitsu Services
shall provide such assistance as Post Office may reasonably require in order for Post
Office to assess, and procure the necessary rights to use, suitable replacement
materials to those the subject of the terminated licence.

Subject to any necessary consents (which Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable
endeavours to obtain) in relation to Horizon Third Party Software, HNG-X Third Party
Software or other materials or things in which the Intellectual Property Rights are owned
by a third party, any licence or sub-licence granted by Fujitsu Services to Post Office
hereunder:

Documentation

30.15.1 Subject to Clause 30.15.2, Post Office and a third party engaged by Post Office
including but not limited to any bona fide potential Next Suppliers (in particular during
any tender, due diligence or implementation process) where reasonably required (i) to
comply with the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (in particular without limitation
Regulation 4(3)) and (ii) by Post Office for a Design Purpose, shall be entitled to have
access to and use Horizon Design Documentation.

30.15.2 Post Office agrees:

(a) that (irrespective of ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in Developed
Documentation) it will not use or permit to be used any Horizon Design
Documentation for any purpose other than a Design Purpose;

(b) not to disclose Horizon Design Documentation to any third party save where
such disclosure is required for a Design Purpose and the third party to whom it
is disclosed has (1) entered into such confidentiality commitments as Fujitsu
Services may reasonably request (written confirmation of which shall be
provided by Post Office to Fujitsu Services prior to release of such
documentation), and (2) delivered a written undertaking to Fujitsu Services that
it will use such Horizon Design Documentation solely for the Design Purposes;
and

(c) access to and use of any Horizon Design Documentation in accordance with
this Clause 30.15.2 shall not serve to transfer any Intellectual Property Rights in
the documentation or information contained therein to the Post Office or any
third party.

30.15.3 For the purposes of determining ownership of, and any licences granted in respect of,
Intellectual Property Rights in any Specially Commissioned Design Documentation,
such documentation shall be deemed to fall within the definition of Developed
Documentation or Specially Written Documentation, whichever is applicable. Licences
granted by Fujitsu Services under Clause 30.1 in respect such Specially Commissioned
Design Documentation that is deemed to be Fujitsu Developed Documentation shall be
subject to the additional restrictions imposed by Clause 30.15.2.

Deposited Software

30.16 Fujitsu Services shall place the Source Code of the Deposited Software in escrow with a
reputable escrow company agreed upon by the Parties (if the Parties are unable to
agree then the escrow company shall be NCC), on the basis of the appropriate standard
agreement or on such other terms as Post Office, Fujitsu Services, the third party
licensor (if applicable) and the escrow company shall agree (each such agreement, a

Without prejudice to the generality of Clauses 48.7 to 48.13, Fujitsu Services hereby
grants to Post Office a perpetual, royalty-free and non-exclusive licence (which shall
(subject to Clause 30.11) be irrevocable) to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and enhance
(and to authorise a third party to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and enhance) the
Source Code version of the Deposited Software. However, the foregoing licence shall
only become effective if Post Office becomes entitled to obtain access to the Source
Code version of the Deposited Software pursuant to the Source Code Escrow
Agreement referred to in Clause 30.16 and the licence shall be subject to any
restrictions contained herein in respect of the object code version of the Deposited
Software.

Miscellaneous Licence Provisions

30.18.1 On the sale or transfer of an item of Hardware of which Internal Code is an integral part,

the licence to use such Internal Code in combination with the said item of Hardware
shall pass to the purchaser or other transferee of the said item of Hardware. Post Office
shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the purchaser or transferee of the said
item of Hardware agrees to comply with the licence to use the Internal Code that was
previously enjoyed by Post Office.

set out in the applicable CCDs (relating to the Horizon Applications or the

from time to time (save that where any Post Office Data received by Fujitsu
Services is stored, transmitted or otherwise processed as part of the Superstock
Solution, Fujitsu Services' applicable obligation in respect of that data shall be
to use all reasonable endeavours to preserve the integrity and prevent loss or
corruption of the data and, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the validation
procedures set out in the CCDs (relating to the Horizon Applications or the

Services shall not be liable for any loss or corruption of Post Office Data nor for

Both Parties warrant that if and to the extent they have obligations under the Data

pursuant to Clause 34.5.1, then Fujitsu Services shall refund to Post Office any
Charges paid or payable by Post Office in respect of development work
undertaken by or on behalf of Fujitsu Services in relation to that Rejected
Requirement in that intervening period (but excluding any Charges in respect of
development work which Fujitsu Services is able to demonstrate to the

Requirement to the extent that (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu Services
Group was engaged by Post Office for the purposes of the development of that UI
Development Requirement and contributed to that Ul Development Requirement and
(b) such contribution resulted in the infringement or alleged infringement referred to in
Clause 34.3.1.

In the event that, pursuant to Clause 34.5, Fujitsu Services rejects a Queried
Requirement in respect of which (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu

interests of the Royal Mail Group and the public interest and where Fujitsu Services is
the Indemnified Party the commercial interests of the Fujitsu Services Group) and views
of the Indemnified Party in the conduct of any defence to any claim or demand
hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so taking into account also the
interests of the Indemnifying Party, comply with such interests and views.

The Indemnified Party shall, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, afford to the
Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any claim or
demand made or action brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity
may apply or any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying
Party to which the indemnity may apply. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to
legal costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred in so doing.

The Indemnified Party shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the
defence or settlement of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged
infringement brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity may apply or
any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying Party to which
the indemnity may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which the indemnity may apply or in
the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party is likely to be made or brought, the
Indemnifying Party may at its own expense either:

34.12.1 modify any or all of the affected documents, software, materials, items or other
things whatsoever without reducing the performance and functionality of the
same, or substitute alternative items, products or services of equivalent
performance and functionality for any or all of the documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever, so as to avoid the infringement or
the alleged infringement but without disrupting the performance of the Services,
provided that the terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis to such modified or
substituted items or services and such modified or substituted items shall be
acceptable to the Indemnified Party (whether by passing any form of
acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party all reasonable
costs directly incurred by it; or

34.12.2 procure a licence to use the affected documents, software, materials, items or
other things whatsoever on terms which afford to the Indemnified Party no more
extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and which are

Services of Clause 34.4; and

34.13.2 provided that the HNG-X Development Completion has not occurred at the time
of the claim, demand or action in respect of such infringement,

the costs of undertaking any modification or substitution or procuring a licence that may
be made or obtained pursuant to Clause 34.12 shall be treated as a normal cost of
development and Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services:

(a) for such modification work on a time cost basis, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule D8; and

(b) in respect of any such substitution or licence, an amount equivalent to
Fujitsu Services' cost of the product used as a substitute and/or of the
necessary licence, multiplied by 95 and divided by 100.

The indemnities set out in this Clause 34 (other than where Clause 34.3.1(b) applies)
shall not apply insofar as any such claim or demand or action is in respect of:

34.14.1 any use by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party of the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) by the Indemnifying Party where such combined use directly gives
rise to the claim, demand or action; or

34.14.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to any item
supplied by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement if such modification is
not authorised by the Indemnifying Party in writing; or

34.14.3any use by the Indemnified Party of the affected documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever in a manner not reasonably to be
inferred from their specification (if any) or the requirements of the Indemnified
Party (including, without limitation, where Post Office is the Indemnified Party,
the Requirements Baseline).

If the Indemnifying Party has availed itself of its rights to modify the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever or to supply substitute products or
services pursuant to Clause 34.12.1 or to procure a licence under Clause 34.12.2 and
such exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim, demand or action for
infringement or alleged infringement, or if the Indemnified Party has unreasonably
withheld its acceptance of any items modified or substituted by the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with Clause 34.12, then the Indemnifying Party shall have no further liability
thereafter under this Clause 34 in respect of the said claim, demand or action.

If a modification or substitution in accordance with Clause 34.12.1 is not possible so as
to avoid the infringement and the Indemnifying Party has been unable to procure a

39A.3.3 Fujitsu Services’ failure to provide the Services in accordance with the Service
Levels arose from a cause beyond Fujitsu Services’ reasonable control.

Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39A.3 and advise Fujitsu
Services of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15
Working Days of receipt. If Fujitsu Services does not accept Post Office’s submission,
the Parties shall meet within 5 Working Days of Fujitsu Services’ receipt of Post Office's
proposal and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the rights and reliefs applicable
to Fujitsu Services in line with Clause 39A.5. Either Party may invite other interested
Tower Contractors to the meeting and in that event shall inform the other Party.

Where the Parties agree that Fujitsu Services would have provided the Services in
accordance with the Service Levels but has failed to do so as a direct result of a Post
Office Cause or a Tower Contractor Cause and has demonstrated compliance with
Clauses 39A.3.1 to 39A.3.3 inclusive then:

39A.5.1 the period in which the relevant Service was affected by the Post Office Cause
or Tower Contractor Cause will not be included in measuring the performance
of any affected Service;

39A.5.2 Fujitsu Services will not be treated as being in breach of this Agreement to the
extent that non-performance or breach is due to the Post Office Cause or
Tower Contractor Cause; and

39A.5.3 Fujitsu Services will be entitled to the Charges for the relevant Services
affected by Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause as if it had not
occurred provided that Fujitsu Services mitigates those Charges to the extent
that it is able and passes on any reduction in the Charges to Post Office.

In order to claim the rights and reliefs in Clause 39A.5, Fujitsu Services’ submission
pursuant to Clause 39A.3 will be provided within 15 Working Days after it has notified
Post Office of a claim that Clause 39A.2 applies and that Fujitsu Services is applying for
the rights and relief set out in Clause 39A.5.

In the event of a dispute, either Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance
with schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance within 15 Working Days,
such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both Parties will continue
to resolve the causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

Costs incurred due to Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause

In this Clause 39B, claims for reimbursement of additional costs and expenses may be
claimed insofar as the Parties have not agreed to recompense Fujitsu Services
elsewhere in this Agreement. Where the Parties have agreed to recompense Fujitsu
Services elsewhere in this Agreement, Fujitsu Services may not make any claim under
this Clause 39B.

If Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that it has incurred additional costs and
expenses as a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any

additional work or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office
Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, then Fujitsu Services shall claim for reimbursement
of those additional costs and in accordance with the claim process set out in Clause
39B.3.

To the extent that Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that Clause 39B.2 applies,
Fujitsu Services may make a written submission to Post Office within 3 months of the
commencement of the Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause seeking
reimbursement of additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred
as a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any additional work
or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office Cause or Tower
Contractor Cause. Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to any additional costs and
expenses, unless Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable
satisfaction that:

39B.3.1 Fujitsu Services could not have avoided the effect on the provision of the
Services and/or on its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement by
using all reasonable endeavours to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of
the delay in accordance with Good Industry Practice and having regard to the
scope of the Services for which Fujitsu Services is responsible; and

39B.3.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Fujitsu Services used all reasonable endeavours to minimise
such costs,

and Fujitsu Services will provide any additional information that Post Office may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Fujitsu Services’ claim.

Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39B.3 and advise Fujitsu
Services of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15
Working Days of receipt. If Fujitsu Services does not accept Post Office's submission,
the Parties shall meet within 5 Working Days of Fujitsu Services’ receipt of Post Office's
proposal and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the amount of compensation
applicable to Fujitsu Services. Either Party may invite other interested Tower
Contractors to the meeting and in that event shall inform the other Party.

The agreed costs will be shown as an additional amount on the next Operational
Charges invoice due to be issued under this Agreement. If no Operational Charges
invoice is due to be issued then Fujitsu Services will issue an invoice.

In the event of a dispute, either Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance
with schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance within 15 Working Days,
such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both Parties will continue
to resolve the causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that in respect of a Post Office Cause or a Tower
Contractor Cause, a materiality threshold applies in respect of costs claimed for
reimbursement pursuant to Clause 39B.3 and that Fujitsu Services will not be entitled to
claim for reimbursement of costs pursuant to that Clause unless and until additional

Effects of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure

For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the earlier of notification to Fujitsu Services of the
appointment of the Post Office Service Integrator by Post Office or the termination of
any Terminable Service and the contracting of a replacement for said service by Post
Office with a Tower Contractor under its Towers Model, there shall be no Fujitsu
Dependencies.

Upon agreement of any Fujitsu Dependencies, Fujitsu Services undertakes to notify
Post Office as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that it has not, will
not, or is unlikely to fulfil any Fujitsu Services Dependency or will be delayed from doing
so (a “Fujitsu Dependency Failure”). In the event that Post Office has not been
notified by Fujitsu Services in accordance with this Clause 39C.2 but Post Office is
aware or becomes aware of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, then Post Office shall notify
Fujitsu Services of such Fujitsu Dependency Failure.

Notwithstanding actions to be taken under any Incident management process to resolve
a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, within 5 Working Days after providing notice or receiving
notice under Clause 39C.2, Fujitsu Services shall submit a report relating to the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Fujitsu Dependency Failure Report”) to Post Office setting
out full details of the reasons for, the issues arising out of and the steps which Fujitsu
Services is taking to minimise the impact of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on Post
Office and/or the Tower Contractors to the extent to which the potential impact of a
particular Fujitsu Dependency Failure was agreed as part of the agreement of the
particular Fujitsu Dependency. In addition, it shall notify Post Office of the actions it
intends to take to prevent the recurrence of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure in the
future.

Fujitsu Services shall take reasonable steps to perform its obligations under the
Agreement and use its reasonable endeavours to take precautions which it ought
reasonably to have taken in accordance with Good Professional Practice in order to
avoid or mitigate the potential impacts of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on Post Office,
and/or the relevant Tower Contractors.

Fujitsu Services shall co-operate and work with Post Office, the Tower Contractors
and/or any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) to mitigate the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure.

39C.6 In the event of a Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, Fujitsu Services shall co-

39C.7

operate, support, collaborate and work with Post Office, other Tower Contractors and/or
any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) so that Post Office and/or
relevant Tower Contractors are able to mitigate the effect of the Post Office Cause or
Tower Contractor Cause.

Once a Fujitsu Dependency Failure has been resolved and in any event no later than 30
days (or such period as may be agreed by the Parties) after the occurrence of the

Fujitsu Dependency Failure, the Subject Leads for the Relationship best qualified to
deal with the Fujitsu Dependency Failure, taking into account its nature and the
responsibilities of each Subject Lead, shall convene an occasional meeting of the
relevant Relationship in accordance with paragraph 3.3 of Schedule A2 to agree
responsibility for the Fujitsu Dependency Failure (including where appropriate the
preparation of a root cause analysis).

Post Office may make a written request to Fujitsu Services seeking reimbursement of
demonstrable additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred as a
direct result of steps taken by Post Office and/or a Tower Contractor in carrying out any
additional work or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Compensation Amount”). Post Office shall make any claim
for a Compensation Amount within 3 months of commencement of the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure. Post Office shall not be entitled to any Compensation Amount for
itself or any Tower Contractor unless Post Office can demonstrate to Fujitsu Services’
reasonable satisfaction that:

39C.8.1 Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor could not have avoided the effect on
the provision or receipt of the relevant services and/or on its ability to perform
its obligations under its agreement(s) by using all reasonable endeavours to
eliminate or mitigate the consequences of the delay in accordance with Good
Industry Practice; and

39C.8.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor used all reasonable
endeavours to minimise such costs,

and Post Office will provide any additional information that Fujitsu Services may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Post Office's request.

39C.9 Fujitsu Services will consider any request under Clause 39C.8 and advise Post Office of

its proposal in respect of the Compensation Amount promptly and in any event within 15
Working Days of receipt. If Post Office does not accept Fujitsu Services’ proposal, the
Parties shall meet within 5 Working Days of Post Office’s receipt of Fujitsu Services’
proposal and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the Compensation Amount
applicable. Either Party may invite other interested Tower Contractors to the meeting
and in that event shall inform the other Party.

39C.10 The agreed Compensation Amount will be shown as a credit on the next Operational

390.11

Charges invoice due to be issued under this Agreement. If no Operational Charges
invoice is due to be issued then Post Office will issue a credit note.

In the event of a dispute under this Clause 39C, either Party may refer the matter for
resolution in accordance with Schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance
within 15 Working Days, such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance
with the Dispute Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both
Parties will continue to resolve the causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

Fujitsu Services' Personnel

Post Office reserves the right under this Agreement to refuse to admit to any premises
occupied by or on behalf of any member of the Royal Mail Group (which expression
shall in this Clause 40 include all persons employed or engaged by the Royal Mail
Group and all persons other than Fujitsu Services and its sub-contractors providing
services to the Royal Mail Group), or to any Branch any person employed or engaged
by Fujitsu Services, or by a sub-contractor, whose admission would be, in the
reasonable opinion of Post Office, undesirable.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall provide a list of the names
and addresses of all persons who it is expected may require admission in connection
with the performance of this Agreement to any premises occupied by or on behalf any
member of the Royal Mail Group or to any Branch, specifying the capacities in which
they are concerned with this Agreement and giving such other particulars as Post Office
may reasonably require. Fujitsu Services shall comply with any reasonable directions
issued by the designated representative of Post Office as to which persons may be
admitted to such premises and at what times.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall secure that any person
employed or engaged by Fujitsu Services or by a sub-contractor, who is specified in the
direction or is one of a class of persons who may be so specified, shall sign a statement
that he understands that the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 apply to him both during
the term of and after the expiry or termination of this Agreement.

Fujitsu Services’ representatives, engaged within the boundaries of a Royal Mail Group
establishment or Branch, shall comply with such rules, regulations and requirements
(including those relating to security arrangements) as may be in force from time to time
for the conduct of personnel when at that establishment or Branch and when outside
that establishment or Branch.

The decision of Post Office as to whether any person is to be refused admission to any
premises occupied by or on behalf of the Royal Mail Group or to a Branch shall be final
and conclusive.

Fujitsu Services’ Key Personnel

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of Fujitsu
Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 61, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) (including any proposed or
agreed amendments to it) and the information contained in it (“Personnel Information”)

41.2.1 Post Office may reproduce, copy and disclose Personnel Information:

(a) to Post Office's Subject Leads for (i) the Systems Integration Partnership
and Executive Relationship and (ii) the Commercial Relationship;

(b) to its professional advisers provided such reproduction, copying and
disclosure is necessary for the purposes of this Agreement; or

(c) as required by law,

provided that Post Office shall procure that the persons referred to in
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not themselves disclose Personnel
Information (except amongst themselves) without the express written consent of
Fujitsu Services.

41.2.2 Post Office may discuss Personnel Information with and disclose Personnel
Information to FS Listed Personnel.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to them
(described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001)). However, in the event that any of the Key Personnel become
unavailable for any reason (including without limitation death, injury, sickness,
promotion or resignation), Fujitsu Services shall have the right upon giving 30 days’
notice in writing (or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably practicable) to
Post Office to replace such an individual with another individual whose abilities and
qualifications are appropriate for the services to be performed by such individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be
identified after the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall identify and agree any
such additional key personnel (together with any activities which are relevant to them).

Injury to Persons; Loss of Property

Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this
Clause 42 and except where paragraphs 5.2 or 6.3.3 of Schedule B1.3 apply, Fujitsu
Services shall fully indemnify Post Office in respect of any personal injury or loss of or
damage to Property incurred by Post Office, its contractors or their respective
employees and authorised agents to the extent that such personal injury or loss of
Property is caused by any Default of Fujitsu Services, its employees or agents in
connection with the performance or purported performance of this Agreement.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause 42.1
applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu Services shall at
its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any legal
proceedings that may arise therefrom. Fujitsu Services shall consult with and pay due

regard to the interests and views of Post Office (including the commercial interests of

interests and views. Post Office, its employees and agents, shall at the request of
Fujitsu Services afford all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any such
claim or demand or action and shall be repaid any reasonable expense incurred in so
doing and shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence of
such claim or demand or action.

Notwithstanding Clause 42.2, Post Office shall have the option to take over the conduct
over any claim, demand or action to which this Clause applies. Should Post Office
exercise the aforementioned option it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services against any loss,
damage, cost or expense which it incurs in respect of that claim, demand or action over
and above the monetary amount (which Fujitsu Services shall have notified to Post
Office prior to Post Office exercising its option) at which Fujitsu Services was prepared
to settle said claim, demand or action.

In the event of termination of Project HNG-X:

43.2.1 for convenience pursuant to Clause 47.11.2, the provisions of Clause 43.1 shall

Management Service, Third Line Software Support Service or Application Support
Service (Fourth Line), with effect from the date of termination of the first such Service to

proves that any of the matters referred to in sub-clauses 43.1.1 to 43.1.4 (inclusive)
have been caused by Fujitsu Services' Default in respect of any of its obligations or
responsibilities under this Agreement.

In the event of Partial Termination for any reason of any of the Terminable Services
referred to in Clause 43.3 Fujitsu Services shall promptly provide to Post Office all
correspondence, audit trails, documentation and other information (in whatever media)

For the purposes of Clauses 44.2 and 44.4,

a liability or claim for monetary relief arises when the act, omission, event or
circumstance giving rise to that liability or claim occurs; and

Notwithstanding that Clause 44.2 is stated to be subject to Clause 44.4, Clause 44.4
shall not limit:

44.4B.1 _ liability of the type referred to in Clauses 44.1;
44.4B.2 _ liability for Defaults governed by 44.2.1, 44.2.4 or 44.2.5; or
44.4B.3 liability governed by Clause 44.3.

The financial limits on the liability of Post Office under Clause 44.2 shall be exclusive of
and additional to any liability of Post Office to pay any Charges, other amounts, the
Transfer Payment, the Termination Charge, any Partial Termination Charge or the HNG-
X Termination Charge which may become properly due and payable to Fujitsu Services
in accordance with the provisions hereof or any sum by way of interest thereon that a
court may award.

Subject always to Clause 44.1, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party
for indirect or consequential loss or damage. However:

(a) Fujitsu Services acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to
claim that a loss incurred by a Tower Contractor is an indirect loss solely
because it was not incurred by the Post Office. As such, any loss
incurred by a Tower Contractor that would have been a direct loss if it
had been incurred by the Post Office shall, for the purposes of
determining a Compensation Amount, be deemed to be a direct loss;
and

(b) Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all claims that Fujitsu
Services may make for relief under Clause 39A.3 or Clause 39A.5.3
and for compensation under Clause 39B.3 including for any payments
under Clause 39B.5 shall be made to Post Office and not any of the
Tower Contractors and that all payments of such relief or compensation
shall be by Post Office and not any Tower Contractor.

The provisions of Clause 44.6 shall not be taken as limiting the right of Post Office to
claim from Fujitsu Services for:

44.7.1 additional operational and administrative costs and expenses; and/or

44.7.2 expenditure or charges rendered unnecessary as a result of any Default by
Fujitsu Services; and/or

The Parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision contained in this
Clause be held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law it shall to that
extent be deemed omitted but if any Party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage
which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other
limitations and provisions set out herein.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to relieve either Party of its common law duty to the other Party
against which a claim may be made to mitigate any loss which is the subject of such
claim.

Subject to Clause 44.1, the aggregate liability of Fujitsu Services under the SAP RTU
(including, without limitation, under any indemnity therein) arising in any Financial Year
shall not exceed £1,905,449. Fujitsu Services' liabilities (if any) under the SAP RTU, as
limited by this Clause 44.10, shall count as part of Fujitsu Services’ aggregate liability
under Clause 44.2.3.

The liability of Fujitsu Services in connection with the SAP RTU is as set out in
Clause 44.10 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU. In the event and only to the extent of
any conflict between: (i) Clauses 44.10 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU; and (ii) any
other Clause, then Clause 44.10 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU shall prevail.

Each of the sums referred to in Clauses 44.2.2, 44.2.3(a)(3), 44.3 and 44.10 shall be
increased at the end of the Financial Year ending on or around 31 March, 2007 and at
the end of each subsequent Financial Year by an amount equal to the difference
(expressed as a percentage) between the level of the Retail Price Index most recently
published in respect of December of the Financial Year in question and the level of the
Retail Price Index in December of the preceding Financial Year.

Insurance

Fujitsu Services shall to the extent reasonably possible insure or make provision for
self-insurance against all losses and damages which are the result of its fault or
negligence in performing the Services, including workman's compensation, public
liability, product liability, property damage and professional indemnity. Fujitsu Services
will, if requested in writing by Post Office, produce to Post Office a certificate of
insurance showing the applicable coverage currently in force, and will also give Post
Office prior written notice of (where possible), or written notice no later than 30 days
after, alteration or cancellation of such insurance.

The term of this Agreement shall, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the

If Post Office wishes to extend the term of this Agreement, it shall notify Fujitsu Services
in writing at least 18 months before the expiry of this Agreement, and the Parties shall
meet within 20 Working Days of receipt of such notice and shall use their reasonable
endeavours to agree an extension to the term of this Agreement. Fujitsu Services
acknowledges that Post Office is particularly concerned regarding a material increase in
the operational expenditure in the event that it needs to extend the terms of the
Agreement beyond 31st March 2017. To this end, Fujitsu Services agrees that it shall
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any material increase in the operational charges in
the event of such an extension. In order to avoid such an increase the parties
acknowledge that it may be necessary to upgrade or refresh elements of the
infrastructure via a project (chargeable to the Post Office) and/or to switch off non-
essential elements of the remaining Services. Such amendments and/or changes shall
be included in any agreement to extend the term..

Each Expiring Service shall, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions
of Clause 47 or extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 10 of
Schedule E, be provided for the period up to 31 March 2015 on which date such
Expiring Service shall expire. For the avoidance of doubt, no Partial Termination
Charge or Termination Charge shall be payable by Post Office in relation to an Expiring
Service on the expiry of such Expiring Service on 31 March 2015 (except the POLSAP
Applications Support Service which shall expire on 31 March 2016). Liquidated
damages shall continue to apply during any extension in accordance with Clause 18
save in the case of a mini extension of the Engineering Service where the Actual
Engineering Visits in any month exceeds the related Excepted Engineering Volume by
10%. In such instances, the calculation for liquidated damages in respect of the
Counter Availability SLT shall be based on the average downtime for each of the
hardware components over the previous three months (not including the month in
question), instead of the actual downtime in the month for each of those components.
This shall be calculated using the reported downtime for each problem type prefaced
“HD” in the Local Failure section of the SLT report produced in accordance with Annex A
to the CCD Branch Network Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0011). For the
avoidance of doubt, all other provisions of the Agreement shall continue to apply during
any extension period.

for termination of that Service specified in Annex 1 to Schedule E by
giving Fujitsu Services not less than 3 months’ notice in writing (or 6
months’ notice in writing in the event of termination of the Service Desk
Service and 1 month's notice in writing for CMT Services). In the event
such notice is given a Partial Termination Charge shall be paid by Post
Office to Fujitsu Services upon such Partial Termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is noted that during the 6 months’ notice period for
the Service Desk Service, Post Office retains the option to “ramp down”
the services, noting that it must take account of Post Office’s and the
Next Supplier's obligations (where relevant) to consult with any staff
potentially subject to transfer under the TUPE Regulations.

Post Office may terminate the provision of the CMT Service by giving
Fujitsu Services not less than one month's notice in writing. No
termination or compensation charge shall be payable to Fujitsu Services
in the event of such termination and the provisions of Schedules D6 and
E shall not apply in respect of the CMT Service.

Post Office may terminate the provision of the Superstock Service by
giving Fujitsu Services not less than twelve months’ notice in writing. No
termination or compensation charge shall be payable to Fujitsu Services
in the event of such termination and the provisions of Schedules D6 and
E shall not apply in respect of the Superstock Service.

Unless the Parties agree otherwise in the relevant CCN:

(i) Post Office may terminate the provision of any Service
Integration Service or Third Party Management Service
introduced under the Change Control Procedure after the date of
signature of CCN1200 by giving not less than twelve months’

Termination of Project HNG-X

Subject to Clause 47.11.3 at any time prior to HNG-X Initial Acceptance, Post Office
may terminate Project HNG-X:

47.11.1 by notice in writing, with effect from seven days after service of such notice or
such later date as may be specified therein, if Fujitsu Services is in material
Default of any obligation under this Agreement in relation to Project HNG-X
(and for the purposes of this Clause 47.11.1 only, “material Default” includes
any persistent Default which by reason of its persistence has become material)

and:

(a)

such Default is capable of remedy and Fujitsu Services shall have failed
to remedy the Default within 30 days of written notice to Fujitsu Services
(i) specifying that it is given pursuant to this Clause 47.11.1(a), (ii) giving
details of the Default and why it is considered to be material and (iii)
requiring its remedy, or within such other period as may be requested by
Fujitsu Services and agreed by Post Office, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; or

such Default is not capable of remedy (and for the purposes of this
Clause 47.11.1, failure to comply with a timescale shall not of itself be
considered a Default not capable of remedy) and Post Office shall have
given written notice to Fujitsu Services (i) specifying that it is given
pursuant to this Clause 47.11.1(b) and (ii) giving details of the Default and
why it is considered to be material;

47.11.2by notice in writing, specifying that it is given under this Clause 47.11.2, with
effect from 30 days from the service of such notice. In the event of notice being
given in accordance with this Clause 47.11.2, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu
Services upon termination of Project HNG-X the HNG-X Termination Charge.

47.11.3 Post Office shall not be entitled to exercise its right of termination of the HNG-X
Project under Clause 47.11.2 of the Agreement prior to 30th April 2010. If HNG-
X Initial Acceptance has not occurred by 30th April (which allows for a period of
4 weeks following the planned initial Acceptance Date of 2nd April 2010) then
Post Office may exercise its right of termination of the HNG-X Project under
clause 47.11.2 at any time after 30th April 2010.

47.12 Notwithstanding the termination of Project HNG-X in accordance with Clause 47.11:

47.12.1the Services shall continue to be provided using the Infrastructure until such
time that this Agreement expires in accordance with Clause 46 unless the
Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the other provisions of this
Clause 47; and

and D8 (as applicable).

If Project HNG-X is terminated under:

47.13.1 Clause 47.11.1 or Clause 47.15 (but only as a consequence of the Agreement
terminating pursuant to Clauses 47.1 or 47.2), then Fujitsu Services shall at its
own cost reinstate the Horizon Applications to those Branches in which the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities have been rolled out; or

47.13.2 Clause 47.11.2 or Clause 47.15 (but only as a consequence of the Agreement
terminating pursuant to Clauses 47.4 or 47.7), then Fujitsu Services shall
reinstate the Horizon Applications to those Branches in which the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities have been rolled out. Fujitsu Services’
charges for such reinstatement shall be paid by Post Office and shall be an
amount equal to Fujitsu Services’ costs multiplied by 100 and divided by 78,
provided that such costs are subject to verification under the Open Book
procedure.

If at the date upon which Project HNG-X is terminated in accordance with Clause 47.11,
the move of Data Centres to Fujitsu Services’ premises has been completed, such
move will not be reversed following termination in order that the Services may continue
to be provided using the Data Centres located at Fujitsu Services’ premises. To the
extent that prior to termination of Project HNG-X Data Centre equipment has been put
in place and which relate only to the HNG-X Service Infrastructure, such equipment
shall be decommissioned following termination and the costs of such decommissioning
shall be borne by either Party in accordance with Clause 47.13.

If, for any reason, Post Office or Fujitsu Services gives notice to terminate this
Agreement prior to HNG-X Initial Acceptance, Project HNG-X shall terminate, subject to
Clause 47.16, two weeks after the date of service of such notice, unless the Parties
agree otherwise in accordance with the Change Control Procedure. Any notice
purporting to terminate Project HNG-X given after notice to terminate the Agreement
has been given shall be deemed to be invalid and of no effect. If notices to terminate
the Agreement and Project HNG-X are given on the same day, the notice to terminate
Project HNG-X shall be deemed to have been given first.

If Project HNG-X is terminated in accordance with Clause 47.15, Fujitsu Services shall,
where the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities have been rolled out in
Branches, continue to provide the HNG-X Services using the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities in those Branches until the Horizon Applications have been reinstated
in accordance with Clause 47.13.

48.1.1 any or all of the hardware that is comprised within the Infrastructure and/or that:
(a) _ is being used; or

(b) had previously been used in Branches and is no longer being used (other

other agreements (other than employment agreements and agreements in
relation to Third Party Software, Third Party Items or Non-standard Third Party
Materials) entered into by Fujitsu Services which are necessary to the
performance of the Services as Post Office may designate,

provided that, if termination is in respect of Project HNG-X or a Terminable Service
rather than the entire Agreement, the above provisions shall apply only to those Project

Post Office exercises the option in Clause 48.1 in respect of any Partial Termination or
in respect of termination of Project HNG-X or in respect of the expiry of an Expiring
Service or Clause 48.2.3 applies, the Project Assets acquired by it shall cease to form
part of the Infrastructure and this Agreement shall be amended accordingly as provided
in Schedule E.

Worker from any breach of contract with it (other than in relation to such
person's obligations of confidentiality and notice of termination) which such
acceptance may otherwise involve.

All the assets to be acquired pursuant to the exercise by Post Office of its option under

respect of additional or substitute sub-contractors pursuant to Clause 58.2 is provided,
and shall be granted (as the case may be), on the understanding that Fujitsu Services
shall keep Post Office informed of the general nature and scope of the work to be sub-
contracted and the duration of the relevant sub-contracts (such information to be

supplementing such arrangements or commitments and shall take account of all
reasonable requests and comments that Post Office shall make in connection therewith.

Non-Solicitation

Subject to Clause 48.4.3, neither Party shall during the currency of the Agreement or for

(the "Previous Employer") any Key Individual who is then or shall have been in the
previous three months either:

59.1.1 an employee of the Previous Employer; or

59.1.2 engaged by the Previous Employer as a contractor performing the services of
such an employee.

In the event that such Key Individual is employed or engaged by the other Party with the
agreement of the other Party (such agreement to include without limitation agreed
transfer of work and associated staff between the Parties during the term of the
Agreement) or after redundancy from the Previous Employer, the Previous Employer
shall not (unless agreed otherwise) be paid any sum by the other Party by way of
compensation.

If either Party is in breach of this condition that Party will pay to the other Party by way
of liquidated damages and not by way of penalty the Solicitation Fee.

Nothing in this Clause 59 is intended to prevent or frustrate the right of any individual to
seek employment as he thinks fit.

Force Majeure

For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any
cause affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts,
events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations
(subject to Clause 60.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only
be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if a
substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to the
cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event shall
any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the Services for
which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 43.1 constitute a Force Majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall use all
reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of, such
obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In the
case of any such failure or delay on the part of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall agree
an orderly process for such continuation or resumption of performance (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply with
such process. Fujitsu Services shall remain liable to perform the Business Continuity
Services, save where such Business Continuity Services are themselves also affected
by Force Majeure, in which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use all reasonable
endeavours to perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one Working Day and shall inform Post Office of the
period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office shall
become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such failure or
delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one Working Day and
shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that such failure or delay
shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or company
with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply arrangement or
sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to Force Majeure
only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be prevented from or
delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply arrangement or
sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force Majeure and there is no
substitute person, firm or company reasonably available (having regard, without
limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days, Post Office may after
consulting with Fujitsu Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 47.1.5.

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party is delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 60.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a reasonable
extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional costs or
expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify the other
Party in writing within one Working Day of becoming aware of the Force Majeure event.

Political Risk

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 60.1 to 60.5, a change of, or new,
Governmental Regulation:

60.7.1 shall not entitle Post Office to terminate this Agreement under Clause 60.5, and
any such purported termination shall be treated as a termination for
convenience in accordance with Clause 47.7; and

60.7.2 shall not require Fujitsu Services to perform any additional obligations, or any
reduced or modified obligations resulting in increased cost to Fujitsu Services,
without its agreement in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

confidentiality which Post Office or its agents or contractors may owe to their respective
personnel. In such circumstances, Post Office shall use its reasonable endeavours to
obtain appropriate consent for the release of such information.

details referred to in Clause 75.2 as transferring pursuant to the Transfer
Regulations and (ii) relates to employer's liabilities arising in relation to
that employee's service after the said transfer of employment which are
disclosed in writing to Fujitsu Services and/or any of its sub-contractors
prior to the said transfer or relates to the employee's termination after the
said transfer; or

reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any failure by Post
Office or any of its agents or contractors to comply with its or their obligations
under Regulation 13 of the Transfer Regulations save to the extent such failure
is attributable to the failure of Fujitsu Services to comply with its obligations
under the same Regulation.

In the event that the Transfer Regulations apply on the commencement of the POLSAP
Services, Fujitsu Services shall indemnify Post Office (on its own behalf and on behalf
of its agents and contractors) against:

1.1 In Clause 2 of this Agreement Post Office has stated that it is its present intention to appoint Fujitsu

Services as Preferred Systems Integrator with a wider scope of operation than the Infrastructure and
with the potential to include all Relevant IT Systems in that scope. The purpose of such appointment
would be to exploit the appropriate IT and services to drive Post Office's business strategy. This
Schedule sets out the rights and obligations of a Preferred Systems Integrator and the terms upon
which Post Office would be willing to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator.

1.2 The Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship shall review opportunities to create
value for Post Office by Fujitsu Services taking on the Systems Integration of additional IT systems
and services, and shall maintain a list of such opportunities in a Working Document.

2s SCOPE

241 For the purposes of this Schedule A1, “Preferred Systems Integrator’ shall mean the person
appointed by Post Office from time to time to carry out the procurement, integration, provision and
management of any or all applications, infrastructure and services required by Post Office for the
purposes of integrating some or all of the following information technology systems:

2.1.1. any new IT system acquired by Post Office which is required by Post Office to interface with
the Infrastructure;

2.1.2 any existing IT system used by Post Office which interfaces or is required to interface with
the Infrastructure; or

2.1.3 any other IT system currently in use or acquired by Post Office after the Amendment Date
which is not required to interface with the Infrastructure, but excluding any system that is
provided as a shared information technology system with other parts of the Royal Mail
Group,

(each a “Relevant IT System”, together the “Relevant IT Systems”).

2.2 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, such responsibility may involve the Preferred Systems Integrator undertaking the
provision of operating, support, development and maintenance activities associated with Systems
Integration using either its own resources or by procuring some or all of such associated activities
from subcontractors. Where such associated activities are procured from third parties, the Preferred
Systems Integrator shall remain solely responsible to Post Office for their provision.

3. APPOINTMENT

3.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige Post Office to appoint Fujitsu Services as its sole Preferred
Systems Integrator. However, it is Post Office’s present intention, subject to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3,
to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator within twelve months of the
Amendment Date.

3.2 Post Office, at its sole discretion but acting reasonably in accordance with paragraphs 3.3, 3.4 and
3.5, shall determine:

3.2.1. when Fujitsu Services is first appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator;
3.2.2 which categories of Relevant IT Systems that initial appointment covers; and
3.2.3 the timing and extent of any subsequent additions to that scope.

3.3 Post Office's determination of the matters referred to in paragraph 3.2 shall be based on Post
Office's assessment of (a) the extent to which Fujitsu Services has met the criteria for selection of a
Preferred Systems Integrator as set out in paragraph 3.4, taking account of the matters set out in
paragraph 3.5 and (b) Fujitsu Services’ performance of its obligations under this Agreement as
monitored by Post Office and disclosed to Fujitsu Services in accordance with the processes set out
in Schedule A2.

3.4 Post Office's criteria for selecting a Preferred Systems Integrator will comprise the candidate's ability
to demonstrate (by reference where appropriate to any track record with Post Office) that it can, with
respect to large scale complex IT systems such as that used in relation to the Horizon Service

Infrastructure:

3.4.1. work collaboratively with other Post Office suppliers in delivering Post Office end to end
requirements;

3.4.2 manage third party service and product suppliers to deliver integrated solutions;
3.4.3 deliver continual improvements in levels of service;

3.4.4 deliver value for money to Post Office;

3.4.5 use innovation to improve Post Office competitiveness;

3.4.6 deliver application developments consistently within time, at or below cost budgets and to
required quality;

3.4.7 select supplier-independent products and services most appropriate to meet Post Office
requirements; and

3.4.8 adopt ways of working based on a relationship of mutual trust.

3.5 In evaluating Fujitsu Services’ performance against the criteria set out in paragraph 3.4, Post Office
shall take account of the following:

3.5.1 Fujitsu Services' progress on completing Project HNG-X within time, at or below cost
budgets and to required quality;

3.5.2 the ability of Fujitsu Services SIP Team Members, and/or Fujitsu Services, to generate and
implement innovative ideas to either reduce Post Office costs or improve Post Office
efficiency;

3.5.3 Fujitsu Services recommending the selection of other companies’ (rather than its own)
products and services where these are demonstrably a better fit with Post Office's
requirements;

3.5.4 Fujitsu Services demonstrating in relation to at least one Service that they are best value for
money;

3.5.5 Fujitsu Services adopting new ways of working such as transparency on costing for new
proposals, not 'man marking’ (which means a situation where both Parties utilise individuals
to manage a Service or other aspects of the Services) and, where appropriate, adoption of
‘win-win’ as the way of resolving issues; and

3.5.6 when considering additions to the scope of Fujitsu Services’ Preferred Systems Integrator
role, its performance of that role in relation to its existing scope.

3.6 Without prejudice to any Systems Integration activities being provided by Fujitsu Services under this
Agreement, Post Office reserves the right to seek competitive bids for any Systems Integration
activities in relation to Relevant IT Systems where it considers it would be in the best interests of
Post Office to do so. Fujitsu Services (having been appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator)
would be invited to bid in all such competitions.

3.7 The appointment of Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator will be terminated with
immediate effect upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement.

3.8 The appointment of Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator may be terminated or the
scope within which it has such a role reduced with immediate effect by Post Office in its sole
discretion:

3.8.1. should Fujitsu Services unreasonably refuse to accept responsibility for any Relevant IT
System nominated by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 4; or

3.8.2 should Fujitsu Services fail to fulfil its obligations under this Schedule A1.

3.9 Should Fujitsu Services be appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator and such appointment be
terminated or its scope reduced under paragraph 3.8, Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement to provide Systems Integration activities for the HNG-X Services shall continue in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

4. RESPONSIBILITY

41 At any time following Post Office's appointment of Fujitsu Services as its Preferred Systems
Integrator, Post Office shall be entitled to nominate any Relevant IT System as a system for which
Post Office would like the Preferred Systems Integrator to assume responsibility and shall disclose
full details of the Relevant IT System to the Preferred Systems Integrator. The terms on which the
Preferred Systems Integrator assumes such responsibility shall be subject to agreement in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

4.2 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, activities in relation to the Relevant IT System will commence within three months of

Schedule A1 Version 9.0

paragraph 4.1 or such other period agreed between the Parties.

4.3 Post Office shall facilitate discussions between the Preferred Systems Integrator and any current
supplier of products and/or services that are relevant to the nominated Relevant IT System. Where
requested by the Preferred Systems Integrator, Post Office shall use reasonable endeavours to
procure that Post Office's existing contracts with such suppliers that are relevant to the nominated
Relevant IT System are assigned to or novated in favour of the Preferred Systems Integrator.

44 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, the Preferred Systems Integrator shall be responsible for all Systems Integration
activities in relation to each Relevant IT System which Post Office nominates to the intent that the
Preferred Systems Integrator shall ensure that:

4.4.2 the interoperability and performance across Relevant IT Systems meet the required service
and performance levels applicable to each Relevant IT System.

5. VALUE FOR MONEY

with the principles set out in Schedule D6, without causing delay to any of the other Market Testing
activities described in that Schedule.

5.2 Where the Preferred Systems Integrator procures associated activities from a third party in
accordance with paragraph 2.2, the provision of those activities shall be subject to market testing.
Where Fujitsu Services is appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator, such market testing will be
conducted in accordance with the principles set out in Schedule D6 without causing delay to any of
the other Market Testing activities described in that Schedule and validated in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule D4.

GOVERNANCE FOR TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE TOWERS
MODEL

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that the supplier that Post Office chooses as its Post
Office Service Integrator for the new Towers Model may act as Post Office’s managing
partner. Subject to paragraphs 9.4 and 9.6 below, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled, on behalf of Post Office, to exercise
any rights or perform any obligations of Post Office under this Agreement, provided that
only Post Office shall be entitled to exercise its rights under Clauses 47, 58 and 66 of
the Agreement and paragraph 7 of Annex 2 to Schedule A2.

For the purposes of the Post Office Service Integrator performing its role as a managing
partner for the Post Office and subject to paragraphs 9.1 and 9.4, references in this
Agreement to Post Office shall be interpreted to refer to or include Post Office Service
Integrator as relevant. Post Office’s opinion shall prevail in the event of any dispute as
to whether a reference refers to or includes the Post Office Service Integrator.
Delegation to the Post Office Service Integrator shall be without prejudice to Post
Office's right to exercise its rights under any provision of the Agreement on its own
behalf. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph 9 is intended to create a
separate contract between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Service Integrator or to
assign or novate this Agreement or any part of it to Post Office Service Integrator.

In the event that Post Office appoints the Post Office Service Integrator to manage
some or all of its IT services on its behalf, Fujitsu Services shall perform all its
Obligations owed to Post Office under this Agreement to the Post Office Service
Integrator as if the Post Office Service Integrator is Post Office. To the extent that
Fujitsu Services fails to perform its obligations under the Agreement, Post Office retains
the ability to enforce its rights against Fujitsu Services and require it to perform those
obligations. In the event that either Party considers co-operation and collaboration
between Fujitsu Services, Post Office Service Integrator and other Tower Contractors is
not in accordance with this paragraph 9, then either Party may escalate the issue
through the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Without prejudice to Post Office's right to exercise its rights under any provision of the
Agreement on its own behalf, in the event that Post Office Service Integrator exercises
the rights of Post Office under Clauses 23, 24 or 25 of the Agreement, Fujitsu Services
shall only be required to disclose details of the aggregated price of performing the
Services and not details of pricing for specific Services or details of the cost base it uses
to calculate such prices which may indicate Fujitsu Services’ pricing strategy or pricing
levels to Post Office Service Integrator.

Without prejudice to paragraph 9.1 above but subject to paragraph 9.6 below, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to
attend any of the meetings described in this Schedule either in addition to Post Office or
on behalf of and as the representative of Post Office. The Post Office Service
Integrator may in some instances be the sole representative of Post Office at such
meetings or governance boards and will be responsible for the relationship relevant to
those meetings or governance boards. Where Post Office Service Integrator attends a
meeting on behalf of Post Office, Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to

Post Office shall ensure that it has a representative at the following governance boards
in addition to or instead of Post Office Service Integrator:

9.6.1 Executive Relationship;
9.6.2 Commercial Relationship; and
9.6.3 Acceptance Board Dispute.

As part of its transition to the Towers Model and in order to ensure the smooth and
effective delivery of end-to-end services to Post Office, Post Office may require its
suppliers of IT services to enter into good faith negotiations and agree non-disclosure
agreements with other Tower Contractors and/or other third parties (“NDA(s)”) and
operating level agreement(s) (“OLA(s)") setting out each supplier's respective
obligations and dependencies to Post Office and each other supplier. Fujitsu Services
shall, where reasonably requested by Post Office, use its reasonable endeavours to
enter into NDA(s) and OLA(s) with Post Office Service Integrator and/or any Tower
Contractors and/or any other third parties within 3 months of such notification by Post
Office. In the event that Fujitsu Services has not or considers it will not be able to enter
into NDAs and/or OLAs within such 3 month timescale, Fujitsu Services shall promptly
notify Post Office of any issues preventing compliance with such 3 month timescale and
the Parties shall work together to address the issues in good faith within a reasonable
timescale to be agreed mutually. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree a
reasonable timescale, either Party may escalate the matter through the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office shall not be a party to
any such NDA or OLA.

Post Office may wish to make changes to the governance structure in this Agreement to
align with its new Tower Model and to implement changes associated with any OLA. All
such changes shall be managed as a change to the Agreement and implemented via
the Change Control Procedure. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge for any
additional costs or risks as a result of changes to the existing governance structure in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

Fujitsu Services shall collaborate reasonably with Post Office Service Integrator and the
Tower Contractors by adopting Good Professional Practice in relation to collaborating
and co-operating with Tower Contractors to enable Post Office to maximize the benefit
of the strategic IT supply chain and optimal target operating model selected by Post
Office for its IT and change transformation programme including by:

9.9.1 responding to and following the Post Office Service Integrator’s instructions,
including meeting all timescales, where provided in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement;

9.9.2 save as set out in the Agreement, reporting to the Post Office Service Integrator
as if it were Post Office;

9.9.3 co-operating with the Post Office Service Integrator where it seeks to manage
and resolve issues between the Tower Contractors including any Incidents;

9.9.4 providing the Services in accordance with collaboration requirements and
responsibilities set out in Schedule F.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge Post Office for
its demonstrable additional costs in complying with this paragraph 9.9 which the Parties
shall agree through the Change Control Procedure to the extent to which such costs are
not covered by the (i) Charges relating to the other Services provided under this
Agreement and (ii) de minimis amount of time being equivalent to 15 man days of
additional effort (over and above those activities performed by Fujitsu Services prior to
the implementation of some or all of the Tower model) in any quarter (being January to
March, April to June, July to September and October to December) incurred by Fujitsu
Services in complying with this paragraph 9.9.

Fujitsu Services shall at all times work with Post Office and Post Office Service
Integrator, in good faith, to develop governance processes, collaboration arrangements
and meeting structures in relation to the provision of the Services in order to:

9.10.1 facilitate consistent management, reporting, and sharing of information between
Fujitsu Services, Post Office Service Integrator and Post Office (as applicable);
and

9.10.2 support and assist the delivery of the Services to Post Office and the delivery of
other relevant Tower services by Post Office Service Integrator and other Tower
Contractors, to Post Office.

The Fujitsu Subject Lead for the Executive Relationship (or a suitable alternative in
terms of seniority, decision making ability and knowledge of this Agreement) shall attend
meetings of the governance board entitled “Supply Chain Member Board” instituted
under the agreement between the Post Office Service Integrator and Post Office.

Annex 2 to Schedule A2

Dispute Resolution Procedures

INTRODUCTION
The Parties shall use the Dispute Resolution Procedure to resolve any Dispute.

There may, subject to the other provisions of this Annex 2 to Schedule A2, be up to five
stages (each a "Stage") to the DRP as follows:

1.2.1 the Subject Lead Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 2;
1.2.2 the Executive Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 3;

1.2.3. the Board Review (including facilitation by an expert) to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 4;

1.2.4 provided that the Parties agree to such procedure, mediation (to be carried out
in accordance with paragraph 6) or expert determination (to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 7); and

1.2.5 where any mediation does not resolve the Dispute or the Parties do not agree to
the use of mediation or expert determination, or as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, resolution through the courts of England.

The Parties may relax the timescales referred to in the DRP by mutual agreement (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

SUBJECT LEAD REVIEW

Subject to paragraph 2.2, as soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter it
shall refer the Dispute to the Subject Leads best qualified to deal with the Dispute
(taking into account the nature of the Dispute and the responsibilities of each Subject
Lead) for resolution within five Working Days of the date of referral (the “Subject Lead
Review’). If the Dispute relates to the interpretation of this Agreement or to the amount
or terms of invoices, then the Dispute shall be referred to the Commercial Relationship
for resolution.

As soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter in relation to the SIP it
shall refer the Dispute to Executive Review described in paragraph 3.

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

In the event that the Subject Leads of the Relationship to which the Dispute is referred
under paragraph 2 fail to resolve that Dispute, the Dispute shall be referred to the
Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship for resolution in
accordance with this paragraph 3 (the "Executive Review"). Each Party shall, no later
than five Working Days after such failure (or as soon as reasonably practicable if the

Dispute is in relation to the SIP), provide the other with a Statement of Dispute. If the
Parties agree to do so, such statements may be provided sequentially by one Party
responding to the Statement of Dispute of the other.

The Subject Leads of the Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship
or other individuals nominated by each Party suitably empowered to deal with executive
matters (the “Nominated Executives”) will be responsible for collating all relevant
information relating to the Dispute and for progressing the Dispute through the DRP-
until it is resolved or determined.

The Executive Review shall take place within ten Working Days of the referral with the
object of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith negotiation.

The Parties may agree, before the Executive Review referred to in paragraph 3.3 takes
place, or if that review fails to resolve the Dispute referred to it, to appoint an expert
facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to assist with resolution of the Dispute on the following basis:

3.4.1. The Facilitator will be appointed as soon as reasonably practicable;
3.4.2 The Facilitator shall be an individual who:

3.4.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the
Dispute; and

3.4.2.2 is approved by both Parties (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

3.4.3 In the event that the Parties fail to agree upon an individual as the Facilitator,
the Facilitator shall be appointed at the request of Post Office or Fujitsu
Services (whichever is the earlier) by the President for the time being of the
Institution of Engineering and Technology so long as such appointee shall meet
the criterion in paragraph 3.4.2.1.

3.4.4 The Facilitator shall act as a facilitator and not as an expert or arbitrator and his
fees shall be borne by the Parties in equal shares.

3.4.5 Within five Working Days of appointment of the Facilitator the Parties shall
submit to the Facilitator:

3.4.5.1 each Party's Statement of Dispute (as amended to reflect matters
discussed so far), such statement also to be disclosed to the
other Party; and

3.4.5.2 a joint agreed statement describing the scope of the initial
guidance required from the Facilitator.

3.4.6 The Dispute shall be referred to the Facilitator to obtain such initial guidance
and the Parties shall request that the Facilitator gives such guidance within 15
Working Days of receipt of the Statement of Dispute from both Parties. The

Facilitator shall not be required to determine the Dispute unless the Parties
agree that he shall be appointed as an Expert in accordance with paragraph 7.

3.4.7. Once the Facilitator has given to the Parties his initial guidance on the Dispute,
the Nominated Executives shall meet within five Working Days of the initial
guidance being given and attempt to resolve the Dispute with the advice and
guidance of the Facilitator within ten Working Days of the meeting.

BOARD REVIEW

If the Dispute is not resolved by the Executive Review, the Parties may, if both Parties
agree, refer the Dispute for review by (i) either or both of the Operations Director of the
Post Office and/or the Procurement Director of the Royal Mail Group ple and (ii) the
Commercial Division Director, Fujitsu Services (the “Board Review”).

The Board Review shall take place within five Working Days of the referral with the
object of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith negotiation.

If the Dispute is not resolved within ten Working Days of the Board Review, the Parties
may, if both Parties agree, refer the Dispute to a Mediator (for resolution in accordance
with paragraph 6) or to an Expert (for determination in accordance with paragraph 7).

If the Parties do not reach agreement whether (a) to refer the Dispute for resolution by
Board Review, within 15 Working Days of completing the Executive Review, or (b) to
refer the Dispute to a Mediator or an Expert pursuant to paragraph 4.3, either Party may
seek resolution of the Dispute through the courts of England. Notwithstanding the
requirement in paragraph 4.2, if the Board Review has not taken place within 20
Working Days of referral, either Party may seek resolution of the Dispute through the
courts of England.

STATEMENT OF DISPUTE

A “Statement of Dispute” means a signed and dated statement of a Subject Lead
containing the following information:

5.1.1 the name, job title, postal address and contact telephone number of the Subject
Lead making the statement on behalf of one Party and that of the Subject Lead
of the other Party to whom the statement is given (each such Subject Lead
being a “Dispute Owner”);

5.1.2 an adequate description of the Dispute, from the perspective of the Party on
whose behalf the statement is made;

5.1.3. any dates by which an output or decision is required for operational reasons;
and

5.1.4 any recommendation for the resolution of the Dispute which the Dispute Owner
considers appropriate.

5.2.2 the output or decision required from the next Stage of the DRP,
to be used by or in connection with the next stage of the DRP.
MEDIATION

At any time after the Executive Review, the Parties may agree that the Dispute shall be
referred to mediation. In the event that the Parties agree to mediation, the Parties will be
responsible for appointing the mediator (the "Mediator"), but in the event that they are
unable to agree on a Mediator either or both of the Parties shall request the Centre for
Dispute Resolution ("CEDR") to appoint a Mediator.

The Parties shall, with the assistance of the Mediator, seek to agree the mediation
procedure. In default of such agreement, the Mediator shall act in accordance with
CEDR rules. The Parties shall, within five Working Days of the date on which the terms
of the mediation are settled, meet the Mediator in order to agree a programme for the
exchange of any relevant information and the structure to be adopted for the mediation.

Subject to agreement between the Parties, the mediation shall take place within 30
Working Days of the appointment of the Mediator.

EXPERT DETERMINATION
At any time after the Board Review, the Parties may agree that the Dispute shall be
referred to an expert ("Expert"), appointed by the Parties, for final determination of the

Dispute.

The Expert shall be appointed as soon as reasonably practicable and shall be an
individual who:

7.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the Dispute in
question; and

7.2.2 is approved by both Parties (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

In the event that the Parties fail to agree upon the Expert to be appointed, the Expert
shall be appointed, at the request of Post Office or Fujitsu Services, by the President for
the time being of the Institution of Engineering and Technology so long as such
appointee shall meet the criterion specified in paragraph 7.2.1.

The Expert appointed under paragraph 7.2 shall act on the following basis:

7.4.1 the Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator;

Planning of Pre-Committed Resource

INNER CORE TEAM TO 31ST MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Inner Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st
March 2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Inner Core Team
for such period shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist
knowledge and experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post
Office's needs under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase
in cost or time for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or
re-discovered that key knowledge.

The Inner Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 9 full time
posts covered by 12 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Inner Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes
which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel is not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

Limited changes: The Inner Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets
and numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN1271c and such
elements may not be varied prior to 31st March 2015 other than under the process set
out in paragraph 3 below in relation to skill sets only.

The additional provisions regarding the Inner Core Team set out in paragraphs 11 and 12
below shall apply with effect from 1st April 2015 except that paragraph 11 will not apply
in the event that the Inner Core Team is terminated by Post Office pursuant to
paragraph 12 below.

OUTER CORE TEAM TO 31st MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Outer Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st
March 2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Outer Core Team
shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist knowledge and
experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post Office's needs
under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase in cost or time
for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or re-discovered
that key knowledge.

The Outer Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 15 full time
posts covered by 18 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Outer Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes

d)

which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel are not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

Right to cancel Outer Core Team: Post Office shall have the right to cancel the Outer
Core Team effective from the second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c. Post Office
may exercise such option in writing to the Fujitsu Services Commercial Director up to 21
months from signature of CCN1271c only. If such break option is not activated, the
Outer Core Team shall continue in place as normal until 31st March 2015.

Limited Changes: The Outer Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets
and numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN 1271c and such
elements may only be varied:

i) in relation to numbers of persons and posts only, on Post Office giving 9
months’ notice after that date. Post Office shall not reduce the numbers of
persons and/or posts of the Outer Core Team as initially set by more than 20%
during the initial 2 years from signature of CCN1271c. During years 3-5 from
signature of CCN1271c, assuming Post Office has not invoked the break option
at point 2(b) above, Post Office may reduce the numbers of persons and/or
posts of the Outer Core Team by up to 20% in total of the size existing at the
second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c during the remainder of the Term
of the Agreement. Should Post Office not have utilised the full 20% reduction
during the initial 2 years, then the remaining balance is not carried over to the
3rd-5th years.

ii) In relation to skill sets only, under the process set out in point 3) below.

VARIATIONS TO SKILL SETS OF THE INNER AND OUTER CORE
TEAMS:

Where forecast utilisation of a specified skill set within either the Inner Core Team or Outer
Core Team is less than 50% for three or more succeeding months, Post Office may request
at the Demand Planning Forum for that skill set to be exchanged for another skill set where
consistent demand is shown. Post Office may, after the first anniversary of signature of
CCN1271c, change 1 person in the Inner Core Team and 2 people within the Outer Core
team under this provision each year.

Where the replacement persons are from the Inner Core Team, the Outer Core Team or the
Standing Team, it is expected that Post Office will normally backfill that post, leaving the
total within each team unchanged. Post Office's rights in respect of team size reductions
under the other provisions of CCN1271c would be unaffected.

Post Office’s entitlement to discounts will be unaffected by exchanges of personnel under
this paragraph.

Only in the event that the Post Office has requested the substitution, any re-skilling
requirements for the replacement resource will be chargeable to the Post Office provided
that Fujitsu Services shall take all reasonable endeavours to minimise the need for such re-
skilling.

an individual with another individual whose abilities and qualifications are appropriate
for the services to be performed by such individual. Fujitsu Services shall submit to Post
Office the CV of any such replacement and shall take any representation from Post
Office in response under due consideration. Post Office shall not be charged for any
training required to bring such staff up to the required standard of knowledge.

STANDING TEAM TO 31st MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree a Standing Team of resources for the period up to 31st March 2015
under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Standing Team during such period
shall consist of an agreed number of personnel per grade sufficient to meet the Fujitsu
Services forecasted minimum level of resources required, over and above the Inner Core
Team and the Outer Core Team, to match the minimum Fujitsu Services forecasted
workload anticipated within the next rolling 9 month period. This is initially set at 20.9 full
time posts covered by 23 people. Post Office may terminate individual resource from this
team on 3 months’ notice after completion of the first 9 months. Post Office shall have the
final say on what quantity of personnel for each grade is included within the Standing Team
from the recommended list provided by Fujitsu Services. For replacements, Fujitsu Services
shall recommend its suggested candidate plus at least 1 other qualified candidate and Post
Office may request further candidates where, for good reason, neither of the submitted
candidates is acceptable. Fujitsu Services remains the final arbiter on who fills each post, as
long as they meet the required qualifications and experience.”

SPARE CAPACITY

i) In the event that a member of the Inner Core Team, Outer Core Team or the
Standing Team is unallocated to a particular task for any period, Fujitsu Services
shall notify Post Office as soon as possible, in any event at the next succeeding
Demand Planning Board. Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to
locate work either on or off the programme to utilise this spare capacity and report
its findings to Post Office. Where staff are used other than to support Post Office
programmes or services, charges shall be reduced accordingly and Post Office
shall not pay anything for any time any persons are working on non-Post Office
matters or are unavailable for reasons of sickness, corporate training, leave etc.
Where staff are available but are unable to be utilised or re-deployed, charges shall

ji) In the event that Fujitsu Services is unable to locate sufficient work to fill such spare
capacity, Post Office shall have the option to identify work for the individual, either

latter case, such work would be brought within the contract scope to ensure that a
contractual framework was provided for the services performed.

Core Team or Outer Core Team role, Fujitsu Services shall:

i) provide to Post Office a revised potential cost for that role to include the re-training
etc required. Fujitsu Services shall also provide all reasonable information in
relation to any potential risks from the Offshoring to allow Post Office to make an
informed decision on whether Offshoring is advisable in the particular case. Where

Within the context of the following sections of this Schedule the term "change" includes
both amendments and changes.

PRINCIPLES

Where Post Office or Fujitsu Services identifies the need for a change, then Post Office
may at any time request a change or Fujitsu Services may at any time recommend a
change. Such a request or recommendation shall only be made and shall only be valid if
authorised (in each case) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 of
this Schedule.

Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu Services shall unreasonably withhold or delay their
agreement to any change or proposal in relation thereto.

Until such time as a change has been fully authorised in accordance with the
procedures set out in paragraph 3 of this Schedule, Post Office and Fujitsu Services
shall continue as if the change had not been made.

Any discussions which may take place between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a
change before its authorisation shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party.

Any purported change provided by Fujitsu Services that has not been otherwise agreed
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1 above shall be undertaken entirely at
the expense and liability of Fujitsu Services. If so required by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services shall at its own expense promptly take all steps necessary to reverse and
remove the effects of such purported change.

3. CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE

3.1 Standard Change Procedures

3.1.4

Discussions between Post Office and Fujitsu Services in relation to a change to
be effected through the Change Control Procedure shall result in any one of the
following:

3.1.1.1 no further action;

3.1.1.2 a request to make a change by Post Office's authorised representative
(a "Change Request" or “CR”);

3.1.1.3 a recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services.

Post Office shall send Change Requests to Fujitsu Services Change Control
Manager and Fujitsu Services shall respond to such Change Request by
submitting a Change Control Note (“CCN”) to the Post Office Change Control

If Fujitsu Services considers that the preparation of a CCN, requested by Post
Office, would necessitate allocation of resources in excess of five mandays,
Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office accordingly and, on agreement by Post
Office, Fujitsu Services will make a proposal for a paid study of the cost and
implications of producing the required CCN. Pending Post Office's acceptance
of that proposal or in the event that Post Office does not agree that such
proposal should be submitted, Fujitsu Services will be relieved of its obligations
to produce such CCN.

A recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services shall be submitted to
the Post Office Change Control Manager in the form of a CCN.

For each CCN submitted, Post Office shall evaluate the CCN and, as
appropriate, during the period of validity:

3.1.5.1 request further information;

3.1.5.2 authorise the change set out in the CCN in accordance with paragraph
3.1.8 below;

3.1.5.3 suggest modifications to the CCN (including, without limitation,
corrections of minor errors to avoid unnecessary rejection); or

3.1.5.4 notify Fujitsu Services of its rejection (together with an explanation of
the rejection) of the CCN.

The period within which Fujitsu Services shall respond to a CR, and the period
of validity of each CCN from the date it is submitted to Post Office shall be:

of that CCN signed on behalf of Fujitsu Services by one of the following: Group
Commercial and Legal Director; Commercial Director; Director Business
Development; Account Director; or Business Unit Director, or their nominated
representatives in their absence.

4. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

If Fujitsu Services considers that any change is necessary in order for it to comply with

procedures described above, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to proceed with such
change, provided that it shall as soon as practicable provide Post Office with a CCN for
retrospective change. Such change shall be subject to the procedures described in this

additional costs or expenses that it would not incur if that data was not Personal Data, then:

(c) Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office of the reasons for such additional costs and
expenses; and

(d) the Parties shall agree any consequential changes to the provisions of paragraphs
2.3 to 2.6 (inclusive) and/or reasonable additional Charges (as the case may be)

Charges for work defined in a Work Package description), before the processing of
any such New Personal Data can commence.

2.3.4 Fujitsu Services shall not, unless the Parties agree otherwise, be required to process
Sensitive Personal Data, as that term is defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 and Post
Office shall ensure, to the extent that Post Office, its employees, contractors or agents,
determine or control the data that is collected for processing, that such data does not include

of that Data Controller.

2.4.3 In respect of any Personal Data of which Post Office is the Data Controller, Fujitsu Services
shall be entitled to appoint any of Fujitsu Services’ sub-contractors listed in Schedule C2 to
process that Personal Data provided that, to the extent such processing is undertaken by a

to those dealing with such processing set out in this Agreement and which impose
obligations upon that sub-contractor at least as onerous as those imposed upon Fujitsu
Services under this Agreement.

2.4.4 Where Post Office fails to ensure that Post Office and Fujitsu Services have delegated
authority from each Data Controller to the full extent referred to in paragraph 2.4.1, or where
the terms of Post Office’s contract with a Data Controller do not permit the Personal Data of
that Data Controller to be processed on the terms of this Agreement:

(a) Post Office shall indemnify Fujitsu Services in respect of all claims, demands,
actions, costs (including legal costs), expenses, losses and damages arising from or
incurred by reason of any processing of Personal Data by Fujitsu Services in the

that deal with such processing (or as may be agreed under the Change Control
Procedure).

(c) Personal Data shall not be mechanically copied or otherwise reproduced by Fujitsu

(b) Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of each Subject Information Request it
requires Fujitsu Services to deal with, providing the statutory time limit applicable in
respect of each such request and sufficient information in each case to enable
Fujitsu Services to locate and retrieve the information requested or to confirm that
the information is not held by Fujitsu Services, as the case may be.

(c) Fujitsu Services shall respond to each Subject Information Request as soon as
reasonably practicable taking into account the statutory time limit notified to Fujitsu
Services for that request and whether that time limit is reasonably achievable given
the amount of time between notification of that request and expiry of the statutory

requested.

(d) If and to the extent that the number, type and frequency of Subject Information
Requests is such that Fujitsu Services, having discharged its obligation under
paragraph 2.4.7(c), is not able to respond to Post Office's requests within the time
limits specified by Post Office, the Parties shall assess the need for changes to the
relevant system architecture and/or investment in hardware, software or other

Any such changes and/or investment shall be agreed by the Parties under the

any portion thereof to such employees, agents, sub-contractors, third parties or consultants,
Fujitsu Services shall ensure the relevant employee, agent, sub-contractor, third party or
consultant is subject to a written contract with Fujitsu Services requiring them to comply with
Fujitsu Services’ obligations herein regarding the security and confidentiality of the Personal

Data which are an integral part of diagnostic data or data generated for diagnostic purposes
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.6.3 and subject to the

addition to those relating to security and confidentiality of the Personal Data) as are
necessary to satisfy the requirements of the eighth data protection principle of the

(b) those requirements are otherwise satisfied or do not apply.

Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office in writing whenever Personal Data are disclosed or
transferred outside the European Economic Area in accordance with this paragraph 2.6.4,
such notice to state who such Personal Data have been disclosed or transferred to and the
purpose of such disclosure or transfer and to contain, in general terms, a description of such
Personal Data.

obligation to provide information on request. Such information may include Confidential
Information.

2.9.2 In the event that Post Office receives a valid request for information under FOIA and/or EIR
to disclose Confidential Information (in whatever form), Post Office shall as soon as
reasonably practicable after receiving that request notify Fujitsu Services and the Parties

of such disclosure; or

related matters (a copy of such opinion to be provided, for information only without

Additional Discounts in relation to Feasibility Work

If in any Financial Year the services of the Core SI Team or Additional Resource are
used by Post Office in relation to feasibility studies which the Parties have agreed under
a Work Order to undertake as part of the Strategic Approval Stage and/or the Start-up
and Feasibility Stage of the Development Process ("Feasibility Work") then the value of
the Core SI Services calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4 and/or the Additional
SI Charges payable in accordance with paragraph 6.2.1 above (as the case may be)

where:

RA= _ Reduced amount in respect of a particular Professional Service Grade category
(as set out in paragraph 6.2.1) in relation to Core SI Services and/or Additional
Resource.

N= Total number of working days (as described in paragraph 6.2.5), in whole or in
part, of Feasibility Work undertaken by all individuals in the Professional Service
Grade category referred to in RA.

R= Rate per working day (as described in paragraph 6.2.1) for the Professional
Service Grade category referred to in RA.

The above formula shall be applied in respect of each applicable Professional Service
Grade category such that the total reduction to the value of the Core SI Services and/or
Additional SI Charges shall equal the sum of the reduced amounts (RA) for each
applicable category.

Development Methodology agreed by the Parties as most suitable for successfully
delivering the development project in question. The Development Methodology to be
used for each development project shall:

4.2.1 be agreed by the Parties no later than the end of the Requirements Stage (as
described in paragraph 5.4.1) +for that development project;

4.2.2 shall, as a minimum, set out the approach to the Development Lifecycle Stages
(including how the processes and disciplines of the Development Methodology
map to the generic Development Lifecycle and Development Lifecycle Stages)
and the Artefacts to be produced at each Development Lifecycle Stage for that
development project, by each Party; and

4.2.3 shall be developed to be consistent with RMG Harmony (so as not to prevent the
use by Post Office of RMG Harmony in relation to that development project.)

Post Office shall be responsible for documenting the Development Methodology agreed
for each development project.

Development Services to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services must be ordered as Work
Orders in accordance with the provisions of Schedule D2. The terms of such Work
Orders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5
unless either paragraph 2.2.6 or paragraph 6 applies, in which case the terms of such
Work Orders shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 2.2.6 or 6 respectively.

The basis for development resource planning of Work Packages shall be the
Development Lifecycle Stages.

The following principles shall be applicable to contracting for Development Services
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services:

4.5.1 clear control for each Development Lifecycle Stage and the responsibility to
deliver associated deliverables will be specified and agreed between the Parties
as vesting in either Post Office or Fujitsu Services but not both;

4.5.2 business control of Work Packages shall be established in accordance with the
governance principles set out in Schedule A2 and the Work Ordering Procedure
in Schedule D2 and each large Work Package will have a senior management
sponsor within both Fujitsu Services and Post Office; and

4.5.3 related responsibilities shall be clearly identified and assigned to specific
individuals in Fujitsu Services or Post Office.

Where the scope and size of a Work Package are substantial, Post Office may request
Fujitsu Services to identify as separable components of work individual Work Package
Elements which could be carried out by third parties under Fujitsu Services’ management.
Where this option is considered, Fujitsu Services will identify any liability, performance,

reliability or other potential service implications of such option and the terms to be
incorporated into a subcontract for such work.

THE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

Initial Development Lifecycle Stages

The following Development Lifecycle Stages will be led by Post Office who may procure
professional services (as described in paragraph 3.1.1) from Fujitsu Services to support
the work done in the relevant Development Lifecycle Stage.

5.1.1 Strategic Approval Stage, which defines the strategic and architectural framework
within which the changes are to be developed and delivered.

5.1.2 Start-up and Feasibility Stage, in which Post Office develops an outline view of a
potential business requirement with input, where required, from Fujitsu Services:

5.1.2.1 on the indicative cost range for the provision of a potential solution, to
assist Post Office in making an informed decision on:

(a) the business case for proceeding to later stages of the
Development Lifecycle; and

(b) sourcing of solution components; and

5.1.2.2 to assist with an assessment of the most appropriate Development
Methodology to be adopted (with this Development Methodology being
confirmed during the Requirements Stage by the Systems Integration
Partnership); and

5.1.2.3 to give an indication of the scope of any work that Fujitsu Services
proposes be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (with this being confirmed during the Solution Definition
Stage).

A key objective of these two Development Lifecycle Stages is to provide sufficient
information to Post Office such that it can make an informed decision about the
procurement approach in respect of the development project as a whole and each
solution component. Post Office shall consider the procurement options by reference to
the provisions of Schedule B1.3 and paragraphs 4.6 and 6 of this Schedule B1.1 before a
decision is made by Post Office on whether it will involve Fujitsu Services in the later
Development Lifecycle Stages or in procuring subcontractors in accordance with
paragraph 4.6, or adopt a competitive approach in accordance with paragraph 6.

Subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages where Development Services are procured

If Fujitsu Services is required to provide Development Services after the Strategic
Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage and a competitive approach is not
adopted by Post Office as described in paragraph 6 of this Schedule B1.1, the remaining
provisions of this paragraph 5 shall be applicable.

The Development Lifecycle Stages that (subject to paragraphs 4.2 and 5.5) shall apply
after the Strategic Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage are described
below.

5.4.1 Requirements Stage, in which production of a full specification of the
requirements and Work Packages is led and managed by Post Office to form the
basis for solution specification and any subsequent contract for development,
implementation, acceptance and operational work.

5.4.2 Solution Definition Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
produces (i) a solution description as defined in the applicable Development
Methodology setting out the proposed solution in response to the Post Office’s
Work Package requirements including any qualifications and caveats applicable
to those requirements and (ii) Commercial Terms detailing the price and
contractual terms applicable to the subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages
(and those applicable to any subsequent stage relating to operational service if
not dealt with in an associated CCN), including confirmation of the details and
scope of any work to be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (together with the identity of any such Sub-contractor).

5.4.3 Solution Build and Test Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu
Services undertakes the development, integration and testing of the solution
Work Package (other than any user testing or release validation testing or
elements of solution assurance which will be managed by Post Office) up to, and
including, its acceptance by Post Office.

5.4.4 Implementation Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
undertakes system and software rollout into the live environment (any necessary
Implementation of Branch Hardware having been carried out in accordance with
Schedule B1.3 and, as applicable, this Schedule) together with related planning
and change management, up to acceptance of the solution into live service. Post
Office related business implementation aspects shall be managed by Post Office.

In order to optimise the Development Lifecycle, Development Lifecycle Stages may
overlap or occur in parallel, be combined or, in exceptional cases, omitted. The method of
operation of the Development Lifecycle Stages for each development project will be set
out in the Development Methodology as agreed and documented in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.

circumstances. However, the commercial/contractual arrangement must take into
account the impact on the systems and services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu
Services. Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to accept proposed
commercial/contractual terms for the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-
Alone Hardware. Fujitsu Services may base its decision to reject proposed terms on
commercial and/or an adverse outcome of Hardware Impact Assessment.

Branch Hardware Procurement

Where Post Office procures Branch Hardware from a third party, a warranty clause (the
terms of which shall be agreed with Fujitsu Services, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld) must form part of the purchase agreement for the Branch

6.3.2 Where Post Office (or its chosen third party supplier) carries out Installation it
shall be liable for any damage to physical property or data which occurs at a
Branch (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damage to the Infrastructure) as
a direct result of such Installation work.

6.3.3 Notwithstanding paragraph 6.3.2, where Post Office or its third party supplier
carries out Installation work, Fujitsu Services shall be liable for any damage to
the Infrastructure or data in accordance with paragraph 5.2 where:

6.3.3.1 such damage occurred as a result of the Post Office or its chosen third
party supplier carrying out such Installation work in accordance with

installation specifications provided by Fujitsu Services;

6.3.3.2 the damage would not have occurred if the Fujitsu Services installation
specifications had not been followed; and

6.3.3.3 Post Office or its third party supplier acted in the manner of a
reasonable and skilled provider of Installation services in following the
installation specifications.

1.3 HNG-X Telecommunications Infrastructure

1.3.1

1.3.2

The HNG-X Telecommunications Infrastructure consists of:

(a) Branch Telecom Infrastructure — those networking elements that
provide connectivity between the Branches and the Data Centre; and

(b) Central Telecom Infrastructure — those network elements that provide
connectivity from the Data Centre to other sites.

Branch Telecom Infrastructure

(a) The Branch Telecom Infrastructure shall use one or more of the
following communications access methods between the Branch
Infrastructure and the Data Centres:

(i) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) - communications
method to connect to the data centre where ADSL cannot be
used or if in the Kingston Communications area;

(ii) Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) which shall be
introduced on a Branch by Branch basis on commencement of
Associated Change Workstream A7 (Branch Router Rollout);

Schedule B3.3 Version 9.0 Page 3 of 14

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

(c)

(e)

(iii) I Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) - Primary
communications method for Branches;

(iv) Very Small Aperture Terminal Broad Band (VSAT BB) - a
Branch communications method where Fujitsu Services is
unable to provide ADSL or ISDN owing to the Branch's
geographical location.

(v) I General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) / Enhanced Data GSM
Environment (EDGE) and 3G which shall be introduced on a
Branch by Branch basis on commencement of Associated
Change Workstream A7 (Branch Router Rollout); or

(vi) Branch Network Resilience (BNR) which shall be withdrawn on
a Branch by Branch basis on commencement of Associated
Change Workstream A7 (Branch Router Rollout) and shall be
fully withdrawn on completion of Associated Change
Workstream A7 (Branch Router Rollout).

(vii) Internet Virtual Private Network — to enable Branches to connect
from Internet connections. This is subject to agreed connection
specifications and concurrency limits as stipulated in Schedule
D1 Annex A “BRANCH AND COUNTER POSITION LIMITS.

These connections may be used as either primary or backup network
connections, although there may be restrictions on the size of the
Branch that can be supported on some technologies. Additionally
there are restrictions on the technologies that are supported for a
Branch’s primary (storage) location. All such restrictions are set out in
PA/PER/033.

The backup network is designed to cater for failures of the primary
network at individual Branches and not for a total failure of the primary
network at all Branches. Any capacity limits for the backup network will
be set out in the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and
Business Volumes" (PA/PER/033).

The response time Service Levels defined in Schedule C1 and each
applicable Service Description apply to this Schedule B3.3 providing
that at least 90 per cent of Transactions are undertaken in Branches
that use ADSL as their primary network connection. If the proportion of
the connected Branches using ADSL drops below this level then
changes will be handled under the Change Control Procedure.

With regard to the BNS Report Part 1 and BNS Report Part 2 (as
defined below):

Within 1 month of date of signature of CCN 1400, Fujitsu Services
shall agree with Post Office via the Change Control Procedure the

set out in Schedule B1 (Branch Hardware Implementation), only
Fujitsu Services may implement such BNS R&R Required Items into
the Services (at Post Office’s additional cost, where such costs are
not recoverable under the Charges) unless the relevant Service is
partially terminated in accordance with Schedule E, paragraph 9.1.
After 31° March 2015, Post Office may request the appropriate
Tower Contractor to implement the BNS R&R Required Items
(where the previous way to implement such an item was performed
by an element of the Services that has been partially terminated) but
Fujitsu Services retains the right (acting reasonably) to sample test
and check correct implementation of such BNS R&R Required
Items.

Once BNS R&R Required Items have been implemented then
Fujitsu Services shall provide the Services and comply with the
Service Levels to which those Refresh Items relate.

With regard to BNS R&R Required Items listed in the BNS Report
Part 1, Post Office shall procure and/or implement the BNS R&R
Required Items set out in the BNS Report Part 1. In the event that
Post Office fails to procure and/or implement the relevant BNS R&R
Required Item, then Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any
service failure directly attributable to Post Office not proceeding with,
implementing and/or making available the BNS R&R Required Item
listed in the BNS Report Part 1.

With regard to Refresh Items listed in the BNS Report Part 2, Post
Office may at its sole option determine whether to implement all,
some, or none of BNS R&R Required Items set out in the BNS.
Report Part 2. In the event that Post Office decides to proceed with
some or none of the Refresh Items listed in the BNS Report Part 2,
then Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any service failure
directly attributable to Post Office not proceeding with, implementing
and/or making available the BNS R&R Required Items listed in the

17 POLSAP Central Infrastructure

1.7.1. The POLSAP Central Infrastructure is detailed in the CCD entitled “Data Centre
Operations Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0003).

2: SECURITY
21 Introduction
This section covers the security provisions relating to the HNG-X Service Infrastructure.
2.2 Encryption Key Management
2.2.1. The HNG-X System shall support a reliable and secure means for the transfer of
data to the Data Centre. This shall include the use of techniques used
selectively and in agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services as
specified in the CCD entitled "HNG-X Technical Security Architecture"
(ARC/SEC/ARC/0003)
2.2.2 With the exception of PIN Pads (in which case paragraph 2.1.4 of Schedule
B3.4 shall apply), a key management system shall be in place so the encrypted

data can be deciphered without risk of that cryptographic key being exposed.

2.2.3. Fujitsu Services shall support the use of PIN Pads and the associated
cryptographic management. PIN Pads shall comply with the requirements of

ISO 9564.
3. BUSINESS CONTINUITY
3.1 Introduction

This paragraph 3 covers the business continuity provisions relating to the HNG-X
Service Infrastructure.

3.2 End to End Recovery

End-to-end recovery shall be performed by Fujitsu Services in accordance with the CCD
entitled “HNG-X Business Continuity Framework” (SVM/SDM/SIP/0001).

3.3 Business Continuity
3.3.1 Data Centre Resilience
(a) One Data Centre will be used to support the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities (the “Live Data Centre”) with a second Data Centre
providing DR (the “DR Data Centre”). There are network components

(appliances and platforms) at the DR Data Centre which contribute to
the provision of Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

CONFIDENTIAL
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
()
(9)

3.3.2

The DR Data Centre will under normal operation be used for testing
except where it needs to be used for business continuity tests. The DR
Data Centre will also host some live network components.

Each Data Centre shall have the capability in normal operation with no
failures or a single failure having occurred:

(i) to support the Contracted Volumes as defined in the CCD
entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business
Volumes” (PA/PER/033); and

(ii) to support Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of Service
Levels set out in Schedule C1 and each applicable Service
Description.

Each Data Centre will be configured such that the failure of a single
component will not cause the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities to fail. For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services will
inform Post Office of those major Data Centre components whose
failure may result in the need to invoke DR. There is a single high
capacity WAN circuit into each Data Centre. Should the link into one
Data Centre fail then a patch via the other Data Centre will be used.

Switchover to backup systems within the Data Centre and for the
network connections within the Data Centre:

(i) for real-time elements of the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities shall be automated; and

(ii) for non-real time elements may be automated or manual.

Switchover from the Live Data Centre to the DR Data Centre will be
manually initiated.

In the event that the DR Data Centre needs to be used to run the live
service or if the DR Data Centre itself is unavailable, there will be no
significant test environment available. In this scenario, limited testing
(sufficient to test minor fixes needed to keep the live service
operational) will be available at a Fujitsu Services development site.
However such testing facilities will not be sufficient to test releases.

The Central Network

(a)

The Central Network comprises the network communications between
the Data Centres and the switches used by Fujitsu Services (or Fujitsu
Services' Sub-contractor which operates such network) to:

(i) answer ISDN calls from Branches;

Schedule B3.3 Version 9.0 Page 12 of 14

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069

4.

44

(c)

(ii) convert asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communications
from ADSL Branches into’ internet protocol (IP)
communications; or

(iii) convert leased line communications from Branches into
internet protocol (IP) communications

(iv) convert wireless wide area network (WAN) protocols from
Branches into internet protocol (IP) communications,

(the "Central Network").

The loss of a major sub-contractor network switching node within the
Central Network shall not cause the complete loss of the Branch
Telecom Infrastructure. However, should a loss of a major sub-
contractor network switching node within the Central Network occur,
Fujitsu Services (in addition to its other obligations under this
Agreement) shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that any
shortfall in system performance is recovered within seven days of that
loss.

The Central Network shall be configured such that there shall be no
single point of failure within the Central Network. Some failures in the
Central Network may require the Branch to re-establish
communications with the Data Centre.

3.3.3 The Alliance & Leicester Circuit

(a)

The Alliance & Leicester Circuit shall be configured such that there
shall be no single point of failure (including site failure) within the
Alliance & Leicester Circuit.

"The Alliance & Leicester Circuit shall have the capability in normal
operation, with no failures or a single failure having occurred to that
link:”

(i) to support the Contracted Volumes for Banking Transactions
for Alliance & Leicester as defined in the CCD entitled "Horizon
Capacity Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033);
and

(ii) of supporting Fujitsu Services' obligations in respect of Service
Levels set out in Schedule C1 and each applicable Service
Description.

3. TECHNOLOGY REFRESH

3.1 Introduction

3.1.1

3.1.2

The Services, Service Levels and Charges have been agreed against certain
assumptions as to:

(a) the reliability of the Equipment; and

(b) Post Office's business plans, as they relate to the availability of
spares for the Equipment and the number of Counter Positions,

and the Parties have agreed that certain remedial actions may be taken should
those assumptions be likely to prove incorrect.

This paragraph 3 sets out the assumptions and the remedial actions.

3.2 Management of Equipment

3.24

3.2.2

No change shall be made to the specification of Equipment to be used within the
Branch Infrastructure without prior approval by Post Office. Post Office will not
unreasonably withhold its consent to a change in specification where
replacement Equipment of the same specification is no longer available at
reasonable cost within the UK.

The Equipment used within the Infrastructure shall be reviewed by Post Office
and Fujitsu Services at times reasonably agreed by them to assess whether the
most appropriate technology is deployed.

3.3 Assumptions

3.3.1

In relation to Services, Service Levels and Charges, the following assumptions
have been agreed:

(a) that the reductions in the number of Branches and Counter Positions
during the term of this Agreement will take place in accordance with
the table in Part 1 of Annex A of Schedule D1 (and consequently that
additional maintenance spares will be available to Fujitsu Services);

(b) that, over the period between the Amendment Date and completion of
HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout), the Mean
Time Between Failures of each item of Equipment forming part of the
Branch Infrastructure (as calculated in accordance with the CCD
entitled Calculating Mean Time Between Failure And Availability"
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0013) will not decline by more than twenty percent
(20 per cent.); and

CONFIDENTIAL

3.3.2

3.3.3

3.3.4

3.3.5

3.3.6

(c) that, over the period between completion of HNG-X Project
Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout) and 31 March 2015, the
Mean Time Between Failures of each item of Equipment forming part
of the Branch Infrastructure, excluding 12,000 flat screens installed in
Branches, (as calculated in accordance with the CCD entitled
“Calculating Mean Time Between Failure And Availability"
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0013) and after allowing for the Mean Time Between
Failures to be re-baselined on completion of HNG-X Project
Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout) in accordance with that
CCD) will not decline by more than fifty percent (50 per cent). During
this same period the Mean Time Between Failures of 12,000 flat
screens installed in Branches (as calculated in accordance with the
CCD entitled “Calculating Mean Time Between Failure And
Availability” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0013) and after allowing for the Mean
Time Between Failures to be re-baselined on completion of HNG-X
Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout) in accordance
with that CCD) will not decline by more than twenty percent (20 per
cent).

The Mean Time Between Failure of each item of Equipment forming part of the
Branch Infrastructure shall be calculated at the Amendment Date, in the case of
paragraph 3.3.1(b), and re-baselined on completion of HNG-X Project
Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout), in the case of paragraph 3.3.1(b),
in each case based on Equipment failure rate data for the preceding 12 months.

For the purpose of assessing the likelihood of the assumptions set out in
paragraphs 3.3.1(b) and 3.3.1(c) proving incorrect, Fujitsu Services shall
monitor Equipment failure rates using the methodology set out in and provide
monthly information to Post Office in accordance with the CCD entitled
Calculating Mean Time Between’ Failure And Availability"
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0013).

Fujitsu Services shall monitor the actual numbers of Branches and Counter
Positions in each year against the figure in Annex A of Part 1 of Schedule D1 for
that year for the purpose of assessing the likelihood of the assumption set out in
paragraph 3.3.1(a) proving incorrect and there being insufficient maintenance
spares.

If, at any time, the assessment of Fujitsu Services or Post Office is that any of
the assumptions set out in paragraph 3.3.1 is likely to prove incorrect it will
promptly report that assessment to the Service Management Relationship.

On receiving an assessment of the kind specified in paragraph 3.3.5, the Parties
shall meet to consider the assessment (including the period the Parties believe
the assumption is likely to continue to prove incorrect) and determine a remedial
plan (the "Remedial Plan"), which may include one or more of the following:

(a) replacement, at the expense of Post Office, of any or all of the
Equipment in the Branch Infrastructure;

Schedule B3.4 Version 9.0

Page 6 of 9

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL
(b) revision of the Charges in order to reflect the cost (including the
applicable margin for the Charges) to Fujitsu Services of replacing
and/or supporting any or all of the Equipment in the Branch
Infrastructure and the time period for which such revision will apply;
(c) revision of the Service Levels, obligations and responsibilities
(including any new obligations) to reflect the impact on the same of
the fact that gives rise to the assumption being incorrect (for example,
increased failure rate of Equipment) and the time period for which
such revision will apply;
(d) decommissioning of items of Branch Equipment to make available
sufficient spares;
(e) closure of additional Counter Positions; and
(f) a change to the assumptions set out in paragraph 3.3.1 to reflect the
impact of the Remedial Plan; and
(g) a change to the table in Annex A of Part 1 of Schedule D1 to reflect
the impact of the Remedial Plan.
3.3.7 Any Remedial Plan shall be agreed using the Change Control Procedure and

either Party shall be entitled to raise a CCN or CR (as appropriate) accordingly.
Details of the Remedial Plan which are not reflected in changes to the
provisions of this Agreement shall be recorded in a CCD. Neither Party shall be
entitled unreasonably to withhold or delay its consent to a Remedial Plan.

3.4 Catastrophic failure

3.4.1

3.4.2

3.4.3

Fujitsu Services will, for the purpose of paragraph 3.3.2, carry out regular
monitoring of, and regularly report on, trends in the Mean Time Between
Failure of the items of Equipment in question to Post Office. In normal
circumstances, the variation between the measured trend and the assumed
trend for an item of Equipment will be sufficiently consistent over time to
allow a replacement programme (if that is necessary) to be developed and
carried out in an economic manner as part of a planned and orderly routine.
It is possible, however, that an item of Equipment might, other than by
reason of an act or omission of Fujitsu Services, begin to fail in such
quantities that Fujitsu Services and Post Office reasonably consider that the
Equipment needs to be replaced or repaired outside the normal routine
(‘Catastrophic Failure’).

In the event of any Catastrophic Failure occurring, Fujitsu Services will promptly
report that fact to the Service Management Relationship.

Subject to paragraphs 3.4.4 and 3. the cost of replacement of a type of
Equipment which suffers Catastrophic Failure will be borne by Post Office.
Types of Equipment that are replaced by reason of Catastrophic Failure (and
the replacement Equipment) will continue to be taken into account in the

Schedule B3.4 Version 9.0

Page 7 of 9

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

3.4.4

3.4.5

calculation of Mean Time Between Failure referred to in paragraphs 3.3.1(b)
and 3.3.1(c).

As an alternative to replacing a type of Equipment that has suffered
Catastrophic Failure, Post Office may request Fujitsu Services to cease to
provide or to modify Services which are affected by that Catastrophic Failure, in
which case the provisions of paragraphs 3.3.6 and 3.3.7 shall apply.

In the case of the following items of Equipment:
(a) PC BIOS batteries; and
(b) Flat screens,

the Charges assume that replacement items will be installed in the course of
normal engineer visits to Branches in response to Incidents as part of the
Engineering Services, there being no installation programme as such, and
should either of these items be subject to Catastrophic Failure the cost to be
borne by Post Office under paragraph 3.4.3 will only be the increased direct
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Fujitsu Services in accelerating the
planned programme of replacement.

3.5 Interim Position

3.5.1

As from the date when an assumption set out in paragraph 3.3.1 proves
incorrect or a Catastrophic Failure occurs and until such time as the relevant
Remedial Plan has been agreed and fully implemented (or, in the case of
Catastrophic Failure the Equipment in question has been replaced throughout
the Branch Infrastructure) then, provided Fujitsu Services is not in breach of
Clause 15.2, Fujitsu Services shall:

(a) other than in respect of the Counter Availability SLT (once the Local
Allowance for the Counter Availability SLT has been adjusted) and
any liquidated damages payable in respect thereof, not be obliged to
achieve any Service Level (SLT, LDT or ARL) or pay liquidated
damages in respect of a failure thereof or perform any obligation to
the extent that that Service Level or obligation cannot reasonably be
achieved or performed as a result of that assumption proving incorrect
or the Catastrophic Failure occurring (as the case may be); and

(b) be entitled to recover from Post Office its reasonably incurred,
increased direct costs and expenses of performing obligations under
this Agreement to the extent that such increased direct cost and
expenses were the result of that assumption proving incorrect or the
Catastrophic Failure occurring (as the case may be). The principles
set out in the CCD entitled "Calculating Mean Time Between Failure
And Availability": (SVM/SDM/PRO/0013) shall apply in relation to
the assessment of such costs.

2. ESCHER UPGRADE SOFTWARE
2.1 General
2.1.1 This paragraph 2 specifies the terms on which the Escher Upgrade Software

22

may be used by Post Office and Escher Software Users in connection with the
Existing Services. Such rights of use shall cease upon the occurrence of
Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout Complete).

Terms of Use

2.2.1

Fujitsu Services grants to Post Office and to all Escher Software Users from
time to time (together with Post Office the “Licensed Persons”) a right to use
and (for the purposes only of loading, execution, storage, transmission or
display) copy the Escher Upgrade Software to the extent necessary for the
Licensed Persons to receive the Existing Services in connection with the
system known as “Horizon” currently in use by Post Office and as upgraded by
the Escher Upgrade Software.

Fujitsu Services warrants that it has the right to grant the rights stated to be
granted by it under paragraph 2 of this Schedule B4.1 and that it has the right to
make such back-up copies of the Escher Upgrade Software as are reasonably
necessary for the provision of the Services.

The rights granted by paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 are subject to the
following conditions:

2.2.3.1 Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of all actual or threatened
breaches of Escher's trade secret, patent, copyright, and other
ownership rights in the Escher Upgrade Software of which it becomes
aware and shall use reasonable endeavours to provide Fujitsu Services
with assistance as may be reasonably requested by Fujitsu Services in
relation to the prevention and/or challenge of such actual or threatened
breaches.

2.2.3.2 Notwithstanding paragraph 2.2.3.1 of this Schedule B4.1, Post Office
may at its absolute discretion notify Escher directly of such actual or
threatened breach in addition to notifying Fujitsu Services.

2.2.3.3 All use of the Escher Upgrade Software by Post Office and/or Escher
Software Users shall take place within the United Kingdom or its
territories.

2.2.3.4 On termination of this Agreement, provided such termination occurs
prior to Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout Complete), Fujitsu
Services shall at Post Office's request procure the direct licence of the
Escher Upgrade Software to either Post Office or a replacement for

2.2.3.5

2.2.3.6

Fujitsu Services appointed by Post Office (as Post Office requests) at
no charge and on substantially the same terms as the Existing
Licences. The obligations of Fujitsu Services and the rights of Post
Office under this paragraph 2.2.3.4 shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

Post Office's rights granted by Fujitsu Services by paragraph 2.2.1 of
this Schedule B4.1 shall terminate upon the grant of a direct licence in
accordance with paragraph 2.2.3.4 of this Schedule B4.1.

Save to the extent required under English law, the rights granted by
paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 shall not be construed so as to
allow Post Office to modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or reverse
compile the Escher Upgrade Software or take any other action to
disclose Escher’s source code. To the extent that Post Office is
permitted by law to take such action for interoperability or otherwise,
such reverse engineering or related activity shall be limited to the
minimum amount required and may not be undertaken unless Fujitsu
Services has refused or is unable to make or procure such adaptations
after Post Office requests that it do so. Fujitsu Services shall be
entitled, subject to the prior approval of Post Office, to charge Post
Office its reasonable costs for making and/or procuring such
adaptations as Fujitsu Services makes or procures and Post Office shall
pay such charges.

2.3 Intellectual property rights

Post Office and Fujitsu Services each agree that Escher's copyright legend shall be
displayed on all software and associated documentation and media under their
respective control in a manner consistent with the CCD entitled “Horizon Office Platform
Service Style Guide”, reference SD/STD/001.

The provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule C3 shall apply.

25 Breach

The provisions of paragraph 2.3 of Schedule C3 shall apply.

26 Termination

The provisions of paragraph 2.4 of Schedule C3 shall apply.

Services to provide the Services to Post Office from the Amendment Date until Trigger
Point T5 (Data Centre Ready for HNG-X).

Fujitsu Services shall operate and maintain each Horizon Application listed in
paragraphs 2 and 4 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the relevant
specifications for each Horizon Application as set out in this Schedule, all CCDs
relevant to an Horizon Application as referred to in this Schedule and all Service Levels
relevant to an Horizon Application as set out in Schedule B4.4 and Schedule C1 to this
Agreement.

Fujitsu Services will be invited to bid for future developments to Horizon Applications in
accordance with the terms of Schedule B1.1.

The functionality and interfaces of each Horizon Application are defined in the CCDs
indicated to relate to an Horizon Application in the column headed “Horizon Application”
in Table A below and the CCDs indicated to relate to that Horizon Application in the CCD
entitled “Post Office Contract Controlled and Contract Referenced Document List’
(COM/CUS/SPE/0001).

Horizon Application software installed in those Branches and Admin Positions which do
not have a network connection point shall not be kept up to date with new Releases
other than in accordance with paragraph 7.4 of Schedule D1.
HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING APPLICATIONS

EPOSS

2.1.1. EPOSS is an electronic point of sale service application which provides the
following functions:

(a) on all Counter Positions in all Branches and Other Authorised

Locations:
(i) facilities to Counter Clerks in support of Transactions with
Customers;

(ii) a “till” function; and

(iii) a framework within which other applications can be invoked to
support specialised Transactions within a Customer Session;

2:2) APS

2.24

(b) to Users within Branches including:
(i) stock balancing;
(ii) Branch cash accounting;
(iii) production of Client summaries; and
(iv) User administration tasks;

(c) transfer of data to Post Office systems and services outside the Horizon
Service Infrastructure; and

(d) management information reporting.

EPOSS is implemented with the following major functional components:
(a) EPOSS running on every Counter Position;

(b) TMS Agent applications running on the Data Centre servers; and
(c) host database applications running in the Data Centres.

EPOSS records Transactions to the Riposte message store. These are
replicated by Riposte to the message stores on file servers at the Data Centres.
The TMS Agents extract and reformat Transaction data and present it for further
analysis, summarisation and forwarding by the host database application.

Cash, cheque and voucher methods of payment are handled by EPOSS. For
payment using a debit card, EPOSS (from the settlement menu) initiates Debit
Card to obtain authorisation of payment.

APS is a generic application that enables Post Office to provide a range of bill
payment and pre-payment services to the customers of many Post Office
Clients. APS provides transaction facilities at the counter, integrated into
Customer Sessions using facilities provided by EPOSS. APS also supports
transfer of data to and from Post Office Client systems and Post Office systems.
APS is available at all Counter Positions in all Branches.

APS supports a range of advanced data capture facilities (the “AP-ADC
Facility”) which are controlled and constrained by Post Office Reference Data.
These facilities extend the capabilities of APS and provide support for:

(a) product selection mechanisms using picklists;

(b) a range of data capture and validation routines;

Schedule B4.2 Version 9.0

Page 3 of 32

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

2.2.6

(c) access to the PAF Facility, APOP Facility, DVLA POME and such other
specific external applications as the Parties may agree under the
Change Control Procedure; and

(d) the use of print templates in support of customised receipt and slip print
layouts.

The production of Reference Data by Post Office to make use of the AP-ADC
Facility shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the CCD
entitled “AP-ADC Reference Manual” (AP/MAN/002).

APS supports the following range of Tokens conforming to the standards in the
relevant CCDs:

(a) magnetic stripe cards;
(b) bar coded documents; and
(c) Smart Tokens comprising:

(i) Quantum token;

(ii) Watercard token; and

(iii) Talexus (developed but not deployed in accordance with the
terms of CCN 798).

APS supports the use of desktop buttons, which may be specified as being
equivalent to a manually entered AP barcode Token.

APS is implemented with the following major functional components:

(a) APS running on every Counter Position;

(b) APS agents running on Data Centre servers;

(c) host database application in the Data Centre; and

(d) file transfer capabilities provided by the Horizon Central Infrastructure.

As referred to in paragraph 2.2.2 (c), APS supports access to DVLA POME for
the purpose of vehicle re-licensing Transactions only. DVLA POME is the Driver
Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Post Office MOT enquiry service
which is based on systems that are external to the Horizon Service
Infrastructure. The AP-ADC Facility will perform online interactions with DVLA
POME during a vehicle re-licensing Transaction. Such interaction will take
place via the DVLA On-line Link. Information concerning MOT status and
vehicle excise duty as well as other supporting data will be retrieved during the
course of such on-line interaction, as specified by Post Office Reference Data
for the purposes of the re-licensing Transaction. The interaction with DVLA

Schedule B4.2 Version 9.0

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

2.2.10

POME may be configured to deal with scenarios where no response is received
from DVLA POME within designated time periods.

APS handles interaction with customer Tokens and records Transactions in the
Riposte message store. It also passes Transaction details to EPOSS for
incorporation into a Customer Session. Transaction data is replicated by
Riposte to the message stores on file servers at the Data Centres. The APS
agents extract and reformat transaction data and present it for further analysis,
summarisation and forwarding by the host database application.

The clients and tokens supported by APS are referred to in the CCD entitled
“Automated Payments System Client List” (BP/DOC/008). Specific payments
and the AP Transactions which support them conform to the relevant AP Client
Specification, which in turn references the CCD entitled “POCL Automated
Payments Generic Rules” (BP/DOC/014) and appropriate Token Technology
Specification(s). Data is transferred to AP Clients in accordance with the
appropriate AIS. Such transfer will either be direct to the AP Client in
accordance with the relevant automated payment client specification or via the
EDG in accordance with the CCD entitled “Automated Payments Interface
Specification - EDG / DES” (CR/IFS/002).

APS supports the receipt of data from Clients, typically comprising tariff data, as
specified in the relevant AIS specified in the CCD entitled “Post Office Contract
Controlled and Contract Referenced Document List” (COM/CUS/SPE/0001).
This data will be distributed to APS.

Post Office will be responsible for:

(a) the design and development of new AP Transactions that use the AP-
ADC Facility;

(b) (save to the extent that Fujitsu Services is required to facilitate testing of
Post Office Reference Data in accordance with the CCD entitled “Fujitsu
Services / Post Office Ltd Interface Agreement for Operational Business
Change - Reference Data" (CS/PRD/058)) ensuring that Post Office
Reference Data, intended to introduce those new Transactions,
functions correctly within the Horizon Service Infrastructure (in
accordance with any applicable Reference Data rules) and has the
desired business effect; and

(c) defining receipts (for all AP Transactions that use the AP-ADC Facility)
that contain sufficient information to allow manual recovery of a subset
of the transaction data following a system failure, to the extent that such
manual data recovery is required by Post Office.

POL SERVICE TYPES

The POL Service Types applicable to the period between the Amendment Date and

Acceptance Point Z3 are set out in Annex 1 to this Schedule.

If Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services in writing that it no longer requires use of a POL
Service Type and requests that Fujitsu Services disable that POL Service Type in
accordance with Clause 10.5, then where Post Office ceasing to use that POL Service
Type may affect the use of any other POL Service Type(s), Fujitsu Services shall advise
Post Office accordingly. Where Fujitsu Services so advises Post Office, the Parties will
discuss and agree (acting reasonably) the appropriate steps to be taken to address the

effect of disabling the POL Service Type on any other POL Service Type(s).

Ability to Provide Authorisation to Post Office Products

Infrastructure Services and Horizon Service Infrastructure shall support
authorisations for Post Office products through access to computer systems
which are external to Post Office Services or are within Post Office Services.

44 Availability

4.4.1

User access to OPS

4.4.1.1 Users may only log-on to the OPS in their Branch in accordance with
their defined role. Any access to data or services outside of that Branch
is controlled exclusively by the relevant counter application.

4.4.1.2 Access to OPS and Post Office Services offered via OPS to Users
working in the Branches shall be controlled by a mechanism conforming
to the CCD entitled “Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide”
(SD/STD/001), offering multiple access levels and providing specific
identification of each User. An exception to this is the Mails Application
which does not conform to the “Horizon Office Platform Service Style
Guide” (SD/STD/001).

4.4.1.3 Authentication of all Users logging on to the OPS in the Branch shall be
undertaken by the elements of Horizon Service Infrastructure on which
OPS is based. Full access control and password management facilities
shall be provided. Users shall only access those Horizon Applications
for which they have been given permission by the Branch. Each User
shall be identified by a unique User-id and individual password.

4.4.1.4 The OPS shall provide facilities to enable the Branch Manager to
establish new Users and set an initial password for all Users in a
Branch. Should a User forget their password the Branch Manager shall
be able to reset the password. The same procedure shall apply at single
Counter Position Branches and multiple Counter Position Branches.

4.4.1.5 For situations where the sole User (e.g. Branch Manager in a single
Counter Position Branch) has forgotten their password, the OPS shall
provide the facility to generate a unique key as part of the log-on to a
specific username. This shall be telephoned to the Help Desk who shall
provide the corresponding key which, when input to OPS, shall allow

Schedule B4.3 Version 9.0

Page 8 of 22

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL,
access to the administration facilities. The User shall then be able to
reset their User password.
4.4.2 Concurrency

The Pathway solution for OPS is based on a PC infrastructure configured such
that multiple activities within a Branch do not significantly impact on each other.
In particular, back office processes (e.g. report production) will be operated on a
logically consistent set of data which will not be affected by any concurrent
counter transactions.

45 Peripherals

4.5.1

Horizon Service Infrastructure - OPS: Peripheral and input devices Equipment

by Riposte and details stored in the message store. The format of this
message store entry shall vary according to the Transaction type but
will typically contain:

(a) Post Office ID;

(b) Counter Position ID;

(c) unique Transaction ID;

(d) date;
(e) time;
(f) User ID;

(g) Horizon Application; and
(h) Transaction details.

Each Counter Position PC shall contain a journal and all journal entries
shall be automatically replicated to all other members of the work group.
Awork group shall include all the Counter Position PCs in the Branch
and one of the correspondence servers, at which TMS is provided. This
correspondence server forms part of a “cluster” of correspondence
servers of which two are located on one Data Centre site and the
remaining two located on the other Data Centre site. All Transactions
associated with one correspondence server are automatically replicated
to the other site. Within each site all Transactions are reliably mirrored
within a multiple disk array which has no single point of failure.

Once data are stored in the message store they shall never be altered.
New Transactions shall always be appended to the message store.
Retrieval of data using a particular key field shall retrieve all entries
containing that field.

The security of data held within OPS shall not be compromised by any
Incident nor when OPS is re-established following any Incident.

Fujitsu Services shall provide synchronisation facilities which shall
automatically check the status of the journal for a node when it is re-
established following failure. Should the journal be out of step (e.g.
through failure of the Counter Position PC) Fujitsu Services shall
automatically synchronise the journal and any data files to the same
state as all other journals in that work group. Synchronisation may occur
from another Counter Position PC (in a multi-Counter Position Branch)
or from one of the correspondence servers or the second hard disk
referred to in paragraph 6.2.4.2 (in a single Counter Position Branch).

Applications which were active shall be left active. The display
presented when the suspension facility is activated shall be
different to any normal desktop or Horizon Application screen;
or

(b) suspend a customer session and start a second session, and
thereafter swap between the two sessions until one of them has
been completed.

While an individual Transaction is waiting for input from a peripheral, a
pick-list or on-line interaction, or while reports or receipts are printing,
these facilities may be inhibited.

Should the User who initiated the suspension be unable to re-activate
the facility, the following actions may be taken:

(a) after a period of time, during which there is no active session,
the session shall be automatically logged-out. A journal
message will be created indicating this;

accordance with the CCD entitled “Business Continuity Framework”
(CS/SIP/002).

6. GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES REQUIREMENTS.

6.1 Introduction

This section contains characteristics common to both the OPS and TMS Infrastructure
Services.

6.2 Links from OPS to TMS

6.2.1

General

6.2.1.1

6.2.1.2

6.2.1.3

Each instance of OPS within Branches shall interface with TMS to allow
the transfer, in both directions, of authorised data files and messages.

The transfer of data between OPS and TMS shall be secure, complete,
accurate and robust.

Within OPS it shall be possible for OPS to identify whether data from
OPS have been received by TMS or not.

Data Replication

6.2.2.1

6.2.2.2

6.2.2.3

6.2.2.4

Fujitsu Services shall use data replication and synchronisation
techniques to ensure that data transfer between Counter Positions at
which OPS is provided and between instances of OPS at each Counter
Position and the TMS are secure, complete, accurate and robust.

Once a Transaction has been settled at a Counter Position, TMS shall
commit the full Transaction details to that Counter Position PCs
message store. The Transaction details shall simultaneously be
automatically replicated to all other Counter Position PCs in the Branch
so that the data are securely captured. In addition, Fujitsu Services shall
automatically replicate Transaction details to a remote server at which
TMS is provided.

The OPS Counter Position PCs and TMS servers are known as
"nodes".

All data and message transfers from a single node shall be generated in
a strict numbered sequence with a unique node identification. Any
attempt to introduce a fraudulent message shall be automatically
detected and rejected by OPS.

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL
6.2.2.5
6.2.2.6

6.2.3

An additional pseudo random sequence number produced from a
cryptographic algorithm can also be included to provide a very high
level of message integrity as agreed between the Parties from time to
time, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. Details of the
use of the cryptographic algorithm are contained in the CCD entitled
“Security Functional Specification” (RS/FSP/001).

Data and message transfers shall be resilient to either network or node
failure. When the failure condition is resolved the nodes shall
automatically synchronise and complete any data or message transfers
that are required to ensure these nodes are in a consistent state.

Data Integrity

6.2.3.1

6.2.3.2

6.2.3.3

6.2.3.4

6.2.3.5

Fujitsu Services shall use techniques to ensure data integrity within the
OPS and as part of data/message transfer between OPS and TMS,
including:

(a) cyclic redundancy checks shall be calculated for all journal
records, including Reference Data;

(b) digital signatures shall be used for all data where assurance of
content and source are required; and

(c) data encryption shall be used selectively on certain data fields.

All messages and data shall have a cyclic redundancy check applied
when they are initially committed to the journal and this shall be
checked every time the message or data is accessed. This shall protect
against accidental corruption and casual tampering. Any failure of a
cyclic redundancy check shall cause the message to be rejected and
retrieved from alternate nodes.

In the event that nodes fail, recovery shall take place through the use of
the following techniques: associating of Post Office and correspondence
server nodes, message numbering, marker (message high and low
water marks) exchange message transfers to equalise water marks,
and in accordance with the CCD entitled “Post Office Site Failure
Contingency Procedures”.

Where Post Office requires the origin of data to be authenticated,
Fujitsu Services shall apply a digital signature to the data prior to
transmission and shall then check it upon receipt. Digital signature
techniques and the data to which they are applied shall be described in
the CCD entitled “Security Functional Specification” (RS/FSP/001).

Fujitsu Services shall automatically detect any attempt to alter data and
shall log such attempts for subsequent investigation by Fujitsu Services.
Details of all such attempts shall be passed to Post Office.

is clearly marked with a functional title or code so that it can be readily identified in the
relevant documentation and related to its proper place in the Horizon Service
Infrastructure.

NBS SPECIFIC BUSINESS CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

Each Data Centre (if required to support the NBS on its own as a result of a failure of
the other Data Centre) shall have the capability in normal operation, with no failures
having occurred:

7.1.1 to support the Contracted Volumes in relation to the NBS and Debit Card as
defined in the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and Business
Volumes” (PA/PER/033); and

7.1.2 to support Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of NBS Service Levels set out
in Annex 3 to Schedule B4.4 without preventing or impairing that Data Centre's
support for Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of the Service Levels for
other Services in existence at the Amendment Date.

The Data Centres (including NBS elements) will be configured such that no single point
of failure within the Data Centres will cause the NBS to fail with both Data Centres in
operation.

Switchover to backup systems within the Data Centres and for the network connections
within the Data Centres:

SCHEDULE B4.4
EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS
1. INTRODUCTION
11 The provisions of this Schedule B4.4 shall apply to the HNG-X Services (other

2.3

than the BCSF Service) from the Amendment Date and shall cease to have
effect on commencement of the relevant Trigger Event as set out within the
tables in Schedule B3.1. For the purposes of determining which existing Service
Levels are affected upon the occurrence of such Trigger Event, Annex 6 to this
Schedule B4.4 sets out each existing Service Level, as described in this
Schedule B4.4, and its corresponding Service Description.

This Schedule B4.4 defines up to three thresholds in respect of each Service
Level as follows:

1.2.1 the level of Service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from
Fujitsu Services by Post Office;

1.2.2 the level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give
rise to payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the
“Liquidated Damage Threshold” or “LDT’). Payment of liquidated
damages notwithstanding, a failure of any LDT shall not (on its own)
constitute a Default; and

1.2.3 the level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which if
not achieved by Fujitsu Services shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu
Services of Post Office Additional Costs or liquidated damages as
described (where relevant) in this Schedule (the “Additional Remedy
Level” or “ARL”).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that not all SLT failures shall give
rise to payment of liquidated damages. The SLT failures that do not give rise to
payment of liquidated damages are set out in each relevant Service Description
ccD.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The purpose of remedies (liquidated damages or any other additional remedy
specified in a Service Description) is that Post Office shall not be disadvantaged
by failures of Fujitsu Services to provide the Services to the agreed specification
and reliability.

For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages shall be based upon the
applicable fixed amounts or rates stated in this Schedule B4.4.

The performance of the Services against the SLT, LDT and ARL applicable in
respect of each Service Level shall be measured and reported and success or

failure against each shall be judged over Service Level Measurement Periods
defined for each Service. Additionally, all levels of service shall be monitored on
a weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet a Service Level assessed
over that month shall be reported to Post Office by means of the Service Review
Book produced on a monthly basis detailing all Service Levels and the actual
levels of service achieved in that month.

In respect of any SLT that has a Service Level Measurement Period equivalent to
a SLT Calendar Year or a Service Level Measurement Period that is otherwise
defined with reference to a SLT Calendar Year, in the event that the remainder of
the term of the Agreement after the last SLT Calendar Year of the term of the
Agreement in relation to that SLT (“Final Period”) is less than six (6) months then
Fujitsu Services shall:

2.4.1 continue to measure and report performance against that SLT during
the Final Period; and

2.4.2 not be obliged to take any remedial action should that SLT fail to be
achieved at any time during the Final Period.

The values applicable to each SLT are set out in the Annexes to this Schedule
B4.4.

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in this Schedule B4.4 in respect of a
particular Service Level, where Service Levels are expressed in terms of

performance required by a particular “Day”:

2.6.1 “Day A” means the day of the specified triggering event (such as the
date of a Transaction);

2.6.2 “Day B” means the day following Day A; and
2.6.3 “Day C” means the day following Day B and so on.
SERVICE LEVELS

The Annexes to this Schedule B4.4 define the SLTs, LDTs and ARLs for the
following groups of Services:

3.1.1 Service Desk services (Annex 1);
3.1.2 Data Delivery services (Annex 2);
3.1.3 Banking services (Annex 3); and

3.1.4 Miscellaneous services (Annex 4).

(the “Volumetric Limits”) which if exceeded over the period specified in the table
in Annex 5 (the “Relevant Period”) will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the
measurements of performance in respect of the Service Levels (SLTs and (if
applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) affected by that excess (the “Affected Service
Levels”). Such adjustment shall be made on the following basis:

4.1.1 if the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a calendar month and
that limit is exceeded, Fujitsu Services shall identify for joint
consideration with Post Office the days in that month on which the
average daily volume (based upon measurements of actual volumes
over the previous three months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties
(acting reasonably)) has been exceeded and shall specify for joint
consideration the reasons for that excess if caused or contributed to by
Fujitsu Services.

4.1.2 if the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a day and that limit is
exceeded, Fujitsu Services shall specify for joint consideration the
reason for that excess if caused or contributed to by Fujitsu Services.

4.1.3 for each day on which the average daily volume referred to in paragraph
4.1.1 or the Volumetric Limit referred to in paragraph 4.1.2 is exceeded:

(a) as a result of Default by Fujitsu Services, no adjustment shall be
made to the performance measurements for the Affected Service
Levels in respect of that day; or

(b) for any reason other than a Default by Fujitsu Services, the
performance measurements for the Affected Service Levels in
respect of that day shall be disregarded and replaced with an
average measurement for that day (based upon actual
performance measurements over the previous three calendar
months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting
reasonably)).

Following each Service Level Measurement Period the Parties will assess
whether, on average, over the relevant Service Level Measurement Period any of
the Volumetric Limits has been exceeded by 10% or more. In making that
assessment the Parties shall consider the cause of any daily peaks in excess of
daily averages during that period, and disregard the measurements in respect of
those days where the peaks have arisen as a result of Fujitsu Services’ Default.
If having made such assessment, the Parties agree that a Volumetric Limit has
been exceeded by 10% (and in the case of monthly Volumetric Limits, those
limits have been exceeded in any three consecutive months), the Parties shall
meet to discuss and agree (acting reasonably) appropriate changes to the
Volumetric Limits and any change to the applicable Service Levels.

SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF - BUSINESS VOLUMES CCD

The CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033) (the “Business Volumes CCD”) defines various limits on
numbers of Transactions or instances of Service as “Contracted Volumes” or
“Design Limits” for EPOSS, APS, LFS, Message Broadcast Service, Reference
Data Management Service, NBS, DCMoP and on-line Transactions.

On each day that any of the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business
Volumes CCD is exceeded, the measures of Fujitsu Services' performance for
the Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) listed in the
Business Volumes CCD shall be disregarded and replaced with an average
measurement for that day (based upon actual performance measurements over
the previous three calendar months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties
(acting reasonably)).

If the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes CCD are
exceeded, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly consider the reasons for
such excess and whether it is temporary or is or is likely to be continuing. If such
excess is or is likely to be continuing Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to make a
reasonable and proportionate adjustment to the relevant Contracted Volume
and/or the affected Service Levels or obligations specified in the Business
Volumes CCD, such adjustment to be agreed with Post Office under the Change
Control Procedure.

If any of the Design Limits specified in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded
then the measures of Fujitsu Services' performance for any Service Level or
other service target involving data processing (requiring either automated or
manual processing or both) shall be disregarded to the extent that Fujitsu
Services can demonstrate to Post Office's satisfaction (Post Office acting
reasonably) that failure to meet the Service Level and/or service target, as the
case may be, occurred as a result of a Design Limit being exceeded. Fujitsu
Services shall use reasonable endeavours to meet those Service Levels and/or
service targets during the period when the measures of Fujitsu Services’
performance are disregarded.

OTHER SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF

The Parties shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld)
appropriate relief from Service Levels if any new facilities or products are
introduced, by agreement, with less testing than would otherwise be required to
safeguard Fujitsu Services' position.

For the periods in which the NBS and/or any of the Horizon Applications (other
than NBS) or Infrastructure Services are suspended in accordance with
paragraph 3.4.15 of the CCD entitled “Service Management Service - Service
Description” (CS/SER/014), measurements of Fujitsu Services' performance in
respect of all Service Levels detrimentally affected by such suspension (in
respect of those Horizon Applications and Services) shall be disregarded and

Fujitsu Services shall be released from those of its obligations in respect of those
Horizon Applications and Services which it is unable to perform as a result of
such suspension.

If Fujitsu Services fails to achieve any Service Level or service target (as the
case may be) and can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that
such failure occurred as a result of a fault or problem within the QAS Software,
such fault or problem requiring the Third Line Support Service or Application
Support Service (Fourth Line) in order to be resolved, then the measures of
Fujitsu Services’ performance in respect of such Service Level and other service
target shall be disregarded for the period affected by the QAS Software fault or
problem.

RECTIFICATION PLAN

In the event that an ARL specified in this Schedule B4.4 is failed, Fujitsu Services
and Post Office shall agree a method of rectification and timetable for the
resolution of the cause of that failure (a “Rectification Plan”). For the avoidance
of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall remain liable for financial remedies payable in
accordance with this Schedule B4.4 in respect of that failure.

In the event that the Rectification Plan involves a change to the provision of the
Services, such change shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure and
shall be made at no charge to Post Office.

Without prejudice to Post Office's rights to remedies provided in this Agreement,
during the period the Rectification Plan is being implemented Fujitsu Services
shall maintain performance of all other Services in accordance with the Service
Levels specified in this Schedule B4.4 unless otherwise agreed with Post Office
as part of the Rectification Plan.

In the event that the Rectification Plan is not agreed by the Parties (acting
reasonably) within three (3) calendar months of the occurrence of an ARL failure
or the Rectification Plan fails to resolve the cause of the ARL failure to which it
relates, such that the ARL failure occurs again and is persistent, the following
provisions shall apply:

7.41 Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and require Fujitsu Services
to co-operate and assist with, a tender process for sub-contracting by
Fujitsu Services of the Operational Services in relation to which the ARL
failure has occurred to an alternative service provider (the “Service
Provider’). If the Parties agree that it would be more appropriate for
Fujitsu Services to conduct, and Post Office to co-operate with, the
tender process, then the Parties shall procure the same.

74.2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services
shall disclose to any bona fide potential Service Provider (subject to the
same executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-
disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services

Schedule B4.4 Version 9.0
Page 6 of 51

Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL,
and such bona fide potential Service Provider) Confidential Information
to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable any
potential Service Provider to prepare a reasonably detailed tender
proposal.
7.4.3 If the outcome of any tender process is that Fujitsu Services were to

sub-contract the Operational Services in question to a Service Provider
identified in the tender process, the performance in respect of the failed
ARL for that Operational Service would be improved then Post Office
shall have the right to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such
Operational Service to such Service Provider at no higher cost to Post
Office than was previously the case.

8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any dispute arising in connection with the application of this Schedule B4.4 shall

Application of APS Service Levels

The SLTs, LDTs and ARLs specified in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex 2 are of
generic application to APS Clients and the relevant performance
measurements for all APS Clients (for which services are being provided as
at the Amendment Date) shall be aggregated for the purposes of those
SLTs, LDTs and ARLs. All APS Clients introduced after the Amendment
Date shall be included in that aggregate unless it is specifically stated
otherwise in the applicable CCN.

Data File delivery

(a) Delivery of APS Transaction records shall not normally be before 03:00
on the day following the completion of those Transactions (referred to
as “Day B” in the tables below).

(b) Where Fujitsu Services is required to deliver APS Client files on
specified days, the terms Day B, Day C, Day D and Day J used in this
paragraph 2.1 of this Annex 2 shall be construed as the days on which
files could have been delivered as specified in the relevant AP Client
Specification. If files may only be delivered Monday to Friday inclusive,
then for Transactions completed on Thursday, Day B shall be Friday
and Day C shall be Monday.

(c) The SLT, LDT and ARL for APS Transaction Data File delivery are as
shown in the table below:

(d) For the purposes of paragraph 2.1.3(c) above, in relation to each AP
Client serviced by the APS via the EDG:

Remedies

(i) the Transaction record file shall be deemed to be
delivered when it is delivered to the EDG and not the AP
Client; and

(ii) a successful Transaction record file delivery will be

deemed to have occurred when the file transfer software
running on the remote file transfer management service
(FTMS) gateway identifies that a successful transfer to
the EDG has occurred or cannot occur because of
problems within the EDG infrastructure.

(a) The liquidated damages for late delivery of APS Transaction Data Files

shall

be calculated when the relevant LDT is breached as follows:
liquidated damages =

(((100 - actual level of Service by Day J) / 100) * total number of
Transactions * 1.46 pence) +

(((98.5 — (the greater of the ARL (98) and the actual level of
Service by Day D)) / 100) * (total number of Transactions - any
also failing at Day J) * 1.46 pence) +

(((97.5 - actual level of Service by Day C) / 100) * (total number of
Transactions - any also failing at Day D and Day J) * 1.46 pence) +

(((96.5 - actual level of Service by Day B) / 100) * (total number of
Transactions - any also failing at Day J, Day D and Day C) * 1.46
pence).

(b) Where the level of service falls below the ARL specified in the table in
paragraph 2.1.3(c) Post Office shall be entitled to recover in addition to

any liquidated damages recovered under paragraph 2.1.4(a), the
greater of:
(i) liquidated damages calculated as follows:
liquidated damages =
((ARL (98) — the actual level of Service by Day D) / 100) *
(total number of Transactions - any also failing at Day J) *
1.46 pence; and

In respect of all Transactions undertaken on a particular day, the proportion
of Transaction records delivered from TMS to Configured POL FS following
that day (i.e. Transactions on Day A, delivery to Configured POL FS by 07:30
Day B, Day C, Day D and Day J) shall be measured by Fujitsu Services.

Subject to paragraph 2.2.4, Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable
endeavours within the capacity and performance constraints of the POL FS
System to ensure that all Transactions occurring on Day A are loaded onto
Configured POL FS as set out in the table below:

Service Requirement Target

Transactions loaded from TMS I 96% of all Transaction records loaded onto

onto Configured POL FS. Configured POL FS by 07:30 hours on Day

C (i.e. 1 Day after Day B);

98% of all Transaction records loaded onto
Configured POL FS by 07:30 hours on Day
D (i.e. 1 Day after Day C);

100% of all Transaction records loaded onto
Configured POL FS by 07:30 hours on Day J
(i.e. 6 Days after Day D).

2.2.3

2.2.4

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets described in
paragraph 2.2.2 as a result of lack of capacity or performance of the POL FS
System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address the
deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management Service.

The measurement of the targets in paragraph 2.2.2 shall not include:

(a) in the event that the QA/Test SAP System is used as the failover
system for the Production SAP System pursuant to paragraph
2.2.5, any Transactions required to be loaded onto Configured
POL FS during the period commencing from the day on which the
QA/Test SAP System is used and expiring on the day on which
the Production SAP System becomes available and Fujitsu
Services has completed the loading of all data onto the
Production SAP System from the QA/Test SAP System;

(b) any failure to load any Transaction onto Configured POL FS
where such failure is caused either by:

(i) the incorrect functioning of PRISM application code; or

In the event that an incident or a major failure of the
Production SAP System causes the Production SAP System
(situated in the live Data Centre) to be unavailable:

Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office of such incident
or failure (in such manner as is practicable in the
circumstances) as soon as reasonably practicable and if
such notification is not in written form, shall confirm in
writing in accordance with the normal practice for
incident management between the Parties;

the QA/Test SAP System (situated in the DR Data
Centre) shall be used as the failover system for the
Production SAP System; and

the POL FS Services in respect of the QA/Test SAP
System shall be suspended for the duration of such
incident or failure.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the time taken for failover
referred to in paragraph 2.2.5(a) (measured between notice
being given by Fujitsu Services pursuant to section
2.2.5(a)(i) and the QA/Test SAP System being re-configured
for use as the Production SAP System) does not exceed 48
hours. In the event that such failover is required, it shall be
permissible for the POL FS Services to be reduced in terms
of number of concurrent users, response times and hours of
service.

Fujitsu Services is not obliged to provide failover systems
for the QA/Test SAP System or the Development SAP
System and, in the event that an incident or a system failure
causes either the QA/Test SAP System or the Development
SAP System to become unavailable, the POL FS Services
in respect of the QA/Test SAP System and the Development
SAP System shall be suspended for the duration of such
incident or failure.

In the event that Fujitsu Services gives notice pursuant to
section 2.2.5(a)(i) above, Post Office shall ensure that the
QA/Test SAP System is available for failover within two
hours of such notice being given

liquidated damages =

(L-(0.01 * T)) * £3.82, or zero if the result of that calculation is
negative, where:

L = the number of times (summed for all Branches) that a pouch
delivery confirmation entered at a Branch before 19.00 has been
delivered to SAPADS after 08:00 the next day; and

T = the number of times (summed for all Branches) that a pouch
delivery confirmation has been entered at a Branch before 19.00.

For the purposes of L and T, each delivery will have a single
confirmation, whether that delivery comprises one pouch or
multiple pouches.

In the event that Fujitsu Services fails to achieve the ARL in
respect of SAPADS to Branch data transfer set out in the table in
paragraph 2.3.4(a), Post Office shall be entitled to recover Post
Office Additional Costs from Fujitsu Services.

ANNEX 3 TO SCHEDULE B4.4 - BANKING SERVICES

PART A - NBS SERVICE LEVELS AND REMEDIES

NBS SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES

This Part A of Annex 3 to Schedule B4.4 specifies the SLTs and ARLs and the
performance measurements required in respect of them for the NBS. No LDTs are
specified for the NBS in this Annex, but liquidated damages shall be payable by
Fujitsu Services in accordance with paragraph 3 and 4 of this Annex 3.

For the purposes of this Annex 3:

“Availability Period” means each period of six (6) months commencing on 1 January
and 1 July each SLT Calendar Year;

“Central NB System” means the elements of the NB System which enable on-line
Banking Transactions to be carried out, excluding all:

1.2.1 such elements in Branches (or other Post Office locations where the NBS is
available);

1.2.2 network components between each Branch (or other Post Office locations
where the NBS is available) and the Data Centres; and

1.2.3 network components between the Data Centres and the Banks;

“Core NB System Fault” means a fault in the Central NB System which causes the
NBS not to be available in any one or more Branches for the period that fault persists;

“Customer Critical Exception” means a NB Priority Exception in respect of which
Fujitsu Services has received a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice; and

“Non NB Core Hours” means all hours which are not NB Core Hours.

The Service Levels described in this Annex 3 relate to the performance of the NBS
within the NBS Service Boundaries as measured at the points and/or in the manner
described in this Annex 3.

All calculations (including percentages and averages) upon which the SLTs, ARLs or
other targets in this Schedule are based shall be calculated, and Fujitsu Services’
performance assessed, for the relevant Service Level Measurement Period or
Availability Period as a whole. Without prejudice to that calculation and assessment,
Fujitsu Services' performance against the Service Levels in this Annex 3 shall be
reported monthly for service monitoring purposes in the Service Review Book.

The architecture of the NB System shall be capable of supporting Banking
Transactions (in accordance with applicable Service Levels) carried out in each
Branch during the hours that Branch is actually open for business, except during the
period from 2000 to 0800 each 24 hour period when Banking Transactions shall not

Schedule B4.4 Annex 3 Part: A version 9.0
Page 28 of 51

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069

be able to be carried out in Branches due to system management activities (including
the introduction of major Releases in accordance with paragraph 3.5.1 of the CCD
entitled “Service Management Service: Service Description” (CS/SER/014)), activities
in support of software distribution, continuity tests and Reference Data update and
such other activities as the parties may agree). Such periods shall be scheduled by
agreement with Post Office in accordance with current practices used in respect of the
Applications (other than the NBS) and the Infrastructure Services, such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld.

For the purposes of the NBS, in particular the NBS Service Levels described in this
Annex 3 to Schedule B4.4, the result of the following calculation:

¢ MCWP minus MAAWP,
(such result being referred to in this paragraph 1.6 as the “NB Additional Time”) shall
not be less than 15 seconds. Once set, or as otherwise specified in the CCD entitled
“NBS Definition” (BP/SPE/035), changes to the MCWP and/or MAAWP where the
resulting MCWP is less than or equal to 40 seconds and where the resulting NB
Additional Time is more than or equal to 15 seconds shall be subject to change under
Operational Business Change (as applicable in respect of product change), and
changes where the resulting MCWP is greater than 40 seconds and/or the resulting
NB Additional Time is less than 15 seconds shall be subject to agreement under the
Change Control Procedure.
This Annex 3 sets out five categories of performance measures:
1.7.1 NB Request and NB Authorisation transmission time measures;
1.7.2 NBS availability measures; and

1.7.3 Data Reconciliation Service measures.

Of these, paragraphs 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 above are subject to liquidated damages whilst
paragraph 1.7.3 is not.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES,

NB Request and NB Authorisation transmission times

2.1.1 Banking Transactions referred to in this paragraph 2.1 shall be those for
which a NB Request is generated and a corresponding NB Authorisation is
received from the Banks before the earliest of:

(a) the MCWP has expired;

(b) the Banking Transaction is Declined by the Counter Clerk; and

(c) the Banking Transaction fails,

and no other Banking Transactions shall be included in the calculation set
out in paragraph 2.1.4.

For each Banking Transaction, Fujitsu Services shall record the time (for the
purposes of this paragraph 2.1 referred to as “T1”) which elapses between
the NB Request being generated at the relevant automated Counter Position,
and the corresponding NB Authorisation being received back at that Counter
Position.

For each Banking Transaction, Fujitsu Services shall record the time (for the
purposes of this paragraph 2.1 referred to as “T2”) which elapses between
the NB Authorisation Agent generating each NB Request for routing to the
Banks and the corresponding NB Authorisation being received back from the
Banks by the NB Authorisation Agent.

Fujitsu Services shall calculate a value for “T” for each Banking Transaction
as follows:

T=71-72.

The Service Level Targets are that the average Time for NBS Transactions
conducted in Branches using Fixed ADSL and Dialled Connections taken
together, for the periods such connections are scheduled to be established,
shall not exceed 2.5 seconds.

22 NBS availability measures

2.2.1

Central Systems Availability

(a) Subject to paragraph 2.2.1(b), Fujitsu Services shall record and/or
calculate the following:

(i) the number of Core NB System Faults which causes the
NBS not to be available in 20% or more of all Branches;
and

(ii) in respect of each Core NB System Fault, the average

period of time (“Average Branch Outage”) that the NBS
is not available in a Branch affected by that Core NB
System Fault, as follows:

Average Branch Outage = A multiplied by B,
where:
A = the period, excluding the first five minutes, that a

Core NB System Fault causes the NBS not to be
available in any one or more Branches;

Schedule B4.4 Annex 3 Part: A version 9.0

Page 30 of 51
CONFIDENTIAL

B = the number of Branches where the NBS is not
available as a result of that Core NB System Fault
expressed as a proportion of the total number of
Branches.

(b) For the purposes of the recording and/or calculations referred to in
paragraph 2.2.1(a) of this Annex 3 which are to be used for the
purposes of paragraph 2.2.1(c) of this Annex 3:

(i) Core NB System Faults that cause the NBS not to be
available for 5 minutes or less; and

(ii) all non-availability of the NBS due to any of the system
management activities referred to in paragraph 1.7 of
this Annex 3 or to any other system changes agreed by
the Parties,

shall be excluded, and
(iii) Branches referred to in paragraph 2.2.1(a) of this
Annex 3 are those Branches where the NBS is required

(subject to Clause 2.2) to be available.

(c) The Service Level Targets in respect of each Availability Period are set
out in the following table:

paragraph 2.2.1(d) as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of
the Horizon Service Infrastructure, then increases in capacity or
performance required to address the deficiency shall be dealt with by
the Capacity Management Service.

2.3 Data Reconciliation Service measures

2.3.1

Page 32 of 51

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken to resolve each NB Priority
Exception, counting time within MSU Days only, as follows:

(a)

(b)

where no Disputed Banking Transaction Notice has been received by
Fujitsu Services and a Banking Transaction persists in system state
category number 4 or 12 as set out in the CCD entitled “Network
Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011), such
measurement shall commence at 0800 on the second MSU Day
following receipt by the DRSH of the corresponding C4 Confirmation or
D Message (as applicable);

where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been
received by the DRSH prior to the day of receipt of that Disputed
Banking Transaction Notice, such measurement shall commence at the
time of receipt of the Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (but not if
already commenced in accordance with (a) above, in which case (a)
shall apply); and

where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message is
received by the DRSH on the same day as that Disputed Banking
Transaction Notice or on a subsequent day, such measurement shall
commence at 0800 on the next MSU Day following receipt of that C4
Confirmation or D Message (as applicable).

In each case above the NB Priority Exception shall be deemed resolved and
measurement shall stop at the time Fujitsu Services sends information to
Post Office sufficient to enable Post Office to settle that exception with the
relevant Bank, as described in the CCD entitled “On Line Services
Reconciliation & Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002).

2.3.5

In respect of each NB Priority Exception where Fujitsu Services requires:
(a) information from, or access to, a Branch; or
(b) information from the Post Office regarding Banks,

for that exception to be resolved, the following shall not count towards the
time for resolution of that exception:

(a) the period, if any, during which Fujitsu Services is unable to contact (by
telephone or other method agreed by the Parties) the Branch in
question or the Post Office regarding Banks in order to request that
information or access, provided that Fujitsu Services has used
reasonable endeavours to make such contact; and

(b) the period, if any, whilst Fujitsu Services waits for that information or
access to be provided by the Branch in question or the Post Office
regarding Banks, having requested it, provided that Fujitsu Services has

The discounting of the periods described in 2.3.2(c) and 2.3.2(d) above shall
be subject to Fujitsu Services providing reports to Post Office setting out the
reasons for discounting any such periods from the resolution time for a NB
Priority Exception and the duration of such periods.

In respect of each Disputed Banking Transaction Notice, Fujitsu Services
shall continue to check on each MSU Day following that notice whether a
corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been received until either
a Customer Critical Exception arises and is resolved or Fujitsu Services and
Post Office agree alternative action.

For the purposes of paragraph 2.3 of this Annex 3:

(a) “day” means a period running for 24 hours from 00:00; and

(b) aC4 Confirmation or D Message received on a day by the DRSH after
21:30 on that day shall be deemed to have been received the next day.

The Service Level Target set out in paragraph 2.3.6 of this Annex 3 shall
apply in respect of:

(a) all Customer Critical Exceptions; and
(b) the first 500 NB Priority Exceptions (other than Customer Critical
Exceptions) occurring on each day (excluding those described in

Exceptions arising from such common cause is greater than 100.

2.3.6 The Service Level Target is that the resolution time (measured in accordance
with paragraphs 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of this Annex 3) for 95 % of the NB Priority
Exceptions specified in paragraph 2.3.5 of this Schedule B4.4 shall not
exceed 8 hours.
3. REMEDIES

3.1 Liquidated Damages

3.1.4

The liquidated damages payable by Fujitsu Services shall be based on a
series of measurements, accumulated over a range of Services. This
paragraph 3 specifies the contribution made by the NBS.

In respect of each Service Level Measurement Period the liquidated
damages payable by Fujitsu Services for failures to achieve the SLTs set out
in paragraphs 2.1.5 and 2.3.3 of this Annex 3 shall equal:

(a) the sum of Remedies(Time) and Remedies(Reliability) as referred to in
paragraph 3.3 of this Annex 3 and Table 4 of the CCD entitled "Branch
Network: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0011) respectively for
that period, less

(b) the amount recoverable under paragraph 3.1.7(a) as_ liquidated
damages for any failures of the ARLs corresponding to those SLTs.

In respect of each Availability Period the liquidated damages payable by
Fujitsu Services under this Annex 3 shall equal the sum of
Remedies(Availability1) and Remedies(Availability2) as referred to in
paragraph 3.4 for that period.

In addition to the sums referred to in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of this
Annex 3 Fujitsu Services shall also pay liquidated damages calculated as set
out in paragraph 4 of this Annex 3.

The total cumulative sums payable for liquidated damages by Fujitsu
Services under this Agreement shall not exceed the limits set out in
paragraph 2.7 of Schedule C1.

PAYMENT FILE DELIVERY

Fujitsu Services' obligations regarding transmission of Payment Files (as that term is
defined in the CCD entitled “Debit Card MoP Functional Description” (EF/SER/001)) to
the MA shall be as specified in the CCD entitled “Debit Card MoP Functional
Description” (EF/SER/001). In the event that an attempt to transmit a Payment File to
the MA in accordance with that CCD fails then those provisions shall be supplemented
by paragraph 5.2.

Where Fujitsu Services attempts to transmit a Payment File to the MA and the attempt
is unsuccessful Fujitsu Services shall be required to make one further attempt to
transmit that file to the MA on that day. If such further attempt fails, Fujitsu Services
shall report the same to the Post Office. Thereafter, Fujitsu Services shall provide
such assistance and co-operation as set out in the Working Document entitled “DC
Operational Level Agreement” for the purposes of procuring the transmission of that
Payment File to the MA as soon as reasonably practicable.

In the event that the process specified in paragraph 5.2 above has been followed by
Fujitsu Services, no payment of liquidated damages (as specified in paragraph 5.4
below) will be payable by Fujitsu Services due to the relevant Payment File not
reaching the MA.

Subject to paragraph 5.3 above, in the event that a Payment File is not received by
the MA by the time specified for such in the CCD entitled “Horizon — Streamline
Application Interface Specification” (EF/IFS/002) on the day after creation of the
Payment File, liquidated damages will be payable by Fujitsu Services to Post Office,
by Fujitsu Services issuing Post Office with a credit note, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the day on which the MA receives the Payment File. Such
liquidated damages (to be applied by way of credit) will be calculated in accordance
with the following formula:

liquidated damages per Payment File not received as stated above (£) =
{(X x Y/365} x Z

where:

X = the value (pounds sterling) of the relevant Payment File;

Y = the figure (expressed as a percentage) representing the base rate of Barclays
Bank Plc (prevailing on the day the Payment File is required to be delivered (as
specified in the CCD entitled “Horizon — Streamline Application Interface Specification”

(EF/IFS/002)) plus 3 per cent.; and

Z= the number of days from and including the date after creation of the Payment File
until and including the day on which the MA receives the Payment File.

Fujitsu Services shall include in the BIM Report submitted pursuant to paragraph 6.2
above the Merchant ID, the card number, Transaction amount, Transaction code and
Transaction date for the DC Exception in question. In addition, save in respect of each
DC Exception Reimbursement (in which case the provisions of paragraph 6.6 below
shall apply), Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain from the
relevant Branch the following data (the “Relevant Data”) (for inclusion in the relevant
BIM Report) from the receipt for the DC Exception in question:

6.3.1 issue number (to the extent that the issue number is required by the card
scheme issuer for manual settlement (as confirmed in the CCD entitled “On
Line Services Reconciliation & Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002)); and

6.3.2 Expiry Date.

Fujitsu Services’ obligation to obtain the Relevant Data as specified in paragraph 6.3
above shall cease in the event that:

costs of obtaining the Relevant Data and effecting manual settlement).

In respect of each DC Exception Reimbursement, Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post
Office an amount equal to the sum of the DC Transaction Value and £125.06.

Save where paragraph 6.5 applies (in which event the provisions of this paragraph 6.7
shall not apply), for each DC Exception (other than a DC Exception Reimbursement)
Fujitsu Services shall (provided manual settlement has been effected) pay to Post
Office the lesser of:

6.7.1 £125.06; and

6.7.2 £100.00,

in respect of Post Office's costs of effecting manual settlement.

Save in respect of a DC Exception Reimbursement, in the event that:

6.8.1 due solely to the acts or omissions of Fujitsu Services the BIM Report
referred to in paragraph 6.2 is not delivered to Post Office within the time
period (for the purposes of avoiding “charge backs”) specified in the CCD
entitled “On Line Services Reconciliation & Incident Management”
(NB/PRO/002) or the BIM Report is delivered within that time period but it
does not include the Relevant Data in circumstances where Fujitsu Services
is in Default of its obligation in paragraph 6.3 above to obtain such Relevant
Data or a payment is required to be made to Post Office pursuant to
paragraph 6.5 above; and

6.8.2 the Merchant Acquirer does not reimburse Post Office the DC Transaction

liquidated damages. The liquidated damages shall be calculated in accordance with
the following formula:

liquidated damages (£) = (N x TV x Y) / 365
where:

N = the number of MSU Days, including the day the BIM Report was due for delivery
pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, that the BIM Report is delivered late;

TV = the DC Transaction Value; and

Y = the figure (expressed as a percentage) representing the base rate of Barclays
Bank Plc (prevailing on the day the BIM Report was due for delivery (as specified in
the CCD entitled “On Line Services Reconciliation & Incident Management”
(NB/PRO/002)) plus 3 per cent.

The Parties acknowledge that the fundamental commercial assumptions underlying
the provisions of this paragraph 6 are that (i) the total number of DC Exceptions in any
calendar month shall not exceed 100 and (ii) the total number of DC Exception
Reimbursements in any calendar month shall not exceed 20. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that should these assumptions prove to be incorrect they shall review and in
good faith negotiate appropriate amendments to the provisions of this paragraph 6.

ANNEX 4 TO SCHEDULE B4.4 - MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES
1. IMPLEMENTATION - SERVICE LEVEL TARGETS: INSTALLATION OF SERVICE

INFRASTRUCTURE

General principles for creating Service Levels for each Implementation shall be agreed
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a case by case basis in accordance with
the Change Control Procedure.

2s SERVICE LEVELS AND OTHER TARGETS FOR TESQA
2.1 Availability
2.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall, upon the expiry of each SLT Calendar Year, measure

the time that TESQA was available to be logged on to by TESQA Users as a
proportion of the total time between 07:00 and 22:00 on each day of that year
("TESQA Availability").

The Service Level Target is that TESQA Availability in each SLT Calendar
Year shall be no less than 99.75% which equals less than or equal to 13
hours 30 minutes Downtime. Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office of any
failures to achieve this target monthly on an exception basis.

For the purposes of the above SLT, the Service Level Measurement Period is
each SLT Calendar Year.

2.2 Query Time

2.2.1

2.2.2

Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the query
time for all properly constrained transaction queries (as defined below)
between 07:00 and 18:00 is no longer than 20 seconds.

For the purposes of paragraph 2.2.1, a properly constrained transaction
query is one of:

(a) APAN and a date/time range of 31 days or less (rolling).
(b) APAN, an amount and a date/time range of 31 days or less (rolling).

(c) A PAN, a Banking Transaction and a date/time range of 31 days or less
(rolling).

(d) APAN, a FAD, a frequency greater than 1 and a date/time range of 31
days or less (rolling).

(e) No PAN, but an amount greater than 4,999.98 and a date range of less
than 1 day.

Schedule B4.4 Annex 4 Version 9.0

Page 42 of 51

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

(f) No PAN, but a frequency greater than 4 and a date range of less than 1
day

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the target described in
paragraph 2.2.1 as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of the
Horizon Service Infrastructure, then increases in capacity or performance
required to address the deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity
Management Service.

Fujitsu Services shall make available a report of the TESQA query times to
the Service Management Relationship. The report shall show, for different
periods during 07:00 and 22:00 of each day, the query times for each type of
query (including for properly constrained transaction queries, unconstrained
transaction queries, data queries and count only queries).

TESQA will have the ability to decrypt encrypted PANs on an individual
basis. These requests shall be excluded from the measurement of
achievement of the target in paragraph 2.2.1 above.

For properly constrained transaction queries using a PAN as described in
paragraph 2.2.2 above, the target time in paragraph 2.2.1 above shall be
extended. Such extension to the target time shall be agreed between the
Parties and shall not exceed twice the target time in paragraph 2.2.1 above.
The extended target time shall apply from X2 (as described in Part 1 of
Annex 1 of Schedule BS5) until a date to be agreed between the Parties that
shall be a date after there are no more in clear PAN values within the
Transaction Enquiry Service.

2.3 Data Load

2.3.1

2.3.2

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken for data to become available for
interrogation to TESQA, measured from the time that the data is available within
the Data Centre either from an external source, or when an update to the status
of a Transaction is recorded in Transaction data by the Data Centre components.
internally ("Data Load Time").

The Service Level Target in respect of the Data Load Time is that:

(a) Subject to paragraph 2.3.2(c), 97% of the data will be available within
15 minutes between 07:00 and 20:00 on each day of each SLT
Calendar Year, except in the event that the Transaction Enquiry Service
fails or an Incident occurs in which case the data will be available within
two hours (for 100% of all queries);

(b) Subject to paragraph 2.3.2(c), 97% of the data will be available within
40 minutes between 20:00 and 22:00 on each day of each SLT
Calendar Year, except in the event that the Transaction Enquiry Service
fails or an Incident occurs in which case the data will be available within
two hours (for 100% of all queries);

(c) 100% of the data will be available within four hours during each SLT
Calendar Year at all other times of the day; and

(d) For the purposes of the SLT described in paragraph 2.3.2, the Service
Level Measurement Period is each SLT Calendar Year.

24 After Hours Availability

2.4.1 Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to:

(a) ensure that TESQA is available to be logged on to by TESQA Users
under normal operation on a 24 x 7 basis other than during periods of
daily overnight maintenance;

(b) notify Post Office in advance of the approximate start and finish times of
such overnight maintenance periods, such periods being no longer than
four hours in duration; and

(c) ensure that during such overnight maintenance periods TESQA is taken
off-line for a total period of no longer than 30 minutes duration.

3. SERVICE LEVELS FOR POL FS SERVICES

3.1 Availability

3.1.4

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time that Configured POL FS in live
operational use (as opposed to in development or testing environments) is
available to be logged into by POL FS Users as a proportion of the total time
between 07:30 and 19:30 hours on Working Days (“POL FS Availability”).

Subject to paragraph 3.1.3, the Service Level Target for the POL FS System
is that:

(a) POL FS Availability in each Service Level Measurement Period shall be
greater than or equal to 98.5%.

(b) the POL FS System shall not be unavailable to be logged into by POL
FS Users on any single occasion in any Service Level Measurement
Period for more than four hours, or ten hours where offsite engineering
expertise or replacement equipment is required,

measuring time in relation to paragraphs 3.1.2(a) and 3.1.2(b) between
07:30 and 19:30 on Working Days only and excluding time required,
following a failure, to repair or recover Configured POL FS, the SAP Loading
Applications and/or the underlying database.

If the elements of the POL FS System used to support live operational use of
Configured POL FS become unavailable and failover occurs pursuant to
paragraph 5.2 of Schedule B2, the period of such unavailability shall not be

3.2.2 When a new Client interface to the POL FS System is introduced by Post
Office the design target for “New Client” in paragraph 3.2.1 shall apply to
data being loaded from that Client provided that:

(a) no volumes in the CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and
Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033) are exceeded; and
(b) no new physical link to the POL FS System is required.
3.2.3 The measurement of the design targets in paragraph 3.2.1 shall not include

any failure to load any data onto Configured POL FS where such failure is
caused either by:

(a) _ the incorrect functioning of PRISM application code; or

(b) the incorrect configuration of Configured POL FS (including but not
limited to missing FAD) provided that such incorrect configuration is a
result of configuration activity that is not the responsibility of Fujitsu
Services.

unreasonably withheld) and record a reasonable sample set of transactions
types that may be undertaken by POL FS Users (“Sample Transaction
Types”) using Configured POL FS and a target maximum SAP System Time
in respect of each such transaction type and each shall be specified, once
agreed, in this Schedule B4.4.

Fujitsu Services shall monitor the Sample Transaction Types to determine
the average SAP System Time for transactions of each Sample Transaction
Type in each Service Level Measurement Period.

Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours within the capacity and
performance constraints of the POL FS System to ensure that the average
SAP System Times for transactions of each Sample Transaction Type as
measured in each Service Level Measurement Period do not exceed the
applicable target maximum SAP System Times specified in this accordance
with paragraph 3.3.2 of this Schedule B4.4.

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets referred to in
paragraph 3.3.4 as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of the POL
FS System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address
the deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management Service.

paragraph 3.4.1 as a result of lack of capacity or performance of the POL FS
System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address the
deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management Service.

Remedies

The targets specified in paragraphs 3.2.1, 3.3.4 and 3.4.1 are not SLTs, ARLs or LDTs
and there are no remedies applicable in the event of failure to achieve those targets or
the SLT described in paragraph 3.1.2, other than the remedies specified in this
paragraph 3 which shall be Post Office’s exclusive remedy in respect of any such
failures.

Failover

If the elements of the POL FS System used to support live operational use of
Configured POL FS become unavailable and failover occurs pursuant to paragraph
5.2 of Schedule B2, the period of such unavailability shall not be taken into account for
the purposes of assessing Fujitsu Services’ performance in respect of the design
targets set out in paragraphs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 above.

SERVICE LEVELS FOR POL MI HOSTING SERVICES
Availability

4.14 Fujitsu Services shall measure the time that Configured POL MI is in live
operational use (as opposed to in development or testing environments) ia
available to be logged into by POL MI users as a proportion of the total time
between 0700 and 1900 on Working Days excluding any pre-arranged
system outage agreed between the parties (“POL MI Availability).

4.1.2 Subject to paragraph 4.1.3, the Service Level Target for the POL MI System
is that:

4.1.2.1 POL MI Availability in each Service Level Measurement Period shall
be greater than or equal to 98.5%,

4.1.2.2 The POL MI System shall not be unavailable to be logged into by
POL MI Users on any single occasion in any Service Level
Measurement Period for more than four hours, or ten hours where
offsite engineering expertise or replacement equipment is required.,

measuring time in relation to paragraphs 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2 between 0700
and 1900 on Working Days only and excluding time required, following a
failure, to repair or recover Configured POL MI and/or the underlying
database. For the avoidance of doubt, there are no remedies applicable in
the event of failure to achieve the SLT described in this paragraph other than
the remedies specified in this paragraph 4 which shall be Post Office's
exclusive remedy in respect of any such failures,

In the event that the SLT set out in paragraph 4.1.2 is not met, Fujitsu
Services shall provide Post Office with an analysis of the reasons for the
failure. Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree a reasonable
rectification and improvement plan to address the failure.

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets described in
paragraph 4.1.2 as a result of lack of capacity or performance of the POL
MI System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address
the deficiency shall be the responsibility of Post Office and until such
deficiency is resolved Fujitsu Services shall not be required to achieve the
targets described in paragraph 4.1.2.

CCN1200, are set out in Schedule B6.2.

Fujitsu Services shall carry out Transition in compliance with the Migration and
Implementation Requirements and the HNG-X Migration Assumptions.

The HNG-X Programme Plan and a description of the Dependencies as at the date of
signature of CCN1246 are set out at Parts 2 and 3, respectively, of Annex 1 to this
Schedule. The Parties agree that those parts to that Annex need not be updated to
reflect changes made subsequently to the HNG-X Programme Plan.

ACTIVITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TRANSITION
Introduction

The activities and obligations that are to be performed in relation to Transition fall into
two categories:

3.1.1 those activities and obligations that are required exclusively for the purposes of
Project HNG-X ("HNG-X Project Activities"); and

3.1.2 those activities and obligations that effect changes to the Existing Services,
Horizon Applications and Horizon Service Infrastructure that are not required
exclusively for the purposes of Project HNG-X ("Associated Change
Activities").

HNG-X Project Activities

3.2.1. The HNG-X Project Activities are divided across the following HNG-X Project
Workstreams:

to this Schedule.

3.3.3 The relationship between the Tasks and Dependencies and the respective
Associated Change Workstreams is set out at Level 2 in the HNG-X Programme

Plan.

3.4 Trigger Events

The Trigger Events for the transition of the HNG-X Services, other than the BCSF
Service, are set out in Schedule B3.1.

3.5 Migration Assumptions

3.5.1. Where any HNG-X Requirement within the Migration and Implementation
Requirements is inconsistent with an assumption which is (a) related to that
HNG-X Requirement and (b) set out in the HNG-X Migration Assumptions, that

Schedule B5 Version 9.0

Page 3 of 34

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

inconsistency shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 of
Schedule B6.1.

3.5.2 In the event that:

(a) the outcome of paragraph 3.5.1 is that an HNG-X Requirement is
modified under the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control
Process to avoid an inconsistency with the HNG-X Migration
Assumptions and there is a consequent amendment needed to (i) any
Tasks or (ii) any Dependencies related to those Tasks; or

(b) there is any inconsistency between the HNG-X Migration Assumptions
and (i) any Tasks or (ii) any Dependencies related to those Tasks, then
to the extent that such inconsistency is identified before completion of
the Task referred to in the HNG-X Programme Plan as 'HNGXL2_0330'
(“High-level Design”),

such matters and any amendment necessary to the HNG-X Programme Plan

shall be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure with the intention that:

(c) such adjustment to the Charges for Project HNG-X as may be
necessary shall not include adjustment to any of the Price Thresholds;
and

(d) neither Party shall be obliged to carry out such Tasks or Dependencies
to the extent of that inconsistency until an appropriate CCN has been
agreed by both Parties.

3.5.3. If the outcome of paragraph 3.5.1 is not that an HNG-X Requirement is
modified, but the Parties agree instead to modify the HNG-X Migration
Assumptions to avoid an inconsistency with that HNG-X Requirement, such
modification and any consequent amendment needed to (i) any Tasks or (ii) any
Dependencies related to those Tasks, shall be dealt with under the Change
Control Procedure with the intention that:

(a) any adjustment to the Charges for Project HNG-X as may be necessary
may include adjustment to the Price Thresholds; and
(b) neither Party shall be obliged to carry out such Tasks or Dependencies
to the extent of that inconsistency until an appropriate CCN has been
agreed by both Parties.

The migration is under the management of Post Office. If there is a
risk that not all AP Clients will be migrated to the EDG by the time
X2 is due to commence, written notice must be given by Post Office
to Fujitsu Services by 1 October 2006 in order to allow an
alternative approach to be developed (notification after this date
risks delay to Project HNG-X). Any changes required will be

development

HNGXL2_0095

Development of the solution to allow a router to be installed in each
Branch to replace the network functionality provided, as at the date
of signature of CCN 1200, by the Branch gateway PCs. These
changes are introduced to improve the Branch network service
(e.g. backup network to almost all Branches) rather than as a cost
reduction. The router replaces the facilities provided by the Branch
Network Resilience Service.

Router rollout dates are as stated in the Programme Plan at
Schedule B6.2 Annex 1. As this change is made to the Horizon
Service Infrastructure it will be handled as a Release for the
Horizon Service Infrastructure.

Also included in this change is migrating, where reasonably
possible, any remaining Branches on ISDN to leased circuits.

The router devices shall be installed by engineers dedicated solely
to the rollout and shall be at no additional cost to Post Office other

ANNEX 2
PART 1
TRANSITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Part 1 of Annex 2 provides an overview of:

21

2.2

1.1.1. the elements of the Horizon Service Infrastructure forming part of the
Infrastructure; and

1.1.2 the related Infrastructure Services that Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post
Office,

during the Roll Out Phase.

The provisions of this Part 1 of Annex 2 shall cease to have effect upon the occurrence
of Trigger Point T6: (Counter Application Rollout Complete).

There are four elements to the Infrastructure applicable to Branches awaiting installation
of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities during the Roll Out Phase:

1.3.1 the Central Infrastructure and Branch Telecom Infrastructure parts of the HNG-X
Service Infrastructure described in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3.2 of Schedule B3.3;

1.3.2 the Branch Infrastructure part of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure described in
paragraph 2 of Schedule B3.4;

1.3.3. Office Platform Service (OPS) (as defined in this Annex); and

1.3.4 Transaction Management Service (TMS) (as defined in this Annex).

OPS shall cease to be applicable in respect of each Branch upon the installation of the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities in respect of that Branch and TMS will
cease to be applicable in respect of any Transactions carried out after such date at each
such Branch.

Unless specified otherwise, all references to Branches and Counter Positions in the
following paragraphs of this Annex shall be construed to mean those Branches and
Counter Positions during the Roll Out Phase where the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities have not been installed and activated.

OFFICE PLATFORM SERVICE

Purpose

This paragraph 2 details the functions and capabilities provided by the OPS. The OPS is
provided using the Equipment installed in Branches described in Schedule B3.4.

Availability

2.2.1 User access to OPS

2.2.2

(a)

(b)

Users may only log-on to the OPS in their Branch in accordance with
their defined role. Any access to data or services outside of that
Branch is controlled exclusively by the relevant counter application.

Access to OPS and services offered via OPS to Users working in the
Branches shall be controlled by a mechanism conforming to the CCD
entitled "Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide" (SD/STD/001),
offering multiple access levels and providing specific identification of
each User. An exception to this is the Mails Application which does not
conform to the “Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide”
(SD/STD/001).

Authentication of all Users logging on to the OPS in the Branch shall be
undertaken by the elements of the Infrastructure on which OPS is
based. Full access control and password management facilities shall
be provided. Users shall only access those Applications for which they
have been given permission by the Branch. Each User shall be
identified by a unique User-id and individual password.

The OPS shall provide facilities to enable the Branch Manager to
establish new Users and set an initial password for all Users in a
Branch. Should a User forget their password the Branch Manager shall
be able to reset the password. The same procedure shall apply at
single Counter Position Branches and multiple Counter Position
Branches.

For situations where the sole User (e.g. Branch Manager in a single
Counter Position Branch) has forgotten their password, the OPS shall
provide the facility to generate a unique key as part of the log on toa
specific username. This shall be phoned to the Help Desk who shall
provide the corresponding key which when input to OPS shall allow
access to the administration facilities. The User shall then be able to
reset their User password.

Concurrency

The solution for OPS is based on a PC infrastructure configured such that
multiple activities within a Branch do not significantly impact on each other. In
particular back office processes (e.g. report production) will be operate on a
logically consistent set of data which will not be affected by any concurrent
counter transactions.

2.3 Security

2.3.1

Security of data and audit trail for OPS

(a)

All data captured at a Branch either as part of a Transaction performed
at a Counter Position or as an administration function shall form part of
a unique Transaction which shall be given a unique reference number
by Riposte and details stored in the message store. The format of this
message store entry shall vary according to the Transaction type but
will typically contain:

(i) Post Office ID;
(ii) Counter Position ID;

(iii) unique Transaction ID;

Schedule B5 Annex 2 part 1 Version 9.0

Page 18 of 34

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

(f)

(iv) date;
(v) time;
(vi) User ID;

(vii) Application; and
(viii) Transaction details.

Each Counter Position PC shall contain a journal and all journal entries
shall be automatically replicated to all other members of the work
group. A work group shall include all the Counter Position PCs in the
Branch and one of the correspondence servers, at which TMS is
provided. This correspondence server forms part of a “cluster” of
correspondence servers of which two are located on one Data Centre
site and the remaining two located on the other Data Centre site. All
Transactions associated with one correspondence server are
automatically replicated to the other site. Within each site all
Transactions are reliably mirrored within a multiple disk array which
has no single point of failure.

Once data are stored in the message store they shall never be altered.
New Transactions shall always be appended to the message store.
Retrieval of data using a particular key field shall retrieve all entries
containing that field.

The security of data held within OPS shall not be compromised by any
incident nor when OPS is re-established following any Incident.

Fujitsu Services shall provide synchronisation facilities which shall
automatically check the status of the journal for a node when it is re-
established following failure. Should the journal be out of step (e.g.
through failure of the Counter Position PC) Fujitsu Services shall
automatically synchronise the journal and any data files to the same
state as all other journals in that work group. Synchronisation may
occur from another Counter Position PC (in a multi-Counter Position
Branch) or from one of the correspondence servers or the second hard
disc referred to in paragraph 4.2.4(b) (in a single Counter Position
Branch).

The operating system supporting the OPS shall provide assurance of
access control and data integrity functions.

2.3.2 OPS Secure Suspension

(a)

(b)

The OPS and the elements of the Infrastructure on which OPS is
provided shall provide secure time-out facilities for each Counter
Position PC.

Fujitsu Services shall provide a User activated suspension which shall
enable the User to either:

(i) clear the screen and leave the Counter Position PC for a short
period. In such circumstances, the User session shall be
reactivated by the User entering their password. Any
applications which were active shall be left active. The display
presented when the suspension facility is activated shall be
different to any normal desktop or application screen; or

2.3.3

(d)

(ii) suspend a customer session and start a second session, and
thereafter swap between the two sessions until one of them has
been completed.

While an individual Transaction is waiting for input from a peripheral, a
pick-list or on-line interaction, or while reports or receipts are printing,
these facilities may be inhibited.

Should the User who initiated the suspension be unable to re-activate
the facility, the following actions may be taken:

(i) after a period of time, during which there is no active session,
the session shall be automatically logged-out. A journal
message will be created indicating this;

(ii) the Branch Manager may assume responsibility for any
uncompleted session, the Stock Unit or share thereof, by
entering his own User name password;

(iii) I once the Counter Position PC has logged-out any authorised
User may then use that Counter Position PC; and

(iv) all the above Events shall be written to the journal.
The facility shall allow the User to resume work with the minimum delay

consistent with achieving security in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

Inactivity Time-out

(a)

(c)

The OPS and the elements of the Infrastructure on which OPS is
provided shall provide secure inactivity time-out facilities if the Counter
Position PC is inactive for a period defined in reference data for each
Counter Position PC.

Should the User be unable to re-activate the facility, the following
actions may be taken:

(i) after a period of time during which there is no active session the
session shall be automatically logged-out. A journal message
shall be created indicating this;

(ii) the Branch Manager may assume responsibility for any
uncompleted session, the Stock Unit or share thereof, by
entering his own User name / password;

(iii) I once the Counter Position PC has logged-out, any authorised
User may then use that Counter Position PC; and

(iv) the above events shall be written to the journal.
The facility shall allow the User to resume work with the minimum delay

consistent with achieving security in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

automatically replicated to all other Counter Position PCs in the Branch
so that the data are securely captured. In addition, Fujitsu Services
shall automatically replicate Transaction details to a remote server at
which TMS is provided.

The OPS Counter Position PCs and TMS servers are known as
"nodes".

All data and message transfers from a single node shall be generated
in a strict numbered sequence with a unique node identification. Any
attempt to introduce a fraudulent message shall be automatically
detected and rejected by OPS.

Data and message transfers shall be resilient to either network or node
failure. When the failure condition is resolved the nodes shall
automatically synchronise and complete any data or message transfers
that are required to ensure these nodes are in a consistent state.

Data Integrity

(a)

(c)

Fujitsu Services shall use techniques to ensure data integrity within the
OPS and as part of data/message transfer between OPS and TMS,
including:

(i) cyclic redundancy checks shall be calculated for all journal
records, including Reference Data; and

(ii) data encryption used selectively on certain data fields.

All messages and data shall have a cyclic redundancy check applied
when they are initially committed to the journal and this shall be
checked every time the message or data is accessed. This shall
protect against accidental corruption and casual tampering. Any failure
of a cyclic redundancy check shall cause the message to be rejected
and retrieved from alternate nodes.

In the event that nodes fail, recovery shall take place through the use of
the following techniques: associating of Post Office and
correspondence server nodes, message numbering, marker (message
high and low water marks) exchange message transfers to equalise
water marks.

Fujitsu Services shall automatically detect any attempt to alter data and
shall log such attempts for subsequent investigation by Fujitsu
Services. Details of all such attempts shall be passed to Post Office.

Recovery

EPoOsS

EPOSS is an electronic point of sale service application which provides the following
functions:

1.1.1 on all Counter Positions in all Branches and Other Authorised Locations:

(a) facilities to Counter Clerks in support of Transactions with Customers;
(b) a “till” function; and
(c) a framework within which other applications can be invoked to support

specialised Transactions within a Customer Session;

1.1.2 to Users within Branches including:

(a) stock balancing;

(b) Branch cash accounting;

(c) production of Client summaries; and
(d) User administration tasks;

1.1.3 transfer of data to Post Office systems and services outside the Horizon Service
Infrastructure using the File Management Support Facility; and

1.1.4 management information reporting using the File Management Support Facility.

EPOSS records Transactions to the Riposte message store. These are replicated by
Riposte to the message stores on file servers at the Data Centres. The TMS Agents
extract and reformat Transaction data and present it for further analysis, summarisation
and forwarding by the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

Cash, cheque and voucher methods of payment are handled by EPOSS. For payment
using a debit card, EPOSS (from the settlement menu) initiates Debit Card to obtain
authorisation of payment.

APS

APS is a generic application that enables Post Office to provide a range of bill payment
and pre-payment services to the customers of many Post Office Clients. APS provides
transaction facilities at the counter, integrated into Customer Sessions using facilities
provided by EPOSS. APS also supports transfer of data to and from Post Office Client
systems and Post Office systems via the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.
APS is available at all Counter Positions in all Branches.

APS supports a range of advanced data capture facilities (the “AP-ADC Facility”) which
are controlled and constrained by Post Office Reference Data. These facilities extend
the capabilities of APS and provide support for:

2.2.1 product selection mechanisms using picklists;
2.2.2 arange of data capture and validation routines;

2.2.3. external applications as the Parties may agree under the Change Control
Procedure; and

2.2.4 the use of print templates in support of customised receipt and slip print layouts.

The production of Reference Data by Post Office to make use of the AP-ADC Facility
shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the CCD entitled “AP-ADC
Reference Manual” (AP/MAN/002) once that CCD has been agreed and introduced in
accordance with the provisions of CCN 1131b. Until that CCD has been agreed and
introduced, the production of Reference Data by Post Office to make use of the AP-ADC
Facility shall be in accordance with the document entitled “AP-ADC Reference Manual”
(AP/MAN/002) version 3.2 (or any subsequent version thereof agreed through the
Change Control Procedure).

APS supports the following range of Tokens conforming to the standards in the relevant
CCDs:

2.3.1 magnetic stripe cards; and
2.3.2 bar coded documents.

APS supports the use of desktop buttons, which may be specified as being equivalent to
a manually entered AP barcode Token.

As referred to in paragraph 2.2.3 of this Annex, APS supports access to DVLA POME
for the purpose of vehicle re-licensing Transactions only. DVLA POME is the Driver
Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Post Office MOT enquiry service which is
based on systems that are external to the Horizon Service Infrastructure. The AP-ADC
Facility will perform online interactions with DVLA POME using the DVLA Licensing
capability of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities during a vehicle re-
licensing Transaction. Such interaction will take place via the DVLA On-line Link.
Information concerning MOT status and vehicle excise duty as well as other supporting
data will be retrieved during the course of such on-line interaction, as specified by Post
Office Reference Data for the purposes of the re-licensing Transaction. The interaction
with DVLA POME may be configured to deal with scenarios where no response is
received from DVLA POME within designated time periods.

APS handles interaction with customer Tokens and records Transactions in the Riposte
message store. It also passes Transaction details to EPOSS for incorporation into a
Customer Session. Transaction data is replicated by Riposte to the message stores on
file servers at the Data Centres. The APS agents extract and reformat transaction data
and present it for further analysis, summarisation and forwarding by the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities.

The clients and tokens supported by APS are referred to in the CCD entitled
“Automated Payments System Client List” (BP/DOC/008). Specific payments and the
APS Transactions which support them conform to the relevant AP Client Specification,
which in turn references the CCD entitled “POCL Automated Payments Generic Rules”
(BP/DOC/014) and appropriate Token Technology Specification(s). Data is transferred
to AP Clients using the File Management Support Facility in accordance with the
appropriate Application Interface Specification. Such transfer will either be direct to the

Post Office will be responsible for:

2.8.1 the design and development of new AP Transactions that use the AP-ADC
Facility;

2.8.2 (save to the extent that Fujitsu Services is required to facilitate testing of Post
Office Reference Data in accordance with the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services /
Post Office Ltd Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change -
Reference Data" (CS/PRD/058)) ensuring that Post Office Reference Data,
intended to introduce those new Transactions, functions correctly within the
Horizon Service Infrastructure (in accordance with any applicable Reference
Data rules) and has the desired business effect; and

2.8.3 defining receipts (for all AP Transactions that use the AP-ADC Facility) that
contain sufficient information to allow manual recovery of a subset of the
transaction data following a system failure, to the extent that such manual data
recovery is required by Post Office.

LFS

The LFS application provides an interface between Branches and the Post Office's
Advanced Distribution System (SAP/ADS) using the File Management Support Facility
and is at all Branches.

LFS includes an LFS Branch application. This is present on all Counter Positions at all
Branches. It provides:

3.2.1. screen dialogues for inputting relevant data which are written to the Riposte
message store;

3.2.2 facilities for scanning bar coded labels to monitor movement of cash and stock
bags and pouches into and out of the Branch. Data captured from these bar
codes are written to the Riposte message store; and

3.2.3 a facility for viewing specialised messages originated by SAP/ADS and
transmitted to the Branch.

LFS includes an interface to SAP/ADS for the exchange of batch data using the File
Management Support Facility and manages the forwarding to, and receipt from,
Branches of that data. Data created in Branches is extracted from the Riposte message
stores by agent applications.

MESSAGE BROADCAST

The Message Broadcast (“MBS”) application provides a mechanism for transmitting
plain text messages to all Branches or to Branches specified in a list.

MBS comprises the MBS Branch application, which provides facilities for managing
messages received, presenting available messages for selection by Users, displaying
messages on the Counter Position screen and printing them to the back-office printer.
This is available at all Counter Positions in all Branches (but messages can only be
received at locations with a data communications link).

MBS utilises the Message Handling Support Facility, which provides facilities for
creating messages by text input (including copying text from other electronic documents

Branches.

NBS

The NBS application supports transaction of banking business in Branches. It is
installed at all Counter Positions in all Branches, but requires an operational data
communications link in order to process Transactions. NBS is invoked from EPOSS
either by:

5.1.1. a card swipe (or input of card details) where EMV functionality is not supported
in respect of that card; or

5.1.2 a Customer inserting his or her card into the chip card reader in a PIN Pad
where such card supports EMV functionality,

while in serve customer mode other than at the settlement menu.
The following Transaction types are supported by the NBS:

5.2.1 cash deposit;

5.2.2 cash withdrawal;

5.2.3 balance enquiry;

5.2.4 withdraw limit;

5.2.5 change of PIN at PIN Pad; and

5.2.6 cheque deposit.

NBS has the following functional components:

5.3.1. NBS manages reading of data from magnetic stripe bank cards and EMV chip
cards, presentation of screen dialogues to the User and User data input, input of
PIN numbers by customers, and printing of receipts. It also integrates the
banking Transactions into an EPOSS Customer Session. NBS writes data to a
message store, including “immediate” messages to initiate message exchange
with the Bank systems, this message exchange being brokered by the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities.

5.3.2 NB Authorisation Agent applications run on servers at the Data Centres. Such
servers harvest relevant “immediate” and standard messages. Messages
between the Counter Position and the Bank systems are brokered by the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities. Standard messages are harvested
by the agents and summarised and forwarded to the Reconciliation Application
within the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities; and

5.3.3 The Reconciliation Application as used by NBS receives data from the NB
Authorisation Agents and from Bank systems and prepares reports reconciling
these data streams and identifying reconciliation exceptions for investigation
and corrective action. These facilities are provided by the Business Capabilities
and Support Facilities.

Capabilities and Support Facilities.
9.3 Debit Card has the following functional components:

9.3.1 Debit Card manages reading of data from magnetic stripe debit cards and EMV
chip cards, presentation of screen dialogues to the User and User data input,
and printing of receipts. It also integrates the DC Transactions into an EPOSS
customer session. Debit Card writes data to the Riposte message store,
including “immediate” message exchange with the Data Centre, and onwards to
the Merchant Acquirer (this message exchange being brokered by the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities); and

9.3.2 The DC Authorisation Agents run on servers at the Data Centres. Such servers
harvest relevant “immediate” and standard messages. Messages between the
Counter Position and the Merchant Acquirer are brokered by the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities. Standard messages are harvested by the
agents and summarised and forwarded to the Reconciliation Application
provided by the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

10. MAILS APPLICATION

10.1 Mails is a postal acceptance application designed to fully automate the service selection
and pricing of mails items transacted at Counter Positions. Mails provides transaction
facilities at each Counter Position, integrated into the Customer Session using facilities
provided by EPOSS. Mails replaces the scales functionality of EPOSS.

10.2 Mails is a standard cashier script application that has been customised for UK use by
the addition / alteration of cashier scripts and the creation of specific Mails Reference
Data. Mails Reference Data is unique to the Mails Application and is supplied by Post
Office Limited. Mails Reference Data contains Client data, typically comprising services,
tariffs, rules and constraints.

10.3 Mails accepts manual input of data (weight, destination, service type) as well as
automatic input from electronic weigh scales and barcode readers.

10.4 Mails is implemented with the following major functional components:

form of HTML pages which can be accessed by the Counter Clerk;

10.5.6 Mails accesses the generic Postcode Address File ("PA File") to verify or
complete a destination address on selected services;

10.5.7 Mails captures track and trace barcode information during a mails acceptance
transaction and passes this information along with associated PA File data to
the EDG for onward transfer to Clients by the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities; and

10.5.8 Mails allows the capture of the track and trace barcode information and
verification of price for pre- franked “bulk mail”. The track and trace and item

ETU APPLICATION

The ETU Application supports the Customer purchase or refund of mobile phone related
credits and associated content products (e.g. ring tones). It is installed at all Counter
Positions in all Branches, but requires an operational data communications link in order
to process Transactions. ETU credit products (known as Topup products or PIN
products) are invoked by swiping a card (or input of card details). ETU content products
(known as PIN/e-voucher products) are invoked by selecting an ETU desktop button.
The following Transaction Types are supported:

12.1.1 the purchase of a card based Topup product;

12.1.2 the purchase of card based PIN product;

12.1.3 the purchase of a PIN/e-voucher product;

The ETU Application manages reading of data from magnetic stripe cards, the selection
of ETU products from menus, the presentation of screen dialogues to the User and User
data input, and the printing of receipts. It also integrates the ETU Transactions into an
EPOSS Customer Session. ETU writes data to the Riposte message store, including
*immediate” messages to initiate message exchange with the e-pay authorisation
system, provided by Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

BUREAU APPLICATION

The Bureau Application provides the ability to trade foreign currencies and traveller's
cheques at Counter Positions. The service provided in a particular Branch can range
from none to full bureau de change facilities, depending on the Bureau Type defined in
Reference Data for the Branch in question.

The Bureau Application has the ability to receive Spot Rates Files and Margins Files
from the Post Office using the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities, and to use
the data in these files to control the rates at which currencies and travellers’ cheques
are traded.

The Bureau Application extends EPOSS counter functionality to support, depending on
Bureau Type, for:

13.3.1 buying currency and travellers’ cheques;
13.3.2 selling currency and travellers’ cheques;

13.3.3 remitting currency and travellers’ cheques for sale (but not travellers’ cheques

SCHEDULE B6.1

HNG-X BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

1. INTRODUCTION

11 This Schedule B6.1 sets out the HNG-X Requirements (or processes to be followed to
create HNG-X Requirements) for the HNG-X System, the solution to which will be
developed and documented in accordance with Schedule B6.2.

1.2 This Schedule B6.1 also envisages that the Parties may introduce changes to the live
Horizon system and that such changes may or may not impact on the Requirements
Definition Process.

2. THE THREE BASELINES

21 There are three baselines relevant to the definition of HNG-X Requirements and their
realisation in the development of the HNG-X System:

2.1.1 the “Applicable Horizon Baseline”: the baseline that consists of the Horizon
Applications and the Horizon Service Infrastructure up to and including Release
$92 together with those changes delivered (or to be delivered) after Release
$92 which have been agreed in accordance with the Change Control Procedure
and which are, as at the date of signature of CCN1200, listed in Annex 13 to this
Schedule (as that baseline may be amended in accordance with the provisions
of this Schedule);

2.1.2 the "Requirements Baseline”: the baseline described more fully in paragraph 4
that represents Post Office's requirements for the HNG-X System as set out in
this Schedule and agreed in accordance with the Requirements Definition
Process (as that baseline may be amended or re-issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule); and

2.1.3 the “Solution Baseline": the baseline that consists of the HNG-X System as at
the HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date (as that HNG-X System may be modified to
rectify any HNG-X Acceptance Incidents).

2.2 For the purpose of the Parties resolving any dispute concerning the Applicable Horizon
Baseline or any part of the Applicable Horizon Baseline (including, without limitation, a
dispute as to the Existing Functionality), the Parties shall refer to the Horizon system
that is in live operation as at the date of the dispute in question and shall (a) exclude the
effects of changes that have only been applied as described in paragraph 3.1 of this
Schedule, and (b) include the effect of changes described in paragraph 3.2 of this
Schedule to the extent they have not been implemented.

3. THE APPLICABLE HORIZON BASELINE
3.41 Changes to the live Horizon system that are requested after the date of signature of

CCN1200 and that introduce changes or functions that are not intended to be replicated
in, or to have any effect upon, the HNG-X System, will be dealt with in accordance with

Schedule B6.1 Version 9.0
Page 2of 39
CONFIDENTIAL

3.2

41

the Change Control Procedure or through Work Orders but shall be ignored in
determining the Applicable Horizon Baseline.

Changes to the live Horizon system that are requested after the date of signature of
CCN1200 and that are intended to introduce changes or functions that will be replicated
in, or otherwise affect, the HNG-X System, will be dealt with in accordance with the
Change Control Procedure or through Work Orders. The Change Control Procedure or
the Work Ordering Procedure (as the case may be) will be used to assess the effect of
the changes or new functions on the live Horizon system and (so far as possible at the
time of agreeing the change) on the Requirements Baseline and the changes and new
functions will be taken into account in determining the Applicable Horizon Baseline (and
will be recorded by the Parties in a control log initially formed from the information in
Annex 13 to this Schedule).

THE REQUIREMENTS BASELINE
Requirements Areas

4.1.1. The Requirements Baseline will be composed of HNG-X Requirements covering
each of the following:

(a) the Functional Requirements;

(b) "System Capacity and Performance Requirements’ which, as at the
date of signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 3 to this
Schedule;

(c) ‘User Interface Requirements’ as described in paragraph 4.3;

(d) ‘Training Requirements' which, as at the date of signature of CCN1200,

are referred to in Annex 4 to this Schedule;

(e) ‘Operational and Support Service Requirements’ which, as at the date
of signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 5 to this Schedule;

(f) ‘Migration and Implementation Requirements’ which, as at the date of
signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 6 to this Schedule;

(g) ‘Design and Architecture Requirements’ which, as at the date of
signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 7 to this Schedule;

(h) ‘Security Requirements' which, as at the date of signature of CCN1200,
are referred to in Annex 8 to this Schedule;

(i) ‘Development Requirements’ which, as at the date of signature of
CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 9 to this Schedule; and

(j) ‘Testing Requirements' which, as at the date of signature of CCN1200,
are referred to in Annex 10 to this Schedule.

CONFIDENTIAL

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including this Schedule),
where any HNG-X Requirement set out or referred to in Annexes 3 to 10 of this
Schedule is inconsistent with an HNG-X Assumption which is (a) related to that
HNG-X Requirement and (b) set out or referred to in the same Annex or in
Annex 12, the HNG-X Assumption shall prevail only to the extent of that
inconsistency such that the HNG-X Requirement shall be modified so as to
avoid that inconsistency (such modification to be dealt with under the HNG-X
Programme Requirements Change Control Process).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including this Schedule),
where the application of the Requirements Definition Process or the application
of the Business Equivalence Principles would produce an HNG-X Requirement
that is inconsistent with the HNG-X Assumption set out in Annex 12, the HNG-X
Assumption shall prevail only to the extent of that inconsistency such that the
HNG-X Requirement shall be modified so as to avoid that inconsistency (such
modification to be dealt with under the HNG-X Programme Requirements
Change Control Process).

HNG-X Requirements will be maintained in the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue
and issued formally to Fujitsu Services at agreed points throughout Project
HNG-X, including at the date of signature of CCN1200, at the end of the
Requirements Stage, and at the end of either or both of HNG-X Requirements
Assurance and HNG-X Solution Assurance (if these result in amendments to the
HNG-X Requirements).

42 Functional Requirements

4.21

4.2.2

The Functional Requirements will be generated by following the Functional
Requirements Definition Process. When generating the Functional
Requirements in accordance with the Functional Requirements Definition
Process, the Parties shall at all times observe and apply the following principles
("Business Equivalence Principles"):

(a) other than the Agreed Changes and the Allowed Changes, the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities will provide such
functionality as results from applying the guidelines in Annex 1 to the
Existing Functionality; and

(b) for the avoidance of doubt, other than the Agreed Changes and the
Allowed Changes, the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities will
not be required to provide any functionality that does not result from
applying the guidelines in Annex 1 to the Existing Functionality.

Agreed Changes

(a) The Agreed Changes are agreed as exclusions from, additions to, and
changes in the Existing Functionality that are to be applied in
generating the Functional Requirements in accordance with the
Functional Requirements Definition Process. Agreed Changes are
exceptions to the Business Equivalence Principles and cannot

4.2.3

(c)

themselves be changed by the application of the Business Equivalence
Principles.

Any specific functional characteristics of Existing Functionality that
have been changed as a direct consequence of applying an Agreed
Change are no longer subject to the Business Equivalence Principles.

The effect that an Agreed Change has on the Existing Functionality
shall be limited to the direct consequence of applying that Agreed
Change to the relevant aspect or aspects of the Existing Functionality.

One of the Agreed Changes is the introduction of Postal Services. The
Parties will develop HNG-X Requirements for Postal Services in
accordance with the Postal Services Definition Process.

Allowed Changes

The "Allowed Changes" are changes to aspects of Existing Functionality in
respect of which the following conditions are fulfilled:

(a)

(c)

(e)

either:

(i) the aspect of the Existing Functionality is now assessed by Post
Office as creating operational or procedural problems or
inefficiencies within a Branch; or

(ii) the aspect of the Existing Functionality was previously agreed to
be implemented within certain limitations or constraints and
these limitations or constraints are not present in, or relevant to,
the Solution Architecture or other solution artefact; and

the effect of applying the requested change is assessed by Fujitsu
Services, acting reasonably and in good faith, as having an acceptable
cost / risk / resources impact on Project HNG-X; and

the effect of any such change is to make the manner in which Users
utilise an element of Existing Functionality more efficient without
introducing any completely new functionality into the Existing
Functionality; and

the required change is notified in writing by Post Office to Fujitsu
Services before the end of the Requirements Stage or as part of HNG-
X Requirements Assurance; and

the change has not already been assessed as being an Agreed
Change.

An Allowed Change shall be dealt with in accordance with the HNG-X
Programme Requirements Change Control Process.

43 Requirements of the HNG-X User Interface

4.3.1

4.3.2

4.3.3

4.3.4

The HNG-X Requirements that the HNG-X User Interface shall support are:
(a) the Functional Requirements; and
(b) the non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X User Interface.

The functionality required to be supported by the HNG-X User Interface will be
derived from the Functional Requirements generated through the Requirements
Definition Process. This derived functionality will be an input to the process set
out in the CCD entitled "Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface"
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X User Interface will be
provided by Post Office after the date of signature of CCN1200 in accordance
with the CCD entitled “Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface”
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

The HNG-X User Interface design will draw on best practice design from the
retail and banking industries as well as industry standards in graphical user
interface design. The Parties intend that any similarities between the style and
graphical realisation of the HNG-X User Interface and the user interface(s) of
the comparable Horizon Applications as may arise shall only arise as a matter of
coincidence through the proper operation of the Clean Room Rules.

5. REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS

The Parties will follow the Requirements Definition Process.

6. DEALING WITH CHANGE

6.1 Changes to the Applicable Horizon Baseline

Changes to the Applicable Horizon Baseline will be dealt with as set out in paragraphs
3.1 and 3.2.

Subject to paragraph 6.2.2, if a change to an HNG-X Requirement is notified in
writing to Fujitsu Services after the end of the Requirements Stage then, if that
change is:

(a) not the result of the User Interface Definition Process nor the Postal
Services Definition Process, and required in order to correct a
deviation of that HNG-X Requirement from the Business Equivalence
Principles; or

(b) the result of the Postal Services Definition Process and required in
order to correct a deviation of that HNG-X Requirement from the Postal
Services Assessment Guidelines,

it will be dealt with in accordance with the HNG-X Programme Requirements
Change Control Process. Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to withhold its
consent to the changes to the extent that they are required in order to correct
the deviation from the Business Equivalence Principles or the Postal Services
Assessment Guidelines (as the case may be).

All other changes or additions to HNG-X Requirements proposed after the final
version of the Requirements Baseline has been issued will be dealt with in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

As part of any changes to the Requirements Baseline, the Parties shall agree
any necessary changes to the HNG-X Acceptance Method(s) and HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria applicable to the relevant HNG-X Requirement.

6.3 Changes to the Solution Baseline

6.3.1

If a change to the Solution Baseline is notified in writing to Fujitsu Services
within the period of three months after the start of HNG-X Project Workstream
X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout) then, if that change is:

(a) not the result of the User Interface Definition Process nor the Postal
Services Definition Process, and required in order to correct a
deviation of the Solution Baseline from the Business Equivalence
Principles; or

(b) the result of the Postal Services Definition Process and required in
order to correct a deviation of the Solution Baseline from the Postal
Services Assessment Guidelines,

the Parties will meet to agree whether the conditions in paragraph 6.3.1(a) or (b)
have been fulfilled, and if such conditions have been fulfilled:

(c) discuss and agree in good faith the steps required to correct a
deviation of the Solution Baseline from the Business Equivalence
Principles or the Postal Services Assessment Guidelines (as the case

the financial outcome resulting from the operation of a specific Transaction for
the Customer, Post Office, any affected Client(s), and any Other IT Supplier(s)
is identical to the equivalent Transaction carried out using the Existing
Functionality;

the Post Office products that can be traded within a Branch are the same as
those defined in Post Office Reference Data (whether enabled or not) using the
Existing Functionality;

the Business Rules associated with any Business Capability are applied in the
same manner as those used with the equivalent Transaction carried out using
the Existing Functionality;

the Customer and Counter Clerk interactions that relate to the workflow
associated with a particular Use Case and delivered via the HNG-X User
Interface enable:

2.4.1 the same data to be captured using the same format and validation
criteria;

2.4.2 the same initiating Tokens and/or equivalent initiating events to be
used;

2.4.3 equivalent information displays and capture methods via the counter
terminal; and

2.4.4 the same set of user tasks to be performed following an equivalent
logical workflow and enabling the same or, where agreed, alternative
equivalent operational procedures to be carried out,

in each case as compared with the Existing Functionality;

the outputs resulting from the completion of a Transaction are the same or
equivalent and have the same operational effect (in terms of form and
occurrence) as those resulting from the associated Transaction conducted using
the Existing Functionality. The types of outputs shall include:

any printed item (e.g. Report, Branch receipt, other forms of Branch
produced collateral), which shall be equivalent to the Existing
Functionality; and

any data, produced or captured, that can be accessed, retrieved by, or
provided to, the Post Office, which shall be the same as that from the
Existing Functionality, provided that the meaning of the data and/or
associated Post Office processes has not changed as a result of the
introduction of the HNG-X System. This will be bounded by the scope
of any specific limitations agreed as part of the HNG-X Services;

the outcome of any aspect of Branch trading or operation results in the same
state of financial integrity and ability to audit as exists using the Existing
Functionality;

the use and interpretation of Post Office Reference Data (in terms of its data
definitions and its use to invoke functionality) will remain the same. Any data
items or Reference Data capabilities currently unused within the Existing
Functionality will remain unused or suppressed as part of the HNG-X System
subject to agreement of Post Office; and

Users must be able to perceive and perform the functions provided via the
changed User Interface such that they can perform the same user tasks,
performing equivalent human and computer interactions.

1 Session Transfer

A facility that enables a Branch User to log-on at another
counter without having to log-off at their previous counter. This
facility will automatically log-out the Branch User at their
previous counter and move any current activity onto their new
counter. This facility is also known as “Session Mobility” or
“Session Migration”. This facility is not available during certain
operations.

2 Session Suspend

A facility that enables a Branch User to ‘Suspend’ and
subsequently ‘Resume’ a desktop session. Only one session
can be suspended in this way. During the suspension the
Branch User is presented with a new main desktop menu and
may carry out any of the system functions (including serving
another customer) while the original session is suspended.
Each of the two sessions (the suspended and the current) can
be ‘toggled’ by selection of the ‘suspend/swap’ button. The
two sessions will remain in existence until the user returns one
of the sessions to the ‘Desk Top’ and then swaps to the other
session. This facility is not available during certain operations.

Postal Services

As described in the CCD entitled “Postal
Services Business and Operational Context”
(REQ/CUS/BRS/0001).

Context Sensitive Help.

A context sensitive help mechanism (to
replace the current ‘Bubble Help’) will be
implemented which will be consistent with the
CCD entitled “HNG-X Style Guide”
(DES/APP/STD/0001).

This will utilise agreed POL or FS reference
data to determine the access points from
which the Branch User may invoke relevant
help text. This help mechanism will support
the structuring of and access to different
levels of help text where more detailed help
text is specified.

The exact approach for the context sensitive
help mechanism, including appropriate
interface definitions to allow Post Office to
specify the help text and structure, will be
agreed as part of the detailed design work.
Note that it may be necessary for Post Office
to provide help text for the HNG-X System
separately to help text for Horizon during the
rollout of the HNG-X System (dual entry). This
will be dependent on the interface definition
agreed with Post Office.

Help Desk Calls

The ability to log help desk calls via the

Report simplifications

Report consolidation for the HNG-X System
will be achieved through decoupling the call
for data about reports from the central
database, from the user production and
analysis of reports. Reports will be grouped
into a small number of categories, such as
“Counter Daily Report” and “Counter Weekly
Report”. A revised counter sequence will be
design to enable the user to work through the
report set, printing and cutting off as
appropriate.

Post Office confirms that this does not have
an adverse impact on branches as the
process is similar to present and it also
provides a way for single counter position
branches to be able to exit to continue
customer service if required.

Any consolidation and/or rationalisation of
reports on top of this solution would not
necessarily impact the load on the database
from report production as those reports will be
contained within the bundles of data called in
the one data call. However, it is recognised
that it would be good practice for Post Office
to consolidate and rationalise reports anyway
as a house-keeping exercise to improve
efficiency at the counter and reduce
consumables. This exercise will be carried
out in conjunction with the analysis of the
functional requirements. The Fujitsu Services
baseline assumption for contract is that the
following reports will be removed:

e Counter Daily
o APS Transaction Listing
o O/L Balance Enquiries
o O/L Cash Deposits
o O/L Cheque Deposits

o O/L Cash Withdrawals

2 Changes to the session settlement The HNG-X session settlement model will
model

change from Horizon as a consequence of
the on-line architecture, the classification of
transactions as either 'Recoverable’ or
‘Cancellable', and changes to the production
of some receipt printing.

The primary areas of difference are: -

* Transactions will be classed as either
‘Recoverable' or 'Cancellable’;

«the settlement process is now an on-
line dialogue supported by some new
Counter Clerk dialogues;

e certain receipts will now be printed
during the settlement process,
completing after session data is
secured at the Data Centre;

* a new settlement — transaction
sequence will handle transient time-
outs to the Data Centre. This will
comprise automatic retries and then
Counter Clerk managed dialogues
supporting ‘Retry’ and ‘Cancel’
options;

«certain failure conditions will result in
the settlement process having to be
cancelled. New Counter Clerk
dialogues will manage this exception
process with respect to the settlement
of the 'Recoverable’ transactions and
the cancellation of the 'Cancellable'
transactions. A variant of the
Customer Session receipt for session
recovery will be produced. Following
the printing of the revised session
receipts, the Counter Clerk will be
logged off; and

e a new recovery process will be
initiated on subsequent log-on to the
original terminal. New Counter Clerk
dialogues will manage this recovery
process with respect to the final
outcome of the failed session.

Further details will be contained in the
Working Document ‘HNG-X Session
Settlement Process'.

6 Changes to Confirmation processing
model

Confirmation messages for online
transactions will only be harvested in batch
mode at end of day. This means that the
Transaction Enquiry Service will not receive
C2 messages in near real time, and
Streamline payment file(s) will only be
produced overnight.

7 PIN Pad required for Banking Deposits

To protect against replay attacks, banking
deposit transactions will use a MAC
generated by the PIN Pad. This will require
the presence of a PIN Pad (a change from
Horizon). For the avoidance of doubt, this will
not require a PIN to be entered by the
customer.

8 Change to End of Day

Branch end of day will be declared for all
branches at 19:00 each day. This will be the
same time for all Branches (i.e. there will be
no ability to have different Branches with
different end of day times). End of day will be
declared whether or not those Branches are
operating or connected to the Data Centre.

9 Ad-hoc transaction report for AP PANs

The HNG-X System shall allow the production
of an ad-hoc transaction report containing the
PAN reference number from the AP token
and the AP sequence number, where they are
agreed to be part of the transaction and not
restricted for security reasons. Fujitsu
Services and Post Office will agree the exact
structure of this report during the design
stage.

4. The Business Equivalence Principles do not apply to the System Capacity and
Performance Requirements or associated Service Levels, but it is accepted that the
performance characteristics of the HNG-X System counter applications and associated
infrastructure must be acceptable to the Post Office. This specific aspect of the Solution
Baseline will be assessed to determine that the HNG-X System counter performance
delivers equivalent or better performance characteristics to the Applicable Horizon
Baseline, based on the following principles:

41 Post Office and Fujitsu Services will jointly agree an assessment process that

will:

(a) define and agree sets of representative Transaction types and a
measurement period;

(b) establish system component benchmark measurements for these
Transaction types on the Horizon system and on the HNG-X System
(taking account of any changed processes or UI characteristics that
may be present in the HNG-X Transaction); and

(ce) allow Post Office to request that the set of Transaction types is

augmented (agreement to such requests not to be unreasonably
withheld by Fujitsu Services) if anomalous HNG-X Transaction
performance characteristics are identified prior to the commencement
of the HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout).

4.2 Acceptance by Post Office of the HNG-X System counter performance will be
based on the average system component benchmark measurements for each of
the agreed sets of representative Transaction types for the HNG-X System

ANNEX 11
REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS
PART 1 —- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

Project HNG-X will commence with the Requirements Stage, which includes
specification and assurance activities, and which will be directed by the Requirements
Definition Process.

Part 1 of this Annex 11 is concerned with the definition and assurance processes to
establish a baseline of Functional Requirements.

This process will focus on the specification of the business process and data
requirements of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities. Any of the existing
non-functional HNG-X Requirements that relate to specific requirements, artefacts or
capabilities will also be applied at this stage.

HNG-X Requirements Assurance will be conducted as a joint activity comprising both
business content assurance and the inclusion of any agreed optimisation or
improvement opportunities that would facilitate solution design. Both these aspects of
HNG-X Requirements Assurance will involve Fujitsu Services and will occur
progressively and prior to the final issuing to Fujitsu Services of the Functional
Requirements.

PRINCIPLES

The principles that will apply during the definition and assurance process, in particular
concerning the interchange of HNG-X Requirements artefacts between Post Office and
Fujitsu Services are as follows:

21 DOORS (as configured within Post Office for Project HNG-X) is the master
repository of all HNG-X Requirements;

22: the intention is to be able to compartmentalise the HNG-X Requirements so that
each group of HNG-X Requirements has its own life and own versioning;

2.3 functional Use Cases will be grouped into convenient business areas which will
be made available to Fujitsu Services at relevant points to enable early visibility
and a more interactive approach to solution design; and

24 to ensure integrity of the HNG-X Requirements as a whole set there will be a
number of assurance steps which begin at the start of a piece of work in each
business area and complete with the handover of a completed HNG-X
Requirements set. Fujitsu Services are fully involved in this approach from the
beginning of the process through to final baselining of the HNG-X Requirements
set, and will assist in optimising the overall Use Case model so that constraints
applicable to the existing Horizon architecture are not unnecessarily carried
forward into the HNG-X System.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS METHOD

Analyst teams from both Parties will progressively develop the Use Case specifications
required for each business area, initially assessing the proposed Use Case goals and
descriptions and the various source materials to determine their status and relevance.
The required business processes and logical operations will be described as Use
Cases, with each being developed through normal flow and then variant and exception
paths with interaction at key stages with the HNG-X Requirements Assurance process.

Certain Use Cases relate to functionality that Fujitsu Services has proposed will be
delivered by solution components that are retained from Horizon. These are classified
as “Retained Functionality” Use Cases and it has been agreed that these Use Cases
will only require a minimum level of functional specification.

HNG-X REQUIREMENTS ASSURANCE
Introduction

HNG-X Requirements Assurance represents a significant and necessary stage in the
HNG-X solution lifecycle, providing the means by which Post Office and Fujitsu Services
can progressively gain confidence in the scope, capabilities and impact of the emerging
HNG-X Requirements and solution artefacts. The assurance role will involve both
business and functional content assurance and ‘solution design’ assurance. Fujitsu
Services will support Post Office in both of these activities — initially through the
provision of knowledgeable personnel to assist in minimising the risk of functional
omission and subsequently to work with Post Office to verify and improve various
aspects of the emergent solution, both in terms of solution optimisation and economic
rationalisation of HNG-X Requirements.

Assurance Steps
The approach is underpinned by a series of assurance steps which cover:

4.2.1. content assurance: gradually moving towards a series of fully dressed Use
Cases through a series of assurance stages which verify them on an
incremental basis;

4.2.2 optimisation and completion:

(a) ensuring all Use Cases are up to date with all relevant Horizon or
HNG-X changes and are collectively consistent; and

(b) giving visibility of the HNG-X Requirements to Fujitsu Services in order
to obtain feedback from a solution perspective on any optimisation or
improvement opportunities. It is recognised that these HNG-X
Requirements are still subject to change and that any solution activities
based on this material may be impacted once the final Requirements
Baseline has been issued.

4.3

4.2.3 further Requirements Baseline: if the above process results in amendments to
the HNG-X Requirements, the Requirements Baseline will either be revised or
re-issued.

Roles
The assurance role will encompass the need to:

4.3.1 ensure compliance — by supporting the business analyst teams of both Parties
in following the Requirements Definition Process and their use of the underlying
tools and standards, and in producing deliverables that meet the defined quality
standards;

4.3.2 achieve assurance — by reviewing the business content of the HNG-X
Requirements artefacts for accuracy and completeness, and by enabling
effective dialogue, optimisation and handover activities with the Fujitsu Services
Design Authority;

4.3.3 ensure integrity and consistency — by applying ‘whole service’ and ‘cross
service’ assessments of HNG-X Requirement definitions, shared or common
specifications, and the relationship between newly specified and retained
functionality; and

4.3.4 maintain the Requirements Baseline — by establishing processes for identifying
the various sources of change that will occur throughout Project HNG-X and
managing their application to the Requirements Baseline.

This participative approach will however recognise the overriding roles and
responsibilities of Post Office (in terms of HNG-X Requirements Assurance) and Fujitsu
Services (in terms of solution definition, build and implementation) in this process.

PART 2 - HNG-X REQUIREMENTS BASELINING PROCESS

An initial version of the full set of Functional Requirements will be provided to Fujitsu
Services as part of Post Office issuing an initial Requirements Baseline at the end of the
Requirements Stage. As HNG-X Requirements Assurance may not have been
completed at this point, further amendments to the initial Requirements Baseline may be
required in order to take account of amendments, additions or deletions to HNG-X
Requirements as a result of HNG-X Requirements Assurance. Where the overall impact
of such changes is significant, the Requirements Baseline shall be re-issued by Post
Office. Where the impact is minimal, there would be no need to re-issue the
Requirements Baseline and any amendments shall be dealt with in accordance with
paragraph 6.2 of this Schedule B6.1.

Individual HNG-X Requirements that are not produced as part of the Functional
Requirements Definition Process described in Annex 11 Part 1 may be baselined prior
to establishing the final Requirements Baseline. This approach will enable Fujitsu
Services to make design or solution decisions with more certainty where necessary. At
the date of signature of CCN1200, the HNG-X Requirements are as described in
Annexes 3 to 10 to this Schedule B6.1 and will be marked as baselined at version 0.2.

Schedule B6.1 Annex 11 Version 9.0
Page 31of 39

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

HNG-X Requirements which become individually baselined after this date will be
marked as such in DOORS and formally handed over to Fujitsu Services ahead of the
full HNG-X Requirements set.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to reject or refuse an
HNG-X Requirement that complies with the provisions of this Schedule B6.1 other than
in accordance with Clause 34.5.

PART 3 — NON-FUNCTIONAL HNG-X REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE USER
INTERFACE DEFINITION PROCESS

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the HNG-X User Interface will be
established and assured in accordance with the CCD entitled “Establishing and
Assuring the HNG-X User Interface” (REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

For the purposes of the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control Process,
these HNG-X Requirements are categorised as "Type B".

PART 4 —- HNG-X REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE POSTAL SERVICES DEFINITION

PROCESS

The Functional Requirements relating to the Postal Services will be generated by
following the Functional Requirements Definition Process set out in Part 1 of this Annex
but will be established and assured as defined in the CCD entitled “Postal Services
Business and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001) by following the Postal
Services Assessment Guidelines in place of the guidelines in Annex 1

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the Postal Services will be
established and assured in accordance with the CCD entitled “Postal Services Business
and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001).

PART 5 —- HNG-X PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS CHANGE CONTROL PROCESS:
INTRODUCTION

The HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control Process is owned by the Post
Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme
Manager, and is intended as a mechanism which applies a discretionary level of control
to the scope of the HNG-X Requirements without invoking the Change Control
Procedure.

An HNG-X Programme Change Authority will be established with representation from
the Fujitsu Services' Design Authority and the Post Office Design Authority who will be
responsible for the initial impact assessment of proposed changes and for
recommending to the Post Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services'
HNG-X Programme Manager whether a change can be dealt with within their level of
authority. Final responsibility for this decision remains with the Post Office HNG-X
Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme Manager.

241

The treatment of a proposed change will differ depending on whether the HNG-X
Requirement to which the change is proposed has been baselined, has been baselined
at high level, or is still under development. These are categorised respectively as “Type
A’, “Type B” and “Type C” HNG-X Requirements, with their treatment described in
paragraph 2 of this Part 5 of this Annex. New HNG-X Requirements are categorised as
“Type D”.

Subject to paragraph 1.5, the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control
Process will cease to operate after the end of the Requirements Stage, after which
changes to HNG-X Requirements will be dealt with through the Change Control
Procedure.

After the end of the Requirements Stage, the HNG-X Programme Requirements
Change Control Process shall continue to apply to:

1.5.1. the management of changes or additions to the HNG-X Requirements as a
result of HNG-X Requirements Assurance or HNG-X Solution Assurance in
accordance with paragraph 6.2.2 of this Schedule;

1.5.2 the management of a deviation of a Postal Services Requirement from the
Postal Services Assessment Guidelines in accordance with paragraph 6.2.3(b)
of this Schedule;

1.5.3 for any HNG-X Requirement other than a Postal Services Requirement, the
management of a deviation from the Business Equivalence Principles in
accordance with paragraph 6.2.3(a) of this Schedule; and

1.5.4 for any HNG-X Requirement, the management of an inconsistency between that
HNG-X Requirement and (a) an HNG-X Assumption related to that HNG-X
Requirement (and set out or referred to in the same Annex to this Schedule as
that HNG-X Requirement) or (b) the HNG-X Assumption set out in Annex 12, in
accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 or 4.1.3 of this Schedule (as the case may be).

TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HNG-X REQUIREMENTS
Non Baselined Functional Requirements (Requirement Type C)

2.1.1 Any Functional Requirement which has not been individually baselined and
which does not depart from the Business Equivalence Principles is regarded as
under development and is not subject to the Change Control Procedure or
HNG-X Programme Change Assessment.

2.1.2 Where the generation of a Functional Requirement deviates from the Business
Equivalence Principles (as recognised by the author of the HNG-X Requirement
or as identified during HNG-X Requirements Assurance) and is not the result of
an Agreed Change, an assessment will be made by the HNG-X Programme
Change Authority against the conditions for an Allowed Change as set out in
paragraph 4.2.3 of this Schedule B6.1 as follows:

Schedule B6.1 Annex 11 Version 9.0
Page 33of 39

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

(a) where the HNG-X Requirement is agreed as fulfilling the conditions of
an Allowed Change, the agreement will be logged by the HNG-X
Programme Change Authority as an Allowed Change and the HNG-X
Requirement may continue to be developed without recourse to the
Change Control Procedure or HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment; and

(b) where the HNG-X Requirement does not fulfil the conditions of an
Allowed Change, the HNG-X Requirement must be passed for HNG-X
Programme Change Assessment or reverted to a definition which
accords with the Business Equivalence Principles.

2.2 Requirements Baselined at High Level including Agreed Changes (Requirement
Type B)

2.2.1

HNG-X Requirements, including Agreed Changes, which are baselined at high
level may be described or elaborated in more detail within the scope of the high
level HNG-X Requirement without recourse to the Change Control Procedure or
HNG-X Programme Change Assessment. However, where the elaboration of
the HNG-X Requirement extends the scope (as recognised by the author of the
HNG-X Requirement or as identified during HNG-X Requirements Assurance or
HNG-X Solution Assurance, and which for Postal Services Requirements shall
be assessed against the scope defined in section 4 of the CCD entitled “Postal
Services Business and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001) using the
Postal Services Assessment Guidelines), an assessment will be made by the
HNG-X Programme Change Authority as to whether the extension of scope
fulfils the conditions that it must have an acceptable cost, time, risk and
resourcing impact on Project HNG-X and appropriate actions will be taken as
follows:

(a) where the extension of scope is agreed as fulfilling the above
conditions, the extension of scope will be adopted under the
governance of the HNG-X Programme Change Authority and the HNG-
X Requirement or Agreed Change may continue to be developed
without recourse to the Change Control Procedure or HNG-X
Programme Change Assessment; and

(b) where the extension to scope does not fulfil the above conditions, the
extension to scope must be passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment or reverted to a definition within the scope of the higher
level HNG-X Requirement.

2.3 Baselined Requirements (Requirement Type A)

Once an HNG-X Requirement has been agreed and individually baselined, any
proposed change to that HNG-X Requirement will be passed for HNG-X Programme
Change Assessment. Following the formal handover of the final Requirements Baseline
any HNG-X Requirements which have been assessed as deviating from the Business
Equivalence Principles (in the case of all HNG-X Requirements other than Postal
Services Requirements) or the Postal Services Assessment Guidelines (in the case of

Postal Services Requirements) shall also be passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment.

New Requirements (Requirement Type D)

New HNG-X Requirements will be initially assessed by the HNG-X Programme Change
Authority to determine whether they fall within the definition of an Allowed Change.
When the HNG-X Requirement is not assessed as an Allowed Change it will be passed
for HNG-X Programme Change Assessment. When the HNG-X Requirement is
assessed as an Allowed Change it will be processed as an HNG-X Requirement Type C
in accordance with paragraph 2.1 of Part 5 of this Annex.

Fujitsu Services may propose that any additional or new HNG-X Requirement be
subject to a caveat detailing any exceptions to full compliance in respect of that
particular HNG-X Requirement only (and not in respect of any HNG-X Requirement
already forming part of the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue) and the Parties shall,
acting reasonably and in good faith, agree whether to adopt that caveat in respect of
that particular HNG-X Requirement.

HNG-X PROGRAMME CHANGE ASSESSMENT

Proposed changes to HNG-X Requirements, new HNG-X Requirements and any
changes or additions to the non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the HNG-X
User Interface or Postal Services which are passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment will be initially assessed by the HNG-X Programme Change Authority to
determine whether the change is likely to impact time or cost beyond the level of
authority of the Post Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-
X Programme Manager, or whether there is likely to be any impact outside of Project
HNG-X.

Where the change will clearly exceed this authority or will clearly have an impact outside
the Project HNG-X, the change will be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure
(or agreed with the author to be rejected).

Where the change appears likely to have minimal impact such that, considered with
other proposed changes, it can be managed within the level of authority of the Post
Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme
Manager and has no impact external to the Project HNG-X, the change will be passed
to the appropriate team within Fujitsu Services or Post Office to undertake further
impact assessment (under the control of the HNG-X Programme Change Authority).

If the further impact assessment referred to in paragraph 3.3 of this Part 5 confirms the
initial assessment, the change will be approved and the HNG-X Requirement can be
updated accordingly, subject to the final approval of the Post Office HNG-X Programme
Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X Programme Manager. Once approved, if the
change relates to a Functional Requirement, the change shall be deemed to be an
Agreed Change. The baselined status (as indicated by the Requirement Type A, B C or
D) of the HNG-X Requirement will not be changed by this process, but the version
number of the HNG-X Requirement will be updated accordingly.

3.5 If the further impact assessment referred to in paragraph 3.3 of this Part 5 rejects the
initial assessment, the change will be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure
(or agreed with the author to be rejected).

4. RECORDING OF CHANGES

All changes which are agreed as “Allowed Changes” or “Agreed Changes” shall be logged as
such by the HNG-X Programme Change Authority. This log shall initially be formed from the
information in Annex 2 to this Schedule as at the date of signature of CCN1200 and
subsequently maintained by the HNG-X Programme Change Authority throughout Project HNG-
x.

SCHEDULE B6.2

HNG-X DESIGN AND BUILD
INTRODUCTION

This Schedule deals with:

14 an overview of the manner in which the HNG-X Requirements set out in
or generated by the process in Schedule B6.1 will be logged and
confirmed;

1.2 the agreed processes for design and development in support of the
solution specification, build and test stages of the lifecycle of the HNG-X
Development, including offshore development. The Parties acknowledge
that Post Office is embarking on a project management methodology
referred to as RMG Harmony. This methodology is in development at the
date of signature of CCN1200. As such this Schedule may or may not
align with RMG Harmony. In the event that Post Office requires changes
to this Schedule to better align it with RMG Harmony those changes will
be dealt with in accordance with the Change Control Procedure;

1.3 an overview of the Solution Baseline Documentation Set;

14 maintenance of the HNG-X Programme Plan and associated budgeting
and reporting; and

15 other matters relating to the conduct of Project HNG-X and the
Associated Changes.

HNG-X REQUIREMENTS

The HNG-X Requirements that will form the Requirements Baseline are referred
to in, or will be generated in the manner defined in, Schedule B6.1.

Fujitsu Services will establish a method of requirements traceability against the
Requirements Baseline for use during the HNG-X Development Period. Fujitsu
Services will provide Post Office with a completed compliance matrix for all HNG-
X Requirements listed in the Requirements Baseline by the milestone entitled
“Requirements Compliance Matrix Baselined” in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

SOLUTION BASELINE DOCUMENTATION SET

Fujitsu Services shall develop a set of documents and other artefacts that
accurately reflects the Solution Baseline (the “Solution Baseline Documentation
Set"). The Solution Baseline Documentation Set will consist of updated
versions of Schedules B3.2, B3.3 and B3.4, the Solution Architecture, and more
detailed information (which may be based on aspects of the Requirements
Baseline and/or a set of architectural and design artefacts). The Parties shall
work together throughout the two month period following the end of the
Requirements Stage to agree by the end of that period the list of documents

Changes to components or component usage explicitly described in the
Solution Architecture, or in other documents and artefacts of the Solution
Baseline Documentation Set which have been agreed between the Parties as
requiring Post Office approval, shall be approved by Post Office and Fujitsu
Services.

ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

Fujitsu Services will create and maintain, for the duration of the HNG-X
Development Period, an architectural solution description, which shall be
developed from the Solution Architecture and shall take account of relevant
HNG-X Requirements (the "Architectural Solution Description"). The Architectural
Solution Description will be used to support HNG-X Solution Assurance in the
manner described in paragraph 5.4.2 and the Parties shall agree, in accordance
with paragraph 3, which elements of the Architectural Solution Description shall
form part of the Solution Baseline Documentation Set.

The Architectural Solution Description will consist of a number of architectural
and design artefacts that capture the design characteristics of the component
sub-systems of the solution. The architectural and design artefacts will take a
number of forms, dependent on the nature of the sub-system but typically
dictated by whether the component is to be newly created or retained or
enhanced legacy. Architectural and design artefact production will be tracked
through the HNG-X Programme Plan. Fujitsu Services shall work with Post Office
to agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, the form of the
architectural and design artefacts by the date for such agreement set out in the
HNG-X Programme Plan.

HNG-X SOLUTION ASSURANCE

HNG-X Solution Assurance is a significant and necessary activity in the HNG-X
solution lifecycle providing the means by which Post Office and Fujitsu Services
will progressively gain confidence in the emerging solution.

HNG-X Solution Assurance will continue the engagement between Post Office
and Fujitsu Services that was established to conduct Requirements Assurance
as a pre-cursor to establishing the Requirements Baseline.

The objectives of HNG-X Solution Assurance are to enable:

5.3.1 Post Office and Fujitsu Services to develop a common and shared
understanding of the Requirements Baseline;

5.3.2 Post Office to amplify, explain or clarify any points of difficulty in the
interpretation of the Requirements Baseline as requested by Fujitsu
Services;

5.3.3

Post Office and Fujitsu Services to monitor the progress of the Solution
Baseline towards satisfying the Requirements Baseline;

Post Office and Fujitsu Services to progressively gain confidence in the
completeness and integrity of the Solution Baseline;

Fujitsu Services to confirm to Post Office the operational effect of
applying the HNG-X Assumptions to the Architectural Solution
Description; and

Fujitsu Services to advise Post Office of potential operational or
functional implications which may arise in the development of the
Architectural Solution Description and for Post Office to consider
appropriate actions, such actions to be agreed between the Parties.
Such advice shall not include operational implications relating to the
usability characteristics of the HNG-X User Interface or the user interface
of the CSRDE, where such implications would be specific to Post Office's
business operations and practices.

HNG-X Solution Assurance Roles and Responsibilities

5.4.1

5.4.2

5.4.3

5.4.4

5.4.5

The HNG-X Solution Assurance role will be led by the Post Office Design
Authority and his team, supported by Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services will demonstrate, through discussion and by the
provision of appropriate architectural and design artefacts, how the
Design and Architecture Requirements are met. In addition, Fujitsu
Services will, through the provision of an appropriate compliance matrix,
demonstrate the incorporation of all of the HNG-X Requirements in the
Requirements Baseline against relevant solution artefacts.

During HNG-X Solution Assurance Post Office will not specify any design
or design component to Fujitsu Services but will provide feedback where
it does not reasonably believe that the solution design will correctly meet
the Requirements Baseline, or where it believes that the solution
outcome would result in unacceptable implications.

HNG-X Solution Assurance will be carried out via a joint design forum
and ad-hoc discussions provided that the workings of the design forum or
the holding of such ad-hoc discussions do not adversely impact progress
against the HNG-X Programme Plan. Where Fujitsu Services believes
that such an adverse impact has occurred or is likely to occur, then this
issue shall be raised with both the Post Office HNG-X Programme
Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme Manager for
resolution and such impact shall be assessed via the mechanisms
described in paragraph 13.1.

This participative approach will recognise the respective and overriding
roles and responsibilities of Post Office (in terms of HNG-X Requirements

Assurance) and of Fujitsu Services (in terms of solution definition, build
and implementation) in this process.

DEVELOPMENT

Fujitsu Services will develop the components of the solution using a combination
of “waterfall”, iterative and prototyping development methods as appropriate to
the component or sub-system being created. In general:

6.1.1 the “waterfall” approach will typically be used for retained “legacy” in the
Data Centre and those components that are related to the internal
workings of the solution (not business/user visible);

6.1.2 iterative methods will typically be used to deliver subsets of business
functionality earlier in the lifecycle (to support incremental testing); and

6.1.3 prototyping will typically be deployed where the requirements are not
clearly understood or where Fujitsu Services and Post Office jointly agree
that this is the correct approach for the creation of a particular aspect of
the system.

Fujitsu Services will agree with Post Office, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, which development method will be used for each sub-
system or component of the solution.

Fujitsu Services will act in accordance with the Fujitsu Services “Solution
Framework” methodologies, as enhanced by the Fujitsu Services team to support
the needs of the development stream and this will be captured in revisions to the
Working Document “Development Strategy for HNG-X” (DEV/MGT/STG/0001),
which will be shared with Post Office. Decisions on which development tooling
and development methodologies are to be used will be driven out of the
programme and implemented within the project lifecycle as indicated by Level 2
key milestones in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

Each Party shall comply with its obligations set out in Annex 2 to this Schedule
with regard to the HNG-X Development.

Fujitsu Services shall provide a measurement mechanism which can be used to
estimate the functional size and complexity of software components and which
can be used to estimate the functional size and complexity of future software
changes.

In accordance with agreed Work Order(s), Fujitsu Services shall support Post
Office in activities necessary for Post Office to achieve:

Fujitsu Services shall allow Post Office training development staff access to the
pre-release solution as is becomes available, to facilitate the development by
Post Office of accurate training material.

TESTING

Project HNG-X will follow a jointly developed, jointly agreed testing strategy that
has been created to exploit the benefits of the re-engineered solution to be
delivered by a service oriented architecture (as that term is described in the
Solution Architecture) and an object oriented development approach. From the
agreed testing strategy, revisions to the generic testing processes will be drawn.
The approach will re-balance the testing lifecycle to strengthen the earlier stages
of testing and thus reduce the risk of significant issues emerging in the later
stages. To ensure that each stage of testing delivers the appropriate contribution
to the programme it is important to establish and manage the commencement
(trends, stability, readiness) and completion (coverage, completeness, closure)
criteria for each testing stage.

Each test stage will have associated, documented quality gates (QGs) that will
support the readiness review process to decide whether it is appropriate to enter
or leave the stage of testing to which the QGs relate. The entry QG will be based
on objective entry criteria, drawn from generic checklists, to support the
assessment of readiness, timeliness, worth and risk.

Independent testing of the solution will be carried out by a jointly resourced and
managed team where each organisation takes leadership of an individual test
stage as agreed between the Parties. The scheduling of tests shall take account
of, and be consistent with, the HNG-X Acceptance Plan.

The Parties will use reasonable endeavours to jointly agree, by the touchpoint in
the HNG-X Programme Plan entitled “HNG-X Testing Approach Agreed”, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, a CCD entitled “Testing Approach
for HNG-X” (TST/GEN/STG/0002) which will define the joint approach to be used
for testing. Such CCD will be based on the then current version of the Working
Document “HNG-X Testing Strategy”, the version at the date of signature of
CCN1200 being version 1.0 (March 2006).

ACCEPTANCE

The HNG-X Acceptance Process will be managed in accordance with Schedule
B6.3 by the respective HNG-X Acceptance Managers of Post Office and Fujitsu
Services for the period to HNG-X Initial Acceptance and by the Post Office
Acceptance Manager and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account service
management team for the period from HNG-X Initial Acceptance to HNG-X Final
Acceptance.

action in accordance with paragraph 10 shall be borne by Fujitsu
Services.

13.4.2 To the extent that a failure by Post Office to achieve a Development Dependency
by the achievement date for that Development Dependency in the HNG-X
Programme Plan is due to a Default of Fujitsu Services, then:

13.4.2.1_ if the Development Dependency is not achieved by the date specified
for that Development Dependency in the HNG-X Programme Plan, the
period for achieving that delayed Development Dependency shall be
extended by the period reasonably necessary for that Development
Dependency to be achieved, taking into account:

(a) whether the reasons for delay, to the extent they can be

(c) the nature of the Development Dependency to be achieved; and

(d) other Development Dependencies which have not yet been
achieved,

provided that Post Office shall use reasonable endeavours to redeploy
any resources allocated to achieve that Development Dependency
throughout the period of delay so as to minimise that period of
extension;

13.4.2.2 the length of the time extensions to Development Dependencies in
accordance with paragraph 13.4.2.1 shall require written agreement at
HNG-X Authority Level 1 (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld by either Party) and shall take effect immediately subject to
written confirmation at HNG-X Authority Level 2 (which shall be given
or refused within one week of such agreement);

13.4.2.3 if the Parties fail to reach such agreement at HNG-X Authority Level 1
or HNG-X Authority Level 2, for the purposes of establishing the
effective ongoing HNG-X Programme Plan, Fujitsu Services shall be
entitled to determine on the basis of and taking into account the factors
set out in paragraph 13.4.2.1 the amount of time by which each
delayed Development Dependency shall be extended. Post Office shall
work to that revised HNG-X Programme Plan but shall be entitled to
seek a further extension of time for such Development Dependencies
through the dispute resolution process referred to in paragraph
13.4.2.4; and

13.4.2.4 Disputes as to:
(a) whether or to what extent a Default by Post Office or some other
failure has caused a Development Dependency to be delayed;

or

(b) I the amount by which the time for a Development Dependency
should be extended,

shall be referred for resolution at the Executive Review level of the DRP
and if not resolved shall (unless the Parties agree otherwise) be

a failure by Post Office or any of its agents or sub-contractors to (i)
achieve any Development Dependencies by the date shown for the
achievement of them set out in the HNG-X Programme Plan, or (ii) fulfil
its other obligations under this Agreement, provided that Fujitsu Services
notified Post Office of its failure to fulfil that obligation and its effect on
Fujitsu Services' ability to perform the FS Task.

If an FS Task is not completed by the date specified for that FS Task in
the HNG-X Programme Plan, the period for completing that delayed FS
Task shall be extended by the period reasonably necessary for that FS
Task to be completed, taking into account:

(a) whether the reasons for delay, to the extent they can be
identified, are likely to continue to cause delay;

(b) the availability of appropriate resources (both existing Fujitsu
Services resources and any available to Fujitsu Services to buy
in);

(c) the nature of the FS Task to be completed; and

(d) other FS Tasks which remain incomplete,

provided that Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to
redeploy any resources allocated to that FS Task throughout the period
of delay so as to minimise that period of extension.

Fujitsu Services shall revise the HNG-X T&M Budget for completing each
of its delayed FS Tasks to the extent reasonably necessary to reflect:

(a) any additional work required; and/or
(b) additional resource required to be allocated to that FS Task,

for it to be completed within the period of extension described in
paragraph 13.5.2, provided that Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable
endeavours to redeploy any resources allocated to that FS Task
throughout the period of delay.

The length of the time extensions to FS Tasks in accordance with
paragraph 13.5.2 shall require written agreement at HNG-X Authority
Level 1 (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by either Party)
and shall take effect immediately subject to written confirmation at HNG-
X Authority Level 2 (which shall be given or refused within one week of
such agreement).

If the Parties fail to reach such agreement at HNG-X Authority Level 1 or
HNG-X Authority Level 2, for the purposes of establishing the effective
ongoing HNG-X Programme Plan, Post Office shall be entitled to

determine on the basis of and taking into account the factors set out in
paragraph 13.5.2 the amount of time by which each delayed FS Task
shall be extended. Fujitsu Services shall work to that revised HNG-X
Programme Plan but shall be entitled to seek a further extension of time
for such FS Tasks through the dispute resolution process referred to in
paragraph 13.5.6.

13.5.6 Disputes as to:

(a) whether or to what extent a Default by Fujitsu Services or some
other failure has caused an FS Task to be delayed;

(b) the amount by which the time for an FS Task should be
extended; or

(c) the increase (if any) to the HNG-X T&M Budget to reflect the
additional work or resource required to complete a delayed or
extended FS Task,

shall be referred for resolution at the Executive Review level of the DRP
and if not resolved shall (unless the Parties agree otherwise) be
escalated further in accordance with the DRP.

13.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clauses 57 and 68, written
agreements and confirmations referred to in paragraphs 13.1 to 13.5 may be

14. OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT

14.1. Appointment and Induction of Offshore Development Partner

14.1.1 Fujitsu Services has appointed Zensar Technologies UK Limited as an
HNG-X Sub-contractor, in the role of offshore development partner (the
“Offshore Development Partner’). This paragraph 14 sets out the
circumstances in which Fujitsu Services may use the Offshore
Development Partner, its management of the Offshore Development
Partner and Post Office’s role in that process. It is without prejudice to
Fujitsu Services obligations under Clause 58.2.

14.1.2 Fujitsu Services will agree the appointment, by the Offshore

Development Partner, of a Fujitsu Services’ Offshore Project Manager
and a Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority to oversee the Offshore

14.1.3

14.1.4

14.1.5

Development Partner's contribution to HNG-X Development work. These
appointments will be notified to Post Office by Fujitsu Services as soon
as reasonably practicable.

Fujitsu Services will ensure that the Fujitsu Services’ Offshore Project
Manager and the Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority appointed
by the Offshore Development Partner have a full understanding of both
the technical solution proposed and the business environment within Post
Office sufficient to fulfil Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of offshore
activities.

The Fujitsu Services' Offshore Project Manager and the Fujitsu Services’
Offshore Design Authority will ensure that such induction information is
communicated within the Offshore Development Partner's teams through
mandatory briefings and a record will be maintained to demonstrate all
individuals have received this communication. Post Office will agree the
content of this communication in advance, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld.

The Parties will agree Post Office's involvement in the activities, including
any support to be provided to Fujitsu Services, set out in paragraphs
14.1.3 and 14.1.4, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by
either Party.

14.2 Use of Offshore Development Partner

14.2.1

14.2.2

14.2.3

Fujitsu Services will propose which components of the solution are to be
produced offshore on a case-by-case basis and which aspects of
development (design, development, test) are to be produced by the
Offshore Development Partner. Fujitsu Services shall provide reasonable
notice to Post Office to consider such proposals and shall seek Post
Office agreement to these proposals before they are implemented, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. The decision to offshore the
development of a component will be based on information that will
include architectural considerations, skills availability, development
knowledge, support constraints and security measures.

Before Fujitsu Services proposes to Post Office, pursuant to paragraph
14.2.1, that any HNG-X Development work be undertaken by the
Offshore Development Partner, Fujitsu Services shall, at no cost to the
Post Office, carry out an assessment of the potential risks involved in
such work being undertaken offshore by the Offshore Development
Partner. Such assessment shall consider any potential risks arising from
the physical, logical and management security standards to be followed
by the Offshore Development Partner in undertaking such work.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to Post Office (a) the results of the
assessment referred to in paragraph 14.2.2 and (b) details of the
processes, procedures, systems and controls it has or intends to put in

Schedule B6.2 Version 9.0 Page 15 of 26

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

14.2.4

14.2.5

14.2.6

place to address the risks identified in that assessment. The
commencement of any offshore HNG-X Development work by the
Offshore Development Partner shall be conditional on Post Office
confirming to Fujitsu Services that it is satisfied with such assessment
and such processes, procedures, systems and controls.

Fujitsu Services will enter into contractual arrangements with the
Offshore Development Partner that will entitle it to require the Offshore
Development Partner to put in place the following security measures in
respect of any HNG-X Development work undertaken by it offshore:

(a) physically isolating the Offshore Development Partner's
development environment for HNG-X Development from other
areas, with access restricted to only those resources of the
Offshore Development Partner who are carrying out such
activities; and

(b) isolating the Offshore Development Partner's networks for such
development environment from other areas and other networks
including data security, network security, server security,
document security and web security.

As a result of an assessment conducted pursuant to paragraph 14.2.2 or
otherwise, the Parties may agree in writing that the Offshore
Development Partner implement the measures referred to in this
paragraph in relation to HNG-X Development work. As part of any such
agreement, the Parties shall also agree any additional charges to be paid
by Post Office for those measures, such charges to reflect any additional
costs incurred by the Offshore Development Partner in implementing
those measures.

Fujitsu Services shall be responsible for ensuring that the Offshore
Development Partner implements and observes any security measures
disclosed to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 14.2.3 (to the extent they
are relevant to the Offshore Development Partner) or agreed by the
Parties pursuant to paragraph 14.2.4. Other than as referred to in
paragraph 14.2.4, the cost of such security measures shall be borne by
Fujitsu Services.

The requirements for the components of the solution that are to be
developed offshore will be passed to the Offshore Development Partner
under the control of the Fujitsu Services’ ‘Requirements and Acceptance’
team, in accordance with established Project HNG-X practice. The
Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority will actively participate in the
review, interpretation and assurance of these requirements. Fujitsu
Services will arrange reviews involving the Fujitsu Services Design
Authority, the Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority and the Post
Office Design Authority where it believes significant clarification or better
understanding of an HNG-X Requirement is needed. Post Office may

Schedule B6.2 Version 9.0 Page 16 of 26

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

14.2.7

request Fujitsu Services to arrange such a review if it reasonably
believes a review to be necessary for specific HNG-X Requirements.

The independent testing stages of Project HNG-X will be supported by
the Offshore Development Partner's personnel working on and offshore
and it is anticipated that there will be regular contact with the joint Post
Office and Fujitsu Services testing team with respect to offshore
developed technology where this touches the business/user environment.
A series of two way visits is envisaged.

14.3.1

14.3.2

14.3.3

14.3.4

14.3.5

14.3.6

Fujitsu Services has appointed the Fujitsu Services Project Manager,
who is a senior project management professional, to oversee the
relationship with the Offshore Development Partner to ensure that
synergy with the programme is maintained and pro-actively managed.
The Fujitsu Services Project Manager will ensure all risks associated with
the offshore development are managed, such risks and their associated
action plans to be shared with Post Office.

Offshore activities will be included within the HNG-X Programme Plan
(Levels 1, 2 and 3) and weekly time recording will be supported within
Fujitsu Services’ standard RTR toolset, in accordance with agreed
reporting processes for Project HNG-X. Offshore activities will be
included within Project HNG-X reporting in accordance with this Schedule
B6.2.

Fujitsu Services will hold all offshore generated artefacts within the
nominated repositories for Project HNG-X and knowledge share will be
supported by the continued involvement of offshore staff within their
respective programme communities (design, development and test).

Fujitsu Services will ensure that all risks and issues that originate or are
identified offshore are managed through the appropriate programme
registers and processes. Such risks and issues will be made visible to
Post Office who will be invited to participate in their resolution.

Fujitsu Services will work with the Offshore Development Partner to put in
place measures, equivalent to those set out at Clause 41 (Fujitsu
Services Key Personnel) of this Agreement, aimed at ensuring that the
Fujitsu Services' Offshore Project Manager and the Fujitsu Services'
Offshore Design Authority are retained as key personnel.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Offshore Development Partner's
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph 14 and its performance
of any of Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this Agreement shall be
subject to the same rights of audit as if those obligations were performed
by Fujitsu Services and Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Offshore
Development Partner maintains Records and cooperates with, and

SECTION A: GENERAL
41. BACKGROUND
14 Fujitsu Services does not intentionally engage in the production of software or

1.2

1.3

21

2.2

23

24

25

systems which unlawfully copy the proprietary works of others. Nor does it
intentionally misuse confidential information to assist such production.

In addition Fujitsu Services takes appropriate steps to ensure the potential risk of
inadvertent copying of proprietary works is minimised.

As a result of Post Office's business decisions not to continue using the parts of
the current Horizon systems from Fujitsu Services’ existing subcontractor there is a
possibility that Fujitsu Services will be required to produce evidence that the
replacement software did not benefit either from the unlawful copying by Fujitsu
Services of proprietary material or the misuse of third party confidential
information.

APPROACH

This document sets out the approach agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post
Office:

2.1.1. to control the risk of infringement of third party rights during the
development of HNG-X; and

2.1.2 to enable Fujitsu Services to demonstrate that Fujitsu Services design and
code outputs are based upon the HNG-X Requirements not the unlawful
copying or misuse by Fujitsu Services of third party rights in existing
systems.

The use of the Clean Room is to produce Clean Room Outputs based only on the
Post Office's HNG-X Requirements and not created as a result of any unlawful
copying or misuse by Fujitsu Services of third party rights in existing systems.

Post Office acknowledges that it has a role to play to assist Fujitsu Services in
avoiding the risk of infringement of that third party IPR and Section D of this Annex
sets out details of the actions and responsibilities of Post Office in this respect.

The rules applicable to the Clean Room are not intended to replace those
applicable to the General Development Team. The General Development Team
Rules shall unless modified by the Clean Room Rules also apply to the Clean
Room Team.

Neither the Clean Room Rules nor the General Development Team Rules shall
replace Fujitsu Services’ other applicable general development or quality
assurance obligations. Rather the Clean Room Rules and the General
Development Team Rules are intended to bring specific focus and awareness in

areas where these need to be modified or augmented to meet identified risks of
IPR infringement.

SCOPE
The Parties have agreed that where there are real risks of actual IPR infringement
Fujitsu Services shall put in place a system where part of its team (the “Clean

Room Team”) will work in isolation to prevent such infringement.

For the purpose of this Annex the additional rules applicable to the Clean Room
Team are called the Clean Room Rules.

SECTION B: GENERAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM RULES

GENERAL

These rules apply to all of the activities undertaken by Fujitsu Services for Post
Office involving the creation or use of IPR.

General Development Team shall not use, copy or adapt (from any other
programming language) or reverse engineer any third party proprietary software or
software tool (and its related documentation) unless they have first satisfied
themselves that:

4.2.1 _ they know the origin of the same; and

4.2.2 Fujitsu Services is licensed or otherwise authorised to make use of such
IPR in this way.

For the avoidance of doubt in respect of the General Development Team there
shall be no separation physical or functional outside the Clean Room of ongoing
maintenance and other work in respect of Horizon and the development of HNG-X.

INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED

Members of the General Development Team (other than the Clean Room Team)
may have background knowledge of Horizon and access to Horizon code and
Escher APIs.

All members of the General Development Team shall have been briefed
appropriately on the General Development Team Rules and of the need to ensure
that all contact with the Clean Room Team is through the Fujitsu Filter Team.

Adherence by the General Development Team to the General Development Team
Rules shall be through normal supervision by Fujitsu Services line management.

RECORDS

The General Development Team shall maintain such records as are required
through its normal development procedures and good industry practice.

AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE

Fujitsu Services will implement appropriate controls to check compliance with the
General Development Team Rules through its management organisation.

Compliance with the General Development Rules and the Clean Room Rules shall
be subject to the standard Fujitsu Services’ company quality audit procedure.

CHANGES TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM RULES
Fujitsu Services shall retain the ability to control changes to the General
Development Team Rules and to modify and update such General Development

Team Rules provided any such changes are good industry practice.

SECTION C: CLEAN ROOM RULES

IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR A CLEAN ROOM PROCESS

Fujitsu Services does not intend to unlawfully copy third party proprietary material
included in the existing Horizon system or otherwise.

To ensure that this is not done inadvertently and to assist in proving that the
development of HNG-X took place lawfully Fujitsu Services shall ensure that work
or parts of work needed to create certain HNG-X elements are performed by
Fujitsu Services under Clean Room Rules by a separate development team
located in a Clean Room with inputs and outputs suitably monitored and recorded.

In order to avoid any infringement or risk of infringement the following elements of
the project need to be created in the separate environment to which these Clean
Room Rules shall apply:

A. Work to create UI Clean Room Outputs

. UI Construct Catalogue to create new constructs defined by UI Clean
Room Team;

. UI Prototypes for use in Usability Trials;

. HNG-X Style Guide being the final formal documentation of UI Clean

Room Outputs; and

B. Work to create CSRDE Clean Room Outputs

. Carrier Services technical data model, including schema, to meet the
Postal Services Requirements;

. CSRDT;
. the design of the user interface for using the CSRDT; and
. the design and prototype of the code to access the CSRDE from the

Postal Services Functional Requirements.

The Parties will jointly keep under review through the governance arrangements
set out in Schedule A2 and the Change Control Procedure and Work Ordering
Procedure the risks of infringement of any other aspects or third party rights and
the action required including the creation of Clean Room conditions for such
additional elements.

CLEAN ROOM TEAM

Fujitsu Services shall make arrangements for the creation at a location physically
separated from its main development team of a group (initially eight to ten people)
who will be responsible for creating the Ul and CSRDE Clean Room Outputs.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the development personnel in the Clean Room
Team are selected by Fujitsu Services so as to avoid the use of individuals with
prior knowledge of any relevant third party materials and software. For the HNG-X
UI Clean Room process Fujitsu Services shall select only those personnel who
have not had significant experience of, or any access to the source materials of,
the existing Horizon UI. For the CSRDE Clean Room process, Fujitsu Services
shall select only those personnel who have not had significant experience of, or
any access to the source materials of, the existing Escher Mails data editor.
Members of the Clean Room Team shall be requested to confirm that they have
not had such experience or access.

After their selection, Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Clean Room Team shall
not have any access to any relevant third party materials and software used in the
Horizon system. For the HNG-X UI Clean Room process, Fujitsu Services shall
ensure that the relevant personnel shall continue not to have access to the source
materials of the existing Horizon UI. For the CSRDE Clean Room process, Fujitsu
Services shall ensure that the relevant personnel shall continue not to have access
to the existing Escher Mails data editor.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that members of the Clean Room Team do not have
knowledge of or access to any relevant Escher materials and software (including
the source materials) and that they do not attempt to obtain such knowledge or
access.

10.5

10.6

Fujitsu Services shall restrict access by Clean Room Team to personnel outside of
the Clean Room whether in General Development Team or elsewhere that might
have such knowledge or materials so that the isolation of the Clean Room Team
does not become ineffective.

Fujitsu Services shall make and keep suitable records of the input of information
software and materials to the Clean Room.

Each member of the Clean Room Team shall be responsible for keeping suitable
personal records of their Clean Room activity.

FUJITSU FILTER TEAM

Communication with the Clean Room Team shall be via a nominated set of
individuals (the “Fujitsu Filter Team”) external to the Clean Room Team who shall
be responsible for recording and vetting of inputs to the Clean Room Team.

All communication between the Clean Room Team and either Post Office or the
remainder of the HNG-X development team shall be controlled by a Fujitsu Filter
Team. The responsibility of the Fujitsu Filter Team is to ensure that the terms of
reference for the Clean Room Team are not inadvertently compromised by the
inputs to it.

The Fujitsu Filter Team consists of a senior technical manager appointed by the
Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme Manager along with one or more assistants.
The Fujitsu Filter Team is part of the HNG-X project team outside the Clean Room
Team, and is responsible for the following:

11.3.1 Production of the Terms of Reference for the UI and Postal Services
(CSRDE) Clean Room Teams, including synopsis / contents list for the UI
Style Guide, Counter Architecture and Interfaces;

11.3.2 Identification of individual Process Steps from the sample Post Office
Business Use Cases for prototyping of Ul scenarios and CSRDE specific
Process Steps;

11.3.3. Recording and review of other Post Office and Fujitsu Services’ inputs to
the Clean Rooms;

11.3.4 Communicating any Fujitsu Services feedback to the Clean Room Team
and ensuring any feed back provided to the Clean Room Team relates only
to the above referenced inputs to the Clean Room and not to replication of
existing systems;

The Fujitsu Filter Team shall also raise any issues of concern, or refer any such
issues raised by the Clean Room Team to Fujitsu Services’ legal advisers.

All feedback correspondence originating from Fujitsu Services or Post Office
should include an identifier which clearly identifies the correspondence as
containing feedback intending to lead to a change in the outputs of the Clean
Room Team.

Fujitsu Services shall from time to time inform Post Office of the members of the
Fujitsu Filter Team and shall promptly upon each change to the Fujitsu Filter Team
personnel inform Post Office of that change.

SECTION D: RELATED POST OFFICE OBLIGATIONS

Post Office shall prepare its HNG-X Requirements in a format that where
reasonably possible avoids dictating a specific solution or design which in the
reasonable opinion of Post Office might infringe third party IPR.

Post Office shall as soon as reasonably practicable respond to reasonable
requests for information from Fujitsu Services aimed at establishing the bona fides
of any source of its HNG-X Requirement.

Post Office shall ensure that all its inputs for the Clean Room Team are submitted
via the Fujitsu Filter Team.

Post Office shall (at Fujitsu Services’ cost) take all steps reasonably requested by
Fujitsu Services to assist Fujitsu Services in establishing and operating its General
Development Team Rules or Clean Room Rules but only to the extent such steps
relate to the actions of Post Office’s employees, agents or contractors under this
Agreement.

Post Office shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Fujitsu Services of any
matters which come to its attention that might reasonably result in a breach by
Fujitsu Services of the General Development Team Rules or Clean Room Rules.

SCHEDULE B6.3
HNG-X ACCEPTANCE PROCESS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The purpose of this Schedule is to describe a clear, agreed process that enables

24

2.2

objective confirmation (or otherwise) of the fulfilment of Fujitsu Services’ delivery
obligations in respect of Project HNG-X and certain of the Associated Change Activities.

The process includes a mechanism for managing any and all rectification activities
identified in order to complete the fulfilment of any HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that have
not been met.
DEFINITIONS

Acceptance

2.1.1. The HNG-X Acceptance Process will enable Post Office and Fujitsu Services to
provide:

2.1.1.1 confirmation that the deliverables are fit to proceed to the next stage in
the HNG-X Acceptance Process; and

2.1.1.2 confirmation that Fujitsu Services has met the HNG-X Requirements,
and any related contractual obligations, in an agreed manner.

2.1.2 HNG-X Initial Acceptance will be achieved on progressing through HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4.

2.1.3. HNG-X Final Acceptance will be achieved once all HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways have been passed through.

HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages

2.2.1 A series of HNG-X Acceptance Gateways exists for the HNG-X Acceptance
Process. The HNG-X Acceptance Gateways are each numbered but such
numbering does not imply that the HNG-X Acceptance Gateways must be
achieved in strict sequential order. The series of numbered HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways for HNG-X is stated below, with the corresponding “Z#” point (as
defined in Schedule BS5) stated alongside:

2.2.1.1 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 - Readiness for Router Roll Out
(Acceptance Point Z1);

2.2.1.2 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 - Readiness for Data Centre Migration;

2.2.1.6 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6 — End of Live Monitoring.

HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 must both be passed through as pre-
requisites for passing through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3. HNG-X
Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 may be passed through in any order (the actual
order to be agreed and documented in the HNG-X Programme Plan).

Not Used.

A series of HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages exist, delineated by specific
HNG-X Acceptance Gateways as follows:

2.2.4.1 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Test and Validation” is from delivery
of the agreed HNG-X Acceptance Plan to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway
3;

2.2.4.2 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Live Pilot” is from HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 3 to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4; and

2.2.4.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Live Monitoring” is from HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4 to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6.

The HNG-X Acceptance Gateways and the HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages
can be represented diagrammatically as follows (HNG-X Acceptance Gateways

2.2.6 The HNG-X Acceptance Plan documents, inter alia, all the HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria and when they need to be achieved by. The HNG-X Acceptance
Process from AG4 to HNG-X Final Acceptance will be managed for Fujitsu
Services by its Post Office Account Service Management team.

2.2.7 ‘The Fujitsu Services’ Post Office Account Service Management team will
support the Fujitsu Services Acceptance Manager throughout the Live Pilot
stage by managing the provision of acceptance evidence in support of those
HNG-X Acceptance Criteria with the Acceptance Method of HNG-X Monitoring.

HNG-X Acceptance Criterion

2.3.1. An HNG-X Acceptance Criterion is a clear, objective and unambiguous
statement against which fulfilment (with supporting evidence) of an HNG-X
Requirement using an HNG-X Acceptance Method can be determined. There
will be one HNG-X Acceptance Criterion against each instance of an allocated
HNG-X Acceptance Method. There may be HNG-X Requirements that are, in
themselves, measurable and unambiguous. In such cases, the HNG-X
Acceptance Criterion may be marked ‘as per the HNG-X Requirement’. Where
the HNG-X Requirement is expressed as a Use Case, the HNG-X Acceptance
Criterion will be the fulfilment of the Use Case pre-conditions and post-
conditions or, subject to agreement between the HNG-X Acceptance Managers,
the HNG-X High Level Test Plans as detailed in the Test Automation Toolset and
associated with the relevant HNG-X Requirement, except where explicitly
stated.

2.3.2 HNG-X Acceptance Criteria will be documented by Post Office in DOORS and
extracted by Post Office into the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue at appropriate
points during Project HNG-X, including at the date of signature of CCN1200 and
at the end of the Requirements Stage.

2.3.3. Fujitsu Services is responsible for producing, within the timescale agreed
between the Parties, evidence to demonstrate that the relevant HNG-X
Acceptance Criterion has been met.

2.3.4 Further details of the presentation and status of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are
set out in the table below:

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

Functional Requirements will be specified through Use
Cases.

Use Cases in themselves will not have HNG-X
Acceptance Methods and HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
as they are at a different level of specification and form
the starting point for test scripts. However, Use Cases
will each contain pre-conditions, minimal guarantees
and success guarantees, i.e. what is required to be true
before the Use Case is activated and what is expected
after the Use Case has been activated for both the main
flow and any variant paths.

Acceptance of each Use Case will therefore be fulfilled
when all paths have been exercised, and the pre-
conditions, minimal guarantees and success guarantees
or, subject to agreement between the HNG-X
Acceptance Managers, the tests associated with the
relevant HNG-X High Level Test Plan, have been met.
At the end of the Requirements Stage these will be
described within DOORS, and a _ version-controlled
extract will be provided by Post Office in the HNG-X
Requirements Catalogue, version 1. Further version-
controlled extracts shall be provided by Post Office
following any amendments to, or re-issuing of, HNG-X
Requirements in accordance with Schedule B6.1.

Functional
Requirements (Retained
Functionality)

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

Certain Functional Requirements will be expressed as
Retained Functionality Use Cases which are agreed not
to require main, variant and exception paths. They will
contain, as a minimum, a goal and a description and in
some cases more detail relating to Business Rules and
usage. Acceptance of these Retained Functionality Use
Cases will, as a minimum, be via the HNG-X
Acceptance Methods of HNG-X Solution Test and/or
HNG-X Release Validation and will require traditional
narrative HNG-X Acceptance Criterion statements or,
subject to agreement between the HNG-X Acceptance
Managers, HNG-X High Level Test Plans to be jointly
developed by Post Office and Fujitsu Services which

Schedule B6.3 Version 9.0

shall reference existing Horizon test materials where
relevant.

Development of HNG-X Acceptance Methods and HNG-
X Acceptance Criteria will not be complete for Retained
Functionality Use Cases by the end of the
Requirements Stage. These will be agreed by the joint
test teams following the end of the Requirements Stage
and, following such agreement, will be included in any
subsequent versions of the Requirements Baseline
issued by Post Office to Fujitsu Services.

except where HNG-X Requirements are provided in
narrative form and have narrative HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria.

Position at the date of

of signature of CCN1200.

The position at the end of the Requirements Stage will
be that updated HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and HNG-X
Acceptance Methods will be provided by Post Office
within DOORS. A version-controlled extract will be
provided by Post Office in the HNG-X Requirements

which of these HNG-X Acceptance Methods and HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria have and have not been agreed
between the Parties at the date of signature of
CCN1200. Any such HNG-X Acceptance Methods and
HNG-X Acceptance Criteria not so agreed will be
documented as areas for agreement and detailed work
after the date of signature of CCN1200.

The User Interface

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

The functionality required to be supported by the HNG-
X User Interface will be derived from the Functional
Requirements generated through the Requirements
Definition Process. No HNG-X Acceptance Criteria or
HNG-X Acceptance Methods are required to additionally
and specifically accept these HNG-X Requirements in
terms of their presence within the HNG-X User Interface
as this is a fundamental pre-requisite to testing for
acceptance of the Functional Requirement.

Non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X
User Interface will be created in the traditional narrative
style and will include HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and
HNG-X Acceptance Methods. A high level view of the
acceptance events which relate to these HNG-X
Requirements are described in the CCD entitled
“Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface”
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

2.4 HNG-X Acceptance Methods

2.41

2.4.3

2.44

HNG-X Acceptance Methods are an agreed set of pre-defined techniques by
which HNG-X Requirements can be objectively measured as fulfilled or not,
each against one or more agreed HNG-X Acceptance Criteria. HNG-X
Acceptance Methods are described in more detail at Annex C to this Schedule.

2.4.2 In general, an HNG-X Requirement will be allocated one or more HNG-
X Acceptance Methods. The objectives in allocating HNG-X Acceptance
Method(s) to HNG-X Requirements are to progress toward overall HNG-
X Final Acceptance as efficiently as possible, but subject to also being
able to identify and resolve defects (non-compliances) as early as
possible in the HNG-X Acceptance Process, to reduce overall
development costs and risks.

In summary, the relationships are:

2.4.3.1 each HNG-X Requirement will have one or more HNG-X Acceptance
Methods; and

2.4.3.2 each HNG-X Acceptance Method for an HNG-X Requirement will have
one HNG-X Acceptance Criterion.

The agreed HNG-X Acceptance Method(s) allocated against each HNG-X
Requirement will be documented by Post Office in DOORS and extracted by
Post Office into the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue.

25 HNG-X Acceptance Tracking

2.5.1

HNG-X Acceptance Tracking will be achieved through the production of a single
HNG-X Acceptance Tracking report that will be initially derived from the HNG-X

Schedule B6.3 Version 9.0

2.8

Requirements. During the HNG-X Acceptance Process, the Acceptance status
of the HNG-X Requirements will be recorded in the Test Automation Toolset and
will be incrementally updated with the outcomes of the various activities that
form part of the HNG-X Acceptance Process.

2.5.2 The acceptance status of the HNG-X Requirements will be maintained by Post
Office and shared with Fujitsu Services.

HNG-X High Level Test Plans

HNG-X High Level Test Plans (HNG-X HLTPs) identify those functions and conditions
that are mapped against the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and that are required to
support the HNG-X Acceptance Process. HNG-X HLTPs will be produced by Post Office
or Fujitsu Services in accordance with HNG-X Programme Plan and are subject to joint
review.

HNG-X Acceptance Incident

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident is raised when the HNG-X Acceptance Method fails to
prove that an HNG-X Acceptance Criterion has been met. HNG-X Acceptance Incidents
are classified according to Annex A to this Schedule.

HNG-X Minor Concession

Where the evidence fails to prove that an HNG-X Acceptance Criterion has been met,
Fujitsu Services may request Post Office to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession on the
basis that the failure of compliance or the deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirement
presents no adverse impact to Post Office. In all such cases a defect shall be raised and
if Post Office agrees to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession, details of the failure of
compliance or the deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirements shall be recorded by
Post Office and linked to the relevant HNG-X Requirement. Confirmation that all such
details have been recorded by Post Office shall allow the defect to be closed and the
HNG-X Requirements shall be deemed to have been satisfied providing that there are
no additional test(s) associated with the HNG-X Requirement that have either not been
run or failed for a different reason.

Should Post Office refuse to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession, the failure of
compliance or deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirement shall be rectified through a
defect management process agreed by the HNG-X Acceptance Board.

Following the granting of an HNG-X Minor Concession, should Post Office identify any
unexpected consequences that have arisen as a direct result of an HNG-X Minor
Concession then they shall be treated as an incident, and a date for resolution and
rectification measures agreed through the HNG-X Acceptance Board, but will not be
classified as an HNG-X Acceptance incident for acceptance purposes. This shall apply
up until HNG-X Final Acceptance after which no further Incidents arising from any HNG-
X Minor Concessions shall be raised.

The Post Office shall maintain a register of all HNG-X Minor Concessions and shall
periodically share with Fujitsu Services details of all HNG-X Minor Concessions that
have been granted.

HNG-X Acceptance Incident Collection

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident Collection is a facility in PEAK whereby fault reports
deemed to be HNG-X Acceptance Incidents will be grouped for management and
reporting purposes.

HNG-X Acceptance Dispute

For the purposes of the HNG-X Acceptance Process, an ' HNG-X Acceptance Dispute’
is defined in paragraph 7.1. An HNG-X Acceptance Dispute is not a Dispute in the
broader context of the overall Agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services.

HNG-X Acceptance Plan

The HNG-X Acceptance Plan will define which HNG-X Acceptance Criteria will be
assessed during which HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage. This plan will be produced
by the Post Office HNG-X Acceptance Manager and agreed by the Fujitsu Services’
HNG-X Acceptance Manager, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

HNG-X ACCEPTANCE PROCESS

Roles and Responsibilities
3.1.1. HNG-X Acceptance Manager

The primary responsibility for managing the HNG-X Acceptance Process rests
with the HNG-X Acceptance Managers. This may be a specified
individual or, more likely, a role adopted by the respective HNG-X
Programme Managers.

3.1.2 HNG-X Acceptance Board

An HNG-X Acceptance Board will be nominated and the primary function of this
board shall be to assess and agree the acceptance status of the HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria associated with the relevant HNG-X Acceptance
Gateway. The Fujitsu and Post Office HNG-X Acceptance Managers
shall prepare material for assessment by the HNG-X Acceptance Board
from which the HNG-X Acceptance Board shall provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board’ concerning
progression through the relevant HNG-X Acceptance Gateway.

The HNG-X Acceptance Board shall be constituted, deal with matters and meet
at intervals as set out in Schedule A2.

3.1.3

HNG-X Acceptance Dispute Board

An HNG-X Acceptance Dispute Board will be nominated and the primary
function of this board shall be to settle any HNG-X Acceptance Disputes that
cannot be resolved by the HNG-X Acceptance Managers. The HNG-X
Acceptance Dispute Board shall be constituted, deal with the matters and meet
at the intervals as set out in Schedule A2.

3.2 Changes to the Agreement

3.2.1

3.2.2

After the end of the HNG-X Requirements Baselining Process and prior to HNG-
X Final Acceptance, where either Party requests a change to any provision of
this Agreement relating to HNG-X Requirements or the HNG-X solution, the
Change Control Procedure will be followed and both Fujitsu Services and Post
Office will review the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria to determine whether any
changes are required. Such changes may include:

3.2.1.1 deletion of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that were derived from deleted
provisions;

3.2.1.2 addition of new HNG-X Acceptance Criteria relating to new or extended
provisions; and/or

3.2.1.3 modification of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria relating to changed
provisions.

If changes are made to tests that are already in progress or have been
completed then, unless both Parties agree otherwise, or the results of those
changed tests can be derived from the results of tests already carried out, those
tests shall be repeated.

Within 60 days of Final Acceptance, Fujitsu Services shall present to Post Office
a CCN to incorporate all Minor Concessions continuing to have an impact after
Final Acceptance into the relevant requirements. This shall allow a clear
requirements baseline for the HNG-X Release.

4. PROGRESSING THROUGH THE HNG-X ACCEPTANCE PROCESS

41 Paragraph 2.2.4 identifies the three key stages during which the HNG-X Acceptance
Process takes place, namely Test and Validation, Live Pilot and Live Monitoring.
Progression from one stage to the next is controlled by an HNG-X Acceptance Gateway
that has to be passed through.

42 HNG-X Acceptance Gateways have parameters associated with them that are
configured to meet the specific arrangements agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services. The parameters are:

4.5.1.1 Progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 shall occur once all

of the following have been satisfied:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6, all the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
allocated in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan to Test and Validation

have been achieved;

(b) activities leading to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 (named
“Readiness for Router Roll-Out (Z1)” and HNG-X Acceptance
Gateway 2 (named “Readiness for Data Centre Migration”) must
be completed and these two HNG-X Acceptance Gateways
passed through in accordance with paragraph 4.5.4.2 as pre-
requisites to achieve HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3. Failure to
progress through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 and HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 2 will not prohibit any other programme
activities from continuing prior to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway

3;

(c) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance

Incidents;

(d) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents is five or fewer and an agreed workaround exists for

each of them; and

(e) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low
Severity Acceptance Incidents except for those which the

Parties agree do not require a workaround.

confirmation that it may do so is given in writing to Fujitsu Services by
the Post Office Release Authorisation Board.

4.5.2 Achieving HNG-X Initial Acceptance - From Live Pilot to Live Monitoring (HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4)

4.5.2.1 Achievement of HNG-X Initial Acceptance shall occur on progression
from Live Pilot to Live Monitoring once all of the following have been
satisfied:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6, all HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
allocated in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan to Live Pilot have been
achieved;

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance
Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents is five or fewer;

(d) each HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incident has an
agreed workaround and, subject to paragraph 6.4.2, an agreed
HNG-X Rectification Plan; and

(e) I each HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incident has, subject to
paragraph 6.4.4, a target timescale for rectification and has an
agreed workaround except those for which the Parties agree
that such a workaround is not required.

4.5.2.2 Notwithstanding achievement of HNG-X Initial Acceptance in
accordance with paragraph 4.5.2.1, Live Monitoring shall not commence
until confirmation that it may do so is given in writing to Fujitsu Services
by the Post Office Release Authorisation Board.

4.5.3 Achieving HNG-X Final Acceptance (HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6)

4.5.3.1 HNG-X Final Acceptance shall occur once all of the following have been
satisfied:

(a) the earliest planned date as specified in the HNG-X Programme
Plan for completion of Live Monitoring has occurred;

(b) subject to paragraph 4.6, all HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
allocated to Live Monitoring as set out in the HNG-X Acceptance
Plan have been achieved;

(c) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance
Incidents;

(d) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents arising from HNG-X Acceptance Criteria scheduled to
be achieved during Live Monitoring is two or fewer. For the
avoidance of doubt, this means that the total number of HNG-X
Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents at this HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway (including those outstanding from previous
HNG-X Acceptance Gateways) could be seven. However, this
total of seven would be reduced if any of the original HNG-X
Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents have been closed in
accordance with their agreed HNG-X Rectification Plans;

(e) each HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incident has an
agreed workaround and, subject to paragraph 6.4.2, an agreed
HNG-X Rectification Plan; and

(f) each HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incident has, subject to
paragraph 6.4.4, a target timescale for rectification and has an
agreed workaround except those for which the Parties agree
such a workaround is not required.

all of the following have been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria allocated to achieving progression through the respective HNG-
X Acceptance Gateway:

subject to paragraph 4.6, all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have
been achieved;

there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents, together with any related HNG-X Rectification Plans or
agreed workarounds, are agreed between the Parties as being
acceptable to progress through the HNG-X Acceptance Gateway; and

the number of outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incidents,
together with any related HNG-X Rectification Plans or agreed
workarounds, are agreed between the Parties as being acceptable to
progress through the HNG-X Acceptance Gateway.

4.6.5

If the Parties do not agree whether HNG-X Final Acceptance, HNG-X Stage
Progression or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 has
occurred, the matter will be resolved through the procedure described in
paragraph 7 for resolving HNG-X Acceptance Disputes.

If, following investigation by Fujitsu Services, an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is
found to have been caused solely by a fault or deficiency in anything other than
those elements of HNG-X provided by Fujitsu Services, it shall not count
towards the thresholds identified in paragraph 4.5.

HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the same failure or
deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function, may
be aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance Incident for the purposes of the
thresholds identified in paragraph 4.5.

The aggregation of two or more HNG-X Acceptance Incidents into a single
HNG-X Acceptance Incident shall be proposed by the Fujitsu HNG-X
Acceptance Manager and agreed by the Post Office HNG-X Acceptance
Manager, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

If, other than as a result of a Default of Fujitsu Services, it is impossible for a
test to be carried out when scheduled in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan then that
test becomes known as a "Deferred Test". Deferred Tests will be carried out as
soon as reasonably practicable or at such later time as the Parties may agree
(which shall be no later than six months after HNG-X Final Acceptance)
provided that performance on that agreed date does not, other than as a result
of a Default of Fujitsu Services, become impossible (in which event the Deferred
Test shall be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable).

The non-occurrence of a Deferred Test at the time originally scheduled in the
HNG-X Acceptance Plan will not prevent HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X
Final Acceptance or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2
each of which will be assessed on the basis of:

4.6.5.1 those tests scheduled to take place for that HNG-X Stage Progression,
HNG-X Final Acceptance or progression through HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways 1 and 2, as the case may be, which are not Deferred Tests;
and

4.6.5.2 those Deferred Tests which were originally scheduled to take place as
part of a previous HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X Final Acceptance
or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 and
which have been rescheduled in accordance with paragraph 4.6.4 to
take place for that HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X Final Acceptance
or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1, 2 or 5.

4.6.7 Where a test that was originally scheduled to be carried out by Fujitsu Services
in the Solution Test Stage becomes a Deferred Test in accordance with
paragraph 4.6.4, the failure of Fujitsu Services to carry out that Deferred Test in
accordance with paragraph 4.6.4 shall constitute a Default under the
Agreement.

4.6.8 Other than as set out in paragraph 4.6.6, nothing in paragraph 4.6 shall reduce
or alter any obligations of Fujitsu Services under this Agreement.

HANDLING HNG-X ACCEPTANCE TESTING EVIDENCE

Evidence (including, without limitation, test results, test observations, data or other
information) provided by Fujitsu Services for review in relation to fulfilment of HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria ("HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence") shall by default be
available to all Post Office employees and contractors unless such evidence is:

5.1.1. Confidential Information, in which case disclosure shall be governed by the
provisions of Clause 61 of the Agreement; or

5.1.2 considered to be or categorised as sensitive in accordance with paragraphs 5.2
or 5.3 of this Schedule, in which case disclosure will be governed by those
provisions (as applicable).

HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence that can reasonably be considered to be
particularly sensitive because access to such information could compromise the security
of the HNG-X or other Post Office Services will be restricted to named employees or
contractors of Post Office who will be nominated by Post Office to review it on Post
Office's behalf. Access to the information will be in accordance with such reasonable
conditions as may be imposed by Fujitsu Services.

Subject to paragraph 5.4, HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence categorised by Fujitsu
Services (acting reasonably) as particularly commercially sensitive to Fujitsu Services
will only be disclosed to named employees or contractors of Post Office (such named
individuals to be approved by Fujitsu Services). Post Office will place such named
employees and contractors under a duty to keep confidential and not disclose Fujitsu
Services’ commercially sensitive information to any other person or Party without Fujitsu
Services’ prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

Fujitsu Services will not be entitled to categorise any HNG-X Acceptance Testing
Evidence as commercially sensitive where that evidence solely reflects a visible
manifestation or result of the operation of the HNG-X System, as opposed to how the
HNG-X System achieves that manifestation or result.

5.5 Sensitive information disclosed as HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence pursuant to
paragraphs 5.3 or 5.4 may also be disclosed by Post Office or Fujitsu Services to the
HNG-X Acceptance Board if such disclosure is necessary for the resolution of an HNG-
X Acceptance Dispute.

5.6 At Post Office's request Fujitsu Services will supply supporting evidence for the
completion of a test that can reasonably be regarded as necessary for Post Office to
validate whether the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria for that test have been met.

6. MANAGING HNG-X ACCEPTANCE INCIDENTS

6.1 Raising HNG-X Acceptance Incidents

6.1.1

6.1.4

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident will be raised by Fujitsu Services when the
HNG-X Acceptance Method used fails to prove that the HNG-X Acceptance
Criterion has been met. In addition, Fujitsu Services will report to Post Office
any material undesirable occurrences, which are not HNG-X Acceptance
Incidents, observed by it whilst conducting tests.

Post Office may raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident whenever Post Office
becomes aware of evidence that (a) any of the occurrences referred to in
paragraph 6.1.1 have arisen (b) the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are not being
met or (c) the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X and/or the
Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X Acceptance
Process has resulted or might reasonably be expected to result in the existing
Horizon Applications or the Horizon Service Infrastructure no longer functioning
or being performed (as the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of
the Agreement.

Where the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue or Annex 2 of Schedule B6.1
expressly states that the application will not permit specified functions or
activities or cause certain specified behaviour, and those functions, activities or
behaviour are observed to occur during testing of the application, then the
observing Party will (in the case of Fujitsu Services) or may (in the case of Post
Office) raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident.

Following resolution of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident raised in accordance
with paragraph 6.1.1, 6.1.2 or 6.1.3, a further HNG-X Acceptance Incident can
be raised in accordance with paragraph 6.1.1 if the applicable functions,
activities or behaviour are observed to occur again.

Each Party will raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of such incident. However, HNG-X
Acceptance Incidents may not be raised in respect of any HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria before commencement of the testing or assessment of those HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria in accordance with the HNG-X Acceptance Plan. Once
HNG-X Final Acceptance has occurred no new HNG-X Acceptance Incidents

Schedule B6.3 Version 9.0

Page 17 of 25

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

may be raised. For the purposes of this paragraph a "new HNG-X Acceptance
Incident" means an HNG-X Acceptance Incident that occurs after the HNG-X
Final Acceptance Date or which occurs on or before that date, but is not
reported to Fujitsu Services before the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date. Once
HNG-X Initial Acceptance has occurred no additional HNG-X Acceptance
Incidents will be classified as HNG-X Acceptance Incidents in respect of HNG-X
Initial Acceptance.

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident manifests itself as one or more defects
originating from either the Test Automation Toolset or PEAK. Such defects will
be allocated to HNG-X Acceptance Incidents following review and agreement by
the HNG-X Acceptance Managers from both Parties.

A PEAK fault report that is allocated to the HNG-X Acceptance Incident
Collection can only be closed with the agreement of both HNG-X Acceptance
Managers.

If a dispute arises whereby the HNG-X Acceptance Managers cannot agree as
to the status of a defect associated with an HNG-X Acceptance Incident, the
matter will be escalated according to the procedure described in paragraph 7 for
resolving HNG-X Acceptance Disputes...

6.2 Analysing and Classifying HNG-X Acceptance Incidents

6.2.1

6.2.2

HNG-X Acceptance Incidents will be jointly analysed by Fujitsu Services and
Post Office and a written report produced which will record:

6.2.1.1 initially, the agreed (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by
either Party) severity classification of the HNG-X Acceptance Incident as
identified in Annex A to this Schedule; and subsequently

6.2.1.2 related rectification activities (if applicable); and
6.2.1.3 re-testing dates/periods (if applicable).

This information will be included in the test report issued at the time of
completing the HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage during which the HNG-X
Acceptance Incident was raised.

For the purpose of paragraph 6.2.1, an HNG-X Acceptance Incident will be
regarded as having been caused by the introduction of changes arising from
Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process:

6.2.2.1 if that incident is identified during any of the HNG-X Acceptance Process
Stages; and

Schedule B6.3 Version 9.0

Page 18 of 25

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

6.2.3

6.2.4

6.2.2.2 where the behaviour of Horizon giving rise to that incident (i) has not
been previously observed, or (ii) had been previously observed in
relation to the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the Horizon Application
but such behaviour had been resolved prior to commencement of
testing of HNG-X,

unless following investigation by Fujitsu Services, that incident is found to be
unrelated to the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X
and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X
Acceptance Process and Fujitsu Services has provided Post Office with
reasonable evidence to demonstrate this.

Where an HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be attributed to faults in HNG-X, the
severity of that incident (for the purposes of HNG-X Final Acceptance and HNG-
X Initial Acceptance) shall be classified with reference to the fault in HNG-X
alone.

Either Party may request that the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident be
re-classified in recognition of new evidence or if it is reasonably believed that
the impact of the HNG-X Acceptance Incident should be re-assessed.
Agreement to such requested re-classification shall not be unreasonably
withheld by either Party.

6.3 Repeat Acceptance Activities

6.3.1

6.3.2

Any failed test may, prior to the end of the agreed Live Monitoring be repeated
as many times as necessary in order for HNG-X Final Acceptance to be
achieved. Dates for such repeat tests will be agreed by the joint test teams
having regard to the overall HNG-X Programme Plan. Post Office will be
responsible for making personnel available to observe repeat testing if required.
Repeat tests will be proposed only when it is reasonably believed a different (i.e.
improved) outcome would result.

In the case of repeated HNG-X Document Reviews, HNG-X Design
Walkthroughs or HNG-X Monitoring, Post Office will be entitled to the same
elapsed time for the repeated activity as was scheduled for the original failed
activity. Repeat HNG-X Document Reviews or HNG-X Design Walkthroughs will
be proposed only when it is reasonably believed a different (i.e. improved)
outcome would result.

6.4 HNG-X Rectification Plan

6.4.1

For each HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incident outstanding on the
HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date or on the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date, Fujitsu
Services will have prepared a written HNG-X Rectification Plan that includes:

6.4.1.3 a timetable for rectification.

Post Office shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to any such HNG-X
Rectification Plan and neither Party shall unreasonably withhold its agreement
to any workaround referred to in this Schedule.

It is acknowledged by the Parties that exceptionally they may agree that such a
HNG-X Rectification Plan is not required for each outstanding HNG-X Medium
Severity Acceptance Incident.

For each HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incident outstanding on the HNG-X
Initial Acceptance Date or on the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date, Fujitsu
Services will identify a target timescale for rectification.

It is acknowledged by the Parties that they may agree that such a target
timescale for rectification is not required for each outstanding HNG-X Low
Severity Acceptance Incident.

7. HNG-X ACCEPTANCE DISPUTE PROCESS

Severity Description

High

ANNEX A: HNG-X ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY MATRIX

The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of
changes arising from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change
Activities that are subject to the HNG-X Acceptance Process and results
in a defect that would render a key element of one or more of the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or a key element of the
Infrastructure unfit for operational use, which could include:

a) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction
types;

b) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types
using the required business inputs or generating the required
business outcome;

c) creating system performance issues which are in, or are likely to
cause a, breach of Service Level Targets.

Medium

The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of
changes arising from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change
Activities that are subject to the HNG-X Acceptance Process and results
in a defect that would not prevent operation of one or more of the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or
more Transaction types.

Low

SCHEDULE C1
SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES AND REMEDIES
41. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Schedule sets out the Service Level principles and remedies that apply from the

2-1

2.2

2.3

commencement of the relevant Trigger Event as set out within the tables in Schedule
B3.1. Prior to the commencement of the relevant Trigger Event as set out within the
tables in Schedule B3.1, the provisions of Schedule B4.4 shall apply.

This Schedule defines up to three thresholds in respect of each Service Level as
follows:

1.2.1 the level of Service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from Fujitsu
Services by Post Office;

1.2.2 the level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give rise to
payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the “Liquidated Damage
Threshold” or “LDT"). Payment of liquidated damages notwithstanding, a
failure of any LDT shall not (on its own) constitute a Default; and

1.2.3 the level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which if not
achieved by Fujitsu Services shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu Services of
Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages as described (where
relevant) in this Schedule and each relevant Service Description (the
“Additional Remedy Level’ or “ARL”).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that not all SLT failures shall give rise to
payment of liquidated damages. The SLT failures that do not give rise to payment of
liquidated damages are set out in each relevant Service Description.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The purpose of remedies (liquidated damages or any other additional remedy specified
in a Service Description) is that Post Office shall not be disadvantaged by failures of
Fujitsu Services to provide the HNG-X Services to the agreed specification and
reliability.

For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages shall be based upon the applicable
fixed amounts or rates stated in the relevant Service Descriptions.

The performance of the HNG-X Services (other than the BCSF Service) against the
SLT, LDT and ARL applicable in respect of each Service Level shall be measured and
reported and success or failure against each shall be judged over Service Level
Measurement Periods defined for each HNG-X Service (other than the BCSF Service).
Additionally, all levels of service shall be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis and
any failure to meet a Service Level assessed over that month shall be reported to Post

Office by means of the Service Review Book produced on a monthly basis detailing all
Service Levels and the actual levels of service achieved during that month.

In respect of any SLT that has a Service Level Measurement Period equivalent to a SLT
Calendar Year or a Service Level Measurement Period that is otherwise defined with
reference to a SLT Calendar Year, in the event that the remainder of the term of the
Agreement after the last SLT Calendar Year of the term of the Agreement in relation to
that SLT (“Final Period”) is less than six (6) months then Fujitsu Services shall:

2.4.1. continue to measure and report performance against that SLT during the Final
Period; and

2.5.2 not be obliged to take any remedial action should that SLT fail to be achieved at
any time during the Final Period.

The values applicable to each SLT are set out in the relevant Service Description.

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in a Service Description in respect of a particular
Service Level, where Service Levels are expressed in terms of performance required by a
particular “Day”:

2.6.1 “Day A” means the day of the specified triggering event (such as the date of a
Transaction);

2.6.2 “Day B” means the day following Day A; and

2.6.3 “Day C” means the day following Day B and so on.

Liquidated Damages

2.7.1 The total cumulative sums payable by Fujitsu Services for liquidated damages
in respect of the Counter Availability SLT shall not exceed £2,000,000 (two
million pounds) in any Financial Year.

2.7.2 The liquidated damages payable by Fujitsu Services in respect of any Failure
Event in respect of the Counter Availability SLT shall not exceed £400,000 (four
hundred thousand pounds).

2.7.3 The aggregate limit on Fujitsu Services' liability referred to in Clause 44.4 shall
apply.

If the Parties agree to suspend any of the Services in accordance with the CCD
entitled "Service Level Target & Liquidated Damages Exclusions"
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0006), Fujitsu Services shall, for the period of such suspension, be
released from its obligation to comply with any Service Levels and/or LDTs to the
extent they relate to the suspended Service(s), save where the suspension is due to
Fujitsu Services Default.

define the SLTs, LDTs and ARLs.

Save as provided in paragraph 6.1 of Schedule C1 and section 3.6.1 of the CCD
entitled "Service Integration Service, Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0010), the
provisions of this Schedule C1 shall otherwise not apply to the Superstock Solution.

SERVICE LEVEL RELIEF - VOLUMETRIC LIMITS

Where appropriate each Service Description sets out the limits for an HNG-X Service
(the “Volumetric Limits”) which if exceeded over a specified period (the “Relevant
Period”) will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the measurements of performance in
respect of the Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) affected by
that excess (the “Affected Service Levels”). Such adjustment, where applicable, shall
be made on the basis set out in the relevant Service Description.

SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF - BUSINESS VOLUMES CCD

The CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033) (the “Business Volumes CCD”) defines various limits on numbers of
Transactions or instances of Service as “Contracted Volumes” or “Design Limits” for
Point of Sale Business Capability, In/Out Payment Business Capability, Cash and Stock
Management Business Capability, Message Broadcast Service, Reference Data
Management Service, Banking Business Capability, Payment Management Business
Capability and on-line Transactions.

On each day that any of the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes
CCD is exceeded, the measures of Fujitsu Services' performance for the Service Levels
(SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) listed in the Business Volumes CCD shall
be disregarded and replaced with an average measurement for that day (based upon
actual performance measurements over the previous three calendar months, or
otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)).

If the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded, Post
Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly consider the reasons for such excess and
whether it is temporary or is or is likely to be continuing. If such excess is or is likely to
be continuing Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to make a reasonable and proportionate
adjustment to the relevant Contracted Volume and/or the affected Service Levels or
obligations specified in the Business Volumes CCD, such adjustment to be agreed with
Post Office under the Change Control Procedure.

If any of the Design Limits specified in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded then
the measures of Fujitsu Services’ performance for any Service Level or other service
target involving data processing (requiring either automated or manual processing or
both) shall be disregarded to the extent that Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post
Office's satisfaction (Post Office acting reasonably) that failure to meet the Service
Level and/or service target, as the case may be, occurred as a result of a Design Limit

being exceeded. Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to meet those
Service Levels and/or service targets during the period when the measures of Fujitsu
Services’ performance are disregarded.

OTHER SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF

The Parties shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) appropriate
relief from Service Levels if any new facilities or products introduced, by agreement,
with less testing than would otherwise be required to safeguard Fujitsu Services’
position.

For the periods in which any of the Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities are
suspended in accordance with paragraph 2.8 of the CCD entitled “Service Management
Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007), measurements of Fujitsu Services’
performance in respect of all Service Levels detrimentally affected by such suspension
(in respect of those Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities) shall be disregarded
and Fujitsu Services shall be released from those of its obligations in respect of those
Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities which it is unable to perform as a result
of such suspension.

If Fujitsu Services fails to achieve any Service Level or service target (as the case may
be) and can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that such failure
occurred as a result of a fault or problem within the QAS Software, such fault or problem
requiring the Third Line Software Support Service or Application Support Service
(Fourth Line) in order to be resolved, then the measures of Fujitsu Services'
performance in respect of such Service Level and other service target shall be
disregarded for the period affected by the QAS Software fault or problem.

RECTIFICATION PLAN

In the event that an ARL specified in the relevant Service Description is failed, Fujitsu
Services and Post Office shall agree a method of rectification and timetable for the
resolution of the cause of that failure (a “Rectification Plan”). For the avoidance of
doubt, Fujitsu Services shall remain liable for financial remedies payable in accordance
with the Service Description in respect of that failure.

In the event that the Rectification Plan involves a change to the provision of the
Services, such change shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure and shall
be made at no charge to Post Office.

Without prejudice to Post Office's rights to remedies provided in this Agreement, during
the period the Rectification Plan is being implemented Fujitsu Services shall maintain
performance of all other Services in accordance with the Service Levels specified in
each relevant Service Description unless otherwise agreed with Post Office as part of
the Rectification Plan.

In the event that the Rectification Plan is not agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)
within three (3) calendar months of the occurrence of an ARL failure or the Rectification

Plan fails to resolve the cause of the ARL failure to which it relates, such that the ARL
failure occurs again and is persistent, the following provisions shall apply:

7.41

Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and require Fujitsu Services to co-
operate and assist with (including by Fujitsu Services providing such information
as it would have been required to under paragraph 6.6 of Schedule D6), a
tender process for sub-contracting by Fujitsu Services of the Operational
Services in relation to which the ARL failure has occurred (and where the ARL
failure has occurred in relation to an Operational Service which, together with
one or more other Operational Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such
Operational Services will be tendered together) to an alternative service
provider at Fujitsu Services’ cost (the “Service Provider’). If the Parties agree
that it would be more appropriate for Fujitsu Services to conduct, and Post
Office to co-operate with, the tender process, then the Parties shall procure the
same.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services shall
disclose to any bona fide potential Service Provider (subject to the same
executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement
mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such bona fide potential
Service Provider) Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is
reasonably required to enable any potential Service Provider to prepare a
reasonably detailed tender proposal.

If the outcome of any tender process is that Fujitsu Services were to sub-
contract the Operational Services in question (and where the ARL failure has
occurred in relation to an Operational Service which, together with one or more
other Operational Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such Operational
Services will be tendered together) to a Service Provider identified in the tender
process, the performance in respect of the failed ARL for that Operational
Service (and where the ARL failure has occurred in relation to an Operational
Service which, together with one or more other Operational Services,
constitutes a Testable Service, such Operational Services will be tendered
together) would be improved then Post Office shall have the right to require
Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such Operational Service (and where the ARL
failure has occurred in relation to an Operational Service which, together with
one or more other Operational Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such
Operational Services will be tendered together) to such Service Provider at no
higher cost to Post Office than was previously the case.

SCHEDULE D1
CHARGES
1 GENERAL
1.1 All amounts set out in this Schedule are before adjustment for RPI as set out in

paragraph 16 and exclusive of VAT.

All annual Charges set out in this Schedule D1, unless otherwise stated, relate to
Financial Years. All monthly Charges relate to calendar months. All Charges shall,
unless stated otherwise, become due for payment on a monthly basis in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule D2.

Where during the term of this Agreement any charge under this Schedule D1 is
amended by approved CCN the Parties shall set out in the table contained in Annex E to
this Schedule D1 the number of the approved CCN, the amount of the variation and the

date on which the revised charge becomes effective.

In consideration for the provision by Fujitsu Services of the relevant Services, Post
Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services the following:

1.4.1. Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 2 as varied in accordance
with paragraphs 4 and 5;

1.4.2 additional Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 6;

1.4.3 Call Off Charges in accordance with paragraph 7;

1.4.4 Charges for Service Integration Services in accordance with paragraph 8;
1.4.5 Third Party Management Service Charges in accordance with paragraph 9;
1.4.6 Development Charges in accordance with paragraph 10;

1.4.7 SIP Charges in accordance with paragraph 11;

1.4.8 Transfer Charges in accordance with paragraph 12;

1.4.9 Capacity Addition Costs in accordance with paragraph 13;

1.4.10 PIN Pad Procurement Charges in accordance with paragraph 14;

1.4.11 Charges for Hardware in accordance with paragraph 15;

1.4.12 the Gain Share payments set out in Annex G; and

The Charges have been based on an assumption that the numbers of Branches,

Counter Positions, Old Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations,
CTOs and New CTO Configurations in each Financial Year will not exceed the numbers

Schedule D1 Version 9.0
Page 3 of 68

FUJ00000069

Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

corresponding to that Financial Year as set out in the Table entitled “Branch and Counter
Position Limits” in Part 1 of Annex A. Should this assumption not be satisfied, as
evidenced by:

1.5.1 Post Office providing a forecast of numbers of Branches, Counter Positions, Old
Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations, CTOs or New
CTO Configurations which exceed the limits set out in that Table for that
Financial Year; or

1.5.2 the actual number of Branches, Counter Positions or CTOs exceeding the
applicable limits in any three consecutive months,

the Parties shall agree changes to the Charges or Service Descriptions under the
Change Control Procedure to deal with additional equipment required by Fujitsu
Services to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the lack of availability of
such equipment for spares, maintenance or Operational Business Change purposes.

Services which cause or would cause the limits in the Table in Part 2 of Annex A to be
exceeded or the conditions specified in that Table not to be satisfied shall be subject to
the Change Control Procedure.

In this Schedule D1, unless stated otherwise, any reference to a paragraph or Annex is
to the relevant paragraph of, or annex to, this Schedule D1.

Without prejudice to any Charges which shall have become due to be paid by Post
Office to Fujitsu Services, and subject to paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3, if any Terminable
Service is subject to Partial Termination, the Operational Charges in respect of each
Service comprised within that Terminable Service shall not be payable in respect of the
period after the date of such Partial Termination.

For the purposes of this Schedule D1, from approval by Post Office of a part 2 Exit
Plan for a particular Operational Service, "Counter Positions" shall mean those
Counter Positions that are supported by Fujitsu Services and "Branches" means those
Branches that are supported by Fujitsu Services with respect to that Operational
Service. For the avoidance of doubt, once a particular Operational Service, Counter
Positions or Branches is/are supported by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and
not Fujitsu Services) it/they shall cease to be “Counter Positions” or “Branches” for
such Operational Service for the purposes of this Schedule D1.

Example

Day 1 - Fujitsu supports the same 100 Counter Positions in respect of both the Engineering
Service and the Service Desk Service.

Day 2 - There is a ramp down of the Engineering Service and 50 Counter Positions become

supported by a Next Supplier while the remaining 50 Counter Positions are still supported by
Fujitsu. There is no change in respect of the Service Desk Service.

From Day 2, the number of Counter Positions for calculating the variable charge for the
Engineering Service would be 50 but it would still be 100 for the Service Desk Service.

the usage for that month and multiplied by the Bank of England rate at which
Fujitsu translates this Euro value to Sterling (GBP).

The Operational Fixed Charges are based on a maximum of 400 users, and 15 calls per
month. If the total number of users or calls exceeds the maximum number the Parties
shall assess the impact upon fixed charges through the Change Control Procedure.

The variable charges for the service are from the Fujitsu Global Cloud Platform and are

https://globalcloud.de.fujitsu.com/portala/ctri/UsePrice. Fujitsu shall provide these rates
to Post Office in writing each time they are updated. For the avoidance of doubt these

MARGIN PROTECTION

If in any of the Financial Years 2008/9 to 2011/12 (inclusive) the aggregate amount of all
the Operational Charges calculated in respect of that Financial Year by reference to a
Margin Rate (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt and for the purposes of this
paragraph, any "Late Cost to Post Office" applicable in respect of such Margin Rates in
accordance with paragraph 4.2.3) (plus the margin calculated in respect of that
Financial Year in accordance with paragraph 2.9.2(b)(i)) shall be less than the Protected
Margin for that Financial Year, then Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an amount
equal to the difference.

The amount paid by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 3.1 in respect of any
Financial Year shall be available to Post Office as a credit to be applied against the
margin on any new Services agreed under the Change Control Procedure which Post
Office obtains from Fujitsu Services in that Financial Year, provided such new Service is
provided for longer than twelve months.

Any credit available to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be made available
monthly throughout the Financial Year in question based on estimates made on a year
to date basis in respect of each month. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
end of each such Financial Year the actual amount available by way of credit during that
Financial Year shall be calculated. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the
Financial Year as so calculated is greater than the aggregate of the monthly credits
actually made available to Post Office during that Financial Year the difference shall be
made available to the Post Office as an additional credit on the basis set out in
paragraph 3.2. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the Financial Year as so
calculated is less than the aggregate of the monthly credits actually utilised by Post
Office during that Financial Year then the Post Office shall repay to Fujitsu Services an
amount equal to that shortfall.

In settlement of the incorrect calculation and invoicing by Fujitsu Services of margin
protection payments during the period April 2008 up to and including August 2009, the
parties have agreed that Fujitsu shall pay back to Post Office the sum of £339,396
erroneously paid out by Post Office during such period in margin protection payments.
£300,000 of such sum shall be repaid upon signature by the parties of the POLSAP.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such repayment by Fujitsu
shall not operate so as to reduce the aggregate amount of Operational Charges paid by
Post Office in the relevant Financial Year and so triggering margin protection payments
by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.1 above.

With effect from September 2009, without prejudice to its other obligations in relation to
margin protection, Fujitsu Services shall apply correctly the margin calculation at
paragraph 2.9.2 (b) (ii) above.

VARIATION OF OPERATIONAL CHARGES - TRIGGER POINTS

Assumptions have been made by the Parties about the timing of certain events set out
in the Trigger Point Table (referred to as "Trigger Points") in settling the amounts of the
Operational Charges.

For the avoidance of doubt, the planned dates in the Trigger Point Table shall not be
changed to reflect any changes that might be made to the HNG-X Programme Plan and
no adjustment shall be made to the Operational Charges in relation to Trigger Points
other than pursuant to paragraphs 4.2.3 or 4.2.4, unless the Parties agree otherwise
under the Change Control Procedure.

The principles that shall apply for adjustment to the Operational Fixed Charges and
Operational Unit Charges when Trigger Points occur early or late are as follows:

4.2.1 Not Used

4.2.2 In the event that Project HNG-X is terminated either pursuant to (i) Clause 47.15
(but only as a consequence of the Agreement terminating pursuant to Clause
47.4 or 47.7) or (ii) Clause 47.11.2, then the dates stated in the Trigger Point
Table for such of the Trigger Points that are planned to occur after HNG-X Initial
Acceptance (being, for the avoidance of doubt, Trigger Point T6 (Counter
Application Roll Out Complete) only) shall be put back (for the purposes of this
paragraph 4 only) to the date of the expiry or earlier termination of the
Agreement, provided that in each case such termination of Project HNG-X
occurred prior to HNG-X Initial Acceptance.

4.2.3 The Operational Fixed Charges and/or Operational Unit Charges (as specified
in the final column of the Trigger Point Table) for the Operational Services
corresponding to the Trigger Points (if any) adjusted in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.2 shall each be increased in each complete calendar month in
the period by which such Trigger Points are put back, by the amount of the "Late
Cost to Post Office" (if any) specified in the Trigger Point Table.

If any of the Trigger Points are delayed beyond the planned dates specified in
the Trigger Point Table, then to the extent that the delay was:

(a) caused by a Default or delay of Post Office or any of its employees,

the Operational Unit Charge per Counter Position and Margin Rate per Counter
Position (if any) applicable in respect of the Engineering Service for each month
following such re-allocation of Hardware taking effect shall be varied in
accordance with the Table set out in Annex F to the extent of the Proportion
Change (expressed in percentage terms) in each category of Priorities;

the Proportion Change (expressed in percentage terms) in each category of
Priorities shall be rounded to the nearest one decimal place in determining the
extent of a variation to an Operational Unit Charge or Margin Rate; and

variations to the Operational Unit Charges and the Margin Rates pursuant to
paragraph 5.1.1 in each Financial Year shall be documented in the Operational
Charges Table under the Change Control Procedure and with effect from the

Always subject to Post Office fulfilling the criteria and complying with its obligations as
stipulated in the CCD SVM/SDM/SD/002 Engineering Service, Post Office will be
entitled to £20.96 discount per incident closed via the Bar Code Reader self fix option —
this amount is subject to RPI each Financial year. The discount will be calculated
monthly in arrears and the agreed amount applied as a credit against the Operational
Charges in the following month (or via a cheque where the monthly Operational
Charges are insufficient or are no longer due). Such discount has been agreed between
the Parties in-line with the provisions of Paragraph 5.3 of Schedule D3 (Gain Share).

Operational Business Change (Branch Change) Service

The Operational Fixed Charge in the Operational Charges Table for the Operational
Business Change (Branch Change) Service is for a pre-paid level of Operational
Business Change. The amounts paid by way of such Operational Fixed Charge shall be
deducted from any amounts payable by Post Office for Operational Business Change
under paragraph 7.1. Any amount by which the Operational Fixed Charge in any month
is greater than the charge payable under paragraph 7.1 shall not be carried forward.

Data Centre Operations Service

If the number of SAP Basis Calls per month exceeds 200 in any three months within a
six month period providing that the SAP Basis Calls are not due to a fault in the
POLSAP Central Infrastructure or POLSAP Software that is attributable solely to Fujitsu
Services’ actions and Fujitsu Services demonstrates to the satisfaction of Post Office
(acting reasonably) that it will as a result thereafter require additional resource to
manage SAP Basis Calls above 200 per month, the Parties shall agree under the
Change Control Procedure (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld)
adjustments to:

5.3.1 the Operational Fixed Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service and the
number of SAP Basis Calls included within that Charge, as necessary to reflect
such additional resource requirement; and

5.3.2 the Charge per SAP Basis Call and threshold from which that Charge applies,
as set out in paragraph 6.1.

The parties agree that the relevant monthly Operational Charges may be varied (up or
down) to reflect the difference between the assumed salary costs of the five persons
anticipated to be transferring to Fujitsu Services from CSC Steria at the date of
CCN1270 (and which is agreed to be £8,627.60 gross a month) (the "ASC Figure") and
the actual salary costs of the individuals as at the point of transfer. Such variation to be
limited to 10% of the ASC Figure (either way). No further increase or decrease in the
relevant monthly Operating Charges shall be payable in respect of such persons.

XP Support

The Operational Fixed Charge for the Systems Management Service is based on the
assumption that XP will be supported by Microsoft until expiry of this Agreement. If this

If Post Office exercises its option under the CCD entitled “Service Description for the
Security Management Service” (CS/SER/016), when that CCD is in effect, or the CCD
entitled "Security Management Service: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0017),
when that CCD is in effect, to vary the maximum number of Audit Record Queries which
Fujitsu Services is required to carry out, the Operational Fixed Charge in respect of the
Security Management Service shall, with effect from the date on which that revised
maximum becomes effective, be increased by £213.41 per Audit Record Query by
which such maximum is increased.

Reference Data Processes

For every month after the Amendment Date during which the Reference Data processes
have not been improved by Post Office (or its agents or subcontractors) performing the
work necessary to achieve the following aims:

5.6.1 reduce errors and rework by streamlining the end-to-end Reference Data
processes and simplifying/rationalising the business rules around different
Reference Data types and their sources/validation;

5.6.2 introduce a generic model of product data to minimise the number of product
types, eliminate “special” product features and increase use of "soft" reference
data methods in lieu of "hard" application coding; and

5.6.3 apply Reference Data consistently across all elements of end-to-end solution.

Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an addition to the Operational Fixed Charge for
the Reference Data Management Service due in respect of that month. In Financial
Year 2011/12 the additional monthly charge (if applicable) shall be £20,637, In respect
of each subsequent month, the charge shall be £21,627 where applicable. From 1%
September 2013 no such charges shall apply.

Services introduced by CCN

Post Office may terminate the Services introduced by (i) CCN641a and (ii) CCN807 and
CCN1163 (as listed in the CCN Service List), by raising a CCN to terminate such
Service, subject to Fujitsu Services being entitled to reimbursement by Post Office of its
reasonable costs incurred in the termination of such Service by raising an invoice in
accordance with Schedule D2 in respect of such costs as they arise. If such Services
are so terminated, an amount per month equal to the monthly charge value for each
such Service (as set out in column three of the CCN Service List for the CCN
introducing the Service in question) shall be deducted from the Operational Fixed
Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service.

5.9 If following notice given by Post Office and development of an alternative approach in
accordance with row A4 in Table 2 of Annex 1 to Schedule B5 any of the Client systems
referred to in paragraph 5.8 shall not have been migrated to the EDG by the date of
completion of HNG-X Project Workstream X2 (Migrate Data Centre to HNG-X

managed by the Commercial Leads.

BFPO Branches.

5.11. For the avoidance of doubt all variable Operational charges as listed in Annex B
Schedule D1 will be applied to BFPO Branches.

5.12 Impact of termination or expiry of the Service Desk Service on the Engineering Service:

5.12.1 At the date of CCN1400, it was acknowledged that the termination of the Service Desk
Service may have an impact on the volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches.
To this end, it is agreed that the Engineering Service shall be subject to Branch visit
volume baselines to be agreed between the parties (the “Expected Engineering
Volumes”) calculated by reference to the Engineering Reference Period in accordance
with the process set out below. This baseline shall be set out in a formal exchange of
letters.

5.12.2 With respect to the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall record the volume of
Engineering Service visits to Branch and shall provide to Post Office data relating to
engineering visits in the Engineering Reference Period. The "Engineering Reference
Period” will be the later of either:

a) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to commencement of
rampdown of the Service Desk Service; or
b) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to notification of termination of

the Service Desk,

5.12.3 The Engineering Reference Period will be used to generate a forecast of expected
volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches for the period where Fujitsu Services
is providing the Engineering Service but the service desk is provided by a Next Supplier
(i.e. after the Service Desk Service has been terminated) so as to enable the parties to
agree the “Expected Engineering Volumes”.

5.12.4 In order to determine the Expected Engineering Volumes:

CONFIDENTIAL

a) Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly normalise the volume of visit data
measured during the Engineering Reference Period to take account of

i) particular circumstances occurring at any point in the Engineering
Reference Period;

ii) any peak periods included in the Engineering Reference Period,
whereby downward adjustments shall be made based on a reversal of
the uplifts (adjusted for any particular circumstances at that time)
experienced for each month in the same peak period in the prior year.

b) Normalisation will only be applied to significant programmes that have
materially impacted the Expected Engineering Volumes. Historic examples of
where this has been the case are the introduction of new media to Epson
printers which generated circa1000 additional engineering visits per month and
the programme rollout of new PIN Pads that generated circa 400 additional
engineering visits per month.

c) An 8% variance will be applied to the agreed volumes to generate upper (108%)
& lower (92%) threshold for each month.

d) With respect to months October to December (inclusive), an additional “peak
uplift” shall be applied to the Expected Engineering Volumes. The increased
percentage shall be applied for these months to take account of the expected
greater volumes of Engineering visits to Branches. The peak uplift in 2012 was
as follows :-

i) October +10.0%
ii) November +19.7%
iii) December +12.7%

For the avoidance of doubt, months January to September (inclusive) will be considered
normal (non peak) months for the purpose of this calculation (and shall therefore only
be subject to the variance highlighted in paragraph c) above.

5.12.5 The agreed volumes together with the upper and lower thresholds and peak uplift
determined in accordance with paragraph 5.12.4 above shall form the Expected
Engineering Volumes. In addition, the Expected Engineering Volumes shall be linked to
the estate volume of 29,600 counters (or as per the average number of counters during
the Engineering Reference Period). If the actual estate size varies materially (+/- 1%)
between the volume agreed by reference to the Engineering Reference Period and the
period associated with the actual engineering visits measurement, an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the Expected Engineering Volumes.

5.12.6 At the end of each 3 month period following termination of the Service Desk Service, the
parties shall total the actual Engineering Service visits to Branches, this sum being,
subject to paragraph 5.12.10 below the “Actual Engineering Visits”

5.12.7 Should Actual Engineering Visits be greater than the upper threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that 3 month period, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services a
sum equivalent to credits as detailed in paragraph 5.12.9 below for each Engineering
visit to a Branch above the upper threshold.

Schedule D1 Version 9.0
Page 15 of 68
CONFIDENTIAL

5.12.8

5.12.9

Should Actual Engineering Visits be lower than the lower threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that month , Fujitsu Services will credit Post Office as detailed
in paragraph 5.12.9 for each Engineering visit to a Branch below the lower threshold.

For each additional visit over and above the Upper Threshold (108%) for the 3 month
period, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge £125 per visit. In the event that the
number of visits made in that 3 month period is below the Lower Threshold (92%),
Fujitsu Services shall give a credit to the Post Office of £100 per visit. Additional
charges and credits shall be applied to the operational charge invoice and Fujitsu
Services shall provide supporting information.

5.12.10 For the avoidance of doubt, Actual Engineering Visits shall be based on:

a) the number of incidents passed from the Next Supplier of the replacement
Service Desk to the Engineering Service; and
b) the proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu Services (i.e. Bad blocks on Hard Disc

drives), but in this latter category these shall be limited to no more than 100
visits per month. If the actual volume of proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu
Services is greater than 100, only 100 will be counted in the actual Engineering
Service visits to Branches volumes for that month.

The following will be excluded from the measure of actual Engineering Service visits to

Branches:
i) any agreed user self-fix incidents that do not require an engineer to attend the
Branch, provided the Service Desk identifies them, and does not pass them to
Fujitsu Services’ engineering queue;
ii) any repeat visits to Branches with respect to the same recorded incident; and/or
iii) any engineering visits due to issues, or incidents arising from unexpected failure

across the branch network of a hardware component due to age that exceeds a
50% degradation in the MTBF rates (such rates determined by reference to the
MTBF rates occurring immediately prior to termination of the Service Desk
Service), save where such degradation in the MTBF rate can be directly
attributed to circumstances linked to a change introduced at the request of Post
Office whereupon such additional failures (over and above the MTBF rate +
50% degradation) shall be included in the calculations.

5.12.11 From the date that the Expected Engineering Volume becomes effective the charges to

6.1

Post Office in respect of MTBF excess visits shall cease to apply.

ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHARGES

Additional Charges in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service

Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services, in respect of the period (if any) between 31
March 2010 and the earlier of termination or expiry of this Agreement an amount equal
to:

6.2.1 the costs incurred by Fujitsu Services in respect of hardware and/or software
maintenance and support additional to those allowed for in the Charges plus
margin thereon, calculated together by multiplying such costs by 100 divided by
78; and

6.2.2 the costs incurred by Fujitsu Services in respect of additional hardware,
software or other equipment required in the Data Centres plus margin thereon,
calculated together by multiplying such costs by 100 divided by 95,

in each case where such maintenance, support, hardware, software or equipment is
necessary in Fujitsu Services' reasonable opinion for the provision of Services in
accordance with this Agreement. All such costs shall be subject to Open Book
verification (which, in the case of paragraph 6.2.1, shall be by reference to HNG-X
Baseline Open Book Information), and shall be invoiced by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with Schedule D2 after such verification has been undertaken.

The total number of GSM Connections available is limited in accordance with the CCD
entitled “Branch Network Resilience Service Description” (CS/SER/031). The number of
new GSM Connections that can be made in a rolling four week period shall not exceed
an amount (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to 92 multiplied by the Non-
Router Proportion, with the weekly target of new GSM Connections being an amount
equal to 23 multiplied by the Non-Router Proportion. In the event that an engineer is
despatched to establish a GSM Connection as described in the CCD entitled “Branch
Network Resilience Service Description” (CS/SER/031) and is denied access to the
Branch through no fault of Fujitsu Services, that attempted visit shall count (as a GSM
Connection) towards the limit for the four week period in question. For the purposes of
these limits the four week periods shall commence on the Working Day following the
completion of the BNR pilot.

Where Fujitsu Services would have been obliged to arrange and undertake a Recovery
Visit (as defined in paragraph 3.1.2.2 of the CCD entitled “Engineering Service: Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0002)) and as a result of a GSM Connection having been
established such Recovery Visit is not necessary, Post Office shall be entitled to a credit
of £75.25 against the Charges set out in paragraph 6.3 for the month in which the
Recovery Visit would have taken place.

Core Team and Standing Team are retained on the contract full time for an extended
period for development work other than POLSAP or SIP (which already attract
discounts), the following discounts shall apply retrospectively to the date of CCN1271c
or the date they commenced the development work, whichever is the later.

Discounts shall be calculated for all the Inner Core Team, Outer Core Team and
Standing Team personnel and the discount calculations for each year shall be presented
to the Demand Planning Board each March for agreement.

For the Inner Core Team only, in recognition of the commitment of the team through to
the end of the Agreement, the anticipated final discount level shall be refunded annually.
In the event that eligibility for the Inner Core final discount ceases, then Post Office shall
repay all sums previously refunded by Fujitsu Services against that discount at the end
of the year at the time the other discounts are reconciled.

Payments of the agreed discount sum to Post Office shall be made on the April monthly
invoice each year as a credit (or via a cheque where the monthly operational charges
are insufficient or are no longer due). Discounts are only applied against standard UK
rates; there is no discount on Near Shore or Offshore rates. Where a post is
discontinued, or personnel replaced, at Post Office’s request (except where personnel
are replaced under paragraph 3c of Annex 3 to Schedule A2), the eligibility for discount
will be frozen at the point of leaving the post or its discontinuance. If personnel are
absent temporarily for personal, sickness or Fujitsu Services requested reasons, the
eligibility for discounts shall not be affected by the absence.

Card rate. Subject to Clauses 10.4B.2 and 10.4B.3, a discount of 18% of
the total amount charged for the Inner Core Team shall be calculated on a
monthly basis and applied as a credit to the Operational Charge.

In the event that Post Office removes a full time post from the Inner Core
Team, the following will apply:

(a) As set out in paragraph 12 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2, where Post
Office removes any or all full time posts from the Inner Core Team by
notice in writing, on or prior to 30th September 2014, there shall be no
additional charge.

(b) I Where Post Office removes a full time post from the Inner Core Team
after 30" September 2014 but prior to 1 October 2016, Post Office
shall pay to Fujitsu Services a sum equivalent to the 18% discount
applied in respect of such full time post in a six month period. This
amount shall be invoiced by Fujitsu Services as a one off additional
charge for the month in which the full time post is removed from the
Inner Core team.

(c) I Where Post Office removes a full time post from the Inner Core Team
on or after 1 October 2016, Post Office shall repay to Fujitsu Services
an amount equal to the 18% discount that would have been applied in
the period from the date of such removal until 31° March 2017 only
(e.g. if 3 months remains to 31°' March 2017, then Post Office shall
only be required to repay 3 months discount). This amount shall be
invoiced by Fujitsu Services as a one off additional charge for the
month in which the full time post is removed from the Inner Core team.

In the event that Post Office provides notice to increase the Inner Core Team
in accordance with paragraph 11.3 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2 after 31%
March 2015, the 18% discount shall only apply 3 full months after the
resource is added to the Inner Core Team. For the avoidance of doubt, this
paragraph 10.4.3B shall not apply if Post Office provides notice to increase
the Inner Core Team in accordance with paragraph 11.3 of Annex 3 to
Schedule A2 on or before 31° March 2015.

Paragraphs 10.4B.1, 10.4B.2 and 10.4B.3 above will not apply in the event
that the Inner Core Team is terminated by Post Office in accordance with
paragraph 12 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2.

The default pre-committed monthly Charge for the Outer Core team shall be

Post Office shall confirm its committed monthly spend and the mix of skills in
this team 3 months in advance of the month to which it wishes to apply the
discount. In order to qualify for the discount, the Post Office shall provide its
projected spend for 1° April 2015 to 30" June 2015 on or before 31°‘ December
2014.

Fujitsu Services shall apply the discount applicable to the committed monthly
spend in each monthly invoice.

Save with respect to the period April 2015 to June 2015 (inclusive) should Post
Office fail to commit to a monthly spend 3 months in advance or separately fails
to meet monthly committed level of spend they will lose the discount for that
and the previous 2 months. In the event that Post Office fails to meet its
monthly committed level of spend in April 2015, May 2015 or June 2015, it shall
only lose the discount for that month. In both cases, this shall be invoiced by
Fujitsu Services as a one off additional charge for the month in which the
committed monthly spend is not achieved.

Post Office shall receive an additional 1% discount to the Rate Card for each
additional 6 month period that Post Office, in advance, makes a committed
monthly spend. For example, if Post Office were to commit to spend £500,000
per month from 1* April 2015 to 31% March 2017 it would be entitled to a
discount of 9% on the rates set out in the Rate Card. In order to receive this
discount, Post Office must give the commitment at least 3 months prior to the
first day of the committed period. So, for example, in order to receive the total
discount for 2 years commitment Post Office shall be required to make this
commitment by 31° December 2014.

There are no individual resource rate card reductions in addition to this
mechanism.

10.5 The Development Charges shall be due for payment monthly in arrears.

10.6 The Charges calculated in accordance with paragraph 10.4 in respect of work
undertaken for that day by each:

10.6.1 Consultant, shall not exceed £1,105.17 in total per day;

10.6.2 Senior Consultant Manager or Exit Manager, shall not exceed £1,236.53 in total

per day; and

10.6.3. Senior Manager, Principal Specialist or Transition Director shall not exceed

£1,452.18 in total per day.

10.7 Fujitsu Services will be entitled to be reimbursed by the Post Office for all reasonable
expenses incurred by it in providing Development Services, including (without limitation)

travel and subsistence expenses. Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office in advance of

any unusual anticipated expenses, such as international travel.

SIP CHARGES

Unless otherwise agreed, if in any Financial Year Fujitsu Services provides members of
the SIP Team pursuant to Schedule B1.2, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for such
provision on a time-cost basis, being rates equal to the cost to Fujitsu Services (on a
break-even basis) of employing the relevant individuals, taking into account for the

grade encompasses more than one professional community grade within Fujitsu
Services’ organisational structure. Such cost shall be certified by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with paragraph 1.5 of Schedule D4.

During the Financial Year 2006/7 the charges for each grade of Fujitsu Services staff in

The rate per working day for the relevant grade of committed resource in the table
above shall apply in respect of each Fujitsu Services SIP Team Member of that grade
where Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services by 30 September 2006 that it will commit to
utilising the specified role in which an individual of that grade is engaged for at least 100
days of the remainder of Financial Year 2006/7. If by the end of Financial Year 2006/7
Post Office has not utilised that specified role for 100 days or more, the charges for the
individual performing that role shall be recalculated using the applicable rate for non-
committed resource and Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal to
the difference.

The Charges for resources for the SIP shall become due for payment monthly in arrear.

The rates for each grade set out in the table in paragraph 11.2 shall be varied in each
subsequent Financial Year to reflect the costs to Fujitsu Services referred to in
paragraph 11.1 (the component elements of which costs are as set out in the table
“Breakdown of Day Rate Calculation - Example Grades” referred to in paragraph 2 of
the CCD entitled “HNG-X Baseline Open Book Information” (COM/MGT/PRO/0002)) for
that Financial Year as applicable in respect of each such grade, taking into account any
averaging required where that grade encompasses more than one professional
community grade within Fujitsu Services organisational structure. For the purposes of
the rates for each grade of committed resource in the table in paragraph 11.2, such
variation shall be on the basis that Post Office commits at the beginning of the Financial
Year to utilising that grade of resource for 204 days in that Financial Year. Paragraph
11.4 shall apply in respect of each Financial Year after 2006/7 with the necessary
changes deemed to be made to it to reflect such 204 day commitment applying from the
beginning of the Financial Year rather than the 100 days referred to applying from
September 2006.

In each case where a Fujitsu Services SIP Team Member is unable to perform a
specified role due to illness, injury or any other reason outside Post Office's control, the
number of days for which he is unable to perform that role shall be deemed to be
included within a period of utilisation of that role for the purposes of determining whether
Post Office has not utilised a specified role.

CHARGES FOR TRANSFER SERVICES

Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for all Transfer Services provided in the event of
Partial Termination, termination of Project HNG-X, termination of the Agreement or
expiry of the Agreement on a time-cost basis according to the rates set out in the Table

10.5.

If Transfer Services are provided prior to 31 March 2010, any unused balance at the end
of each month of the pre-payment referred to in paragraph 10.3 may, at Post Office's
option, be offset as a credit against the Charges due that month for such Transfer
Services in accordance with paragraph 12.1.

CAPACITY ADDITIONS

The capacity planning and performance and volume monitoring carried out as part of
the Service Management Service may from time to time identify that forecast volumes of
Post Office business are likely to exceed those allowed for and the consequent need to
add capacity to an element of Infrastructure (Branch equipment, communications
network or Data Centre) so as to maintain Fujitsu Services’ capability to achieve Service
Levels.

Such additions will be supported by analysis carried out in accordance with the CCD
entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033) and be
subject to the Change Control Procedure.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to recover from Post Office its reasonably incurred,
increased direct costs and expenses of performing its obligations under this Agreement
to the extent that such increased direct costs and expenses were the result of a Design
Limit being exceeded. Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate
the amounts payable in accordance with this paragraph and shall provide an Open Book
statement of such increased direct costs and expenses incurred for approval by Post
Office, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

Other enhancements to the Infrastructure may be required from time to time in
accordance with the Work Ordering Procedure or Change Control Procedure, as
applicable. Unless otherwise agreed, the pricing principles are as follows:

13.4.1 Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to Charge for the work undertaken by it in
relation to such enhancements on the time and materials basis set out under the
heading "Development Resources" in paragraph 10.4 (but subject to paragraph
10.6).

13.4.2 If a fixed price basis is to be used in relation to such work, such fixed price will
be assessed and agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu Services in advance
on an Open Book basis. In arriving at such fixed price, Fujitsu Services shall be

entitled to include a level of contingency above Fujitsu Service Cost.

13.4.3 As an alternative to the charging mechanisms described in this paragraph, Gain
Share may be considered in accordance with the principles of Schedule D3.

PIN PADS AND PAYPOLE PROCUREMENT
Additional Paypoles
Post Office shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of Paypoles.

Post Office may, on giving Fujitsu Services at least 100 days' prior written notice, require

notice and shall use reasonable endeavours to do so within that 100 day notice period.

Fujitsu Services’ Charge for procuring each additional Paypole (including box for
delivery) shall be £57.51 and shall become due for payment upon delivery of such
Paypole. This Charge is subject to the proviso that each notice for additional Paypoles
given by Post Office under paragraph 14.2 is for no more than 1000 Paypoles.

Additional PIN Pads and PIN Pad OBC Stock

In the event that the PIN Pad OBC Stock is reduced to 100 PIN Pad Units or less,
Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office of such in writing or by email.

Post Office shall within five Working Days of receipt of such notification from Fujitsu
Services confirm to Fujitsu Services in writing or by email (a "PIN Pad OBC Stock
Notice") whether or not it requires Fujitsu Services to increase the PIN Pad OBC Stock.

Where Fujitsu Services receives a PIN Pad OBC Stock Notice stating that the PIN Pad
OBC Stock should not be increased, Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of its obligations
to supply and install PIN PADs set out in either of the CCDs entitled "Fujitsu
Services/Post Office Ltd Operational Business Change - Branch Interface Agreement"
(CS/IFS/003) or "Operational Business Change (Branch Change) Service: Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0014) to the extent that it does not have the necessary PIN
Pad OBC Stock. Such relief shall apply until Fujitsu Services receives the required PIN
Pad Units to be added to PIN Pad OBC Stock (following written notification from Post
Office to Fujitsu Services that it requires Fujitsu Services to increase the PIN Pad OBC
Stock).

Where a PIN Pad OBC Stock Notice requires Fujitsu Services to augment the PIN Pad
OBC Stock, Fujitsu Services shall procure the required number of PIN Pad Units and
shall use reasonable endeavours to do so within 100 days of receipt of the PIN Pad
OBC Stock Notice.

Fujitsu Services’ Charge for each additional PIN Pad Unit procured shall be £389.45
and shall become due for payment upon delivery of such PIN Pad Unit. This Charge is
subject to the proviso that each PIN Pad OBC Stock Notice for additional PIN Pad Units
given by Post Office under paragraph 14.6 is for no more than 1000 PIN Pad Units.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Charges specified in paragraph 14.9 shall be in addition

CCN1204a referred to in the table above relates to Post Office's initial order for 10,000 replacement counter printers. The Parties anticipate that Post Office
may, in its discretion, order additional counter printers and that, when the changes to the Agreement necessary in respect of such additional printers are
introduced under the Change Control Procedure, adjustments will be made in respect of the figures in the table above so that they are all positive. In the
event that no further printers are ordered by Post Office, beyond the initial order for 10,000 printers, the negative figures in the table above represent amounts
that shall be paid on a monthly basis in the Financial Years in question by Fujitsu Services to Post Office. The above figures have been calculated on the
basis of an agreed estimate of the value of consumables which will be required in respect of the replacement counter printers and therefore, on or about 1
April 2008, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall review the above Gain Share payments in the light of the actual cost of such consumables and those
payments may be amended by agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either
party) in accordance with Change Control Procedure.

1.1.3 the ordering of Work Packages;

1.1.4 the raising and issuing of invoices by Fujitsu Services; and
1.1.5 the payment of all invoices by Post Office.

ORDERING OF CALL OFF SERVICES

The ordering process and ordering points for each Call Off Service shall be as set out
in Service Description for that Service.

ORDERING OF POST OFFICE CONSUMABLES

In the event that Post Office exercises its option to obtain Consumables from Fujitsu
Services, Post Office shall inform Fujitsu Services of the nominated ordering point(s)
for ordering such Consumables. The terms and conditions on which such
Consumables are supplied are set out in Clause 14.

ORDERING OF WORK PACKAGES

All Work Packages and Work Package Elements must be ordered by means of one or
more Work Orders.

A Work Order consists of:

4.2.1 the Agreed Form Commercial Terms signed by both Parties in accordance
with this Schedule D2, being a single document comprising:

(a) agreed Commercial Terms; and

(b) an agreed description of the Work Package or Work Package
Element which is the subject of the Work Order;

4.2.2 a Purchase Order issued by Post Office; and, where required,
4.2.3 a signed CCN in accordance with paragraph 4.6.

The description of a Work Package comprising only Professional Services may consist
solely of a description of:

4.3.1 the number of man days of effort by grade;

4.3.2 the start and end dates required; and

Requests for Work Packages, Agreed Form Commercial Terms and Purchase Orders
shall be sent by Post Office to the address notified to it by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with Clause 57 or as otherwise agreed by the Parties.

Proposals for Work Packages and Agreed Form Commercial Terms shall be sent by
Fujitsu Services to the Post Office Change Control Manager.

Fujitsu Services’ authorised representative shall, subject to paragraph 5.7, within three
weeks of receipt of a request for a Work Package from Post Office in accordance with
paragraph 5.4 or where this is not possible, within such other reasonable timeframe as
Fujitsu Services may notify the Post Office Change Control Manager, offer to carry out
Work Packages on the Commercial Terms by signing a proposed Agreed Form Terms
& Conditions in relation thereto and delivering it to the Post Office Change Control
Manager, 3rdFloor, 148Old Street, London, EC1V 9HQ. If a CCN is required, a copy
of the completed CCN signed by Fujitsu Services shall accompany the proposed
Agreed Form Commercial Terms. The offer may be taken up by Post Office in the
manner described in paragraph 5.8 up to midnight on the Expiry Date.

In relation to any requests for a Work Package that involve software development
received from Post Office in accordance with paragraph 5.4 that, in order to provide a
detailed response, would require analysis to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services after
31 March 2010, Fujitsu Services' obligation under paragraph 5.6 shall be for its
authorised representative to provide Post Office within three weeks of receipt of that
Work Package request with a high level response indicating the charges that would be
payable by Post Office to Fujitsu Services for providing a detailed response to the
Work Package request. Such high level response shall set out:

5.7.1 the number of man days of effort required by grade;
§.7.2 lead times, start and end dates for the work required; and

5.7.3 the nature of the task envisaged, to enable the appropriate skill set to be
identified.

Following review of such high level response, Post Office shall, within a reasonable
period, notify Fujitsu Services whether it wishes Fujitsu Services to respond to the
request for Work Package on the terms proposed by Fujitsu Services (or such other
terms as the Parties may agree) and if so shall authorise Fujitsu Services to produce a
detailed response on those terms and otherwise in accordance with paragraph 5.6.

To place the Work Order for the Work Package on the basis of the Commercial
Terms, Post Office Change Control Manager shall:

5.8.1 counter-sign the proposed Agreed Form Terms & Conditions;
5.8.2 where a CCN is required, counter-sign the CCN;

5.8.3 raise a Purchase Order in the amount of the gross price for the Work
Package or Work Package Element and enter the Purchase Order number
on to the signature sheet of the Agreed Form Terms & Conditions; and

5.8.4 deliver them to Fujitsu Services at the address referred to in paragraph 5.4
before midnight on the Expiry Date.

If a Work Order is received after the Expiry Date, Fujitsu Services may return the Work
Order to Post Office within five Working Days clearly marked "rejected", in which case
it shall be of no effect. If not so returned, it shall be deemed accepted notwithstanding
that it was received after the Expiry Date.

shall be dealt with in the same manner and in the same timescales as a
request or proposal for Work Package, as described in paragraphs 5.1 to

GAIN SHARE
1. INTRODUCTION
141 Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular those

relating to the governance and functions of the SIP set out in Schedules A2 and
B1.2, the Parties agree to share the benefit resulting from a cost saving initiative
or future development work:

1.4.1 the principles set out in this Schedule D3 (referred to in this
Agreement as "Gain Share") shall govern the arrangements for
sharing that benefit; and

1.1.2 the details of the arrangement shall be agreed on a case by case
basis under a CCN or Work Order or otherwise agreed in writing.

2. BENEFITS ELIGIBLE FOR GAIN SHARE

241 The benefits from future initiatives or developments that shall be eligible for Gain
Share (subject to agreement in accordance with paragraph 1.1.2) ("Benefits") are
as follows:

2.1.1 net savings in Fujitsu Services’ costs of delivering the HNG-X
Services:

(a) excluding those resulting from any Partial
Termination;

(b) excluding those resulting from measures taken by
Fujitsu Services to reduce the costs in its business
generally (except to the extent those measures have
been taken specifically in order to generate savings
in the provision of Services to Post Office);

(c) as adjusted to allow for variations in the number of
Branches, Counter Positions and all other variables
referred to in Schedule D1; and

(d) subject to paragraph 5.3, achieved without changing
the HNG-X Services, the Service Levels or other
provisions of this Agreement;

2.1.2 net savings in Post Office's costs, achieved by involving the SIP, in

Page 2 of 7
CONFIDENTIAL,

2.1.4 Post Office's increase in profits or reduction in losses arising from
new additional revenues from product developments that result from
initiatives brought to the SIP by Fujitsu Services. This shall be net of
any contribution that is displaced by the new product.

2.2 Where the Parties identify potential initiatives or developments that may result in

Benefits arising:

2.2.1

22:2

the most appropriate Party shall produce a reasonably detailed
business case in writing analysing the potential initiative or
development, amounts proposed for investment and the potential
Benefits arising. Information from each Party required to produce
such a business case that is obtainable through operation of the
provisions of Schedule D4 shall be used in such business case; and

such business case shall be presented to the Systems Integration
Partnership and Executive Relationship at the earliest opportunity
which shall be responsible for determining as soon as reasonably
practicable whether and how to implement the relevant initiative or
development. The Parties shall only proceed with an initiative or
development where they agree that sufficient Benefits will arise from
the relevant initiative or development to provide an adequate return to
enable each Party to obtain approval for their respective business
cases in accordance with internal policies then in force.

23 In relation to Benefits within the scope of paragraphs 2.1.2, 2.1.3 or 2.1.4, these
shall only be shared by the Parties if the initiative or development work in
question is included in the Working Document managed by the Systems
Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship referred to in Annex 1 to

Schedule A2.
3. PAYMENT/CREDIT
3.1 Benefits may be apportioned between the Parties by:
3.1.1 sharing (in accordance with the principles set out in this Schedule) the

cost savings that arise from the cost saving initiative or development
in question and:

(a) in the case of cost savings made by Fujitsu Services,
reducing the Charges under the Change Control
Procedure to reflect Post Office's share of those cost
savings; and/or

(b) in the case of cost savings made by Post Office,
agreeing the payments that will be made by Post
Office to Fujitsu Services to reflect Fujitsu Services'
share of those savings,

in each case, provided that each party has carried out those actions
that it agreed to undertake in order to achieve the relevant Benefits;
and/or

3.1.2 sharing (in accordance with the principles set out in this Schedule)
Post Office's increase in profits or reduction in losses arising from
new additional revenues that result from the initiative or future
development in question.

If the Parties agree that paragraph 3.1.1(b) or 3.1.2 apply, Post Office shall pay
Fujitsu Services' agreed share of the Benefits which, unless otherwise agreed,
shall be invoiced monthly in arrear in accordance with the provisions of Schedule
D2.

The amount of the Benefits from each initiative or development available for Gain
Share by each Party shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule D4.

Any agreed share of Benefits duly payable to Fujitsu Services under this
Schedule D3 shall continue beyond termination or expiry of the entire
Agreement, and the Open Book provisions in Schedule D4 shall continue to
apply to enable verification of the Benefits available.

GAIN SHARE PRINCIPLES

Subject to paragraph 5, the Benefits resulting from each initiative or development
shall be shared between the Parties according to the following principles:

Investment Recovery
4.2.1 Each Party shall be entitled to recover:

(a) its actual investment in the initiative or development;
plus

(b) sufficient additional amounts to deliver an internal
rate of return equal to the official Bank of England
rate plus 2% per annum,

to the extent the aggregate of (a) and (b) is less than or equal to the
Benefits (such amount being the “Investment Recovery”).

4.2.2 Investment Recovery by each Party shall be achieved over the life of
the assets acquired for the initiative or development or the duration of
the initiative or development (as applicable) and shall be phased such
that Investment Recovery is paid for out of the Benefits.

4.2.3 The amount of the Benefits utilised for Investment Recovery shall (if
possible) be a fixed proportion (to be agreed on a case by case basis)

Schedule D3 Version 9.0
Page 4 of 7

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

of the Benefits in each of the years over the life of the assets acquired
for the initiative or development or the duration of the initiative or
development (as applicable).

4.24 Each Party's Investment Recovery as a share of the Benefits shall be
in proportion to the amount actually invested by that Party in the
initiative or development as compared to the amount actually invested
by the other Party in that initiative or development.

4.3 Additional Benefits

4.3.1 Subject to paragraph 4.4.1, where Fujitsu Services provides actual
investment entitling it to an Investment Recovery under paragraph
4.2, the proportion of the Benefits remaining after that allocated for
Investment Recovery in accordance with paragraph 4.2 (“Additional
Benefits”) shall, subject to paragraph 4.3.2, be allocated between the
Parties as follows:

(a) in the first twelve calendar months of Investment
Recovery, Additional Benefits shall be allocated 70%
to Fujitsu Services and 30% to Post Office;

(b) in the twelve calendar months after (a), Additional
Benefits shall be allocated 50% to Fujitsu Services
and 50% to Post Office;

(c) in the twelve calendar months after (b), Additional
Benefits shall be allocated 30% to Fujitsu Services
and 70% to Post Office; and

(d) in subsequent years all Additional Benefits shall be
allocated to Post Office.

If the initiative or development in question is implemented in stages or
is phased, the Additional Benefits resulting from each such stage or
phase shall be treated separately and shared in accordance with the
provisions above in this paragraph 4.3 with effect from the date of
implementation of that stage or phase.

4.3.2 If Fujitsu Services’ anticipated return, being calculated as the internal
rate of return of a cash flow at constant prices (i.e. without adjustment
for inflation) and before tax, comprising (i) its investment (as a
negative amount) and (ii) its Investment Recovery and (iii) its share of
the Additional Benefits (each of (ii) and (iii) as positive amounts):

(a) is less than 13% per annum then Fujitsu Services’
share of the Additional Benefits shall be increased
and Post Office's share decreased such that Fujitsu
Services’ total return on investment is above its

Schedule D3 Version 9.0
Page 5 of 7

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

(i) 13% per annum; and

(ii) the level at which Fujitsu Services’ and Post Office's
similarly calculated anticipated total internal rates of
return on investment are equal; or

(b) exceeds 30% per annum then Fujitsu Services’
share of the Additional Benefits shall be decreased
and Post Office's share increased such that Fujitsu
Services’ total return on investment is equal to 30%
per annum.

In the case of both (a) and (b) any such adjustments to the share of
Additional Benefits will be on a basis that takes into account the years
in which the investment is made and the extent of investment made in
each year.

44 Alternative Approach

441

4.4.3

Where Fujitsu Services does not provide any actual investment
entitling it to an Investment Recovery in relation to an initiative or
development resulting in Benefits or if the application of the principles
set out in this paragraph 4.4 in respect of any Additional Benefits
would result in Fujitsu Services having a greater share of those
Additional Benefits than it would do under paragraph 4.3, then the
principles set out in this paragraph 4.4 shall apply instead of those in
paragraph 4.3.

In relation to each initiative or development resulting in Benefits, any
Additional Benefits (which, if Fujitsu Services does not provide any
actual investment, shall be the proportion of the Benefits remaining
after that allocated for Investment Recovery to Post Office only) shall
be allocated between the Parties as follows:

(a) in the first thirty six calendar months of Investment
Recovery, Additional Benefits shall be allocated 10%
to Fujitsu Services and 90% to Post Office; and

(b) in subsequent years all Additional Benefits shall be allocated
to Post Office.

If the initiative or development in question is implemented in stages or
is phased, the Additional Benefits resulting from each such stage or
phase shall be treated separately and shared in accordance with the
provisions above in this paragraph 4.4 with effect from the date of
implementation of that stage or phase.

For Benefits of the type described in paragraph 2.1.1, if during the periods
referred to in paragraphs 4.3.1(a) to (c) (inclusive) and 4.4.2(a) in which
Additional Benefits are apportioned (as adjusted in accordance with paragraph
4.3.2, where applicable) it is established through Benchmarking that the Charges
for delivering an HNG-X Service (excluding the Gain Share payments (if any) in
respect of that HNG-X Service) are above the target price range (as described in
paragraph 3.8 of Schedule D6) the Gain Share payments being made to Fujitsu
Services in respect of that HNG-X Service shall cease.

ALTERNATIVE GAIN SHARE APPROACHES

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Gain Share principles set out in this
Schedule in relation to the Benefits eligible for Gain Share and the means of
sharing those benefits may not be applicable or appropriate to every Gain Share
initiative or development.

Each Party shall consider and shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its
agreement to any reasonable modified or alternative Gain Share arrangement
proposed by the other Party in relation to a particular initiative or development.
Such matters shall be dealt with by the Systems Integration Partnership and
Executive Relationship.

The parties acknowledge and agree that in exceptional circumstances it may be
beneficial to consider proposals which generate savings in the Charges but only
if the HNG-X Services, Service Levels or other provisions of this Agreement are
changed. Any Gain Share payable in such cases shall be agreed on a case by
case basis following the general approach set out above.

Testable Services.
MARKET TESTING METHODS

Subject to paragraphs 5.1 and 6.1, the Market Testing method for all Testable Services
shall be Benchmarking.

Fujitsu Services may not increase any Charges, decrease any Services Levels or
(unless required by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 4.3) cease providing any
Services in connection with or as a consequence of Market Testing save where Fujitsu
Services participates in Competitive Tendering and is appointed by Post Office as the
winning tenderer, in which case the Agreement shall be amended under the Change
Control Procedure to reflect Fujitsu Services' tender as described in paragraph 4.3.3(a).

Governance in respect of Market Testing in terms of monitoring, review and reporting of
events and progress and issue resolution shall be managed by the Commercial
Relationship and overseen by the Systems Integration Partnership and Executive
Relationship, as described in Schedule A2.

BENCHMARKING

The purpose of Benchmarking (the "Benchmark Purpose") is to compare the value for
money of the Benchmark Services with Equivalent Services. The focus shall be on
comparing the price of the Benchmark Services with market prices, but taking account
of current technologies at the time of Benchmarking, and not restricted to the same
technical solution as is used in the HNG-X Services.

The target price range for each Benchmark Service shall be as described in paragraph
3.8.

The Charges for the Benchmark Service to be used in Benchmarking comparisons are
the Charges then set out in paragraph 2 of Schedule D1 (as adjusted in accordance
with paragraph 4 of Schedule D1) for that Service for the remaining term of the
Agreement, applying the volumes (in relation to any variable Charges) then forecast in
the CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033), excluding (i) the Service Management Element, and (ii) any Gain Share
payments that may be payable to Fujitsu Services in relation to cost savings in respect
of that Service.

Fujitsu Services shall, unless paragraph 5.1.2 applies, initiate Benchmarking and unless
any of paragraphs 5.1.1, 5.1.3, 6.1.1 or 6.1.3 apply procure that Benchmarking is
completed in respect of each Testable Service referred to in the Benchmarking timetable
in Annex 2 (as such timetable is varied in accordance with paragraph 3.5) in each

Financial Year in which that Service is due to be Benchmarked as set out in that
timetable up to and including 31° March 2015. After 31° March 2015, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that there shall be no Benchmarking of Testable Services.

The Benchmarking timetable in Annex 2 may be revised and any Testable Services set
out in Annex 1 may be added to that timetable by written agreement between the
Parties, subject to the following provisions:

3.5.1 no more than two Testable Services shall be timetabled for Benchmarking in any
Financial Year;

3.5.2 no Testable Service shall be timetabled for Benchmarking more than once every
three Financial Years; and

3.5.3 no Testable Service shall be Benchmarked before the Service first becomes
eligible for Benchmarking as set out in Annex 1.

If no revisions are agreed to the timetable in Annex 2 then, subject to paragraph 3.5.3,
that shall be the timetable for Benchmarking. The date in the Benchmarking timetable
by which a Benchmarking is due to be completed shall be put back, day for day, to the
extent that Post Office unreasonably withholds or delays its agreement under paragraph
3.7.3 to the Benchmarker's proposed approach for that Benchmarking.

Fujitsu Services shall procure Benchmarking from the Benchmarking consultancy who
ordinarily provides benchmarking services to Fujitsu Services, provided that that person
is an independent and generally recognised, within the IT industry, benchmarking
consultancy in the United Kingdom (the “Benchmarker”). The Parties acknowledge that
at the date of this Agreement Fujitsu Services uses Gartner Consulting or Compass
Management Consulting as its benchmarking consultant, either of which may be used
by Fujitsu Services as the Benchmarker so long as it remains an independent and
generally recognised, within the IT industry, benchmarking consultancy in the United
Kingdom. Any alternative benchmarking consultancy used to undertake Benchmarking
that meets the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph shall be notified by
Fujitsu Services to Post Office.

Fujitsu Services shall procure that:

3.7.1. the Benchmarker shall select services for the Benchmark Group of an
appropriate standard, quality and relevance to the Benchmark Services in order
to achieve the Benchmark Purpose having due regard to all relevant factors,
including the nature and type of service concerned and the requirement of the
service recipient in relation thereto. The Benchmark Group shall (where such
services are available in the market) include examples of services which meet
the same business requirements as a Benchmark Service, but which utilise
more recent technology than that used to deliver the relevant Benchmark
Service;

3.7.2 no later than 30 Working Days before the date notified by Fujitsu Services to
Post Office when each Benchmarking is due to commence, Post Office shall be
provided with the Benchmarker’s proposed approach to Benchmarking,

Schedule D6 Version 9.0
Page 3 of 13

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

3.8

3.9

3.7.3. without prejudice to Post Office's right under paragraph 6.1.3, the Benchmarker
shall make such changes to the approach as the Parties and the Benchmarker
consider and agree to be reasonable, such changes to the approach to be
agreed no later than 20 Working Days before the Benchmarking is due to
commence. Either Party may include within such changes as are requested a
request that the Benchmark Group includes a service that meets the same
business requirements as the Benchmark Service, irrespective of the
technology used to deliver that service;

3.7.4 within 30 Working Days following the date on which a particular Benchmarking
is due to be completed in accordance with the timetable referred to in paragraph
3.4, the Benchmarker shall deliver a benchmarking report to each Party (a
“Benchmarking Report”). The Benchmarking Report shall contain the
documented findings and recommendations of the Benchmarker, including any
key financial and technical information supporting such recommendations; and

3.7.5 Post Office is given such direct access to the Benchmarker and the data and
information underlying the Benchmarking Report as Post Office may reasonably
require in order to discuss and understand the Benchmarking Report and its
assumptions.

If the Charges for the Benchmark Services (as described in paragraph 3.3) are greater
than the amount "A" calculated using the following formula those Charges shall be
deemed to be above the target price range, that range, for the purposes of this
Schedule D6, being the range between the lowest price service in the Benchmark
Group and the amount "A".

A= ((0.375N — Z) x (P2—P1)) + P1

where

N is the total number of services in the Benchmark Group;

Z is the integer part of 37.5% of N;

P1, having put the services in the Benchmark Group in ascending order by price (such
prices having been adjusted pursuant to any agreed weighting mechanism applied by
the Benchmarker) and numbered those services consecutively starting at one for the

service with the lowest price, is the price for the service numbered Z; and

P2 is the price for the service numbered Z + 1, such price having been adjusted
pursuant to any agreed weighting mechanism applied by the Benchmarker.

If, pursuant to paragraph 3.8, the Charges for the Benchmark Service are deemed to be
above the target price range, within 30 days of the issue of the Benchmarking Report
Fujitsu Services shall:

either adjust its price for the Benchmark Service so that it falls within the target
price range and continue to provide the Benchmark Service as previously; or

initiate Competitive Tendering in accordance with paragraph 5 to appoint a new
sub-contractor to Fujitsu Services in respect of the Benchmark Service so that
the Benchmark Service may be provided more cost-effectively; or

notify Post Office that (i) it does not consider it possible to provide the
Benchmark Service at a price that is within the target price range and achieve
an adequate gross margin on that Benchmark Service and (ii) its reasons for
this conclusion.

4. COMPETITIVE TENDERING

41 The purpose of Competitive Tendering is to identify potential alternative suppliers of
Competitive Tendering Services (either as potential sub-contractors to Fujitsu Services
or as direct suppliers of the service to Post Office) who can offer improved value for
money in providing the Competitive Tendering Services.

4.2 Competitive Tendering may be carried out either:

4.2.1

4.2.2

by Fujitsu Services (for the purpose of finding a new sub-contractor), in the
circumstances described in paragraph 5.1; or

by Post Office (for the purpose of finding a new direct supplier) pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.

43 Following Competitive Tendering, Post Office may decide at its sole option:

4.3.1

4.3.2

4.3.3

to continue with the current Service from Fujitsu Services at the current prices;

in the case of Competitive Tendering undertaken by Fujitsu Services where the
outcome of the tender process is such that, if Fujitsu Services was to sub-
contract all or part of the Competitive Tendering Service in question to an
alternative service provider identified in the tender process a downward revision
to the Charges would be, in the mutual opinion of the Post Office and Fujitsu
Services, deliverable, to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such
Competitive Tendering Service to such alternative service provider and revise its
Charges accordingly so that the Charge for that Competitive Tendering Service
shall be equivalent to the sum of: (i) the costs to Fujitsu Services of that sub-
contract (which may include Interface Establishment Costs allocated to such
alternative service provider), (ii) the Relevant Margin thereon, and (iii) the
Service Management Element; or

in the case of Competitive Tendering undertaken by Post Office:
(a) where Fujitsu Services is the winning tenderer, to continue with the

Competitive Tendering Service from Fujitsu Services on a revised basis
to be agreed under the Change Control Procedure, to reflect the

Schedule D6 Version 9.0

Page 5 of 13

FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069
CONFIDENTIAL

44

5.1

specification and charges for that service tendered by Fujitsu Services,
as amended and agreed with Post Office; or

(b) where the outcome of the tender process is that an Equivalent Service
to the Competitive Tendering Service is available at a price which is less
than the Charges for that Competitive Tendering Service (excluding (i)
the Service Management Element, and (ii) any Gain Share payments
that may be payable to Fujitsu Services in relation to cost savings in
respect of that Service) either:

(i) to invite Fujitsu Services to appoint the winning tenderer as a
new subcontractor within 60 Working Days (or such other period
as the Parties may agree) of such invitation and to revise its
Charges for the Competitive Tendering Service on the same
basis as such Charges may be revised under paragraph 4.3.2;
or

(ii) to appoint the winning tenderer as a direct supplier to Post
Office and terminate that Competitive Tendering Service (as a
Terminable Service) in accordance with Clause 47.10.1 of the
Agreement.

In the event that Post Office exercises its option pursuant to paragraph 4.3.3(b)(i) and
either:

4.4.1 Fujitsu declines to appoint such winning tenderer; or

4.4.2 the time limit specified in paragraph 4.3.3(b)(i) expires prior to Fujitsu Services
appointing the winning tenderer,

Post Office may, at its sole option, exercise its rights under paragraph 4.3.3(b)(ii), failing
which paragraph 4.3.1 shall apply.

COMPETITIVE TENDERING BY FUJITSU SERVICES
Fujitsu Services shall undertake Competitive Tendering where:

5.1.1. subject to paragraph 6.1.3, the Benchmarker notifies the Parties that, in the
Benchmarker's reasonable opinion, due to the lack of availability of suitable
services for inclusion in the Benchmark Group or other reasons in connection
with the Benchmarking process or criteria, it will not be or has not been possible
to perform a satisfactory Benchmarking for that Service and the Parties agree
that Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services may result in a downward
revision to the Charges for the Testable Service in question; or

5.1.2 the Parties have agreed that the Testable Service is one which should be

5.1.3. Fujitsu Services fails to initiate Benchmarking of a Testable Service in
accordance with paragraph 3.4, and Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services that
Fujitsu Services shall initiate a competition in respect of that Testable Service in
accordance with this paragraph 5; or

5.1.4 paragraph 3.9.2 applies,

and in each case Fujitsu Services shall initiate Competitive Tendering within three
months.

When paragraph 5.1 applies Fujitsu Services shall carry out, or procure that an
Independent Adviser (such Independent Adviser to be agreed with Post Office and such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) conducts, Competitive
Tendering in each case with a view to appointing a new sub-contractor to Fujitsu
Services in respect of the Service in question so that the Service may be provided more
cost-effectively.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that:

5.3.1 once initiated in accordance with paragraph 5.1, Competitive Tendering shall be
actively continued and in any event completed within six months or in
accordance with any timetable agreed in writing between the Parties;

5.3.2 all invitations to tender and other key tender documents are submitted to Post
Office for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) prior to being provided to potential tenderers; and

5.3.3 Post Office is provided with copies of all tenders received, subsequent related
correspondence and documentation and valuation assumptions or processes
adopted from time to time throughout the tendering process and, in the event an
Independent Adviser is used, is given the opportunity to discuss the tenders with
that Independent Adviser.

The three month period referred to in paragraph 5.1 and the six month period referred to
in paragraph 5.3.1 shall each be extended, day for day, to the extent that Post Office
unreasonably withholds or delays its approval of the tender documentation referred to in
paragraph 5.3.2 or otherwise delays the Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to any bona fide potential sub-contractor of Competitive
Tendering Services (subject to the same executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other
form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and
such potential sub-contractor) Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure
is reasonably required to enable that potential sub-contractor to prepare a reasonably
detailed tender proposal, including an anonymised list providing details of the terms and
conditions of employment of all Fujitsu Services personnel (and those personnel of its
relevant sub-contractors) who are then wholly or mainly employed or engaged in the
performance of the Competitive Tendering Services, to the extent such personnel may
be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006
if such Services were transferred (including, as a minimum, information on (i) numbers

Services, skills sets and employment grades, (iv) age and length of service profile, (v)
locations of personnel and (vi) such key employee policies as shall be generally known
to the relevant employees and relevant to their terms of employment or reasonable
expectations).

COMPETITIVE TENDERING BY POST OFFICE
Subject to paragraph 6.2, Post Office shall be entitled if:

6.1.1. Benchmarking by Fujitsu Services pursuant to paragraph 3.4 in respect of any
Testable Service is not initiated in accordance with the Benchmarking timetable
in Annex 2 (as adjusted in accordance with paragraph 3.5) or Fujitsu Services
fails to procure the outputs required by paragraph 3.7 to achieve such
Benchmarking or Fujitsu Services fails to comply with its obligations under
paragraph 3.9 and Fujitsu Services fails to comply with written notice delivered
by Post Office to Fujitsu Services within 60 days of such notice to initiate such
Benchmarking or procure such outputs or comply with such obligations, or

6.1.2 following Benchmarking, Fujitsu Services gives notice to Post Office in
accordance with paragraph 3.9.3; or

6.1.3 it does not agree on a reasonable ground to the Benchmarking approach to be
used by the Benchmarker; or

6.1.4 Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services is not initiated within the period
specified in paragraph 5.1 (as may be adjusted in accordance with paragraph
5.4); or

6.1.5 there is a Default by Fujitsu Services in relation to its Competitive Tendering
obligations in paragraph 5.3.1 (the six month period therein as may be adjusted
in accordance with paragraph 5.4),

to initiate a competition within six months respectively of (i) expiry of the 60 day notice
period referred to in paragraph 6.1.1, (ii) receipt of notice under paragraph 3.9.3, (iii) the
date the Benchmarking was due to commence or (iv) expiry of the period referred to in
paragraph 5.1 or (v) Fujitsu Services’ Default in relation to its obligations in paragraph
5.3.1 (as the case may be), to find an alternative supplier of Equivalent Services to the
Testable Service in question. The exercise, by Post Office, of any of its rights under
paragraphs 6.1.1, 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 shall be without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies available to Post Office in such circumstances.

Post Office may choose to appoint an Independent Adviser to run such a competition on
its behalf, such Independent Adviser to be agreed with Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Fujitsu Services shall (subject to any applicable legislation or regulations) be entitled to
participate as a tenderer in any such competition. If it participates in such competition,
Fujitsu Services shall submit its tender in the same way and to the same timescale as

Schedule D6 Version 9.0

6.6

other tenderers and shall not have access to the financial information in respect of any
other tender.

Unless Fujitsu Services exercises or intends to exercise its right under paragraph 6.3 to
participate as a tenderer in the competition, Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office or
the Independent Adviser (as the case may be) with such assistance as may reasonably
be required to facilitate such a competition, including managing all or any part of the
competition should Post Office or the Independent Adviser ask it to do so.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to any bona fide potential replacement provider of
Competitive Tendering Services (subject to the same executing an Agreed Form NDA or
any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services and such potential replacement provider) Confidential Information to the extent
that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable that potential replacement
provider to prepare a reasonably detailed tender proposal.

Where in accordance with this paragraph 6 Post Office seeks a tender or tenders for a
third party contractor to provide Equivalent Services to those of a Competitive Tendering
Service, Fujitsu Services shall:

6.6.1 to the extent it can reasonably do so in advance (not knowing which provider
will be the winning tenderer) provide to Post Office its best estimate of any
Interface Establishment Costs likely to be incurred by Post Office in connection
with such services on the basis that the specification of the Competitive
Tendering Service and its intended replacement service are the same;

6.6.2 to the extent that any proposed third party replacement service does not meet
the specification of the Competitive Tendering Service, Fujitsu Services shall, in
a timescale consistent with the tender process, advise Post Office of the
Interface Costs likely to be incurred by Post Office in relation to the proposed
replacement service; and

6.6.3 provide to Post Office an anonymised list with details of the terms and
conditions of employment of all Fujitsu Services personnel (and those personnel
of its relevant sub-contractors) who are then wholly or mainly employed or
engaged in the performance of the Competitive Tendering Services, to the
extent such personnel may be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 if such Services were transferred
(including, as a minimum, information on (i) numbers of personnel (employees,
contractors and temporary staff), (ii) salaries and other benefits, bonuses and
pensions arrangements, (iii) where readily available to Fujitsu Services, skills
sets and employment grades, (iv) age and length of service profile, (v) locations
of personnel and (vi) such key employee policies as shall be generally known to
the relevant employees and relevant to their terms of employment or reasonable
expectations).

continue the Relevant Services after termination, in each case either by performing
them itself or by means of the Next Supplier.

The Parties acknowledge that it is their overall objective in relation to termination of the
Agreement, expiry of an Expiring Service and Partial Termination to procure, so far as is
reasonable and practicable, that there shall be an orderly transfer of responsibilities for
the delivery of the Relevant Services provided under this Agreement or an orderly and

reasonably practicable after completion of any period of notice of termination
given by Post Office to Fujitsu Services; and

1.7.4 set out the Parties’ obligations with respect to the development and
maintenance of the Exit Strategy and the Exit Plans.

given” in the table set out in Annex 1 of this Schedule E.

Following service of a notice duly served under Clause 47.10.1 or 47.10.2, the Parties
shall assess the impact of the relevant Partial Termination upon the rest of this
Agreement in order to agree under the Change Control Procedure (such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) any consequential changes to this Agreement
necessary to deliver the Services continuing after such Partial Termination including,
without limitation, the changes necessary to address:

the tender process and were prepared with Fujitsu Services' input and assistance
pursuant to paragraphs 6.4 to 6.6 (inclusive) of Schedule D6.

If and to the extent that the Parties fail to reach agreement under the Change Control
Procedure pursuant to paragraph 2.2 by the date the Terminable Service in question is
terminated:

2.4.1 the Parties shall each use all reasonable endeavours to reach agreement such

obligations and achieve the Service Levels applicable in relation to all continuing
Services ("Continuing Obligations") to the extent it reasonably can do so, taking
into account those aspects of the performance of that Terminable Service upon
which Fujitsu Services’ performance of the Continuing Obligations depends; and

to the extent such failure to reach agreement is in relation to the qualifications or
exceptions to Clause 43.1 referred to in paragraph 2.2.6 or security related
responsibilities to be performed by Post Office, with effect from the date of such
termination Post Office shall be responsible for ensuring to the extent that it or a
Next Supplier:

(a) establishes the Replacement Interfaces, that the Replacement
Interfaces are secure; and/or

(b) operates or provides technical or service linkages to the Replacement
Interfaces, that such operation and linkages are performed in a secure
manner,

in each case in accordance with the levels of security and the standards of skill,
care and diligence that would be reasonably expected to be applied in relation
to the relevant Replacement Service taken on by a supplier of IT services using
good industry practice and adopting any enhanced security measures that such
a supplier could reasonably be expected to adopt if such supplier provided an
indemnity to Post Office in the same form as that set out in Clause 43.1 (but
subject to the same limitations or exclusions of liability set out in Clauses 43 and
44) in respect of the provision of that Replacement Service.

Any Disputes in relation to this paragraph 2.4 shall be resolved in accordance with the
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

2.5 In the case of Partial Termination pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph

the Charges which shall be paid by Post Office to Fujitsu Services for the
provision of the Third Party Management Services in respect of such
Replacement Services shall be as set out in paragraph 9 of Schedule D1; and

(a) Fujitsu Services shall update the Exit Strategy to include all of the
matters set out in paragraph 3.2.3; and

(b) the Parties shall, in light of the Exit Strategy updated in accordance with
paragraph 3.2.2(a), consider the Exit Plans in Annexes 2 and 3 to this
Schedule and update them to identify at a high level any additional
activities which the Parties agree are required in relation to termination
of this Agreement, Partial Termination and/or termination of Project
HNG-x, the detail of such activities to be included in the appropriate Exit
Plan in Phase Two.

The Exit Strategy shall:

(a) set out a generic description of all probable post termination scenarios
relevant to this Agreement (each an “Exit Scenario”) including, without
limitation, the following:

(i) full or partial continuation of services substantially the same as
the Relevant Services by the Next Supplier;

(ii) full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next
Supplier fully or partially utilising the Infrastructure;

(iii) full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next
Supplier utilising an entirely new infrastructure; and

(iv) continued provision of the Services by Fujitsu Services following
termination of Project HNG-X;

(b) identify the major factors which are common to all the Exit Scenarios
and those which occur in some only of the Exit Scenarios;

(c) set out the roles and responsibilities of the Parties in the development of
the Exit Plans in Phase Two;

(d) set out in broad and general terms:

(i) the categories of information that will be required for exit,
distinguishing between those categories which will be required
in all probable Exit Scenarios and those which will be required
only in particular Exit Scenarios; and

(ii) the sources of such information and how it will be provided.

After the Asset Register has been updated in accordance with paragraph 3.2.1
and the Exit Strategy established in accordance with paragraph 3.2.2, the
Parties shall thereafter jointly review and update the Asset Register and/or the
Exit Strategy once in every twelve months or if the Commercial Leads decide it
is necessary to do so as a result of significant changes to the Services. If the

Schedule E Version 9.0

Fujitsu Services shall provide an updated version of the Asset Register to Post
Office by 30" April 2013 which they shall keep up to date throughout the
remainder of the Term in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

Fujitsu Services shall provide an updated version of the Exit Strategy document
to Post Office by 31st October 2013, such version to take into account Post
Office's intention to transition to a Towers Model.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall not charge Post Office for the
production of the updated versions of the Asset Register and Exit Strategy in
accordance with paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 above.

Exit Plans for transition

Fujitsu Services shall, within 2 months of receipt of a request from Post Office,
provide to Post Office part 1 of the Exit Plan (excluding aspects of the Exit Plan
which are dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier) for such Services as
Post Office may specify.

Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office part 2 of the Exit Plan (including
aspects of the Exit Plan which are dependent on the identity of the Next
Supplier) following notification to Fujitsu Services by Post Office as to who the
Next Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and
the Next Provider requires. Fujitsu Services shall provide part 2 of the Exit Plan
within 2 months of receipt of this notification from Post Office provided that,
subject to paragraph 3.4.3 below, such notification is received 2 months or
longer after the date the request for the part one of the Exit Plan was made in
accordance with paragraph 3.4.1 (i.e. the creation of part one of the Exit Plan
and part two of the Exit Plan shall not run concurrently). For the avoidance of
doubt, Post Office shall provide this information on or before the date it gives
written notice of termination of the Terminable Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may elect to request only part 2 of the
Exit Plan (without requesting part 1) by notifying Fujitsu Services who the Next
Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and the
Next Provider requires. In the event that Post Office requests part 2 of the Exit
Plan only, Fujitsu Services shall provide such Exit Plan in accordance with
paragraph 3.4.2 above including all aspects of the Exit Plan which are
dependent and which are not dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier.

Post Office shall not make a request for an Exit Plan for the following Services
in accordance with paragraph 3.4.1 or 3.4.2 above earlier than

reasonable assistance to Post Office for the purposes of determining the
implications at that time of the Exit Scenarios.

3.4.6 The Parties shall work together in good faith to review and revise (if
appropriate) part one and part two of the Exit Plan to Post Office's reasonable
satisfaction within 2 months of receipt by Fujitsu Services of Post Office's
request for each Exit Plan.

Charges for development of Exit Plans

3.5.1 All work performed by Fujitsu Services in writing and reviewing any Exit Plans

NEXT SUPPLIERS

Subject to Post Office procuring that each bona fide potential Next Supplier and/or Next
Supplier enters into an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure
agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such bona fide
potential Next Supplier and/or Next Supplier, Fujitsu Services will:

4.1.1 Provide Post Office with reasonable information and assistance in relation to
Post Office's tender process conducted for the provision of services (i) to
replace the Relevant Services or the performance of the Relevant Services by a
replacement contractor; and/or (ii) in relation to any Tower;

4.1.2 During any tender or due diligence process:
(a) provide bona fide potential Next Suppliers with access to personnel,
data and information (via either a real or virtual data room); and

Where Post Office appoints or intends to appoint a Next Supplier, Post Office shall be
responsible for liaising with and ensuring the co-operation of such Next Supplier in all
planning and handover activities in respect of exit transition and where obligations in the
General Exit Plan which fall to Post Office are due to be performed by or with the co-
operation of the Next Supplier, such obligation will be deemed to include an obligation
on the Post Office to procure such performance or co-operation from the Next Supplier.

Where, following Partial Termination, Relevant Services are provided by a Next Supplier
and managed by Fujitsu Services pursuant to the Third Party Management Service,
Post Office shall procure that all information reasonably required by Fujitsu Services to
perform its obligations in respect of such Third Party Management Service is provided
to Fujitsu Services as soon as reasonably practicable.

OTHER EXIT ASSISTANCE

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure an orderly and efficient
transition from the provision of the Relevant Services to the provision of Replacement
Services (as the case may be) to the Next Supplier and shall co-operate with the Next
Supplier as required in order to fulfil the obligations under this Schedule E.

Where, other than in accordance with paragraph 6 of Schedule D6, the Post Office is
seeking a tender or tenders for a third party contractor to provide a Replacement
Service for any Terminable Service to which Partial Termination applies or where Post
Office intends to provide such Replacement Services itself, Fujitsu Services shall:

5.2.1 to the extent it can reasonably do so in advance of such Replacement Services
being provided, provide to Post Office its best estimate of any Interface
Establishment Costs likely to be incurred by Post Office in connection with such
Replacement Service on the basis that the specification of the Terminable
Service being terminated and the Replacement Service are the same; and

5.2.2 to the extent that any proposed Replacement Service does not meet the
specification of the Terminable Service being terminated, Fujitsu Services shall
as soon as reasonably practicable (in a timescale consistent with the tender
process, if any) advise Post Office of its likely Interface Costs in relation to the
proposed Replacement Service.

Fujitsu Services shall provide reasonable assistance at all times for a period of six years
after the date of Partial Termination or date of termination or expiry of this Agreement,
as applicable, for the purposes of allowing Post Office to obtain or have access to such
historic records connected with the performance of the Relevant Services as may have
been retained by Fujitsu Services after termination as is necessary to fulfil Post Office's
obligations to supply information for parliamentary, judicial, or administrative purposes.

Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services its reasonable costs directly incurred in providing
such assistance after Partial Termination and/or termination of this Agreement provided
that Fujitsu Services proves such costs to the reasonable satisfaction of Post Office.

6.1 The Termination Charge, Partial Termination Charge and HNG-X Termination Charge
are each intended to represent a good faith recognition of the loss of revenues Fujitsu
Services may reasonably have planned for in establishing the Relevant Services, the
supporting infrastructure and/or Project HNG-X. Such charges shall not be applicable
(i) where the Agreement or Project HNG-X is terminated in accordance with this
Agreement for Default by Fujitsu Services or (ii) in the case of Partial Termination arising
in relation to Market Testing.

including but not limited to the termination of its personnel plus any termination
charges payable to suppliers and sub-contractors (in all cases Fujitsu Services
being required to take reasonable steps to mitigate such exposure); or

6.2.2 B shall be an allowance for lost profit which:

(a) in the case of termination of Project HNG-X, shall be an amount equal to
15 percent. of the amount (if any) by which the HNG-X Development
Charges due for payment by Post Office up to the date of termination of
Project HNG-X are less than the Lower Target Price; or

(b) in the case of Partial Termination, shall be the Lost Profit; or
(c) in the case of termination of the Agreement, shall be the aggregate of:
(i) an amount equal to the profit element of the HNG-X Termination

Charge calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.2.2(a), or
zero if such termination of the Agreement occurs after HNG-X
Initial Acceptance or the HNG-X Termination Charge has
already been paid by Post Office; plus

(ii) the Lost Profit;

6.2.3. C shall:
(a) in the case of (i) Partial Termination or (ii) termination of the Agreement,

All costs forming part of the Termination Charge, Partial Termination Charge or
HNG-X Termination Charge shall be determined in accordance with Fujitsu
Services’ standard accounting practice, supported by proper vouchers and
records and verified by Fujitsu Services’ auditors.

For the purposes of this paragraph 6.2:

(a) “Lost Profit" means the present value of the lost profit that would have
been due to Fujitsu Services during the remainder of the term of the
Agreement.
(i) in the case of termination of the Agreement, in relation to all
Relevant Services; or

(ii) in the case of Partial Termination, in relation to the Relevant
Service that has been terminated,

in each case calculated as at the date of termination of the Agreement or
Partial Termination, or as at the date of commencement of the Ramp
Down Period in the event the Relevant Service is subject to a Ramp
Down Period, as the case may be, according to the following formula:

Lost Profit = APo + AP,/(1+r) + AP2/(141) + [series to continue on same
calculation basis until] + APyy/(1+1)"".

Where the Relevant Service being terminated is subject to a Ramp Down
Period, then the profit included within the Charges paid or payable by
Post Office during the Ramp Down Period shall be recognised in the
calculation of the Lost Profit payable by deducting the amount calculated
in accordance with the following from the Lost Profit (as calculated
above):

(10/100) multiplied by the total amount of the Charges paid or
payable by Fujitsu Services for the Relevant Service during the
Ramp Down Period

(b) "nn" means the numbering applied to Financial Years, where in respect
of the Financial Year in which termination occurs or the Ramp Down Period
commences (as the case may be), nn = 0; in respect of the next Financial Year,
nn = 1; for the Financial Year after that nn = 2 and so on for each successive
Financial Year in the period after such termination :

(i) to 31" March 2015 in the event of Partial Termination of the
Expiring Services (excluding the POLSAP Applications Support
Service) , save as set out in paragraph (ii) below; or

Charge applicable in respect of each Relevant Service
in that Financial Year multiplied by the Month Number or
OBC Month Number (as applicable) multiplied by

9.1 Impact

9.1.1

of termination or expiry during transition

From 1st April 2015, it is anticipated that Post Office will initiate a number of
Partial Terminations of Services as it moves to its new procurement model. To
support the transition following these Partial Terminations there may be a
resulting change in the scope and charging for the central support Services
(Service Management Service, Management Information Service, and Security
Management Service). In addition, the Services may be impacted by the
termination or expiry of the Engineering Service, Operational Business Change
Service and CMT Service.

Schedule E Version 9.0

Page 18 of 36
FUJ00000069
Fuoo000069

CONFIDENTIAL

9.1.2 The impact of any Partial Termination on the remaining Services shall be
assessed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.1.3 The impact of any expiry of an Expiring Service shall be assessed in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.2 Spares Stock

9.2.1 Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares stock for Expiring
Services (excluding POLSAP Applications Support Service) from 1st April 2015.
For the avoidance of doubt, all spares stock procured by or on behalf of Post
Office shall form part of the Branch Infrastructure.

9.2.2 Post Office may request in writing that Fujitsu Services source the spares stock
for Branch Infrastructure on Post Office’s behalf (including spares stock
identified in a Mini Extension Report). In such circumstances and subject to the
availability of such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post
Office's cost. Fujitsu Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of
these spares. In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service,
Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates
it will require to deliver the Services during the period for which the Engineering
Service is extended. Fujitsu Services will continue to be able to charge for the
storage of any other spares procured on behalf of Post Office during such
period.

93 It is noted that at the time of entering into CCN 1400, both parties acknowledge that it is
not possible to predetermine all of the potential impact (including changes to the
relevant cost base) of the removal of the Service Desk Service and the impact of the
removal of other subsequent Terminable Services (whether before or after 31st March
2015) on the remaining Operational Services and/or Transition Support Services. To
this end, the provisions of paragraph 2 (Partial Termination) of Schedule E (Termination
and the Exit Plan) shall apply in each instances and Fujitsu Services shall be required
to impact each expiry and/or termination and the Charges for the remaining services
shall be varied according to any increase or decrease in the remaining costs incurred by
Fujitsu Services in delivery of the remaining services.

10. MINI EXTENSIONS

10.1 In the event that Post Office requires any or all of the Expiring Services (excluding
Credence/MDM Service, the Salesforce Support Service, POLSAP Hosting Service and
POLSAP Applications Support Service) to continue beyond 31st March 2015, then the
following provisions shall apply:

10.1.1 Post Office shall only be able to extend a particular service for fixed 6 month
periods. In the event that Post Office requires an additional period beyond 30th
September 2015 then Post Office must also elect for an additional fixed 6
month extension period.

10.1.2 In order to extend one of these Expiring Services (excluding POLSAP
Applications Support Services), Post Office shall give a minimum of 6 months’
written notice, i.e. in the first instance, such written notice must be received by
Fujitsu Services prior to 30th September 2014.

10.1.3 For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages (where applicable) shall
continue to apply during any mini extension in accordance with clause 18 save
in the case where the Actual Engineering Visits in any month exceeds the
related Expected Engineering Volume by 10%. In such instances, the
calculation for liquidated damages in respect of the Counter Availability SLT
shall be based on the average downtime for each of the hardware components

over the previous three months (not including the month in question), instead of
the actual downtime in the month for each of those components. This shall be
calculated using the reported downtime for each problem type prefaced “HD” in
the Local Failure section of the SLT report produced in accordance with Annex
Ato the CCD Branch Network Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0011).

10.1.3A The Credence/MDM service, the Salesforce Support Service and POLSAP

Hosting Service are not extendable beyond 31° March 2015 in accordance with
the terms above. The POLSAP Applications Support Service is not extendable
beyond 31° March 2016 in accordance with the terms above.

10.1.3B In the event that the Service Desk Service continues beyond 31st March 2015,

there shall be no reduction in contracted for Service Levels during the extended
period.

Mini Extension Reports

10.1.4

10.1.5

10.1.6

10.1.7

10.1.8

10.1.9

Fujitsu Services shall, acting as the informed supplier, ensure that its personnel
inform the Service Management Relationship (as defined in Schedule A2) as
soon as it is aware of any issues that may impact on the provision of Expiring
Services (excluding POLSAP Applications Support Service) beyond March
2015 (be it by Fujitsu Services or the Next Supplier) on a reactive basis. Where
such issues are agreed they shall be formally recorded in the minutes and
become Refresh Items. If agreement is not reached in the Service Management
Relationship then the Parties shall escalate the matter using the Dispute
Resolution Procedure.

Additionally, to inform the mini extension request Post Office may elect to
commission via a CT, a report identifying any items of risk that would need to
be addressed in order for the relevant Service(s) to continue to operate during
any Mini Extension in accordance with the Agreement immediately prior to the
extension. This report shall be prepared on a pro-active basis with Fujitsu
Services consulting relevant sub-contractors as necessary. Such report shall be
delivered to Post Office within 3 months of the agreement date of the CT (the
“Mini Extension Report”). The report shall be delivered on a time and
materials basis but the cost of such report shall be capped at £30,000.

Post Office will review the Mini Extension Report and the Parties shall use
reasonable endeavours to agree any changes within 15 Working Days of the
date the Mini Extension Report is delivered to Post Office. If the Parties are
unable to agree the report then the matter shall be escalated via the existing
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Once agreed, any items identified in the Mini Extension Report shall be deemed
to be Refresh Items.

If matters relating to potential Refresh Items have been referred to the Dispute
Resolution Procedure but not yet resolved and result in a service failure during
any mini extension period, then the potential Refresh Items attributable to the
service failure shall become Refresh Items.

Post Office may at its sole option determine whether to implement all, some, or
none of the Refresh Items set out in the Mini Extension Report and/or Service
Management Relationship minutes and/or Dispute Resolution Procedure
resolutions. For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may purchase Refresh
Items from any Tower Contractor or any other third party but, as set out in
Schedule B1 (Branch Hardware Implementation) only Fujitsu Services may
implement such Refresh Items into the Services (at Post Office's additional
cost, where such costs are not recoverable under the Charges) to the extent it
still provides the applicable Service. In the event that Post Office decides to
proceed with some or none of the Refresh Items then Fujitsu Services shall not
be liable for any service failure directly attributable to Post Office not
proceeding with and/or making available the Refresh Items. In the event that
Post Office decides to proceed with some or all of the Refresh Items then, for

the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services’ obligations to provide the Services in
accordance with the Service Levels shall be unaffected to the extent to which
Post Office procures and/or provides the Refresh Items within the agreed
timescales.

10.1.10 Furthermore, if Post Office does not elect to procure the Mini Extension Report
and to the extent that Fujitsu Services has fulfilled its obligations under
paragraph 10.1.4 of this Schedule E, then, should the service be impacted by
the non-availability, refresh or support of hardware and software, or of spares
after 31st March 2015 an appropriate adjustment to service level performance
shall be made in relation to failures directly caused by the lack of availability,
refresh or support of those spares, hardware or software.

SPARES STOCK

Prior to the termination/expiry of any of the Services, Fujitsu Services will notify Post
Office promptly after it becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware), of
any:

10A.2.1 software or hardware used in the performance of the Services; or
10A.2.2 spares stocks for Branch Infrastructure,

which is becoming end-of-life and/or coming out of support in the two years after the
planned expiry of the Service.

Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares stock from 4% April 2015
required for the provision of Expiring Services (excluding POLSAP Applications Support
Service). For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may request that Fujitsu Services
source the spares stock on Post Office's behalf. In such circumstances and subject to
the availability of such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post
Office's cost. Fujitsu Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of these
spares.

In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall not
be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates it will require to deliver the
Services during the period for which the Engineering Service is extended. Fujitsu
Services will continue to be able to charge for the storage of any other spares procured
on behalf of Post Office during such period where such spares are stored by Fujitsu
Services.

RAMP DOWN CHARGES

Once a particular Operational Service, Counter Positions or Branches is/are supported
by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and not Fujitsu) it/they shall cease to be
“Counter Positions” or “Branches” for such Operational Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, a single Branch or Counter Position may be supported by
Fujitsu in relation to one Operational Service but may be supported by a Next Supplier
in relation to another Operational Service. As illustrated in the example in paragraph
1.9 of Schedule D1, that Branch or Counter Position supported by Fujitsu would be
included in the variable charge calculation for the Operational Service but not the
Branch or Counter Position supported by the Next Supplier.

RAMP DOWN OF TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES
In order to facilitate the transition to the new Towers Model, the Parties shall work
together to ascertain to what extent the elements of the Transitional Support Services

are variable as follows:

11.1.1 Upon request from Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall prepare a report
(the “Ramp Down Report”), within 5 months of the request, for Post Office

Schedule E Version 9.0
Page 21 of 36

CONFIDENTIAL

identifying for each Terminable Service within the Transitional Support Services
which elements of such Terminable Service are: (i) potentially variable in that
certain parts of that Service provided by Fujitsu Services may be reduced during a
ramp down period and the Charges reduced accordingly (“Variable Services”); and
(ii) fixed (for which no savings will realistically be achievable ahead of the exit of
that particular service). The Ramp Down Report shall be written on the basis of an
“order of magnitude”. Fujitsu Services shall not be required to disclose any
commercially sensitive information in the Ramp Down Report concerning how the
Services are delivered. Without prejudice to Clause 24 and Schedule D4, Fujitsu
Services shall not be required to provide Open Book information as outlined in
Schedule D4 for the purposes of the Ramp Down Report. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Ramp Down Report shall include the operational charge reduction which
Post Office could expect (comprising the cost of the network plus the additional
margin) as the result of cessation or decommissioning of individual central network
circuits. For avoidance of doubt Post Office acknowledges that in terminating a
circuit it may be required to incur termination charges from the circuit provider
(charged by Fujitsu Services on a pass through basis) and any additional costs
associated with the impact on the remaining circuits (for example a loss of
discounts associated with a certain volume of circuits) and/or Services. The
provision of the report shall be agreed via the Change Control Procedure and be
chargeable by Fujitsu Services up to a maximum amount of £15,000 excluding
VAT.

11.1.2. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the more commoditised Services,
such as Data Centre Operations, should be capable of being Variable Services.
In the Ramp Down Report, Fujitsu Services shall identify the variable elements
of such commoditised Services and the associated reduction in the Charges for
such variable elements during a Ramp Down Period. For more bespoke
Services, such as Applications Support Service (4th Line), Fujitsu Services
shall use reasonable endeavours to identify any variable elements and the
associated cost drivers, however if this not possible Fujitsu Services shall
explain in the Ramp Down Report:

a) why this is the case; and

b) any information Fujitsu Services will need to be able to provide
the information required to be included in the Ramp Down
Report.

11.1.3 Upon receipt of the Ramp Down Report, Post Office shall review this report and
provide feedback to Fujitsu Services. The Parties shall promptly meet to
discuss Post Office’s feedback and based on the agreed outputs of the
meeting, Fujitsu Services shall amend the Ramp Down Report and the details
of which Services will constitute Variable Services. This process shall be
completed within 6 months of the date of the request for the report from Post
Office.

11.1.4 Once the Ramp Down Report is agreed, if requested by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services shall apply the relevant principles contained in the Ramp Down Report
when developing the pricing mechanism for the relevant Exit Plan which shall
apply during the ramp down of the relevant Variable Service.

11.1.5 Where a cost saving is achieved by Fujitsu Services as a result of the reduction
of volumes or scope of a Variable Service to be delivered by Fujitsu Services
during the Ramp Down Period these cost savings will be passed on to Post
Office as a reduction in the Charges.

11.1.6 Any Disputes in relation to this paragraph 11 shall be resolved in accordance
with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.
Schedule E Version 9.0
Page 22 of 36
CONFIDENTIAL

11.2. Post Office shall, on termination of a Variable Service, be permitted to ramp down such
Variable Service. This shall work as follows:

11.2.1

11.2.2

11.2.3

11.2.4

11.2.5

On or after providing notice to terminate a Variable Service, Post Office shall
notify Fujitsu Services of any period during which it wishes to ramp down such
Variable Service (the “Ramp Down Period”) and how it wishes to ramp down
such Variable Service. Any such Ramp Down Period shall not extend beyond
the expiry of the Agreement.

For a minimum of the relevant termination notice period following the receipt of
the notice to terminate such Variable Service, that Variable Service shall
continue to be delivered (and paid for) in full.

During the relevant termination notice period, Fujitsu Services shall produce an
Exit Plan in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Schedule E which shall set out
how the Variable Service will be ramped down and the reductions in the
Charges resulting from such ramp down.

The Variable Service shall be ramped down from the end of the relevant
termination notice period, except that Post Office may elect to ramp down the
Service Desk Service at any stage after the first 3 months of any termination
notice period for such Service.

Where a Variable Service is terminated, the impact on the remaining
Transitional Support Services shall be determined and any variations to the
remaining Services (including any changes to the Charges) shall be agreed
between the Parties and implemented in accordance with the Change Control
Procedure.

fit for purpose, stable and operable services to Post Office to the agreed levels and quality of
service for those services.

delivered to Post Office are proactive and supportive, taking a collaborative approach to
knowledge and skills sharing, benefiting Post Office and the Tower Contractors.

1.4 Each Tower Contractor delivers services using an integrated (through strong interfaces),
innovative and strategic approach in accordance with Good Industry Practice. Such approach
carried out by each Tower Contractor shall include (but not be limited to) the use of appropriate
and cost effective tools, properly skilled and experienced staff, and continuous improvement
strategies.

1.5 Each Tower Contractor is focussed on maintaining, delivering and improving user
support, user experience, and customer satisfaction in relation to any and all services. Each
Tower Contractor acknowledges that the maintenance, delivery and improvement of such
factors or items are critical to the effectiveness of any and all services provided to Post Office.

1.6 Each Tower Contractor, and relevant functions of Post Office, works collaboratively
together in relation to the provision of the services, and receipt of those services by Post Office.

1.7 Each Tower Contractor shall work with Post Office (and other Tower Contractors, as
appropriate) to enable and further improve proper and robust assurance regimes in relation to
the delivery of services by Tower Contractors in accordance with agreed service requirements
and service levels for those services.

potential providers of services.

1.9 Each Tower Contractor shall conduct its activities in relation to any services it provides
