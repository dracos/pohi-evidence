I have pulled together a draft briefing note for counsel which lifts heavily from the advice note prepared by Jonathan
Swift QC in February. We can provide this (once finalised) to Jeff Onions and Tony Robinson ahead of back-to-back
meetings with each of them, ideally next week. Is there any update from Jane on the counsel point (further to Andy's
email below)? Once I have the green light from you, I will set up meetings with Jeff and Tony.

Gavin is tied up until 2pm and has not looked at this draft note yet but for the sake of efficiency, I thought it best to
send it to you in its current form so you and Gavin can be looking at this in parallel.

Having discussed this with Andy, we were of the same mind that this need not be a traditional “instructions” document.
The attached note plus the letter of claim and claim form should give Jeff and Tony what they need to get them thinking
about the issues ahead of the meetings.

I'm happy to discuss the note if that would be helpful.

Thanks

Please find attached our Work Plan for responding to the LOC that encompasses the strategy and timings we
discussed previously.

You'll see that the actions have been allocated between Tom P and Paul L and they'll crack on with this work next
week.

There are two key points that I'd be grateful if you could help with:

1. Counsel — Please could you get Jane's approval to instruct Counsel. Once you get the green light, Paul L will
put the wheels in motion. The first step will be short meetings with Tony Robinson and Jeff Onions to see who
is the best fit.

2. FJ-—Please can you setup an internal meeting at POL to discuss the issues around FJ (disclosure, unlawful
conspiracy claim, limitation issues, etc.). If this could be arranged for w/c 16 May when I'm back that would be
great.

Below is an eSRF in line with the figures we discussed the other day. I presume that this matter will be coming out of a
separate project budget rather than your BAU budget. If this means that you need us to provide something else to
support the budget request, please let me know.

Kind regards

Andy
