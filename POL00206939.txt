Chris

Please see the attached paper from finance which deals with Second Sight's questions relating to suspense
accounts. We redrafted the paper, a number of times now, and Rod has come back with further
comments. They should show up as tracked changes.

Rod felt that the paper as drafted did not fully deal with the question relating to suspense accounts as there may
be circumstances where a loss in branch is not capable of being identified or reconciled - he gives an example.
He feels without making this point the paper (as drafted without the tracked changes) is incomplete and may
cause POL to have to clarify further later.

Although the drafting can be improved on, I would welcome your views in relation to the position previously
discussed with the Working Group.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi both

Further, and hopefully near final version of the finance paper for Second Sight. Grateful if you could both cast
your eyes over this and let me have any final comments.

Best wishes
