Dear Sir or Madam

Thank you for your recent enquiry regarding the vacant post of Subpostmaster (1) at
Craig y don, 21 Queens Road, Craig y don. Your application will be considered if
you will complete and return the attached official application form together with the
items listed at appendix B, not later than 30 January 1998. The issue of the
application form does not imply that you will be offered the appointment as

. Subpostmaster, your application being considered together with any others that may
be received.

The remuneration at the office is determined partly by an Assigned Office Payment
(A.O.P) paid in twelve equal instalments and partly by a variable volume related
Payment (called a Product Payment) which reflects the work transacted at an office
in an accounting period. The Product Payment is also paid monthly and is
calculated two months in arrears.

By way of example, based on last year’s traffic, the Product Payment would be
£23410.47 per annum which together with the Assigned Office Payment of
£14611.51 per annum equates to a total of £38021.98 per annum,

However, in recognition of the opportunity to operate a Post Office on behalf of
Post Office Counters Ltd, the remuneration paid for the first 12 month period will be
75% of the payment as above. The remuneration covers any attendance during
normal scheduled hours.

The opening hours of the office, which can be liable to variation, are normally:

900 : 530 Monday to Friday
900 : 1230 Saturday
