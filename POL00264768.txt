Subject: Horizon

Hi both
Lesley and Chris A today opened discussions with Deloittes about undertaking some assurance work on Horizon (Rod
Williams and Lesley are speaking to Fujitsu about this Andy so grateful if you do not).
POL00264768
POL00264768

To inform that work we are providing Deloittes with material we already have which gives us assurance about different
aspects of Horizon.

On the call today Lesley mentioned a number of documents we have which I need to provide to Deloittes and suggested
you both would be able to provide them.

They include:

1$027001 reports

Pen testing reports

Could you please let me have these and any other documents you might be have which record checks/audits of
information about the integrity of the Horizon system.

I need to get this information to them as early as possible tomorrow morning.
Best wishes
Belinda
