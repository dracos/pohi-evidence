Dear David

I hope you are well? Thank you for your help a couple of months ago regarding Sandsacre and Mrs Stockdale. Your
input was invaluable in getting the right information to finalise Post Office's defence to her claim.

As I may have mentioned to you, we are now in the process of preparing witness evidence with a deadline of 10
August.

At this stage, we will need a short statement from you which basically covers two points:

What would have happened if Liz had asked you any questions about the Acknowledgment of Appointment she had to
sign, on 8 May 2014? Also, whether she in fact did ask you any questions about this (if you remember).

What you knew, if anything, about the experience of the assistant Diana Daniel, who Liz took on as staff from the
previous subpostmistress. Did you know she had been working in the branch before Liz took it on?

I have attached a draft statement, some of which is based on our previous discussions. I have included various
questions in there in yellow for us to discuss which develop the above. We also need to cover a bit about your career/
job background as standard at the start of the statement. Finally, I have also attached 4 documents which we will need
to refer to.

Please could we arrange a time to speak to run through this? This Friday or next Tuesday are looking free for me at
the moment, if either suits you? I will then prepare a more complete draft for you to review.

If you are going to be away on holiday soon, please let me know.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. It is much appreciated. If you need any help clearing your desk for time to
deal with this, please let me know and I can ask for help on this.
