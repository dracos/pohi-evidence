Hi — I think the response to SS Part2 should be in the same form as our responses to SS’s individual case reports, i.e. a
letter form POL, signed by Angela.

Absent any objection, Caroline — could you please do the honours (we’ll need two — one for M0127 on 10.07.14 and the
other for M022 on 11.07.14)?

All
I'm happy with the latest draft and have attached a clean version.

I've also attached the "ATM retract note" that can be sent out with this letter.

Just confirm — who is sending this? It's still got the BD sign off but has removed the BD letter headings so just want to be
sure.

Dear all
Please find attached Belinda and Rodric’s changes to this letter (tracked).

Andy, it would be good to reference any information or evidence that we have — do we have anything in a format that
can be appended?

These changes need to be agreed and then the letter signed off by Chris.

Many thanks and best wishes

Please find attached a draft letter to M022's lawyers with POL's comments on the draft Part 2 report.
Angela is happy with this. Your comments are welcomed.

Once this letter is signed off, we'll produce a similar letter for M127.

I’ve nothing to add to the draft as it is pretty much what we sent to SS previously. Are you submitting the draft to Belinda

Draft attached — this is based on the comments we sent to SS previously and which SS have not addressed.

BD is on the record as acting for POL on M022 so I've assumed that this letter will come from us to Mr Corner's solicitors.
We can do a similar letter for M127 — she has now instructed Aver so we (BD) can write direct to them.

I sent the doc last night. I have spoken to Andy parsons, he’ll pull together some comments based on our previous

assessment and then let you have them to add/amend/comment.

We can decide on Monday how to get POL’s comments to the other party and whether the ‘mediation statement’ is the
best vehicle for that.

Subject: Fwd: Mediation for M022 and M127

Please see below. Tony has decided that he wants the SS ATM report to issue to the parties marked up Provisional and
draft. Not approved by POL and not discussed by the Working Group."

Tony has not forwarded his decision to the whole of the WG but I know he has been very tied up today. I have discussed
with Chris. He is content. The way forward now will be for POL to polish off its comments on the document and attach
them to our mediation statement (or whatever mechanism) so that POL's comments are part of the information
available to the applicant. Rod will need to get lines sorted for mediation to address the point about how to deal with
the document if raised in discussion.

It will be helpful to have Angela's input into this.

Best wishes

I attach an updated DRAFT version of the ATM section of Part 2. We have taken account of POL’s comments on the
previous draft, but may still wish to make further changes in due course.

We’d be happy for this to be disclosed to CEDR as a draft document for both M022 and M0127.

We always envisaged that both Part 1 and Part 2 would be living documents that continue to be updated in the light of
new information.

Subject: Mediation for M022 and M127

All

Please find below a message from Tony.

We have learnt that CEDR has fixed the dates for the mediation in M22 and M127 for next week. By then the
Part 2 extract will not have been discussed by the WG and we will not have discussed whether to change our
original decision that M22 would not be accompanied by what would at the time of that decision have been a
document which we had not seen. As far as M127 is concerned, we were due to discuss on July 10th whether
to forward the Part 2 extract as part of the mediation pack. We took the precaution in the final SS reports in
both cases to say that there might be further documents.

lam sure that we are all very reluctant to postpone the mediations.

I would like your views please.

Tony
