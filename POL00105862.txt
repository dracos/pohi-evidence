Attachments: Letter to BBC - Complaint re Panorama - Final version(208818673_2).DOCX; Redline - Letter to BBC.docx

Dear all

Please find attached what is hopefully the final version of the letter to the BBC. We have incorporated
Mark's and Jane's most recent comments and Rodric has reviewed the revisions.

we have included some additional references to the BBC Editorial Guidelines
I also attach a redline against the last version circulated so that you can see the changes.

We would recommend that this letter should come from CMS rather than POL. This is more appropriate
because we are writing to the BBC Legal team.

Assuming that there are no further changes, we will send this letter out at close of play today.
In terms of next steps, the process should run as follows:

* The BBC should investigate the complaint and provide a response. They state that they will try
to do so within 10 working days.

* If you are dissatisfied with the response, then the procedures state that the complainant should
explain in writing why within 20 working days, in which event the matter may then proceed to the BBC’S
Editorial Complaints Unit or to "relevant senior management".

* The final stage in the process is an appeal to the BBC Trust

We will, of course, notify you as soon as we receive a response

Kind regards

Susan
