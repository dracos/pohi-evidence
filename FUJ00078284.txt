1.1 Planning

1.1.1.

1.44

Monthly Summary

The focus within Pathway continues to be against the Level 1 plan for
NRz, the key Milestones dates from this plan are used by the Checkpoint
and SiWG meetings. The revised Level 1 plan, version 6.0 is being used
for reporting to the meetings. However, the planned dates for MOT and
E2E identified in Version 6.0 have failed to be met, due to slips in the
start and completion of System Test Final Passes and disagreement with
the Horizon over the timing of Model Office Test. There was little scope
or attempt to mitigate the slips and the current forecast dates become
accepted as the revised ‘planned’ dates. There have also been
occurrences of new tasks being added to the plan, without prior
programme agreement and of development work being performed
without prior authorisation of a Change Proposal. Revised dates for
MOT, Live Trial and NRO were agreed late December and will be
incorporated into the detailed plans in early January. A revised Level 1
plan version 7.0 will be developed and issued also in early January.

NR2

The update cycle is now running against the Level 3 plans with
subsequent roll-up to Level 1 and Level 2, where appropriate, and
reporting into NR2 meetings.

The programme established at Level 3 to meet the timescales for Version
6.0 of the Level 1 plan showed significant slip in the System Test Final
Pass phase. This resulted in a slip to the start date of MOT week 1, to
January 1999, against a plan of 14° December 1998. There was little scope
or attempt to mitigate the slips to the System Test Final Pass dates. A
revised plan has now agreed, late December, with MOT week 1 starting
15" February 1999, and these revisions will be incorporated into the
detail plans in early January 1999.

1.1.2 NR2+

The design plan has been developed and baselined for some time and is
now being updated and monitored. The plan was distributed to the
other departments to act as a map to develop the plans for their
departments. These departments, particularly development, continued
to be pressed to provide their inputs to the NR2+ plan, still without
much success thus far. The planning department will now distribute a

ICL PATHWAY Commercial in Confidence Programme Office

generic plan for development of NR2+ for review and approval, based on
the information contained in the on-line standards. The plans will be
reviewed against the requirements for the release to ensure that all
activities planned for NR2+ are captured in the plan. A draft P.B.S. has
been derived from the RCD, Design Plan and discussion with the Release
Manager. This needs to be reviewed with the programme to ensure that
all the NR2+ activity is covered.

1.1.3 Planning

Planning within the programme has during the last few months
concentrated on the prediction of revised start and end dates for
activities. These revisions have not been supported by evidence of the
manpower required or resource availability to each activity in the plan to
meet these forecasts.

As part of Tracking & Control enhancements, it is proposed to include
activity estimated effort, resource allocation and forecast to complete in
the plan which will allow the calculation of scheduled EV for Release
NRa2+. These proposals will be presented to the Programme in January.

1.1.4 AMS RealTime software application

The issue of the availability of AMS RealTime software licenses remains,
there is now an agreement between ICL Corporate and AMS. However
no funding exists within ICL corporate to purchase licenses based on this
agreement until the end of Quarter 1 1999 and this will prevent any
further progress in the implementation of RealTime at TSC and
Kidsgrove and the purchase of additional licenses for Feltham, unless
funded separately.

1.1.5 Issues

Although rate of return of turn-around documents remains reasonable,
the issue with the support of the planning process from the
Directors/Li/L2 managers remains.

Managers are not using plans to determine and drive the work to be
performed, they are merely using them to record what has been
achieved.

The recently developed detail plan for Audit showed that whilst Level 1
and 2 managers may agree a plan for a specific piece of work, this is not

Commercial in Confidence Page 5 of 32
FUJ00078284
FUJ00078284

ICL PATHWAY Commercial in Confidence Programme Office

being communicated to those doing the work, to the effect that the work
is not being performed within the agreed planned timescales.

Reporting in the Turnarounds is often at variance from that reported in
the same weeks progress report.

Slippage reported is often being accepted as the new ‘planned’ date, and
consequently there are rarely attempts to mitigate the slippage.

Obtaining the NR2+ plans from the managers for post Design activities,
specifically Development.

Lack of interest in the planning awareness events, poor response to the
last event and note sent requesting best timing for the events.

The move to B3 has the propensity to exacerbate some of the issues
above, because the planning department is now more remote from the
programme than before.

1.1.6 Staffing

The group has now moved to B3, which whilst it provides more
acceptable accommodation, leaves the group more on the periphery of
the Programme.

1.1.7 Last Months (December) Activities

1. Conclude the addition of resource man day estimates to the Design
plan and agree the remainder of the implementation plan.
The method of achieving this has now been agreed, the
inclusion of resource man day effort estimates into the Design
plan will be concluded early in January 1999.

2. Complete the addition of all activities to the vertical plans such that
all horizontal projects activities can be extracted from them.
The two specific projects identified, so far, are Audit and RoDB
Move, the activities for the former have been baselined and
are included in the vertical plans. The RoDB Move plan is still
iterating and the addition of the activities into the vertical
plans will not be concluded until early January 1999.

3. Agree process and procedures document and any amendments to on
line standards.
The draft process and procedure documents have been issued
within Planning, they need further reviewing before formal
issue.

Commercial in Confidence Page 6 of 32
ICL PATHWAY Commercial in Confidence Programme Office

Discuss planning awareness requirements with Level 1 managers and
agree revised, if appropriate, course of action.

A note was issued to 15 managers, which drew but a single
response.

1.1.8 Next Months (January) Activities

Complete the generation and agreement of the P.B.S. for NR2+.
Complete the Tracking & Control enhancements for the NR2+
Design Plans.

Develop and ‘approve’ NR2+ Development plans.

1.2 Planning Co-ordination

1.2.1 Monthly Summary

1.2.1.1 New Release 2 High Level Plan

Exception reports continue to be produced against the version 6.0
baseline.

A disappointing response from the Directors and Level 1 managers to
the exception reports.

The revised Model Office dates will be included into the plan and
issue during January.

1.2.1.2 Handshake Milestones

Progress this month has been hampered by the on-going
negotiations.

Communications with POCL re: the status of Handshake Milestones
has been concluded and a meeting will be established to review, ona
on-going basis, the status of existing and new milestones.

1.2.1.3 IWG

Meetings continue no issues to report this period.

1.2.1.4 CAPS Card Enablement plan

e Further work has been carried out this period.

¢ Peter Robinson has been involved in mapping the CAPS plan onto
Pathway’s volumetrics, the results should be available early January.

¢ The number of Post Office’s in each BA Districts has also been added
to the CAPS plan.

1.2.1.5 POCL Integrated programme plan (IPP)

e Review of POCL’s IPP plan has been overtaken by events and will be
reviewed early in the New Year.

e We should expect a new version following completion of the
negotiations.

1.2.1.6 Technical

¢ Outline discussions within the Planning team have started re: the
use of Web Technology with the planning arena. The sourcing of the
publishing tool has been delayed due to my contact crashing his car!

e I have met with AMS re: the level of support and have received
written confirmation of the changes that have been put in place to
guarantee support in the future.

e In order to maintain a backup of all the planning data stored on the
server we will have purchase some additional software.

1.2.1.7 Planning development

e The generic life cycle model has been developed and now requires
testing. We are awaiting the start of development planning for NR2+
to trial this model. A review of additional “Quality” checkpoints will
be undertaken by the planning team.

e The production of a Level 2 plan has been passed over to Laurence
Price for completion.

1.2.2 Issues

¢ Without the ongoing, visible support of the Directors and Level 1
managers, the planning reporting process is of limited value. This
issue must be resolved at the Pathway management level and
communicated to the “Work Face”.

1.3 Programme Control / Tracking

1.3.1. Monthly Summary

All Metrics reports as well as the weekly NR2 Progress reports are now
produced as part of normal operation. Unfortunately there is an
increasing trend of late submissions of progress reports despite issuing
reminders.

A Finance Review was held in the month concentrating on the cost
performance of the Customer Service directorate.

1.3.2 Metrics

No major issues concerning the Metrics reports and production of these
have slipped into routine maintenance. However these reports are
dependent on receipt of weekly progress reports being submitted by the
Wednesday noon deadline. Unfortunately several managers are not
meeting this deadline and repeated emails have already been sent as
reminders.

1.3.3 PinICL MIS

There have been no new developments on PinICL MIS. A CP was raised
seeking authority for funds to develop and implement Root Cause
Analysis Work. This has been capped by the Finance Director and

Commercial in Confidence Page 9 of 32
FUJ00078284
FUJ00078284

ICL PATHWAY Commercial in Confidence Programme Office

further work is needed to provide a more detailed breakdown of
development costs.

A full review of PinICL MIS is needed following the work of the PinICL
Clearance task-force and this is envisaged to be sometime next month.

1.3.4 Pathway Budget Forecast

The monthly Finance Review was held concentrating on the cost
performance of Customer Service.

The conversion programme from Excel spreadsheets to Access
continues. There are still a few technical problems requiring resolution
on report production. It is intended to start production of regular
monthly cost reports from 1999.

Given that not all departments’ budget forecast for 1998 was baselined, it
is important to do so for 1999. The planning horizon must now extend to
at least March 2000 to comply with ICL Group’s requirements.

In the last week of December notification was given of a Fujitsu “due
diligence” review to be held in the 1* week of January 1999. Some effort
was therefore spent on formatting all historic DEVCOST spreadsheets in

preparation for this review as well as integrity checks to ensure that
approved cost CPs have been correctly implemented.

1.3.5 General

The Programme Control/Tracking Study document has been passed
onto the Director, Programmes for internal review.

Reminders were issued for outstanding responses to the questionnaire
issued a few months ago and a few more have been returned completed.

1.3.6 Issues

No major issues this month.

13.7 Staffing

Despite amending the job description to align with the role of a Project
Control Officer, there has still been no further progress in filling the
vacancy of Numerical Analyst.

Change Management

The volume of CPs for NR2 being raised both internally and externally
has stayed at approximately 10 per week for the last month. The total
number in the process for NR2 is now 82, of which 39 are awaiting
Horizon’s sign off of the associated CCN. As stated last month (and
before), some serious discussions should be had with Horizon to either
approve the changes or agree a deferral to Release 2+.

All of the Quality & Risk Directorate, FELo1 Development, and Design
now enter their CP impacts directly into PCMS. This process will be
rolled out to all FELo1 impactors in the short term, then external ICL
Pathway groups (not external suppliers).

Document Management

The volume of documents and reviews continues at a steady level.

The document baseline activity is progressing well against plan in most
areas. We are still waiting for a statement of which documents are to
reside in which worksets from Requirements and Development. This will
extend the plan beyond the original timescale and hence will result in
increased external consultancy cost.

The training of staff in the new processes and PVCS usage has begun,
although some had to be called off later in the month due to ill health.
This will resume when Angela returns.

Problem Management

The Problem Review Forum and progress chasing continues as normal.
The PinICL Defect Register shows a levelling off in the number of
PinICLs for NR2 (350 to 377), and the Incident Register shows an
increase of about 75 (425 to 500).

The Problem Management processes recently introduced have relied
upon a high level of discipline (process adherence) to ensure smooth
functioning and reporting of the process. This has not occurred.

A review of the new processes, their use, and the responsibilities of the
various parties involved in Problem Management will be conducted to
ensure that:

e the processes meet the Programme’s requirements and are

understood by all

2. New Release 2
2.1 NR2 Summary

2.1.1 General

December was spent by Pathway attempting to convince BA and POCL
that the system was ready for an MOT, a testing phase that is still some
months before the Data Centre is migrated.

Pathway had requested an intermediate test to prove the POCL back end
systems, this was replaced by a number of Pre-Proving tests, the
contents of which were defined by the sponsors.

One of these was with CAPS over a four day period and was deemed by
CAPS to have been successful.

The others were with POCL and consisted of a 2 day and then 4 day test.
Although the incidents detected were mainly minor and the tests
deemed successful in what they attempted, POCL still felt that further
tests should be attempted before MOT, testing a wider selection of
requirements.

On the 23" December a review was held with Horizon where Pathway
and Horizon continued the hold different positions on when an MOT
should commence. It was finally agreed that Pathway would support two
further, additional, 6 day test cycles during January before an MOT
started on 15‘ February 1999. As part of the agreement for Pathway to
support these additional test streams it was agreed that Horizon would
re-visit the length of the Live Trial in order to minimise the impact on
the national roll Out.

The National Roll Out date is therefore planned to be during August,
early August if Pathway are fully supported by Horizon and late August
if there is no support.

POCL have re-structured it’s testing team to ensure they receive full
visibility of any issues during future test cycles and have promised early
feedback on any potential problems within their system.

Final Pass System Test activities for EPOSS, MIS and BPS have
completed and the Final Pass of Business Integration Testing and
Migration Testing have completed.

The management of the volume of PinICLs and their rectification
between the various test stages continues to cause concern. Daily

meetings are now in operation with Horizon, during testing cycles, to
decide how best to progress new incidents resolution.

Commercial in Confidence Page 15 of 32

ICL PATHWAY Commercial in Confidence Programme Office

3. NON-ISDN
3.1 Progress

No significant issues have been raised with Frame Relay in either
Technical or End to End testing.

Earlier this month further results were published from BT/Energis
exercise to re-visit all the Non-ISDN sites. A further 80 sites have now
been identified as supporting ISDN thus reducing the total of Non-ISDN
sites to 370. On these figures it is anticipated that the number of Frame
Relay sites will be less than 30.

3.2 Issues

The proposed PSTN solution needs to be proven and_ potential
performance evaluated to ensure that it will be able to cope with the
peak workload at any single counter office is required. If PSTN
performance is very poor then this could potentially increase the number
of Frame Relay sites.

These comprised file naming problems, the “Time synchronisation”
problem which switched from Legato to MAESTRO to the Windows NT
system parameters. This problem alone consumed over a_ week.
Although the Audit system was not able to be proven to pass the BIT
testing, by the end of December, end to end runs were demonstrated
with MAESTRO and confirmed by BIT.

Of the four utilities within the Extraction and Filter, the sealer and
Oracle utilities were delivered before target and the other two delivered
on time.

5.1.1 Audit System

Gatherer, Sealer, Hoarder, Deleter, Retriever, Legato, MAESTRO.

5.1.1.1 Testing Status

A tremendous effort was made by all participants in the BIT testing. A
number of fast paths were delivered as each obstacle was knocked down
in turn.

Problems were encountered until December 22", when there appeared
to be a major breakthrough when the “Time synchronisation” problem
was finally solved and a successful end to end run undertaken by
MAESTRO.

It should be pointed out here that we still need to test with Tivoli and
Security (encryption).

Maestro has been used to run the Audit System end to end in writing to
the Legato files on the DLT’s. At an audit meeting on 23/12/98, BIT
confirmed that there are no outstanding PinICLs inhibiting them from
continuing with the testing through the Christmas period into the New
Year.

5.1.1.2 PinICLs

Of the 46 PinICLs raised so far, only 9 have resulted from software
development. The majority have been raised due to naming or directory
problems because standards for host files have either been mis-applied
or incorrect.

5.2 Issues

5.2.1 Tivoli

e Integration with existing software

5.2.2 Security

e Integration with existing software

5.2.3 Change Proposals

e CP for logging MAESTRO files.
e CP for AP Reconciliation.

5.3 Extraction and Filter

5.3.1 Design

The Extraction and Filter HLD has been baselined, and all four software

utilities specified have now been delivered into PCMS.

5.3.2 Plan

Detailed planning has been done for the first two weeks of the new year

taking us up to the MOT rehearsal confidence test.

5.3.3 Delivery Strategy

Subject to ratification by Design the three stages look as follows:

5.3.3.1 MOT

Deliverables for MOT are still being defined. The deliverables are the
minimum necessary to meet the acceptance requirements (ie an interim
solution). The full Extraction and Filter system is being delivered for Live
Trial.

There will be more PIT building and testing of the MOT RiposteImporte
UK and NR2 Query with Retriever in the last week of 1998.

The Workstation is scheduled to be built in the Secure Room at Feltham
week commencing 4/1/99.

5.3.3.2 Live Trials

Deliverables for Live Trials is the completeness of the development of
the HLD Extraction and Filter document produced by Michelle Myles.
Jan Holmes who specified the requirements for audit has confirmed that
he does not have a requirement for GUI interfaces to any of these tools.
He only requires batch tools. He may at a later date, after the process has
been used for some time, ask for such enhancements. However, it was
agreed at the meeting on 2/12/98 that the requirement for GUI interfaces
would remain in SD/DES/o72 vo. but that GUIs would not be
implemented for NR2.

5.3.3.3 NR2+

Deliverables for NR2+ are enhancements to the GUI interfaces as
specified by Michelle, plus further usability enhancements as mentioned
in Jan Holmes and David Gent memos. These refer to the usability of
retrieving using the existing Legato interfaces.

The current intention is to broaden the usability requirements with

Legato to see if our future requirements can form a basis for the future
Legato development.

5.4 Issues

1. Support for Brian Orzel utility
2. Dependency on future GUI interfaces

6. Reference Data

6.1 Status at 31/12/98

Daily incremental updates of the ‘Live’ reference data have been
occurring throughout December. This has included Advanced changes
held back until the OBC process was in use. Unfortunately procedures at
RDS Chesterfield (now corrected) were allowing a mixture of types of
data in files and this has caused delays in release of some of the data.
This was compounded by delivery of a Cash Account spreadsheet to the
new format (see below) before agreement to us of the format.

Type ‘B’ data - sign off of the non-AlS feeds has been achieved.

OSG (Operational Service Group) continued the validation of the ‘Live’
reference data however the mix of data along with the incorrect format
of Cash Account spreadsheet delayed delivery of data prior to Christmas.
The changes required to update the data from the problems identified by
OSG were received at the end of December and the intention is to
progress these to the OSG test counters, along with a rebuild to MOT
baseline, in early January.

The Tivoli connection fore OSG counters is still being progressed by
Customer Services.

APS backlog validation is still causing concern. Changes in the desktop
appear to have affected the automated test scripts and changes need to
be investigated. There is a significant problem in resourcing necessary
skills for resolving issues with the testing mechanisms.

Cash Account mappings and syncronisation of RDS/Pathway/TIP will be
tested during January. Systems directorate are producing test scripts
which should produce a complete run of the cash account which will
then be validate by TIP.

We understand that the ITIP validation for Item Transaction Mode and
Organisational Unit has now been removed.

The Customer Services paper to ensure that an RDMC system is available
for migration of the 1c counters to NR2 has been reviewed and actions
agreed. Customer Services anticipate a revision of this paper to be
produced.

Replacement MiMan and MiEcco mappings have been received from
Pathway from Horizon. A proposal to test the new mappings, as a
separate exercise, is being discussed.

7. Roll-out Database
7.1 Status as at 31/12/98

7.1.1 Support

Theoretically as a live service RoDB 2.5 should not be part of the ongoing
project agenda. However as the moving of RoDB to managed service in
the data centres has not yet been completed, it is difficult for the various
service levels provide a complete service. Therefore in the interim a co-
ordination role is being undertaken in order to facilitate and cover any
gaps (in service) that may appear.

In order to bring RoDB support into the line with live service levels that
used by other areas of Pathway it is necessary to place RoDB under full
managed service within the data centres. A plan is about to be presented
for approval that will accommodate such a move. Due to the time
required to complete such a move RoDB would have been left
unsupported for a period of time that was unacceptable. To redress this a
short term plan to place RoDB under a level of support has been
implemented. This implementation has meant that there are gaps
between service levels that would not normally apply. In order to fill
these gaps in the short term, several areas of Pathway have extended
their expertise and are accommodating additional duties. It is
anticipated that many of these additional duties will no longer be
needed early in February the (anticipated) start of the move of the live
RoDB server to the Bootle data centre.

7.1.2 PiniCL

The problems with the supplier interfaces have now been fixed.

The data required to enable correction of incorrect data migrated from
2.4 or faulty data supplied as part of the new data load into 2.5 was
received late in the month. Scripts were prepared and have been run, no
further problems in this area have been reported.

7.1.3 Performance

There have been some observations raised by the users as to possible
performance difficulties with one or two specific RoDB functions. In
order to mitigate this; a housekeeping exercise is being run early January
and it is hoped that this will alleviate part of the problem. A workshop is
also being arranged early in the new year in order to establish the

Commercial in Confidence Page 26 of 32

FUJ00078284

relationship between the Server configuration the current access via the
LAN and the perceived performance problems. The result of this
workshop will be to establish the possible, define a method of proving
the actual and the eventual resolution, of the causes of the lack of
performance.

7.2 Plans to move RODB/ACDB server to the Data Centres

7.2.1 Long Term

It is expected that the stage management plan for the upgrading of
RoDB and its establishment at both Bootle and Wigan data centres will
be available for approval mid January 1999. This plan is being produced
upon the assumption that the RoDB workstations will be a dedicated
machine and have no non RoDB applications upon them, as per the
Pathway security policy.

7.2.2 Short Term

In the short term moving the physical RoDB server to Bootle requires
the moving of the AcDB as well ( both are currently located at FELo1). It
is not possible (due to contractual obligations) to decommission the
AcDB box and have no cover for the period of the move. Therefore a
backup server will be created and put in place for this period.

It is anticipated that the short term move will be completed by 15
February 1999.

7.3 Pearce Interface

A draft of the user requirements for this interface have been issued by
Implementation but cannot be impacted until a corrected version is
issued.

7.4 RoDB 2.6

The user requirements for this are not yet available but are expected
from Implementation sometime in January.

7.5 Actions in focus during the next period

1. Delivery to live service of any 2.5 system fixes outstanding

2. Daily operational support for the system at an application/database
level

3. Completion of a fully, scoped, documented and reviewed plan for
the move of RoDB to the data centres

4. Receipt of the 2.6 requirements and plan for delivery

5. Receipt of the Pearce interface definitions.

6. Progression toward partial managed service for RoDB established at
the Bootle data centre.

8. New Release 2 Plus

8.1 Monthly Summary

Comments have been received from the customer on the Release
Contents Description version 0.6 - these need to be addressed in parallel
with the comments on the SADD version 5.1 which are being handled by
John Dicks. A target of early February has been set for the updated
versions of the SADD and RCD to be issued for review. SFS V3.3 was sent
out for review in mid December.

Little progress has been made on producing a full High level Plan for
NR2+. Some progress has been made on producing Development plans
but further work is required to both create new plans and review initial
drafts that have been produced. Test Analysis planning has started but
is delayed pending agreement on a revised T&l organisation structure for
NR2+.

Work on LFS is progressing well with several meetings with the SAPADS
and SAT teams having been held during December. Considerable effort
has been made within POCL to achieve the dates required for providing
draft CARs before Christmas.

Design activities have started to slip, mainly as a result of the impact of
NRz2 PinICLs and the late approval of the LFS CCN. The end of January
design deadline for the business applications is expected to be held,
except for LFS which is planned to complete in mid February.

KMS Design documents are all out for review and are planned to be
baselined by the end of January, although some KMS design will have to
be re-visited in March when the VPN design is completed.

A meeting was held to review the impacts for the SPM Smart card CP
which has been given approval to proceed with the High Level Design
only, this is planned to complete by the end of January. The full
approval will be sought from the CCB when the revised impacts
(showing a greater breakdown) have been collated.

Designs for Internal Services and Technical Infrastructure are generally
being delivered later than the end of January, currently the latest is the
end of March. Further services such as Estate Management may be
included and the dates for design have not been planned as the
feasibility study is awaited.

The Soft EVP CCN has still not been signed although there was some
useful discussion and progress was made during December. This is
being followed up by Mike Coombs with Dave Miller.

Formal test scripts for CAPS Online Enquiry were completed in
December and formal system testing is planned to start in January.
Informal tests were successfully performed by Development in
December to prove the build worked OK.

The proposed PSTN solution depends on a change in Tivoli software
which is being discussed and a CP has been raised to get budgetary
approval for the work.

The VPN software has been undergoing tests to ensure that it meets our
performance and crypto requirements. Some issues have been raised
with Utimaco as a result of this testing and further work is required. A
suitable resource is being sought to continue with the VPN design and
proving work. VPN work-shops are planned in early January to resolve
some of the outstanding issues.

A new team has been set up at Kidsgrove for APS Counter development
and they are taking over the development of the NR2+ code and its
integration with the NR2 baseline. Work continues on the AP Client
Migration Strategy, responsibility for this has now been transferred to
Robert Nikiel. Expanded security statements for Landis & Gyr have been
prepared and approved internally within Pathway for technical and
Contractual/Commercial implications. These were sent to POCL who
have identified an omission which is being addressed by Tom Parker.

8.2 Issues

Some slippage on Design schedules has occurred - Design management
are trying to contain this.

A full set of development plans is still required.

Confirmation of the T& structure for NR2+ is required as this is delaying
the completion of Test analysis plans.

The proposal by the sponsors to run Multi-Benefit Model Office tests in
1999 has yet to be fully impacted. Once further understood, the NR2+
test activities in 1999 must take full account of these activities. (An
initial plan of Multi Benefit testing was prepared in December).

Resolution of the Security issue with Landis & Gyr is critical - without
this Pathway will not be allowed to have their Security module and

would therefore not be able to support Quantum or the new Smart card
SPM.

The content of the Performance release NR2.1 needs to be agreed and
implementation scheduled.

The NR2 KPR and deferred PinICLs are a possible risk to NR2+.

The testing strategy for NR2+ needs to be reviewed in respect of User
testing i.e. Model Office and End to End testing.
