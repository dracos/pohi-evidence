Dear Mr Knight,

Thank you for your letter of 14 November about the Initial
Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme and your constituent, Mr
Lee Castleton.

I would like to clarify that Post Office has never indicated
that it would be willing to mediate in all cases where Second
Sight recommended mediation. I can also confirm that Post
Office has had no direct contact with Mr Castleton since he
entered the Scheme either about mediation or any other matter.

However, the Scheme is overseen by a Working Group with an
independent Chair, Sir Anthony Hooper, and comprises Justice
for Subpostmaster Alliance (JFSA) Post Office and Second
Sight. I have therefore passed your letter to Sir Anthony
Hooper who may wish to respond.

Yours sincerely,

Paula Vennells
Chief Executive
