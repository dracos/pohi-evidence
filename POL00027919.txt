SCHEDULE A1
PREFERRED SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR
1. INTRODUCTION
14 In Clause 2 of this Agreement Post Office has stated that it is its present intention to appoint Fujitsu

Services as Preferred Systems Integrator with a wider scope of operation than the Infrastructure and
with the potential to include all Relevant IT Systems in that scope. The purpose of such appointment
would be to exploit the appropriate IT and services to drive Post Office’s business strategy. This
Schedule sets out the rights and obligations of a Preferred Systems Integrator and the terms upon
which Post Office would be willing to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator.

1.2 The Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship shall review opportunities to create
value for Post Office by Fujitsu Services taking on the Systems Integration of additional IT systems.
and services, and shall maintain a list of such opportunities in a Working Document.

2. SCOPE

21 For the purposes of this Schedule A1, “Preferred Systems Integrator” shall mean the person
appointed by Post Office from time to time to carry out the procurement, integration, provision and
management of any or all applications, infrastructure and services required by Post Office for the
purposes of integrating some or all of the following information technology systems:

2.1.1. any new IT system acquired by Post Office which is required by Post Office to interface with
the Infrastructure;

2.1.2 any existing IT system used by Post Office which interfaces or is required to interface with
the Infrastructure; or

2.1.3. any other IT system currently in use or acquired by Post Office after the Amendment Date
which is not required to interface with the Infrastructure, but excluding any system that is
provided as a shared information technology system with other parts of the Royal Mail
Group,

(each a “Relevant IT System”, together the “Relevant IT Systems”).

2.2 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, such responsibility may involve the Preferred Systems Integrator undertaking the
provision of operating, support, development and maintenance activities associated with Systems
Integration using either its own resources or by procuring some or all of such associated activities
from subcontractors. Where such associated activities are procured from third parties, the Preferred
Systems Integrator shall remain solely responsible to Post Office for their provision.

3. APPOINTMENT

3.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige Post Office to appoint Fujitsu Services as its sole Preferred
Systems Integrator. However, it is Post Office's present intention, subject to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3,
to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator within twelve months of the
Amendment Date.

3.2.2 which categories of Relevant IT Systems that initial appointment covers; and
3.2.3 the timing and extent of any subsequent additions to that scope.

3.3 Post Office's determination of the matters referred to in paragraph 3.2 shall be based on Post
Office's assessment of (a) the extent to which Fujitsu Services has met the criteria for selection of a
Preferred Systems Integrator as set out in paragraph 3.4, taking account of the matters set out in
paragraph 3.5 and (b) Fujitsu Services’ performance of its obligations under this Agreement as

monitored by Post Office and disclosed to Fujitsu Services in accordance with the processes set out
in Schedule A2.

3.4 Post Office's criteria for selecting a Preferred Systems Integrator will comprise the candidate's ability
to demonstrate (by reference where appropriate to any track record with Post Office) that it can, with

Infrastructure:

requirements;

3.4.2 manage third party service and product suppliers to deliver integrated solutions;
3.4.3 deliver continual improvements in levels of service;

products and services where these are demonstrably a better fit with Post Office's
requirements;

3.5.4 Fujitsu Services demonstrating in relation to at least one Service that they are best value for
money;

3.5.5 Fujitsu Services adopting new ways of working such as transparency on costing for new
proposals, not 'man marking’ (which means a situation where both Parties utilise individuals
to manage a Service or other aspects of the Services) and, where appropriate, adoption of
‘win-win’ as the way of resolving issues; and

3.5.6 when considering additions to the scope of Fujitsu Services’ Preferred Systems Integrator
role, its performance of that role in relation to its existing scope.

Post Office to do so. Fujitsu Services (having been appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator)
would be invited to bid in all such competitions.

3.7 The appointment of Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator will be terminated with
immediate effect upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement.

scope within which it has such a role reduced with immediate effect by Post Office in its sole
discretion:

System nominated by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 4; or

3.8.2 should Fujitsu Services fail to fulfil its obligations under this Schedule A1.

terminated or its scope reduced under paragraph 3.8, Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement to provide Systems Integration activities for the HNG-X Services shall continue in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.
