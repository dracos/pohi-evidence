This statement is further to the statement I made on 19" September 2008. I have today
handed to Robert Daily, Post Office Investigator details of wages paid to Peter Holmes for
the financial year 2007/08 and from April to September for the financial year 2008/09.

All wages paid to Peter Holmes were in cash and one month in arrears, i.e. he was paid
for the hours he worked in April at the beginning of May.

He was always paid on the 5" of each month and the cash was handed over in an
envelope that also contained a wage slip.

The details I have handed over are a copy of the details on the wage slip.

For the year 2007/08, Peter Holmes was paid £1,666.67 gross. After tax he received on
average just over £1,291.00.

For the period April to September for year 2008/09, Peter Holmes was paid £1,700.00
gross. After tax he received just over £1,330.00 except for his final wage which was
£1,390.60.

Peter Holmes was exempt from paying National Insurance as he was over 60.

Anything that is handwritten is for an internal accounting process.
