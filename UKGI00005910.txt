Subject: Readout of BNR-OL call

Quick readout:

OL opened with a brief history of his involvement, observing that there was cross party support at the outset but also acknowledging
a genuine question between SPMs who were guilty and those who had been mistreated.

He said that, while POL had set up the review and the SS report, he felt there were still some questions to be answered, and until a
genuinely independent person could look at the whole picture, the issues would persist. He felt Govt needed to understand (through
an independent reviewer) the scale of the problem before it could be decided what was to be done.

BNR responded that both she and SoS were keen to make sure OL understood the background. She made the points from her
speaking note around matters of law, CCRC and mediation.

OL felt the involvement of the CCRC was constructive and accepted that would take time.

BNR spoke about the progress on mediation, acknowledging that the POL contract was strict but rightly so, and that there were a
mixture of cases in the pile for mediation. They will take time to work through.

BNR explained that she had formally asked Tim Parker to look at the issue and explained his background.

OL was very positive about this, noting that TP would come to the issue fresh with no vested interests. He suggested this was the
right approach and BNR should set that out in her reply to AB. TP would need to look seriously at all the information including the
findings of SS.

OL suggested BNR run her plan past JA on Thursday before she replies to AB.

BNR said she would update OL after the JA meeting via his office. OL said the call had been immensely helpful.
