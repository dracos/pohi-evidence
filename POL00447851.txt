Common Issues Judgment

‘The problem with the Post Office witnesses
generally is they have become so entrenched over
the years’... ‘This entrenchment is particularly telling
in the Post Office witnesses who occupy the more
senior posts.’

‘They give me the impression that they simply
cannot allow themselves to consider the possibility
that the Post Office may be wrong, as the
consequences of doing so are too significant to
contemplate.’

Post Office... demonstrates the most dreadful
complacency, and total lack of interest in
investigating these serious issues, bordering on
fearfulness of what might be found if they were
properly investigated.’

‘Post Office... demonstrates a simple institutional
obstinacy or refusal to consider any possible
alternatives to their view’

Employee Engagement Trends since 2019

Trends on employee engagement are difficult to draw because of the inconsistent methodology used by Post Office to survey
employee engagement. However, the following are the conclusions drawn from the data available.

The most senior leaders Post Office became less engaged post 2019 and have remained less engaged — in 2019, the engagement
score for senior leaders was 57% (down 23% on 2018), higher than the Group average at 56%, but since then senior leadership
scores have been lower than the Group average. To demonstrate this, the McKinsey OHI notes that ‘Senior leaders are the most
critical’, the 2021 survey resulted in a -51 NPS for Senior Leaders vs a -8 NPS for the Group, the 2022 survey resulted in a—51 NPS
for Senior Leaders vs a -14 NPS for the Group.
