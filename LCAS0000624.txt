Claim No: 5 SZ 00651
IN THE SCARBOROUGH COUNTY COURT
BETWEEN
POST OFFICE LIMITED
Claimant
and
LEE CASTLETON
"5,
Defendant
DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM
Defence
1, Paragraphs I to 5 of the Particulars of Claim are admitted.
2. As to paragraph 6 of the Particulars of Claim, it is admitted that by March 2004 there

was an apparent shortfall in the account of Marine Drive Post Office of £25,758.75.
The Defendant avers however that the final audit, following which he was suspended
by the Claimant, took place on 23 March 2004. Upon his suspension, the Claimant
arranged for a temporary sub-postmaster to temporarily take over the Defendant’s
duties, In the premises, and without prejudice to the more general denial at paragraph
4 below, any apparent losses sustained after 23 March 2004 (including the pleaded
loss of £176 in relation to National Lottery game sales on 24 March 2004) are not
attributable to the Defendant.

3, In relation to the figure of £1,256.88 pleaded at paragraph 6 as a loss relating to
“Automated products”, the Defendant avers that this relates to the erroneous double-
crediting of the sum to the National Savings & Investment Bank account of one Mrs
Dorothy Constable (which for the complete avoidance of doubt was not done by the
Defendant), which sum was repaid to the Claimant by Mrs Constable in January
2005. Accordingly, it is denied that the Defendant has any liability in respect of that
particular head of loss.

agraph 7 of the Particulars of Claim is denied.

The Defendant repeatedly sought assistance from his managers within the Claimant
company during the period over which the apparent shortfall accumulated. No
assistance was forthcoming. The Defendant avers that any apparent shortfall is
entirely the product of problems with the Horizon computer and accounting system

used by the Claimant.

6. The Defendant further avers that, upon disclosure by the Claimant of the daily
balance snapshot documents created by the Defendant during the course of his tenure
as sub-postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, and which were removed from the
post office on the Defendant’s suspension, he will be able to demonstrate through a
manual reconciliation of the figures contained within those snapshots that the
apparent shortfalls are in fact nothing more than accounting errors arising from the
operation of the Horizon system. The Defendant will plead further and more fully in

this regard following disclosure.

7. Paragraphs 8 to 10 of the Particulars of Claim are denied.
Counterclaim
8. The Defendant repeats paragraphs I to 7 above.
9. The Defendant avers that the Claimant wrongfully terminated the Defendant’s

contract as a sub-postmaster following his suspension and that the true cause of the
apparent shortfall in the accounts of Marine Drive Post Office is the Claimant’s own
computer system not any misconduct or negligence on the part of the Defendant or

his assistant.

10. By reason of the Claimant’s wrongful termination of his contract, the Defendant has

suffered and continues to suffer loss:
Particulars

The Defendant is not yet fully able to particularise his counterclaim. However, the

broad heads of loss in respect of which the Defendant claims are as follow:

the same premises as Marine Drive Post Office; and

(c) loss of profits from the post office itself, and the associated reduction in
turnover at the Defendant’s shop as a result of the removal by the Claimant of

the post office franchise from the premises.

figure not exceeding £250,000.

The Defendant also claims interest pursuant to section 69 of the County Courts Act

1984 on such sums and for such period as the court shall consider appropriate.
