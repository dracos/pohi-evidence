Many thanks for this Richard and while it is difficult to feel “nappy” about such a large claim for damages I
think all concerned in the settlement should be congratulated in steering an outcome that is not only very
likely “dong the right thing” by the Post Masters but also at a cost that is a good deal less some of the more
alarming estimates. For me the best was to see this quote from the leader of the litigation which indicates that
POL is turning a page in its culture and attitude to the Post Masters.

Alan Bates, one of the lead claimants who is also a representative of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, said: 'The
steering committee would like to thank Nick Read, the new chief executive of Post Office, for his leadership, engagement
and determination in helping to reach a settlement of this long-running dispute.

‘During the mediation, it became clear that he intends to reset the relationship between the Post Office and its
subpostmasters and put in place new processes and support for them as part of a wider programme of improvements.

‘It would seem, from the positive discussions with [Mr] Read, that there is a genuine desire to move on from these legacy
issues and learn lessons from the past.'

And if we were involved in helping in this change then further congrats.

With best wishes

Robert
