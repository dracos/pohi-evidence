Charlie

Thank you for feeding back the Minister’s views on the submission. I have made a couple of small tweaks
to the letters on top of the Minister’s comments, all for clarification and/or typos, shown in track in the
attached.

It is important that these letters do not issue until we have communicated the Minister’s decision to Post
Office and until she has had a chance to speak to Paula Vennells. Can we find some time on Thursday or
Friday for that call to happen (assuming the Minister is busy at conference until then)? Happy to chat
about what time would work. We can provide any further details or briefing that the Minister would like
for that call (and are of course happy to listen in and support the Minister).

Many thanks

Laura

Laura,
Baroness Neville-Rolfe would like to thank you for the update. She is content to see Second Sight and Sir

Anthony. The M er has made some slight changes to the attached letters. The Minister does not think
the order of the meetings matters.

Finding time in the diary will be most difficult and she saw that you also want her to speak to Paula which
doubly comes fists.

The Minister feels we will then need to write to Mr Bridges.

Many thanks,

Harriet

As discussed, please see attached submission on the Post Office Horizon matter, covering the points we
discussed with the Minister after she met James Arbuthnot a couple of weeks ago.

Rob — it would be very helpful if Nick King could provide his views on this before it goes to the Minister.
Very happy to chat through if any questions etc.

Many thanks
