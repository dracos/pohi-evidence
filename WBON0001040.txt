Would you mind reviewing the attached wording on the remote access issues?

Having reviewed the Letter of Claim, the remote access point is only specifically raised in relation to limitation / s.32
concealment. It is not cited as a ground for (i) deceit or (ii) unwinding the settlement agreements â€” although it could in
due course be used for these purposes.

We have expressly referred to balancing transactions and Super User access in the attached, without drawing specific
attention to them. Is this transparent enough or should we go further?

Kind regards
Andy
