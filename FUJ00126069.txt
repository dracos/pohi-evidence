Initial feedback from PO — rapport with Mike is not an easy thing to achieve!

Clive

I think it is worth recording somewhere that today Peter told Mike Young that he was going to change the reporting line of
the Account and have it report directly to him , although Mike Young did not react , Dave Smith did after the meeting.
Dave is pleased that this is happening and further pleased by the fact that Peter and Mike Y have agreed to meet ona
monthly basis and that a good rapport is developing between them.

Dave is keen to capitalize on this and ensure we get the relationship back on its long term positive footing.

I will send out a more detailed note on today’s meeting tonight.
