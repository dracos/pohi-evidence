The paper feeder handles up to 100 sheets of paper. To load paper:

Step 1.

Set the left paper guide to the marker for the
required paper size and move the right guide
to a position slightly wider than the paper
width.

Step 2.

Fan the stack of paper, then tap it on a flat
surface to even the edges. Insert the paper so
that it is up against the left paper guide and
check that it is not skewed.

Left paper guide Right paper guide

Step 3.

Adjust the right paper guide to fit against the
edge of the paper. Do not move the left guide
again as this may cause the paper to skew as
it is fed in.

Step 4,

Lift the paper out of the tray again slightly
(about I cm) and re-insert it gently, allowing
it to drop under its own weight - do not force
it down.

(OKI 8P) - replacing the toner cartridge

On average the first toner cartridge will produce between 500 and 700 sheets. Thereafter the
cartridge should produce approximately 1500 sheets per cartridge.

The toner cartridge should be replaced when the TONER LOW LED blinks slowly. (The LED
is the left-hand LED when looking at the front of the printer). You can continue printing using
the toner in the printer reservoir. However, you should replace the toner cartridge as soon as
possible to maintain print quality and avoid possible damage to the imaging system.

Note:

The LED described above is a common LED for both Toner and Drum error conditions.
As the toner is used up more frequently than the drum, it is always prudent to check the
toner FIRST (unless it has just been changed), and if the error condition persists (the
LED continues to blink slowly) then change the drum, refer to the procedure on Pages
26 - 27 of this Workbook.

To replace the toner cartridge:

Step 1.
Open the cover by pushing up (gently) on the
tab indicated left.

Note:

Opening the cover exposes hot surfaces
which are clearly labelled. Do NOT touch
them.

(OKI 8P) - replacing the image drum cartridge

Date: 24/07/00

Issue: 1.0

On average the image drum cartridge should last about 10,000 sheets.

As the image drum approaches the end of its life the CHANGE DRUM LED blinks slowly.
(The LED is the left-hand LED when looking at the front of the printer. At this point you
should ensure that you have a new drum on hand. The old drum should be replaced as soon as
print quality becomes faint or starts to deteriorate.

The image drum is a delicate unit and care should be taken not to damage it. It is therefore
necessary to follow the guidelines listed below:

- Do NOT touch the green drum surface.

- Do NOT set the cartridge down on anything that might scratch the surface of the drum.

- Do NOT expose the drum to direct sunlight and do not expose it to room light for more
than 5 minutes. Leave it in the package until you are ready to install it into the printer.

Note:

The LED described above is a common LED for both Toner and Drum error conditions.
As the toner is used up more frequently than the drum, it is always prudent to check the
toner FIRST (unless it has just been changed), and if the error condition persists (the
LED continues to blink stowly) then change the drum, the toner change procedure is
described on Pages 23 - 25 of this Workbook.

To replace the image drum cartridge:

Step 1.
Open the cover by pushing up (gently) on the
tab indicated left.

Note:

Opening the cover exposes hot surfaces
which are clearly labelled. Do NOT touch
them.
