Dear Kemi,

RE: Accelerating Post Office Horizon Compensation

1. Thank you for your letter of 9 August regarding the acceleration of Post Office
Horizon Compensation.

2. lam wholly committed to ensuring that postmasters receive the full and fair
compensation that they rightly deserve.

3. lam deeply concerned by the risks posed to the successful delivery of the Group
Litigation Order (GLO) compensation scheme, especially given the serious concern
expressed by the Williams’ Inquiry in its Interim Report. I understand that the CST
recently wrote to Minister Hollinrake offering further HMT support and
engagement.

4. Iam receptive to measures which will increase the likelihood of successful delivery
and I understand that your department is looking to secure legislation to remove
the current deadline. I also understand that my officials are engaging with yours in
relation to the scheme’s admin budgets.

5. In relation to the specific proposal for fixed sum awards on the GLO scheme, while
successful delivery is paramount, we must also have regard to our responsibility
for the public finances and to ensuring that the treatment of claimants on each
Horizon compensation scheme is fair to that of their peers.

6. As you note, making fixed sum awards on the GLO would incur significant
repercussive risk and cost, including to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. Given the
extent of this risk and its high likelihood of crystallisation, I would encourage you

to explore the full breadth of other options to advance the ultimate objective of
timely and successful delivery of full and fair compensation.

7. Iam grateful for the continued work of you, Minister Hollinrake, and your officials
to compensate and ensure fair and consistent treatment for all the victims of the
Horizon IT Scandal.

8. lam copying this letter to The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and to Kevin
Hollinrake MP.

Best wishes,

RT HON JEREMY HUNT MP
Chancellor of the Exchequer
