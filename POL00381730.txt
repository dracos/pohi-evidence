Thanks. No | don't think Alice would be referring to you.

| suspect it may be the JA one. Susan asked me to check it but by the time | had seen the request, it was already past
the deadline. | cannot check ExCo briefs for Alice, otherwise je ne m'en sortirai jamais! (Works more eloquently in
French!)

A demain. P

referring to).

sent late (other than those which were requested at the last minute)!

> As you can see, she feels the need to tell Mark about the Board's concerns on the strategy. I'll think about how we can
position this and send you some draft briefing, and then we can send on to her before your 1:1 tomorrow morning.

> Hi Jorja,

> | think my main question is:- what should my objective be in talking to him about the Strategy and Funding? | need to
position this so that he is aware that the Board may not buy the package which appears to be needed to get the Fed
onside - the timing is awkward in that we have the Board discussion next week after my meeting with Mark. | also need to
be on top of the industrial action so I'll have another look at the presentation for the Board Deep Dive. Also the update on
where we are on Second Sight etc. And the latest on the RM prospectus. So basically, all the current hot topics.

> | would like to talk to Paula about this at my 1:1 with her. Please can you alert Martin to that too.

> | really don't want any more last minute briefs! It is not a professional way of doing important business. In any case, |
won't be able to read a brief on Wed evening - | have an engagement - and | have a busy day on Thursday. | am happy,
of course, to take an update following the meeting with Will but | need to get my head round this during the day on
Wednesday.

anything specific you need included in the brief please? | was hoping to get it to you Wednesday morning when you are
here but Martin and Paula are seeing Will G Wednesday afternoon so it might be sensible for Martin to send a few bullets
after that meeting should anything come from it you need to be aware of? Are you happy with this arrangement?
