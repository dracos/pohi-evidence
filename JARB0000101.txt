Dear Joe

Thank you for the phone call just now. Can we try for 12.30 on Monday 15 December, with
Mr Arbuthnot to call Mr Blagden? If this suits, can you confirm correct telephone number
please?

I shall also need to ask Mr Arbuthnot and will confirm with you as soon as I hear back.

Kind regards
Janet
