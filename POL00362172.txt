Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement

{t has been a year of tough challenges and achievements involving a groundbreaking agreement with our people allowing the
modernisation of Royal Mail to proceed and changes to the Pension Plan put in place The Group made an operating profit before
exceptionals of £162million which while down a third on the previous year was ahead of expectations and was against the backdrop of a
3 2% year on year decline in the overall UK mails market volumes and an increase in the proportion of mail carried by rival operators
Daunting challenges remain but the Group is now implementing plans to modernise the Letters business and ensure the Post Office
branch network has a sustainable future Royal Mails quality of service had been at or above target levels in the first quarter of 2007-08
but fell as a result of mdustrial action last summer and autumn Despite the effects of mdustrial action the large majority of mail was
back to being delivered at above target levels by the year end

Key elements of the year were:

+ Landmark agreements with our people on pay, pensions and modernisation, enabling Royal Mail to launch the second phase of I
modernisation of the Letters operations - through automation - using the investment provided by the Shareholder in the form of
commercial loans agreed in March 2007

* — Reform of the Pension Plan to help the Company continue meeting the huge cash cost - of over £800million in the year - of both i
‘ongoing and deficit contnbutions, while providing the best pension benefits Royal Matl can afford for its people

© The launch of new products and services for customers including Tracked™ which allows the movement of parcels and packets I
through the Royal Mail network to be tracked and Online Business Account which enables business customers to handle their
accounts electronically instead of by dockets More new services are planned as the Company strengthens further its focus on
customer service

© The first steps in the roll-out of new technology and equipment in delivery offices and mail centres ~ making the job better for our
people improving the business's efficiency and, above all providing the foundation and capability for new products and services for
customers

«The launch of more new services and products by the Post Office to bring in new revenue and customers and help support the
branch network

‘Strong revenue growth by Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS, the Group s UK and European parcels businesses, both of which operate
in highly competitive markets GLS is now by far the biggest contributor to Group profit

Financial Performance

The biggest change in performance across the Group was the move from profitability to loss by the Royal Mail Letters business which
made a £3milon operating loss on its £6 8biltion revenue - down on the previous year despite the annual price increase m April 2007
The fall in mail volumes continued downtrading by Royal Mail customers to lower priced products, and the increasing impact of
competition resulted in Group operating profit falling by almost a third from €233million to £162mulhon If the mpact of the Social
Network Payment (which supports loss-making Post Office branches) 1s taken out of the picture, Group operating profit in 2007-08 was
less than half the comparable figure in the previous year The huge cost of servicing the Pension Plan continues to bear heavily on the
Company and has again had a huge impact on the operating profit

Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

« — Group revenue rose by just over £200mullion. largely driven by increased sales by GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide but also because
the 2007-08 accounts include the full £150million Social Network Payment to support loss-making Post Office branches while in I
2006-07 only half of this payment, £75mullion was included as revenue
* — Revenue in Royal Mail Letters fell by £27million The overall mail market declined again and volumes handled by Royal Mail fell 3 2%
I - more than the 2 3% volume fall in the Letters business the previous year The average daily mail bag now contains 80 million
I letters it was 83 millon in 2006-07 so Royal Mail ts handling on average three million fewer letters a day i
* — Royal Mail regulated prices rose in April 2007 by around 5% on average However, there was continued downtrading in 2007-08 by
customers for example from First Class to Second, or from premium business mail services to less expensive ones This trend,
together with volume falls, meant that overall revenue in the Letters business declined for the second year running
* — The Universal Service made an estimated loss - for the first time - of around £100multion with the overall price controlled area of
the business making an estimated loss of around £200mullion
© Post Office Limited's revenue increased but when the additional impact in 2007-08 of the Social Network Payment 1s removed the
underlying trend was downwards There was less income overall from traditional business but this was partly offset by growth in
i sales of new products and services
‘*  GLS grew its revenues through higher parcel volumes with particularly strong growth in Eastern Eurape as well as from the
acquisition of ABX Belgium There was also a beneficial impact in the accounts from the strengthening of the euro against Sterling
Profit fell by €1million however but this was again a strong performance by GLS as it operated in a difficult and highly competitive
market and had to make significant network changes ta deal with recently changed road speed laws in France
« Parcelforce Worldwide grew its revenue in a market where competitive pressures got even tougher, and also increased its profit and
maintained its operating margin Quality of service improved further to 96 5% for the year - an impressive performance in a crowded
marketplace

Pension Fund Reform

A series of changes to the Pension Plan began to take effect on 1 April 2008 after intensive talks with the unions and other employee
representatives that began a year earlier, and a formal consultation with every pension scheme member The length of time taken over
talks and consultation reflected the Company's determination to listen carefully to the representations it received and as a result a
number of significant amendments were made to the original proposals first tabled im the early summer of 2007 The changes to the
fund were agreed by the Pension Trustee nm March 2008 They encompass

The Plan closed to new members from 31 March 2008

All pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 are still inked to final salary at the time of retirement

From 1 April 2008 defined benefits building up for employee members of the Plan are earned on a Career Salary basis

‘Anew defined contribution plan will be launched in April 2009

New recruits joining the Company from 31 March 2008 will be able to begin paying contributions to the new plan after they have

worked for the Company for a year

* Employees can continue to take their pension on reaching 60 but the normal retirement age will increase to 65 for benefits earned
from 1 April 2010

‘© From 4 April 2010 it will be possible to draw penston earned before the change to normal retirement age at 60 and continue

working while still contributing into the Pension Plan untit the maximum level of benefits has been reached

The action taken to reform the Pension Plan together with the establishment of a £billion escrow account for the sole benefit of the
Plan if needed has enabled the Group to have an achievable funding programme based on the last actuartal valuation of the deficit of
£3 4billion n March 2006 However our estimates indicate that the actuarial deficit has since increased significantly due to market
changes, further underlining how pensions remain a significant and volatile risk to the Group The continuing heavy cash calls on the
Company - more than £800mitlion in 2007-08 - to service the Plan and pay the deficit - demonstrates again how crucial tt 1s for the
Company to succeed in modernising the Letters business and provide a sustainable future for the Post Office network The Pension Plan
deficit fell in accounting terms from £5 Obillion to £2 9billion

Royal Mail - modernisation underway

The landmark agreement on pay, pensions and modernisation reached with the CWU in the autumn of 2007 has opened the door for the
roll-out of a far-reaching modernisation plan for Royal Mail on which its future hangs The technology we are now deploying is tried and
tested so we know it can be effective The task facing everyone in the Letters business 1s to make it work for Royal Mail and crucially our
customers

The work underway includes

‘+ The deployment of the first of a new range of sorting equipment to deat with “flats”, the Ad sized magazine, catalogues and
brochures which make up around one in six items of the typical daily mail bag

* Successful trials for hand-held keypads that allow postmen and women to record custorers’ confirmation of the delivery of packets,
and other mail such as Special Delivery - a huge improvement on the traditional paper-based method

« Contracts have been placed for a wide array of sorting equipment including upgrades for existing Integrated Mail Processors (IMPs),
and replacements for existing automated mail sorters By March 2008 the codemark printers that print machine-readable
instructions on mail to speed its sortation had all been replaced In addition, to date, 21 IMPs have been upgraded !

We have ordered 400 walk-sequencing machines the first of which will be detivered to the network this summer under a
deployment programme that will last around two years Trials have been successful both operationally and from the perspective of
delivery postmen and women who have been pleased at the machines capability in sorting mail down to the route they follow on a
round vastly reducing the need to sort the matl manually

The new technology will we are confident, improve efficiency and cut costs But we are very clear that one of the greatest benefits of
modernisation 1s the foundation it provides from which to launch new products and services for customers so meeting their needs and
expectations and improving Royal Mails competitive edge in a market where competition is rapidly mcreasing We will be launching
further new products and services this current year with the aim both of providing customers with innovative solutions while at the same
time making it easier for them to do business with Royal Mail

Our strategy for the Letters business is to implement programmes that will provide a more efficient operatian improve Royal Mails ability
to compete and crucially have products and services that both satisfy and excite customers large and small We are aiming at delivering
a hitherto unseen degree of flexibility and responsiveness by Royal Mail

Post Office Limited - creatmg a sustainable network

‘Among the most difficult challenges of the year has been the implementation of the Government's decision to close up to 2,500 Post
Office branches The closure of any branch 1s always difficult as every outlet is appreciated by its customers and subpostmasters are
rightly regarded as key members of the communities they serve

The Network Change programme, therefore, which ts reducing the size of the branch network in line with the funding provided from the
Shareholder 1s a mayor challenge for the busmess We are seeking to implement the programme as sensitively as possible, and create the
most accessible network within the customer access criteria determined by the Government There have been more than 75 000
responses to the programme by the end of March 2008, around the halfway mark, and the high level of feedback from customers shows
the attachment communities feel to their local branches despite the fact that some four million fewer people have been visiting a Post
Office branch each week compared to three years ago

That reduction has been spurred by a further decline in traditional products and services on offer in our branches or in the case of the TV
Licence the ending of the service altogether Card Account transactions went down in 2007-08 and more motorists renewed their car tax
online rather than at a Post Office counter

However, declines in traditional revenue were partly offset by income from new services we have introduced with new products launched
in 2007-08 We are now

Selling one in 50 of all car msurance policies in the UK
Issuing one in every 40 new credit cards in the UK,
Insuring one in every 200 homes in the UK, and
Handling savings from almost half a million savers

eee

The business s stretching goal remains - to create a network that has long-term sustainability We are investing in our Crown office
network to improve their attractiveness to customers, and have agreed a new remuneration package for subpostmasters giving them
greater rewards for achieving product sales, we are cutting our overheads and reducing back office costs for the computer system that
inks the network, and we will continue to develop new products and services

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Chairman and Chief Executive’s Statement (continued)

Many achievements - but many challenges remain

The Group began its journey of transformation in 2002 when change on the scate we have already achieved was regarded by many as
unthinkable and unachievable At that time, we were failing quality of service targets repeatedly, the Company was losing more than
£4mullion a day and without change, our chances of succeeding in a changing and opening market were non-existent

We ve demonstrated we can deliver consistent target-beating quality of service the Group is profitable and has the funding in place to
modernise strategies are underway to achieve a transformation of the Letters business and to create a sustainable Post Office network,
and we have a determination to succeed, spurred on by the hurdles we have already overcome i

Daunting challenges remain /

Our tender for the new contract for the Card Account handling benefit and pension payments for many of the most vulnerable
people in society from April 2010 is currently being considered in competition with other bids and it 1s vital for the future health of I
the Post Office network that we succeed in winning the work.

© Modernising Royal Mail to make it much more efficient while providing flexible and responsive products and services to our I
customers is a challenge in its own right but to meet it im a market where mail volumes are now falling and with heavy cash calls on
the business from its penston fund will be very stretching indeed

Online shopping has provided opportunities across our business but it has also created more competition at the delivery end I
affecting not just the Royal Mail Letters busmess but Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS

* The costs of funding the new technology that 1s now being rolled out to the Letters business will increasingly be felt as the i
Shareholder’s financing package comprises loans at commercial rates that do of course have to be repaid from our earnings

We are contributing to the independent review of the impact to date of competition on the UK postal service The key issue will be the
preservation of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service which in 2007-08 1s estimated to have lost around £100million - the
first time there has been a loss in this vital bedrock of the postal service which Is a powerful benefit to the UK economy and every user of
the postal service The question begging an answer ts how to preserve and nurture the Universal Service when the only business with a
commitment to delivering st - Royal Mait Letters - 1 now loss-making The Letters business has traditionally relied on profit from business
mail - the only part of the market to face competition from other operators - to underpin the Universal Service, which is used by social
customers to send personal letters birthday cards and Christmas greetings, by businesses, large and small, and Government, both local
and central We are very clear that the answer, in part at least, has got to involve regulation reduced to a minimum so that Royal Mail has
the freedom to compete fully in both the postal and wider communications market - while having the right amount of protection for social
customers and small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) who are finding that other mail carriers have no interest in competing for their
letters and cards, when stamped mail loses on average 6p a letter

Our overall vision through this review 1s to achteve a high quality efficient and profitable Universal Service with a Price Control focused on
our social customers and SMEs and forming the backbone of an innovative fully competitive business mail market - provided by an
efficient transformed integrated and lightly regulated Royal Mail competing with a variety of rivals, bath wholesale and end-to-end
Central to achieving this vision is the need to continue to take and execute the often difficult decisions that will turn Royal Mait Group into
a world class postal services company

Annual Review 2007-08

This has been a year of huge significance for the future of the Company A groundbreaking deal was agreed on modernisation of the :
Letters business and reform of the Pension Plan New products and services were launched and the Company continued working to

reduce its environmental impact while investing in the health and wellbeing of its people There were also remarkable achievements by
individual employees who demonstrated again our people's dedication and service to the communtties in which they live and work The
difficult Network Change programme crucial to creating a sustainable Post Office got underway as we began to implement the '
Government decision to reduce the size of the branch network in line with the available funding !

Giving back to the community

Simon Illingworth was named Royal Mails “Postman of the Year” at the business’ 2008 1 Class People Awards Thousands of customers
put forward their postman or woman for an “unsung hero” accolade Simon had run more than 20 marathons to raise £7,000 for charity
and awareness of testicular cancer having been being diagnosed with the disease himself

More than 12.000 people across the Company took part in fundraising activities in 2007-08 while mdividuals themselves dipped into their
‘own pockets to support charities with 50 000 of our people - more than one in every four ~ making payroll donations directly from their
wages it means our people contributed at the rate of almost £300 every hour of every day and the large number of payrall donors
across the Group compares to just 4% of the overall working population who contribute to charities via payroll ging The Companys
encouragement for payroll giving and its people’s generosity were recognised with prizes and accolades at the Institute of Fundraising s
National Payroll Giving Awards in October 2007

A three year partnership - the first of its kind for Royal Mail - between the Company and Help the Hospices raised £2 million for the
chantty - double the target of £1 million More than 10000 employees took part in fundraising actities - a tremendous level of support -
and nearly 6 000 gave payroll donations

There were further improvements in attendance at Royal Mail last year with absence rates having fallen by more than 20% over the last
five years Initiatives in 2007-08 which had helped drive the improvement included campaigns focusing on health promotion such as
advice on diet and nutrition There were health fairs in a number of workplaces a health bus toured many of our offices and centres
while an internet facility was set up to provide health and lifestyle advice online

Royal Mail also began a four year partnership with Access ta Work and Jobcentre Plus, to encourage the employment of disabled people
to build on our existing efforts to welcome applications from all sections of the community and nurture diversity in our workforce

Working towards a better environment

The Company has set itself the goal of operating in a carbon neutral way by 2015 In 2007-08, the Letters business took delivery of 140
double-deck trailers each with the capacity to hold 50 per cent more mail than conventional trailers We are seeking, through these
trailers, to reduce carbon emissions by cutting road mileage annually by the equivalent of twice the circumference of the earth

The Company has also developed an ontine calculator so that any employee can easily calculate their environmental impact and make
donations to the Woodland Trust to allow the charity to plant trees to offset carbon emissions The online calculator has been gifted to the
Woodland Trust, which has called on other companies to fallow Royal Mail's tead

A further initiative in the Letters business has mvolved the provision of telemetry technology in around 8,000 vehicles with training in its
use for the drivers The equipment tracks the vehicles movernents fuel consumption speed and braking patterns so that the best routes
can be chosen in tandem with the best way of driving the vehicle, to minimise its carbon output Royal Mail 1s aiming to cut its fuel usage
by 25 million litres of diesel a year through use of the technology as well as reducing the number of vehicles it has on the road

Technology leads new product development

Despite the decline in overall mail volumes, Royal Mail saw further growth in its delivery of goods ordered online Christmas 2007 saw
Royal Mail deliver a record ¢ 120 million items which had been ordered online In July 2007 the business handled orders for 600,000
copies of JK Rowling s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - a copy for one in every 43 hames in the UK

New technical developments also improved the service for online shoppers - Royal Mail's Tracked™ service allows customers to track the
progress of their order online while the Safeplace service was launched allowing shoppers to speaty a safe place at their address - for
example, a garden shed - where a package can be left safely if nobody is at home to take personal delery

Royal Mail also launched a number of initiatives designed to strengthen the effectiveness of direct mail as a key advertising and marketing
medium Sensational” maul allows companies to build on the visual impact of direct mail by incorporating other features that engage
senses other than eyesight For example a mailshot can include a relevant aroma or taste about a product or service to heighten the
impact when the mail 1s opened

A partnership with Sony DADC allows advertisers and marketers to include in their mailing a CD which is personalised for the recipient of
the mail The combination of traditional post with digital technology allows companies to communicate with a wide range of their
customers but in a personal tatlored way for each of them

As part of its mvestment in data services, Royal Mail has also launched a new source of expert advice on direct mail aimed at improving
the effectiveness of direct mail campaigns

Celebrations through stamps

Royal Mail's Special Stamps issues in 2007-08 covered a diverse range of subjects The enthusiasm for Harry Potter was celebrated in a
set of stamps which featured illustrations from the series of books which have captured the imagination of children and many adults for a
decade

Another set of stamps with a literary theme paid tribute to lan Fleming s fictional secret agent James Bond. showcasing book jackets from
the novels including titles such as Dr No and Casino Royale

‘Amold Machin s iconic image of the Queen which has appeared on more than 175 billion stamps has been famously unchanged since its
introduction in 1967 A miniature sheet was issued in June 2007 to celebrate this timeless, masterwork of modern art and it included a
picture of Machin himself on one of the stamps '

Ten rare British birds featured on the first of a series of stamps showing how endangered UK species are benefiting from conservation
work The set featured the corncrake the white-tailed eagle and the avocet, the emblem of the Royal Society for the Preservation of
Birds The next issue available from May, will feature six of the best-loved Cathedrals in the UK

Building a new Post Office - “The People’s Post Office”

Just aver three years after launching its financial services partnership with the Bank of Ireland the Post Office has served its one millionth
customer - in May 2007 - and has continued to grow During the year the number of customers increased further by over one third,
making the Post Office one of the fastest growing financial service providers in the UK The achievement means that the Post Office

* sells one in 50 of all car insurance policies in the UK
* Issues one in every 40 credit cards in the UK.

© insures one in every 200 homes in the UK , and
has almost half a million savings customers I

The portfolio of financial services grew further in 2007-08 with the launch of a Post Office mortgage, which quickly established a I
Teputation as one of the best rates available in the housing market, while ather new services launched in 2007-08 included life cover for

the over 50s and PayQut, which enables payments to be made using barcoded letters or text messages, avoiding the need to issue ‘
cheques

The MoneyGram service, which customers can use to send cash swiftly and securely abroad was extended to every branch in the
network Growing numbers of people took out a Post Office insurance policy to cover their car van or home with the number of active
policies exceeding 600,000

The Post Office s commitment to providing free access to cash was underlined by the installation in December 2007 of the business’ one
thousandth fee-free ATM More cash machines are being added every week to the network of branches with the aim of making the Post
Office with its banking partner the Bank of Ireland one of the biggest providers of cash machines nationwide

A television advertising campaign featuring a number of celebrities inctuding Joan Collins and the boy band Westlife helped raise
awareness of the wide range of services available in “The People's Post Office ” These have included the launch of the broadband service
designed to appeal to a wide range of customers including older peopte who may not have been online before but are seeking the re-
assurance of the trusted Post Office brand as well as those customers who want to pay for the service m cash at a Post Office branch
rather than set up a standing order

The Post Office s Christmas Savings Club was launched in January 2008 to provide savers with a simple and safe way to save for the
festive season From February 2008, the Post Office offered a pet insurance scheme to its customers

Parcelforce Worldwide

Parcelforce Worldwide's impressive underlying growth in revenue and volume of over 10% outpaced the UK express parcels market in

2007-08, with a key driver behind the increase coming from high quality of service which improved on the previous year's performance i}
Quality over the Christmas period was excellent when processed volumes hit an all time record of 325,000 on 18 December 2007

The business also helped reduce its environmental impact with a carbon offsetting scheme allowing customers despatching goods online
to make a donation via the Woodland Trust With around 25% of online retail users using the scheme it demonstrates both the business's
commitment to reducing its carbon footprint as well as the appetite among customers to support effective environmental programmes

A comprehensive review of service was conducted during 2007-08, resulting in plans for additional service developments The business 1s
aiming to announce in the summer of 2008 the first two of a number of initiatives to drive further growth

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd made a loss in 2007-08, after bearing losses relating to stamped mail and carrying out its Universal Service
Obligation In addition it has been facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed investment in plant and equipment
and funding its pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition On 23 March 2007 a funding package
totalling £1 2bn up until 2016 was completed with Government

The European Commission 's continuing its investigation under the EC Treaty's rules on State Aid into a series of funding measures taken
by the United Kingdom Government in its capacity as Shareholder in favour of Royal Mail between 2001 and 2007, including the funding
agreement completed on 23 March 2007 In its response to the EC in relation to this investigation the United Kingdom Government has
stated that it believes that the measures being investigated by the EC were concluded on commercial terms

Post Office Limited

Following a consultation process on 17 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now Secretary of State for Business
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) announced (\) a funding package for Post Office Limited up to March 2011, (u) a closure programme
Involving the compulsory compensated closure of up to 2,500 Post Office branches and (i) the imposition of certain access criteria
designed to ensure the continued maintenance of a national network of Post Office branches As part of the funding package the Group
recewved £313m during the year under the Industrial Development Act 1982, to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of
providing certain specified “services of general economic interest” An additional £150m (2007 £75m) was paid to Post Office Limited
during the year to fund the maintenance of a rural network of post offices, which was recorded within revenue as a Social Network
Payment - in the prior year an additional £75m of such costs were borne by the Group from reserves

Both of the above payments made during 2007-08 were in accordance with approval received from the European Commission under
televant State Aid rules

Group Financial Analysis

In the following analysis, all references to operating profit are before exceptional items The 2006-07 operating profit has been restated
for each UK operating business unit due to the impact of the new subsidiary Royal Mail Estates Limited, as explamed in note 3 There ts
no impact on the Group operating profit As 2007-08 1s a 53 week period and 2006-07 was a 52 week period where relevant revenue
and costs have been restated to make them more comparable

This year we report an operating profit of £162m compared to £233m for 2006-07, a fall of £71m (30 4%) dnven by the worsening
performance of Royal Mail Although Post Office Limited's position has improved, this 1s wholly attributable to the additional £75m from
Government for the Social Network Payment (SNP) compared to last year

External Revenue

Group external revenue increased by £209m (2 3%), from £9,179m to £9,388m driven by increases in GLS Post Office Limited
Parcelforce Worldwide and Other businesses offset by a decline in Royal Mail despite the impact of the additional week The 53" week
this year has increased Group revenue by £113m, therefore underlying revenue growth is 1 0%

Royal Mail revenue declined by £27m (0 44) even with an average price increase on regulated products in April 2007 of around 5%
Declining market volumes, increased losses to competition and customers continuing to downtrade to cheaper products have led to this
decline with the only growth area for revenue being Downstream Access, 1€ increasing competition

General Logistics Systems increased its revenue by £150m (13 9%) from £1,082m to £1 232m driven by volume growth in domestic and
export parcels ~ this includes the impact of acquisitions - and the strengthening of the euro Parcelforce Worldwide increased its revenue
by £42m (12 5%) from £337m to £379m, through higher volumes particularly im regional and international sales Post Office Limited
showed a revenue crease of £43m (5 OX) from £868m to £911m, although without the £150m (2007 £75m) SNP received from
Government, there was an underlying decline in revenue of £32m to £761m This reduction 1s due to the revenue decline in Government
and financial services exceeding the growth in revenue from the telephony products stream

Costs (excluding exceptional items)
Total costs of £9 273m have increased from £8 985m by £288m (3 2%) The additional week this year has increased Group costs by
£112m, therefore the underlying increase is 20%

People casts of £6 209m represent 67% of the Groups cost base and have increased year on year by £64m (1 0%) - this includes the
impact of the 53 week The majority of front line staff received an increase of 5 4% on basic pay and weekday overtime from 1 October
2007 After adjusting for the impact of the additional week, people costs actually reduced year on year reflecting efficiencies delivered to
absorb the impact of the pay award

Distribution and conveyance costs of £1 341m, representing 14% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £104m (8 4%) This 1s driven
mainly by GLS (including acquisitions) and Parcelforce Worldwide and their associated costs of volume growth

Other operating costs of £1,723m representing 19% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £120m (7 5%) This includes increases in
depreciation and IT costs linked to the phased roll-out of our major capital investment programme as part of our transformation plans,

Pensions I
2008 2007 Pension costs (pre-exceptionals) have reduced by 2 9% from £722m '

Pension charges within operating profit £m €m to £701m The £21m reduction principally relates to past service
Within operating profit before costs of £16m included in 2007

Within exceptionals (relating to March 2007 to £2.923m The decrease in the deficit of £2 062m
redundancy) 42 51 principally relates to an actuarial gain of £1,798m and net pensions.
Within operating profit 743773 __ interest of €131m

The actuarial gain arose due to changes in market conditions giving rise to an increase in the assumed real discount rate, although this
has been partly offset by a lower than expected return on the assets in line with general market returns This gain 1s recorded in the
statement of recognised income and expense

The net pensions interest reflects the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes’ assets less the unwinding of the discount on the
schemes’ liabilities Although trabilities are higher than assets the expected rate of return on these assets (biased toward equities) was '
substantially higher than the discount rate for abilities (high quality corporate bond rate) resulting in a net interest credit This interest 1s,

recorded in the income statement after (loss)/profit before financing and taxation

As part of the recent funding package the Group established €1bn of investments in escrow shortly before the 2007 year end as secunty
for the Royal Mail Pension Plan, in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from 31 March 2006

Worldwide (Spring) NV our international mail distribution associate

Net Exceptional Items

Net exceptional items of £383m (2007 £125m) comprise operating exceptionals of £441m (2007 £243m) offset in part by profits from
property disposals of £58m (2007 £118m with £74m arising from the disposal of a property group) Operating exceptional costs include
£277m for ColleagueShare costs (2007 Enil) £165m for redundancy {2007 £180m), a £141m exceptional charge for subpostmasters’
compensation (2007 Enil), £97m for impairments (2007 £64m) £43m for Agency Network Change programme and WH Smith project
costs (2007 Enil) £10m exceptional property charges (2007 £1m credit) with other Group restructuring costs amounting to £21m (2007
£nil) This was offset in part by Government grant income of £313m (2007 Emil) received to compensate Post Office Limited for providing
certain specified ‘services of general economic interest”

ColleagueShare Scheme

On 17 May 2007 the Group introduced a phantom share scheme, ColleagueShares all associated costs for the year have been treated as
an operating exceptional item The value of ColleagueShares 1s based on a Group share plan valuation model which 1s updated regularly
This has generated a discounted charge to the income statement of £116m for 2007-08 Fully eligible employees have been allocated
408 notional shares in the Company with part time staff holding a proportion of this amount Further allocations will be made aver the
next two years ColleagueShares will be sold back to the Company by 2012 and each fully eligible employee has the opportunity to recewe
up to £3,700 from the sale of the phantom shares A related stakeholder dividend for the year totalling £164m represents a payment of
up to £800 to each eligible employee in recognition of meeting certain Group and business unit targets This 1s payable in 2008-09

Net Fiance Income

Net finance income of £13m (2007 £6m) compnises finance income of £84m (2007 £62m), offset by finance costs of £71m (2007
£€56m) The increase in finance income of £22m 1s mainly due to higher average investment volumes and higher average investment
rates The increase in finance costs of £15m is mainly due to higher commitment, arrangement and advisor fees on the Royal Mail Group
Ltd loan facilities from Government and higher average borrowing rates, partially offset by lower average borrowing volumes

Regulation

Until the last few years Royal Mail had a monopoly status m the UK letters industry However in 2000 the Postal Services Act created an
independent postal Regulator ~ Postcomm - and allowed Royal Mail to have greater commercial freedom Postcomm regulates the prices
of nearly 90% of Royal Mail's letters business contrals the terms and conditions for nearly all its services sets the quality of service
targets and determines compensation arrangements

Post Office Limited 1s increasingly subject to regulation in financial services (Financial Services Authority) and in telephony (Ofcom) Post
Office Limited ts an appointed representative of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, which in turn is regulated directly by
both the Irish Financial Regulator and Financial Services Authority (FSA) for conduct in the UK

Its the Group's policy to be fully compliant with the regulatory framework in which we operate During 2007-08 we continued to

Competition

The Group's business units now all operate in a competitive marketplace Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS have been operating in an open
market since their inception These units have demonstrated their ability to perform in a non-regulated and competitive environment,
which ts reflected in their annual results

Post Office Limited due to a reduction in income from benefit payments and a significant and contmumg decrease in Government use
has developed revenue streams from financial services products (including car and home insurance a ‘two-in-one credit card and range
of savings products) and its HomePhone and broadband services These products are in direct competition with services offered by banks,
msurance and telephony companies, as are many of the services it continues to offer eg bill payments, renewal of car tax discs and
travel services

Royal Mails operating environment has gradually been opened up to competition since February 2004 with the letters market fully
liberalised im January 2006 well in advance of the rest of Europe Competitors are now able to offer customers the opportunity of end-
to-end service for the collection, sorting and delivery of their mail

Operating and Financial Review (continued)
Mayor Regulatory Activity in 2007-08

{n November 2007 the Group responded to Postcomm’s Strategy Review “Emerging Themes” and believes that four key regulatory
principles need to be addressed which will result in a truly competitive industry whereby all stakeholders benefit

© Realign prices to underlying costs - to create transparency for business customers and to ensure that competition 1s sustamable
‘Some competitors in the UK are basing their entry strategies on unsustainable business models that target the historical cross-
subsidies in Royal Mails pricing structure but cross-subsidies are fundamentally incompatible with an effectively functioning
competitive market Royal Mail believes it should be allowed to remove these cross~subsidies, so that customers face the right pricing
signals and competitor models going forward are based on efficiency

*  Anarrower range of unwersal service products - focused on the needs of all social customers and fully funded through stamp prices
‘Business customers tell us they do not need the protection that the Universal Service Obligation (USO) provides - Postcomm
describes many of these customers as “non-captive” and we agree given the ample choice they have across mail and other
communications providers The USO should therefore be refocused on stamped mail only, and prices should reflect the true costs of
this provision,

* Full retail deregulation of business products - the explosion in access competition representing 40% of bulk mail this year 1s
encouraging business customers to demand more commercial and innovative responses from Royal Mail However, Royal Mail 1s
prevented from responding rapidly by regulatory requirements such as an mvolved process for changing terms and conditions Royal

introduce complex and costly interfaces endanger quality of service and put at risk delivery of the transformation programme

In March 2007, Postcomm commenced an Interim Review Royat Mail has asked Postcomm to consider the following pricing proposals m
this review all of which are consistent with realigning prices to costs and entirely driven by the need to react to bath the volume erosion
and significant downtrading that has been evident for the last eighteen months

* — Reducing the headroom between Downstream Access (DSA) and the equivalent retail prices from a high level set to encourage
competition, to a level which reflects the underlying upstream costs because entry has been significantly higher than the Price
Control assumptions

* Allowing Royal Mail's retail business to price its non-USO bulk mail products by zone thereby making prices of cheap to deliver areas
lower by up to 5% and prices of expensive to deliver areas higher by up to 5% This does not change the price of the “one price goes
anywhere” stamp

postal sector, and

In January 2008, Postcomm confirmed the following decisions with respect to its Interim Review

Its rejection of a change to the headroom between DSA and equivalent retail prices
* Its rejection of Royal Mail's retail zonal application and
¢ Its agreement to increase the level of rebalancing

Royal Mail contnues to work with Postcomm on industrial action dispensation

In December 2007, BERR announced a review of the UK postal services market to examine the impacts of lberalisation of UK postal
services, trends in the future market development and the likely impact of this on Royal Mail alternative carriers and consumers Royal
Mail has submitted its first response to this review in March 2008 followed by its second response in May 2008

Key Relationships
The Group has several key relationships that are critical to its day-to-day activities and its overall success

People - Our people are the lifeblood of the organisation and brands Without their continued support and dedication it will be impossible
to function on a day-to-day basis and embrace the change within our markets Training, diversity, flexible resourcing and making the
business a great place to work are some of the ways we continue to improve this relationship

Unions - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents non-managerial staff with Unite the Union - Communication and
Managers’ Association (CMA) sector representing managerial staff The Group s policy is to work with the CWU and CMA to engage staff in
the development and execution of business decisions

Pension trustees - Our pension trustee board for the main pension plan comprises an independent chairman plus 10 people including
employees, union representatives, a pensioner and independent members They take external professional advice, from Sacker & Partners
LLP (legal) Watson Wyatt Limited (actuary) KPMG LLP (auditors) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (financial) They are responsible for
obtaining regular actuanal valuations of the plan to satisfy the statutory funding objective, which involves reaching agreement with Royal
Mail Group on the statement of funding principles, the recovery plan and the schedule of contributions There 1s a separate trustee board
for the senior executives pension plan which comprises the chairman plus 5 individuals including employees pensioners and an
independent member

Customers - The Groups businesses and brands are used or recognised by almost everyone in the UK - from the largest of companies to
individuals However, the 30 largest customers generate ¢ 15% of Royal Mails turnover and consequently the business is reliant on a !
small customer base As competition increases the Group will have to continue to simplify ways of dong business and design products

around customers’ needs Customers are offered standard terms and conditions for the markets and countries in which the Group

operate

Subpostmasters - The vast majority of Post Office Limited s 13,852 Post Office branches are operated by subpostmasters and franchise
partners The National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP) directly represents the interests of their members currently the
membership stands at 9297 As a consequence of this direct representation the NFSP mdirectly influences all other agents through the
representations and negotiations conducted on behalf of the majority of subpostmasters Post Office Limited conducts annual
remuneration negotiations with the NFSP whilst also working closely with them on the many agent related aspects of Post Office Limited's
Forward four2eleven strategy, designed to deliver a viable physical network by 2010-11

There are several major retailers who are also significant partners operating between them around 2,000 branches across the country
Post Office Limited liatses closely with these compamies to maintain successful working relationships It 1s through the effective partnership
with the NESP and these various retail organisations that the business takes into account the interests of all agents whilst seeking to
support the development and achievement of their sales potential and importantly the longer-term viability of the network

Supptiers - The Group has a wide range of suppliers with its primary reliance on those relating to outsourcing of non-core services, such
as IT support It works in partnership with its suppliers to ensure the right products and services are delivered at the right time at
competitive costs A central purchasing team monitors compliance to Group policy in awarding contracts or new business and adheres to
agreed credit terms

The consumer body Postwatch - Postwatch’s role is to act as a consumer advocate in postal matters Its public views on the effect of
Royal Mails policies and management actions on customers can have an impact on Royal Mail's reputation, regardless of the quality of
service achieved

The Regulator: Postcomm - Nearly 90% of Royal Mail Letters’ revenues are price-controlled and the Price Control is set periodically by
Postcomm in the form of a cap on the average price of a basket of products The price increases or reductions allowed by Postcomm
through the Price Control have a very matenal impact on the likely levels of cash flow the Company can generate Postcomm also
investigates compliance with Licence conditions and has broad powers to publicly reprimand or fine Royal Mail if it finds it in breach of
those conditions

Shareholder - The Company 's a plc 100% owned by the Government The Shareholder Executive (within BERR) manages the
shareholder relationship with the Company as a commercial shareholder While management of the Group therefore lies with the
Company's Board of Directors, the Shareholder 1s kept up-to-date through quarterly performance reviews and 1s asked to approve the
Group's strategic plan Any new funding required by the Group (apart from short term borrowings of less than one year) can only be
approved by Government if it meets commercial principles

Principat Risks and Uncertainties

The Group uses a business-wide framework for the identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk. The process
helps support business objectives by linking into business strategy identifying and reacting to emerging risks, and developing cost effective
solutions to the management of risk

The following Group-level risks have been identified and are being managed to support the long-term sustainability of the Group The
impact of some of these risks could be impairment to the value of the Groups brands - Royal Mail GLS Parcelforce Worldwide and Post.
Office which are some of the most well known and trusted brands in the UK, and major intangible assets of the Group

The financial restructuring package agreed with the Government needs to be managed effectively

The business has agreed a financal restructuring package that will allow it to restructure the business, mvest im new equipment and
address the pension fund deficit that has a major impact on Group profit and balance sheet Effective management of this package 1s !
crucial for the business to remain within the agreed financial restructuring parameters and to avoid potential sanctions or penalties that

could ensue i

Ineffective investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and our ability to compete effectively

The business 1s embarking on a major investment programme to replace equipment and technology that 1s nearing the end of its life
cycle The investment programme needs to be deployed effectively and future ongoing investment in the Group's operational network
maintained to ensure the Group s ability to compete effectively in the open market

The Group has a large pension fund deficit that requires funding

The Group's pension fund deficit is being funded mn tine with a schedule of contributions agreed with the pension fund trustees Future
pension risk has been mitigated in part by the closure to new employees of the final salary pension scheme and other measures
introduced as part of the pension reform commencing 1 April 2008 There remain uncertainties over the impact of fluctuations in the
equity and debt markets affecting the value of the funds’ assets and liabilities and the ability of the business to achieve the required levels
of profitability and maintain our contributions at the agreed level

Weakness in the UK economy or recession is likely to have a detrimental impact on the Group's profits

Ongoing changes in the global economy pose challenges and opportunities for the UK and all advanced economies Historically there has
been a correlation between the state of the UK economy and level of mails revenue Economic weakness or recession will have a direct
impact on mail volumes and consequently on Group profit

The Government ts the Company's only shareholder and the Group may be affected by any future change in Government policy
The influence of public policy considerations on Government may adversely affect the Group's ability to promote an effective business
strategy This ts particularly significant for Post Office Limited which ts required to run our branch network as a commercial business and
1s reliant on Government support for loss making branches

24

POL00362172

POL00362172

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Group revenues and profit are subject to several uncertainties
‘The postal market has evolved rapidly as a result of liberalisation Competitors are aggressively targeting business customers Additionally
business customers are downtrading using {ess profitable products In addition overall mait market volumes are declining Technological
innovation is increasing customers can now switch to alternative offermgs and information can be sent or made available faster and, in
many cases at a lower cost than traditional mail services If technological substitution continues market volumes will decrease further

Furthermore Royal Mails regulatory regime impacts the business s profitability in two key areas

The Unwersal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to maintain a national collection and delivery network The USO results in
Royal Mail incurring a higher fixed cost base than our competitors Royal Mail has some of the cheapest stamp prices in Europe, as
historically business mail has subsidised the losses made on stamped mail Unless the applicable regulatory restramts permit Royal
Mail to recover from this imbalance, there 1s a risk that Royal Mail will always lose money on stamped mail, whilst competitors
Procure more profitable products such as business mail The USO does however ensure that Royal Mail has the largest distnbution
network in the country - which may present future opportunities, and

* Royal Mails prices for most of its letters products are determined by Price Control reviews and negotiation with Postcomm which
can reduce our flexibility and profitability, leading to uncertainty over how the future Licence and regulatory regime will affect Royal
Mail

The Group ts subject to regulatory restrictions on our operations and the risk of penalties for non-compliance
Royal Mails postal operator s Licence contains material restrictions on the operation of the business These include

* Obligations over the delivery and collection of mail,
* Restrictions over the freedom to set prices and
* — Obligations to give competitors access to our network

If Royal Mail breaches certain postal operator's Licence conditions or other regulatory requirements it may be subject to financial
penalties In addition to our postal operator's Licence the Group is also subject to oversight by other regulators This affects Post Office
Limited which has to satisfy the FSA's requirements as an appointed representative of The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland
who are regulated by the FSA in respect of investment, mortgage and insurance intermediation actwity in the UK It is also subject to anti-
money laundering regulations issued under the Proceeds of Crme Act 2002 and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs Post Office
Limited 1s also licensed as a telephone service provider by Ofcom who require service providers to issue and adhere to Codes of Practice

Without a contimued change of culture within the organisation future development may be affected
The business has undergone, and will continue to undergo, a significant amount of change Additionally the changing and uncertain postal
market place, the impact of competition and regulation and creased customer expectations place major chatlenges on all employees to
adapt and improve productivity to levels that will allow the business to compete effectively

These challenges need to be met by ongoing cultural change within the organisation Without a flexible efficient and co-operative culture,
Royal Mail could become loss making as mail volumes decline and labour rates increase Significant mdustrial action could have a major
detrimental effect on the Group's reputation and profits

The Group's business activities are time critical and if key infrastructure facilities were disrupted it could have an impact on
results

The business 1s subject to a number of operational risks to its nationwide delivery and retail outlet networks including natural disasters
fire flood explosion possibility of work stoppages or civit unrest. transport infrastructure disruption, power failures unavailability of key
supplies, breakdown or failure of equipment health pandemics terrorism and the normal hazards associated with running a complex
infrastructure A major disruption could have an adverse impact on customer services as well as business and operating results

The Group may be affected by future environmental and related fiscal measures

The Group operates a large vehicle fleet and a substantial property portfolio that consume large amounts of energy Although the Group
1s disposing of surplus property and 1s deploying a Carbon Management Programme, it may be affected by future environmental
Measures and adverse fiscal impact from increased energy costs and “green” taxation The increasing awareness and focus on
environmental issues may also impact on the Group's current product and service offerings

The Group operates a substantial treasury operation and is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk

The Group 1s exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk The former 1s due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying
UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, revaluation of currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change
sermces and various sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency The fuel price risk arises from operating a large
vehicle fleet and on jet fuel risk from purchasing air freight services If the treasury strategy is inappropriate to cover the Group's
exposures, this could result in funds not being readily available when required or a negative impact on profit due to increased costs

The Group ts subject to changes in both domestic and European regulation and legislation, which could expose it to possible
additional costs

Vanious changes to European or domestic law will have a direct impact on the Group such as the European Working Time Directive,

speed restrictions on the Group’s vehicles and increased liberalisation of the market for postal service providers Any future changes may
have a material impact on the Group and its individual business units

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Summary

The Group has produced a robust financial performance with operations remaining profitable before exceptional items and cash
generative even with difficult trading conditions and challenges experienced during the year Despite continued efficiency improvements
the Letters business made a loss as revenues have continued to fall with core market decline, increased losses to competition and
customers downtrading further to cheaper products Post Office Limited s underlying performance 1s broadly flat largely due to losses in
traditional mcome streams which have been partially mitigated by new commercial product revenues and cost savings Both of our parcels
businesses, GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide, have improved their revenue performance, with strong growth underpinning solid profits in
highly competitive markets this year

Our main achievement 1s to have secured landmark agreements on pay, pensions and modernisation for the business - we are now well
placed to press ahead with the vital investment in Royal Mail Letters to improve our efficiency and productivity With the full support of
our people, our strategy to modernise and transform the Letters business - with investment in both our people and technology - will
provide the platform for new and mare flexible products and services for our customers, who remain at the heart of everything we do

Advice to the Remuneration Committee

The Committee calls for information and advice from inside and outside the Group It takes advice from those independent professional
organisations that are best able to assist it on the particular topic under discussion

During 2007-08 advice on the performance of key executives was given by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Information on the
external marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PriceWaterhouseCoopers), Deloitte & Touche LLP, Hay
Management Consultants and Watson Wyatt Limited Internal support 1s primarily provided by the Group Director People & Organisational
Development, and from the Company Secretary, Jonathan Evans Other advice and information has been provided by specialists from the

Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on Directors’ remuneration is that

* the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary quality na
complex business and a competitive market place, who will deliver success for the Shareholder and high levels of customer
service, safety and environmental performance

* a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance - both short and long-term and
the system of remuneration should bring together the interests of senior executives, customers and the Shareholder

The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee regularly reviews the package and its competitiveness against appropriate marketplaces The Committee aims to ensure
that the package ts proportionate and effective and that it follows accepted best practice

The main components of remuneration
The main components for Executive Directors are basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus, a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
pension and other benefits The Committee believes that there should be a particular emphasis on performance-related elements

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives In making
tts judgement the Committee considers information from several sources so that a fair comparison can be made with enterprises of a
similar size and complexity to Royal Mail This data is provided by independent consultancies, usually based on the published annual
reports of other organisations Increases are recommended where the Committee believes that it is necessary to reflect contribution
increased mdividual responsibihties and market levels The Secretary of State’s consent is required for all material changes to Directors’

remuneration

There was no increase to base salaries for Executive Directors for 2007-08 For 2006-07 the increase was 2 9%

Performance-related, annual bonus 2007-08
For 2007-08 the annual bonus plan followed the model of the previous year, which included the following weightings

* all Business roles had a weighting of 30% on Group performance and 70% Business performance This applied to the Managing

Directors of Letters and Post Office Limited and

* all Group roles had a weighting of 90% on Group performance and a further 10% weighting given to Post Office Limited s

performance in view of the importance of supporting the recovery of that business

The following tables show the make up of the annual bonus plan as percentages of annual salary

Long-Term Incentive Plans

A three-year LTIP was in place for 2005-06 to 2007-08 and a further three-year plan covers the period 2007-08 to 2009-10 This
arrangement will allow the last plan to come to an end at the same time as the next Postcomm price control review Half of the awards

for 2007-08 are attributed to the 2005-06 to 2007-08 plan and the remaining half to the 2007-08 to 2009-10 pian

Performance 1s measured by Return on Total operating Assets (ROTA)

For the three years 2005-06 to 2007-08 the principtes of the plan were as follows

(a) Annual Company Performance Awards which accrue on a sliding scale above a threshold level of performance and begin at 12 5% of
annual base salary For on-target performance, the Company Award 1s 25% of annual base salary and for exceptional performance

this rises to a maximum of 37 5%

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

(b) Bonus Awards A Bonus Award can be made each year by the Remuneration Committee These are only made in situations where
the Director waives a proportion of their annual bonus Bonus awards do nat exceed the amount waived A Director has the
discretion to waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level If a bonus above on-target would
otherwise be payable then three quarters of this additional amount will be compulsorily waived

(c)_ A Multiplying factor Company and Bonus Awards may be increased by a factor that measures ROTA across the plan If the on-
target level is achieved for the relevant period then each of the Company Awards and Bonus Awards to which it apples may be
Increased by an additional one third In the case of exceptional performance, then up to a maximum addition of 100% can be added

Payments under the plan will be made in June 2008

The 2007-08 to 2009-10 LTIP has the same principles as the previous LTIP

The Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08 are effectively shared equally between the two plans

The performance targets for the last two years of the 2007-08 to 2009-10 plan are sll under discussion with the Government

Company Awards

These are measured against an annual ROTA target ROTA mcentivises the productive value of the business and emphasises the need to
make efficient use of all operational assets It covers the need to make a proper return both on any new investments that are made and
on the existing asset base

For 2005-06 the ROTA target was 11 2% and the Company's achievement was 13 7%, 22% above the target and above the stretch of
13 4% This resulted in Company Awards of 37 5% For 2006-07 the ROTA target was 4 2% with astretch of 71% A ROTA of 5 4% was
achieved but the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to cap this at the on-target level of 4 2%, resulting in a Company
Award of 25%

For 2007-08 the following table against annual ROTA applied

Royal Mail ROTA achievement Percentage of Base Salary 1
24% 25%
514 375%

The outturn achievement was 3 9% resulting in a Company Award of 32 5%

Bonus Awards
As described above a Director may waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level and must waive three
quarters of any bonus earned above the on-target level If a proportion of annual bonus 1s waived then a Bonus Award may be made
within the LTIP, not exceeding that value

Multiplying Factor

The Multiplying Factor 1s dependent upon cumulative ROTA over 2005-06 to 2007-08

The cumulative ROTA works as follows Targets for the end of the third year are 15 9% at the threshold level, 17 4% at the on-target level
and 25 7% at the maximum To ensure consistency of performance there are intermediate targets at March 2007 of 13 6% at the
threshold level 15 1% at the on-target level and 20 3% at the maximum As the on-target level of cumulative ROTA was exceeded at the
end of March 2007, the percentage multiplier at that position on the performance scale was applied to the awards made so far The
cumulative ROTA for the preceding 2 years was 19 0% and gave a multiplier of 184 Across the whole of the three-year period, the
cumulative ROTA achieved was 22 6% and this gave a multiplier of 175, which was applied to Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08

Benefits
Benefits include the provision of a company car, health insurance, relocation costs or the cash equivalent of any benefits not taken

Pensions

The Group has a liability to pay pensions in respect of Directors’ services and for some Executive Directors, makes contnbutions to
pension schernes for this purpose The Company pays a cash supplement to Directors whose contributions to the Company scheme are

each year, as a constraint on the amount of salary that is pensionable through the Company scheme

Executwe Directors with effect from 1 April 2008 From 1 April 2008 the defined benefit pension plans have been closed to new members

Notes to the Group accounts
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs

The Group's financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 30 March 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board on 19 May 2008 and the
balance sheet was signed on the Board s behalf by Adam Crozier and lan Duncan

The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 53 weeks ended 30 March 2008 The principal accounting
policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2

2. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation and accounting

The Group comprises Royal Mail Holdings plc (the Company) - which 1s wholly owned by HM Government - and its subsidiarres The Company
1s incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) and the accounts are produced in accordance with the Act and
applicable IFRSs

The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise indicated

Royal Mail Group Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, 1s exposed to the nsk of being fined by its industry Regulator and of being
required to pay compensation to certain customers, as a result of failing to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in its licence The
amount of such fines and compensation will be determined by the Regulator after further representations from Royal Mail Group Ltd and no
further mformation 1s being disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process

Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows

The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year Adoption of these revised standards
and interpretations did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group in the current or prior periods In certain
cases, they did however give rise to additional disclosures

«© IFRS7 Financial Instruments Disclosures
© =IAST Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures
© IFRIC9 Reassessment of Embedded Derwatives

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures

This standard requires disclosures that enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the significance of the Group's financial
instruments and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments The new disclosures are mcluded throughout the
financial statements While there has been no effect on the financial position or results comparative information has been revised where
necessary

JAS 1 Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures
This amendment requires the Group to make new disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the Group's objectives
policies and processes for managing capital These new disclosures are shown in note 23

JFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derwatives

IFRIC 9 states that the date to assess the existence of an embedded derivative 1s the date that an entity first becomes a party to the contract,
with reassessment only if there 1s a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows As the Group has no embedded derwvative
Fequiring separation from the host contract, the interpretation has no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
uabilttes within the next financial year relate to the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligations, deferred tax and ColleagueShare
plan costs Measurement of the defined benefit obligations requires certain assumptions to be made including on life expectancy, future
changes in salaries, inflation and a suitable discount rate The size of these obligations and therefore the pension deficit 1s materially sensitive
to the assumptions adopted The assumptions which have the most significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit obligations
are the real discount rate and the mortality rates A 01 percentage point change to the discount rate could change the liabilities by
approximately £450m An additional one year on the life expectancy could increase liabilities by approximately £650m The major assumptions
are disclosed in note 25 Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability Such estimation 1s inherently
uncertain in a market subject to various competitive pressures Should estimates of future profitability change in future years, the amount of
deferred tax recognised will also change accordingly

The calculation of the ColleagueShare costs and liabilities is rebant an a number of estimates These include in particular forecasts for the
potential equity value of ColleagueShares, forecasts of joiners and leavers throughout the life of the plan and judgements on when participants
are likely to exercise their rights for the Company to redeem the ColleagueShares that they hold The magnitude of the costs involved is
sensitive to these forecasts and assumptions

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd made a loss in 2007-08 after bearing losses relating to stamped mail and carrying out its Universal Service Obligations
In addition it has been facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed investment in plant and equipment and funding its
pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition On 23 March 2007, a funding package totalling £1 2bn up
until 2016 was completed with Government

The European Commussion is continuing its investigation under the EC Treaty's rules on State Aid into a sertes of funding measures taken by
the United Kingdom Government in its capacity as Shareholder in favour of Royal Mail between 2001 and 2007 including the funding
agreement completed on 23 March 2007 In its response to the EC in relation to this investigation the United Kingdom Government has stated
that it believes that the measures being investigated by the EC were concluded on commercial terms

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabilities as at 30 March 2008 and has operated at a loss during 2007-08 and prior years primarily because of
‘supporting the loss-making rural network

To become viable in the longer-term, new business areas continue to be developed and grown in order to replace the lost contribution from
traditional income sources and significant cost reduction programmes continue to be implemented

During the year Post Office Limited has updated tts five-year strategic plan and will proceed with the implementation of a number of radical
programmes which are designed to improve the profitability of the company These programmes include

* the development of new business and drive for sales growth,

* the restructuring of the network,

* bringing the crown branch segment into profit, and

* a programme of fundamental cost reduction

The future financing of this Plan is underpinned by

* rural network funding of £150m received from Government during 2007-08,

* a funding agreement with Government announced on 17 May 2007, which provided a further £313m, which was received on 31 July
2007 to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified “services of general economic interest’,

* a further equity injection of £77m recewed on 1 April 2008 and £75m on 15 April 2008

© the extension on 18 April 2008 of the existing working capital facility of £1 15bn to 2011 {at the balance sheet date this was to 2010),
and

‘State Aid approval has been recened for the above funding and also for the provision of network subsidy payments of around £150m per
annum in each of the three financial years 2008-09 to 2010-11 for the purposes of meeting, up to a specified limit, the net costs of
maintaining certain loss-making parts of the network

‘Whilst the Directors are satisfied with the progress that has been made it should be noted that the completion of the regeneration
programmes will take several years to achieve, as anticipated in the company's five-year strategic plan Accordingly there will be a need to gain
agreement with respect to the continuation of the network subsidy payment for the period beyond March 2011, as well as the replacement or
extension of the working capital facilities These arrangements will need State Aid approval

Notwithstanding these uncertainties the Directors recognise that significant progress has been made in delivering its Plan and that the
Funding Agreement is now in place and, after careful consideration, continue to believe that Post Office Limited will be able to meet its
liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable future Accordingly on that basis, the Directors consider that it 1s appropriate that these financial
statements are prepared on a gomg concern basis

After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Group including consideration of the financing
arrangements outlined above, the Directors consider that it 1s appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings The financial statements of the
major subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies

All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions have been eliminated in full
Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basts of charges reached through a negotiation with the respective businesses

‘Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which
control is no longer held by the Group Where the Group ceases to hald control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include
the results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group held control i

POL00362172

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2 Accounting policies (continued)

After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses Goodwill ansing from business combinations 1s
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired

An impairment loss 1s recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value mn use

For the purpose of such impairment reviews, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating umits

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entittes 1s mcluded in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported m the balance
sheet as goodwil

Intangibte assets

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill f the fair value can be measured reliably
‘on initial recognition Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially recognised
at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or mdefinite useful life Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those '
with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumnstances indicate that the carrying

value may be impaired An impairment loss 1s recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset

exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use

Amortisatton of intangible assets with finite ves 1s charged annually to the mcome statement The useful lives of such intangible assets are in
the range of 1-6 years

Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off in the year it 1s curred Development costs are capitalised where they meet the criteria required under
IFRSs If these criteria are not met then the costs are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, cluding attributable costs in bringing the asset mto working condition for its intended
use Depreciation of property plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to net book value and to the remaining
useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual values The useful lives and residual values are renewed annually and
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment are I

Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers 1-12 years
Fixtures and equipment 2-15 years

An individual property that the Group has identified as surplus 1s reclassified within ‘non-current assets held for sale’, a separate category on
the balance sheet, when a sale is highly probable This has been determined to be when authority to market the property has been approved
and the property 1s vacant and therefore available for immediate sale and occupation by a third party Such properties are expected to

generate economic cash flow primarily by sale of the asset rather than by operational activities, and are expected generally to be disposed of
within a year ‘

For a disposal group of properties or other assets and liabilities the requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued \
operations’ are applied to the specific circumstances of the disposal group

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where appropiate, an
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds Its recoverable amount which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use

Leases
Finance teases, where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group, are
capitalised at the mception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower at the present
value of the minimum lease payments Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lability Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases and
rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental
expenses over the lease term on a straight-line basis

Inventories
Inventones are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow-moving stock Cost includes all costs in
bringing each item to its present location and condition and comprises weighted average cost for supplies and materials and purchase cost for
merchandise

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any non-collectable amounts An estimate for
doubtful debts 1s made when collection of the full amount 1s no longer probable Bad debts are written off when identified

Financial instruments

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as, financial assets at fair value
through the income statement (held for trading) held to maturity investments, loans and recervables or available for sale financial assets as
appropriate Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial lrabilities at fair value through the income statement
or financial liabilities measured at amartised cost.

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evatuates this designation at each financial year
end

When financial instruments are recognised initially they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial
Instruments not at ‘fair value through the income statement’, any directly attributable transactional costs

The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on their classification as follows

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale m the short term Derwatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised
1m the income statement

Held-to-matunty investments

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as ‘held to maturity when the Group has
the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity Held to maturity mvestments are carned at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through the
amortisation process Investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification

Loans and recewables

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determmable payments that are not quoted on an active market do not qualify as trading assets
and have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the income statement’ or available for sale Such assets are carried at amortised
Cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money ts significant Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement
when the loans and recetvables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process

Available for sale financial assets

‘Available for sale financial assets are non-derwative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the three

preceding categones After initial recognition, interest 1s taken to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and the assets

are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the ivestment is derecognised, or

until the investment 1s deemed to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity 1s included in the income i
statement

Financial halulities at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)
Denwatives liabilities are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments They are carried in the balance sheet
at fair value with gains or losses recognised m the income statement

Financial habilities measured at amortised cost

All non-derivative financial liabilities are classtfied as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Non-dertvative financial abilities are
initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs After initial recognition, non-deriatrve
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method Gains and losses are recognised in the
income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an original
matuntty date of three months or less In addition, the Group uses Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash which are bought
and sold on a daily basis to meet the cash requirements of the business These funds are also categorised as cash equivalents

For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank
overdrafts

Cash equivalents are classified as loans and recetvables financial instruments.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments
Financial assets ~ pension escrow investments comprise short term deposits with banks conventional gilt edged securities index-tinked gilt
edged securities and Treasury bills

Short term deposits with banks (pension escrow investments) are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments

Conventional gilt edged securities index-linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills are classified as available for sale financial instruments
on the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Financial assets - other investments

Financial assets - other investments comprise, short term deposits (other investments) with Government local government or banks with an
‘original maturity of three months or more and conventional gilt edged securities Short term deposits are classified as loans and receivables
financial instruments Conventional gilt edged securities are classified as available for sale financial instruments on the basis that they are
quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity

Financial liabilities - interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when
meurred

Financial liabilities - obligations under finance lease and ture purchase contracts
All obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts are classified as financial labilties measured at amortised cost.

Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred

Denwvative financial instruments
The Group uses derwative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group, in line with the Group's treasury management policies Such derivative financial instruments are mitially stated at fair value

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability m cash flows that 1s
either attributable to a particular nisk assouated with a recognised asset or iabilty or a highly probable forecasted transaction

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting the
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that 1s determined to relate to an effective hedge 1s recognised directly in equity and the
ineffective portion 1s recognised m the income statement I

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non financial asset or non financial labilty then at the time the asset or
hhabilty ts recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are cluded in the initial measurement of
the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability For all other cash flow hedges the gains or losses that are recognised in
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit/loss for example
when the future sale actually occurs

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income
statement in the period

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting At that pomt in time any cumnulative gain or loss on the hedging mstrument recognised m equity 1s kept in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs If a hedged transaction 1s no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity 1s transferred to

The fair value of quoted investments 1s determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date Where there is,
no active market fair value 1s determined using valuation techniques These include using recent arm’s length market transactions reference to
the current market value of another instrument which 1s substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models
Specifically, in the absence of quoted market prices derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the underlying commodity/currency
and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date)

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of quoted market prices,
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date

Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it Is settled sold cancelled or expires

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation 1s based on the results for the year as adjusted for ttems that are non-assessable or disallowed It 1s calculated
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date

Deferred tax 1s provided using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except
° initial recognition of goodwill,

. ‘the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss, and

. taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it 1s probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future

Other than stated betow, deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry-forward of unused tax assets and
unused tax losses, to the extent that it 1s probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences
carry-forward of unused tax assets, and unused tax losses can be utilised Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of

s deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that ts not a business
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss and

. deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the
extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary difference will be utilised

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 1s reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the
lability 1s settled based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date Deferred tax
balances are not discounted

Current and deferred tax 1s charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity Otherwise
it 1s recognised in the income statement

Provisions:

Provisions are recognised when the Graup has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it 1s probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation If the effect
of the time value of money 1s material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

The pension plans’ assets for the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term The resulting defined benefit asset or lability 1s presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Full actuanal
valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determmed by the Trustees and with appropnate updates and
accounting adjustments at each balance sheet date form the basis of the deficit disclosed All members of defined benefit schemes are
contracted out of the eamnings-related part of the State pension scheme

For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from
settlements, curtailments and past service costs The net difference between the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets 1s
recognised as net pensions interest in the mcome statement Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
recognised income and expense (SORIE) Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and losses ts also recognised in the
SORIE

For defined contribution schemes, the Group s contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate Overseas subsidianes make separate arrangements for the provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits

2. Accounting policies (contmued)

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail Holdings plc 1s sterling (£) The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in
Europe is mainly the euro (€)

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date The trading results of
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period being a reasonable approximation to the actual

transaction rate The exchange differences arising on the translation, since the date of transition to IFRSs are taken directly to the Foreign

Currency Translation Reserve in equity

Transactions mn foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date Currently hedge accounting 1s not claimed for any monetary assets and liabilities All differences are therefore
taken to the income statement, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group's net investment in a
foreign operation These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment occurs at which time they are recognised in profit
or toss

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates
of the intial transactions Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date
when the fair value is determined

Contingent liabilities and financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of amounts under IAS 37 or the amounts
initially recognised less when appropriate cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue

Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possibility of losses occurring 1s considered to be remote

Government grants
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement and are shown separately to the expenditure to which they
relate

Segment information

2 Accounting policies (continued)
Accounting standards and interpretations not applied

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (iFRIC) have issued
accounting standards and interpretations with an effective date for accounting periods beginning on ar after the date of these financial
statements Of these the Group has not applied the following

International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) Effective date i

IAS 32 &IAS 1 Amendments to JAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation and IAS 1 1 January 2009

Presentation of Financial Statements - Puttable Financial Instruments and
Obligations Arising on Liquidation

Internationat Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)

IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 - The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and

their interaction 1 January 2008

IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations

The amendment to IFRS 2 deals with vesting conditions and cancellations for shares Although the Group operates the Colleagueshare
phantom share scheme (see policy note above) this does not constitute a share based payment arrangement under IFRS 2 Consequently the
Group has no share based payment arrangements, and therefore, this amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance
of the Group

IFRS 3 Business Combinations

The Group does not anticipate early adopting the revised IFRS 3 and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after
29 March 2010 Whilst it 1s not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a
requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase price, and for contingent consideration to be
recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to
goodwill) The standard also changes the treatment of non-controlling interest (formerly minority interests) with an option to recognise
these at full fair value as at the acquisition date and a requirement for previously held non-controlling interests to be fair valued as at the
date control 1s obtained, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement

IFRS 8 Operating Segments

This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group s operating segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary
(business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments It is anticipated that the operating segments will be the same as the business

segments previously reported under IAS 14 It is expected that this new standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March

2009 and will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

IAS 4 Presentation of Financial Statements

‘This revised standard sets overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements guidelmes for their structure and minimum
requirements for their content It does not change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of specific transactions and other events
required by other IFRSs Hence it 1s expected that this new standard which will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009, will
have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

JAS 23 Borrowing Costs

This standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale {t 1s expected that this new standard will have
‘No impact on the financial position or performance of the Group although the standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 30
March 2009

2 Accounting policies (contimued)

IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financiat Statements

AS 27 revised is effective for annual pends beginning on or after 1 July 2009, with earlier application only permitted when the revised IFRS 3 1s
applied The revised standard applies retrospectively with some exceptions IAS 27 revised no longer restricts the allocation to minority interest of
losses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the non-controlling equity investment in the subsidiary A partial disposal of equity interest ma
subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control will be accounted for as an equity transaction and will have no impact on goodwill nor will it
give rise to any gain or loss Where there 1s loss of control of a subsidiary, any retained interest will have to be remeasured to fair value, which
will impact the gain or loss recognised on disposal It 1s expected that retrospective application of this standard will have no impact on the
financial position or performance of the Group although the standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 29 March 2010

JAS 32 & IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation

The amendments to IAS 32 & IAS 11 require that puttable financial instruments and instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another ;
party a pro-rata share of net assets on liquidation are classified as equity provided that they have particular features and meet specific conditions

It 1s expected that these amendments will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009 and will have no impact on the financial

position or performance of the Group

IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements

This interpretation applies to service concession operators and explains how to account for the obligations undertaken and rights received in
service concession arrangements No members of the Group are operators in this regard and hence the interpretatron will have no impact on
the Group

IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
The Group has no schemes involving custorner loyalty awards hence there will be no impact on the Group's financial statements when this
IFRIC 1s adopted

IFRIC 14 - IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction
This interpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the amount of surplus im a defined benefit scheme that can be recognised
as an asset under IAS 19 on Employee Benefits It is expected that at present, this interpretation will have no impact on the financial position
or performance of the Group as the Group has an absolute right to any assets left over after benefits have been secured

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group's primary
financial statements Certain of the above standards will require amendment to disclosures in the period of inttral application

The above analysis of revenue between segments for 2006-07 has been restated to include the impact of the operations of Royal Mail Estates
Limited (RMEsL) £94m and Romec Limited £143m within the ‘Other businesses’ segment These amounts were previously classified as internal
recharges and hence did not form part of revenue between segments
Operating profit before exceptional items for all UK operations has also been restated as if RMEsL had been operating in 2006-07 in the way it has
operated in 2007-08 The effect of this change has been to reduce the operating profit before exceptional iterns of Royal Mail by £58m and
Parcelforce Worldwide by £3m and to increase the operating loss before exceptional items of Post Office Limited by £9m Consequently, the
operating profit before exceptional items of the Other businesses segment has increased by £70m There has been no overall change to the Total

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £338m (2007 £1,159m) relating to the retirement benefit obligation, €289m (2007
£272m) relating mainly to fixed asset temporary differences, and £189m (2007 £101m) relating to tax losses in subsidiaries that are available
to offset against future taxable profits The Group has capital losses cared forward the tax effect of which 1s £16m (2007 £13m) The Group
has rolled over capital gains of £74m (2007 £86m) no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which the gains have
been rolled be sold at their carrying value, as it is anticipated that a capital loss would anse

At 30 March 2008, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax ability (2007 nil) for taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should
such amounts be remitted due to the avatlability of double taxation relief or other exemptions

The Finance Act 2007 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008 The effect of this change on deferred tax
balances ts cluded in these accounts and is detailed above In his 2007 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced forthcoming
changes to the capital allowances regime which have subsequently been confirmed In accordance with accounting standards the effects of
these capital allowances changes on deferred tax balances has not been reflected in these accounts due to the relevant legislation not having
been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date It 1s expected that the phased abolition of industrial buildings allowances will reduce the
Group's unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately £100m

unit exceeds the recoverable amount The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value m use The carrying value of GLS,

excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities is £369m (2007 £322m) at year end (see note 3) and the operating profit
before exceptional items 1s £114m {2007 £115m) for the year (see note 3) The carrying value represents a multiple of 3 2 (2007 2 8) on

value of GLS has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value No reasonable possible change in the earnings muttiples referenced

Foreign currency risk

The Group ts exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign
origin mail in the UK, the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited and various purchase contracts
denominated in foreign currency These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury Where possible, exposures
are netted internally and any remaining exposure 1s hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts Hedging will not
normally be considered for exposures of less than £1m hedging is normally confined to 80% of the forecast exposure where forecast cash
flows are highly probable

The Group's obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket of currencies
compnsing of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme which is
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basts There has been no external SDR hedge in place throughout the financial year 2007-08 due to
there being no matenal net exposure

For the Bureau de Change business, balances of mayor currency holdings are hedged along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated
Movement

The Group's obligations to settle conveyance charges in USS and euro has been hedged (USS to April 2011, euro to April 2008)
The Group has four active hedge programmes covering obligations to settle euro invoices on automation projects
The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries

Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from financial struments owned by GLS denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet is
calculated as the balance of the struments multiplied by the change in exchange rates and impacts equity

The effect from other financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet 1s calculated as

The effect from derivative assets and liabilities 1s calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet date and impacts equity (for
derwatives within an effective hedging relationship) or profit before taxation for ineffective hedges and derwatives not designated in hedging
relationships

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Credit risk

Royal Mail operates a Credit Policy, which provides a fair and equitable arrangement for all its account customers The level of credit granted 1s
based on a customer s risk profile assessed by an independent credit referencing agent The Credit Policy is applied rigidly within the regulated
products area so as to ensure that Royal Mail is not im breach of compliance legislation Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products is
based on commeraal factors which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk.

financial assets, held to maturity financial assets held for trading financial assets, loans and recewvables financial assets and certain derivative
instruments, the Group invests/trades only with high quattyy financial institutions The Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the
counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group, apart from a £0 2bn exposure to the Royal Bank of Scotland as a result
of the establishment of the two pension escrow accounts This exposure is expected to be short-term, pending the implementation of a longer
term investment strategy for the accounts

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due This 1s
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows Typical short-term investments include money
market funds, time deposits with approved counterparties, UK Government gilts and Treasury bills Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed
to ensure continuity of funding

The unused facilities for Royal Mail Group Ltd of £1,200m expire between 2014 and 2016 (2007 £1,200m expiring between 2014 and 2026)
The unused facilty for Post Office Limited of £870m (2007 £850m) expires in 2011 Additionally the Group has £300m (2007 £300m) of
uncommitted lines of credit which are reviewed annually

costs in the income statement

There 1s no material ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement relating to cash flow hedges

For all the above cash flow hedge programmes the underlying cash flows being hedged are expected to occur at the same dates as the hedge
instruments (derivatives) mature For the non-capital programmes (Diesel and Air Conveyance) the profit or loss will be taken on maturity For
capital programmes, the impact on the income statement will be through the depreciation charge over the life of the asset being hedged

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and deficit in the schemes recognised for the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in
the financial statements of the Group

a) Major assumptions

The size of the pension deficit which is large in the context of the Group and its finances, 1s materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the deficit and overall mcome statement charge The
mayor assumptions were

At 30 March 2008 At 25 March 2007
Apa ipa
Rate of increase in salaries 46 41a
Rate of increase in pensions and deferred pensions 36 31
Discount rate 65 53
Inflation assumption 36 31
Expected average rate of return on assets 68 70

The above assumptions relate to both defined benefit plans with the exception of the expected average rate of return on assets which is
computed for the combined assets of the plans The expected average rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the long-term
expected rate of return of each principal asset class (see section b) The expected average rate of return is computed at each balance sheet
date based on the market values and long-term rate of return of each principal asset class as at that date

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the larger scheme are based on the 1992 series mortality tables allowing for medium cohort’ projections of
future improvements These are detailed below

Average expected life expectancy from age 60 2008 2007

For a current 60 year old female RMPP member 29 years 29 years
For a current 40 year old male RMPP member 28 years 28 years
