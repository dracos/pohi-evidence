EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:

This CCN is in response to Horizon Change Request R0046.

The areas impacted by this introduction are mainly centred around the Horizon Systems
Helpdesk, POCL data feed systems such as HAPS and reference data, outlet procedures and
service management (Customer Service Directorate).

As this CR specifically covers live trial, there is no contractual change at this stage. It is
however anticipated that the introduction of the NBSC beyond live trial will cause contractual
change and be the subject of a separate CR.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: _ HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:
POCL have introduced this change to provide POCL users with additional support for new and
changed business processes during Live Trial.

This change has no impact on service provision, however there is a significant amount of
rework required on existing documents. The initial assessment of 9 man days has been refined
down to 5 .5 man days this consists of document reviews and re-write.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:
An initial assessment of the impact of the introduction of the NBSC is that changes to the
following areas are required:

Documentation.

1. Operational Business Change.
2. Processes for support of TIP, HAPS and reference data — POCL need to specify the expert

FUJ00000407
FUJ00000407
domains identified in CR R0046.
3. Documentation: PPD, Counter Procedures, CEM, HSH processes and procedures.
4. Training — material and course content.
5. Service Management processes such as escalation etc.

A complete list of documentation to be changed is shown on sheet 3. This CCN quantifies the
work involved in making those changes.

HSH operations.

The longer term inter-working processes between HSH and NBSC will need to be agreed and
developed. Interim processes for transferring calls by telephone are already in operation but it
is unlikely that this process can be sustained once volumes rise.

Current operational split is as follows: NBSC replaces the regional helpdesks and provides a
channel for all calls into HSH from POCL. The NBSC is responsible for all Horizon business
related incidents. HSH retains its contractual responsibility and remains responsible for
Horizon system related incidents.

Current agreements on call handling are as follows: The called helpdesk will ascertain the
nature of the call and either instruct the caller to ring the correct helpdesk or if some diagnosis
has occurred will instruct the caller that the call will be transferred to the appropriate helpdesk.
The call will then be terminated and the other helpdesk contacted, a new call will be raised and
the new helpdesk will contact the caller. All calls will still be within the scope of the Helpdesk
call matrix.

Projected call volumes across this link are currently not known and neither helpdesk has been
set targets on call back or responsiveness.

Action Number: 8 Date Jul 23 1999 09:49:29 By: Lisa Burchell

HORIZON CHANGE CONTROL REJECT: This change request only refers to live trial. Live Trial has made
little change to ICL Pathway because whereas POCL had intended to use the regional helplines for Horizon
Business Calls, they are instead using LTSC. The outlets will continue to diagnose the incident, and then
phone the appropriate helpdesk. If the outlet has mis-diagnosed the incident, the call should then be
transferred. There has therefore been no significant change apart from the name of the POCL support centre
and there should be little or no cost to Pathway. There will be a change request issued for the long term plans
for the NBSC.23RD July 1999
