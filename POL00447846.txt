- POL Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) impairment - reduced from {
some additional Freehold Land and Buildings in the asset base.

- Tax risks - a contingent liability has been included in the ARA following discussion at
ARC on 7/11/23. This is high level and does not reference the specific risks.

Assurance activities have been completed including Deloitte review of front half metrics (see
separate report presented by Deloitte), GE attestations over accuracy and completeness of
their respective statements and Executive declarations identifying material items to be aware
of have been received (see separate paper). These activities are in addition to the PwC audit
over the financial statements which is well progressed (see separate report by PwC). Meetings
have been held with all Board members where requested, to discuss the Going Concern position
in more detail and enable any concerns to be raised and addressed ahead of the Board meeting
on 28/11/23.

ARC is requested to review this paper alongside the ARA, Executive Declarations paper and
Deloitte paper and approve a recommendation be taken to Board that the ARA be approved,
subject to final approval from a Board sub-committee on Monday 11 December 2023 (to be
established by the Board on 28/11/23).

Report

ARA status and assurance
1. The ARA is substantially complete and can be presented to Board for approval. Ahead of
signing, the ARA may be updated in respect of the following:

a. Finance review —- the Finance team continue to perform consistency checks over
the document which may elicit minor amendments.

b. PwC - reviews are well progressed but will continue until the point of signing.
Additionally, the finalisation of audit items, see PwC’s separate report, may
require further amendments.

c. Subsequent events - should any other matters come to light ahead of signing
that are deemed material and will need reflecting in the ARA.

d. Tax - the disclosures in note 8 of the ARA will be amended prior to signing to
reflect the final financials for the year, with the current disclosures being
produced in early November.

2. The ARA has been reviewed by a significant number of interested parties with comments
reflected in the version presented to ARC. These parties include - management, GE, ARC,
Board, UKGI, DBT and PwC. In addition specific reviews have been undertaken by an
external Copywriter, TB Cardew, Deloitte and Pinsent Masons over defined items / areas.

3. The Remuneration Committee report has been through Remuneration Committee
(“Remco”) review and is expected to have been formally approved by RemCo prior to
27/11/23.

4. Deloitte’s review over Front Half metrics and statements has been completed. Of the 119
in scope item, 16 were identified as having issues / discrepancies. The findings were all
relatively minor in nature and have either been addressed in the latest version of the ARA
or have been confirmed by management as not requiring update. See the separate report
presented by Deloitte for the detailed findings.

5. GE ownership of ARA sections has previously been established. Declarations have been
sent to all GE owners of sections to attest to the accuracy and completeness of their
sections, see Appendix 1 for further details of ownership. These will be obtained and filed
prior to signing. In relation to sections of the ARA owned by Board members, attestations
have not been sought from the Chairman or CEO as they will be formally approving the
ARA at the Board meeting and signing the ARA, thus attestation/approval is implicit in the
signing. Similarly an attestation has not been obtained from the Remco chair as formal
approval of their section is obtained as part of the Remco meeting and as part of the Board
meeting through the overall ARA approval.

6. A separate paper has been produced by the Internal Audit and Risk team regarding GE
attestations which help to establish the completeness of disclosures in the ARA.

8. Discussions have been offered to all Board members ahead of the Board meeting on

28/11/23 to discuss the Going Concern assumption in greater detail. No Board members
i jption was however general consensus
would be beneficial. Management has explored this
with UKGI and DBT however due to both a subsidy and funding classification risk DBT are
unable to grant an extended waiver. Wording has been included in the Letter of Support
to provide comfort that DBT will continue to work with POL to obtain additional waivers
should they be required. The waiver provided by DBT is to 31 July 2024.

Key updates to the ARA

9. Following the Financial Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) review of the POL FY20/21 ARA in
Sept-Nov 2022, amendments have been made to the ARA to both disclose the review that
was undertaken (see the Finance and Business Review (“F&BR”) section of the ARA) and
to ensure their recommendations are reflected. Details of the findings and amendments
made are documented in Appendix 2.

10. The Going Concern (“GC”) disclosure has been updated to reflect PwC and ARC Chair
review comments, principally relating to the wording around th
addition to the expected funding position as at the time of signing. We would like to draw
ARC's attention to the GC disclosures in the Directors Report and in Note 1 of the ARA.

he announcement of the request for

adjusting Post Balance Sheet Event (“PBSE”), as seen in note 25 in the ARA. Management
have added a note in the contingent liability section to cross reference to the PBSE given
it is material. PwC is comfortable with this approach.

14.

cussions on 7/11/23, the POL CGU impairment has reduced fro!
etaining some additional costs related to freehold buildings as a result
whic shows that they can be supported by a FVLCOD approach. Additional wording has
been added to the ARA regarding asset values, clearly stating that freehold land and
buildings have not been impaired on the basis that the FVLCOD approach resulted in those
assets being fully supportable.

15. Acontingent liability has now been disclosed regarding the tax risks faced, being IR35 and
corporation tax on Remediation Matters (“RM”) items. The disclosure doesn’t include any
specifics but notes that risks exist that could have a material impact. See note 20 in the
ARA for further details.

Going Concern

16. An updated GC assessment has been produced and is included in the reading room. The
primary change has been to update the forecasts using managements 7+5 view, which
includes an increase of £24m in Inquiry costs, taking the running costs of Inquiry and RM
beyond the £150m expected funding level for FY23/24 and FY24/25. HMT have recently
declined DBT’s request to include a contingency of £40m in the £150m funding request,
hence creating this downside in the forecasts. Management has agreed updated wording
to the LOS to reflect the need to access such contingency funding as our forecasts are
indicating an additional amount of funding is required for the RU/Inquiry activity.

17. The impact of the above is to bring the anticipated rward,
from February 2025 to October 2024, with the breach remaining in place from that point
onwards, until March 2025 where headroom bounces back marginally.

18. Management's assessment is that this does not alter the overall isis) position, as:

ge

Factored into the GC model base case are costs of in relation to SPMP from July
2024 to March 2025, which are treated as unfunded in the model.

19. Managements latest GC assessment is included in the reading room and a copy of the
finalised Letter of Support is included in Appendix 3.

6 December 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

LETTER OF SUPPORT — POST OFFICE LIMITED - IN CONFIDENCE

1. This letter is intended to assist the board of directors (the,“Board”) of Post Office Limited (“POL” or
the “Company”) with its assessment of the Company's! IRRELEVANT __ I in relation to the
signing of the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements in respect of the year ended 26

of whether the Company will be in a position to meet its liabilities as they fall due is the responsibility
of the Board and not DBT, and that DBT expresses no view on this subject.

ensure that POL can continue to have access to sufficient financing

signing as practicably possible, subject to HMT consent.

Technology Investment Plans

10. DBT acknowledges the Company's funding request, which sets out POL’s investment plans to
continue working on its exit from and replacement of the Horizon IT System until at least June 2024,
including work on associated scope that is considered critical to POL, and to extend its contractual
arrangements with Fujitsu for the Horizon infrastructure support arrangements until at least the end
of FY24/25.

11. The Department intends to provide sufficient funding to POL to ensure that the necessary activities,
agreed between POL and DBT following their funding bid in June, can be completed. This is subject
to HMT consent, the application of the Subsidy Control Act 2022 and consideration of the advisory
outcome of the referral process to the Subsidy Advice Unit of the CMA. It is expected that these
conditions will have been met prior to the signing of POL’s FY22/23 ARA but in circumstances in
which this is not possible the Department will use best endeavours to ensure such arrangements are
in place as soon after signing as practicably possible.

12. The Department also acknowledges that POL is intending to submit a further funding request in early
2024 to fund the continuation of its work to exit from and replace the Horizon IT System after June
2024, and DBT will work collaboratively with POL on this submission to ensure clear alignment
between parties and to minimise the risk of delay to the technology investment plans.

Horizon Liabilities and Other Liabilities

13. DBT acknowledges that it already has in place arrangements with POL for the funding of
compensation associated with the Horizon Shortfalls Scheme, Overturned Convictions and
Suspension Remuneration Review and that POL also requires a funding commitment for liabilities
associated with Policy and Procé Ri diation (“PPR”). Furthermore, DBT acknowledges POL’s
position that having self-funded ; costs (including handling costs) associated with the
Horizon IT scandal to date, the pany can no longer afford to make any further contribution to
these costs from its own funds. It has therefore submitted a funding request to the Department to
make sure that all handling costs of the schemes associated with the Horizon Liabilities, as well as
costs associated with the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the “POHIT Inquiry”), from the start of
FY23/24, can be funded by the Department.

14. The Department intends to provide sufficient funding to POL to ensure that these activities are
appropriately funded, subject to the application of the Subsidy Control Act 2022 and consideration of
the advisory outcome of the referral process to the Subsidy Advice Unit of the CMA. It is expected
that these requirements will have been met prior to the signing of POL’s FY22/23 ARA but in
circumstances in which this is not possible the Department will use reasonable endeavours to ensure
such arrangements are in place as soon after signing as practicably possible.

15. The Department also recognises that the arrangements it has in place, and/or which it plans to put in
place, are intended to make sure that (1) the Horizon Liabilities, (2) the costs associated with handling
payments linked to the Horizon Liabilitie:
