Ir have changed the priority of this from D -> C as there is a risk that these
closure reports could be lost if 1) the auditor accidentally deletes one, or
2) is there is a disk failure of the F: drive as this drive is not backed up.

without this change we will be running with an incomplete audit trail of the
actions taken by the Audit system.

IMPACT ON OPERATIONS: None.

RISK: Low. A single executable needs to be replaced.

this PinICl wrongly (apparently) sent to BMF for a live fix authorisation at
IsT3S50R. QFP can you please change the Target Release to: BI3S50R so that we
can implement a ‘development' fix.

[thanks

Bryan, sending it to the RMF was not wrong but perhaps inappropriate. "R”
releases must when possible be kept clear for urgent correction to the live
estate, not cluttered up with fixes which could and should wait for the next
baseline release. The view of the RMF was that not only was this not
sufficiently urgent to go into an "R" release, but that given the workaround
(don't delete the relevant files) it did not warrent recommendation for
clearance at the next baseline. If you disagree, please resubmit with reasons
(to the RMF if you are still recommending S50R, to QFP if you now recommend a
baseline (S60) release).

fhe reasons that we believe that this should be included as an S5OR fix are
three fold:

h) The risk of a file being accidentally deleted. Currently the Auditors
manually cut and paste the file from the Audit server to the Audit
workstation in order to associate it with the relevant ARQ. We have
introduced a temporary change in their working practices such that they copy
land paste the file, thus reducing the risk of losing it. However the risk is
still there.

2) There is an operational impact in that until the fix is installed,
jperiodically files must be manually renamed (to quite a convoluted new name)
land moved in to the Audit servers Audit point for writing to the Audit trail.
this is also error prone and could result in an incorrectly named file or the
loss of a file (Although in this case there should be a copy on one of the
wudit workstations) .

3) The output from the ARQ process is often used as evidence in court
hearings and the ARQ closure reports are the Audit Trail of how this evidence
as generated.
