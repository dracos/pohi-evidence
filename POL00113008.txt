contractual and legal constraints which stacked the odds against them, and then ran them
through, good and proper.

| would urge any disaffected Subpostmasters reading this to get in touch NOW. As far as |
understand it, part of the process of mediation is that you will be required to sign a
gagging order which stops you, under threat of being sued, from talking to anyone,
especially journalists, about any settlement or agreement you make with the Post Office.

What I'm not clear on is whether the gagging order is signed before any settlement is
agreed, or whether it's signed as part of the settlement. | can't imagine it's the former, but
| did hear someone suggest it was.

Even assuming it's only signed on agreement of settlement, it's not ideal. You'll (hopefully)
get some money back, but you won't be able to protest your innocence or tell the story of
what happened to you to anyone, ever again.

James Arbuthnot writes to Paula Vennells disagreeing with her letter of 28 November
which outlined how the scheme and its processes were operating as they were, jointly,
designed to.

James Arbuthnot takes issue regarding the non-mediation of criminal cases; the scope of
the Scheme; and postmasters no being present at Working Group meetings when their
case is discussed.

He asks that PO does not utilise any time barred limitation point in resisting legal claims;
for agreement that no data relating to these cases will be destroyed; that PO agrees to

Second Sight meeting with MPs.

doing this in secret. It’s an extraordinary story; they’re trying to bar from mediation 90% of

Thanks to James Arbuthnot's dogged pursuit of the Post Office in parliament, a lot of the
information which the Post Office has tried to keep secret is finally surfacing. There is
plenty more which they are successfully suppressing, but they are being called out on it,
by angry MPs.

Remember News International and their absolute total denial that anyone was phone
hacking other than Clive Goodman?

All the Post Office are admitting to at the moment is that they could have done a few
(unspecified) things better.

The full horror of what Post Office "auditors", "investigators" and prosecutors have done
to dozens of subpostmasters and the basis on which they have done it has not yet fully
come to light.

It's easy to forget, and the Post Office would very much like you to forget, there are
people whose lives (and certainly careers) have been ruined by what happened to them.
The Post Office would have that a good number of these people are culpable, and
admitted as much in a court of law.

The Post Office is not interested in the idea that many of the subpostmasters who false
accounted and pleaded guilty claim they did so because of the nightmarish environment
they found themselves in. The Post Office has already exonerated itself of any blame, so
we know it's done nothing wrong.
