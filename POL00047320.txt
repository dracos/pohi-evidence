interview is being conducted in an interview room at Huyton Delivery
Office. I wish to ask you some questions about pension and allowance
discrepancies. At the end of this interview I will hand you a notice
explaining what will happen to the tapes. OK?

LB OK

SB Before we carry on I have to caution you. You do not have to say
anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when
questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do
say may be given in evidence. Do you understand that caution?

LB OK, yeh.

SB Would you like to tell me what your interpretation of that caution is.

LB No. I don’t understand what you’re saying.

SB Well, you’re now being cautioned.

LB Right.

SB The caution is broken down into 3 parts and the first part, you do not have
to say anything, which is quite easy to understand. You can sit there, I can
go through questions with you and you don’t have to give me any
answers.

LB OK.

SB The third part of it is anything you do say may be given in evidence which
means that anything you do tell me, if the matter goes to court it can be
used as evidence.

LB OK.

SB OK. The middle part is a bit more confusing. It may harm your defence if
you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in
court. That means if you say nothing now but in court you might give an
explanation to the same question that could be given now then the court

SB And you sort of ... say for example the pension is for £100, you’re only
paying the one docket out.

LB Yeh.

10.00 SB So after you’ve scanned and it’s gone on the machine, the machine shows
up £100, how do you pay it out, do you pay out what you see on the
machine or what the value of the docket is.

LB I put the docket away, I don’t know. Different...it varies what you do.

SB So say you made a mistake on the machine, the machine’s telling you to
pay out £200...

LB Yeh.

SB What would you pay out when you know the voucher’s only for £100.

LB If I know it’s for 100 it’d pay .... ’'d ask them for the book back and scan
it again.

SB Yeh. OK. So you would normally know that the value of the docket is
what you’ve got to pay out then, is that what you’re saying?

LB What’s there, yeh, what it adds up to.

11.00 SB Say when you’ve done this you’ve made a mistake and you know you’ve
put the wrong amount in, you may have put 2 dockets instead of 1 and
you’re paying out... the machine’s showing £200 but you’ve only got
£100 but the machine’s telling you to pay £200, is there any way of
correcting that mistake?

LB Bin it and get the book back off them.

SB Yeh. I’m thinking more isn’t there a procedure you go through to correct
mistakes in the Horizon system, what’s in there ... at any stage during the
cash account week.

LB What do yo mean?

SB Reversals. Do you know how to do a reversal?

LB Oh yeh. What do you mean, if you’re checking the dockets and the
dockets are wrong.

SB Yeh, to see if the dockets are wrong. When you check your dockets and
you find that one is wrong, the wrong amount....

LB Yeh.

SB ....that you paid and you haven’t got ... it’s gone in the machine, how
would you correct that so you ...

LB Er.. go to reversals.

SB Do you know how to do a reversal?

LB I think so, yeh. I presume I do, if 1 didn’t I’d just ask someone.

SB Yeh.

SB Have you ever done one?

LB I dunno. Probably.

AG It sounds as if it’s very infrequent then.

SB Probably. I dunno.

12.00 AG I think what Steve is saying in the first instance is let’s say you’ve got a
pension at £50 and you mis-key the amount so it reads £250 on the screen,
would you pay out the £250?

LB I don’t know, maybe, maybe not, I don’t know, it depends if I notice it.
It’s that fast and that busy in here, it depends if you notice it.

AG So what you’re saying that it’s quite possible that if you’ ve accepted a
pension docket or an allowance docket ...

LB If I haven’t noticed it yeh.

AG You would pay out 200 and odd pounds too much.

LB Yeh.

AG How many times do you think that might happen?

LB I don’t know.

LB Crap making mistakes.

AG Ych, if someone makes mistakes maybe £100 or £200 a week in that
particular fashion what would you think of them?

it’s me, I don’t know. You’re not gonna say I’m crap, I thought I was
doing my job all right.

LB Every day if we can. Every day.

SB So each day you do a run off of your pensions.

LB If we can yeh, if it’s not busy.

SB After you’ve done your run off in a quict time what happens to the
pensions then?

LB Shove them in a drawer.

SB Is there any sort of check performed?

LB No. We count how many’s there and that’s it.

SB So you count the number of dockets.

LB Yeh.

SB Do you do any other sort of check?

LB No.

SB It’s just a physical check of ..

LB Just count them.

SB If you’ve paid out 50 dockets you just count that there’s 50 dockets.

LB 50 dockets

SB What would happen if you’ve paid out a wrong amount, you’ve keyed in a
wrong amount but you know you’ve paid out the correct amount. For
arguments sake if the docket was for £50 but you paid out £100 ...

LB Be over.

SB So you understand that if you made a mistake ...

LB You’d be over or short, whatever way, yeh.

You’ve give it away.

Thaven’t got it.

OK. Do you think this has happened on any other occasions?

Yes, ‘cos you’ve come for discrepancies.

That’s a discrepancy.

Yeh.

Do you think it’s happened on any other occasions?

Not that I know of, no.

Just to clarify that then Lisa, what you’re saying is that someone with the
child benefit book which has the reference 973023610F with a docket
payable on the 3" June has come in last Thursday. The value of the
docket is £26.30, you’ve keyed in the wrong amount by £200 and you’ve
paid this woman £226.30 instead of £26.30, is that what you’re saying?

I must have done, yeh.

So if we find out who that person is and we go and get a statement from
them....

See if they’ve got it.

What do you think they might say?

If they’re honest they’ll say yeh, if they’re not they’ll say no.

Right, so we’re on a 50/50 there aren’t we if we go and find this person
and .. in fact we can almost read the signature, it looks like maybe
Beaumorris or something like that, Beardwood, it certainly looks like B-E-
A the first 3 letters so we could find out who that is and we could get a
statement from them. And what do you think might happen if they say
they were only paid out £26.30, what would you say to that?

I don’t know. What can I say?

AG They’re static aren’t they because you get an allowance for a number of
children.

LB Yeh.

23.00 AG An old age pensioner, a group 13 can vary because of graduated pension
which you probably don’t know much about but I’m old enough to
remember .... You paid money into a fund and they gave you 6 old
pennies for every so much you paid into the graduated pension fund. So
that can vary by pennies a week. So you get the standard pension which
may be £41.40, you'll get a few of those but then you’ll get lots of others
with varying be a penny...

LB Different amount, yeh.

AG And the same with sickness benefit. Maybe there’s a standard sickness
benefit but there’s a lot of others where they’re all different aren’t they?
But with child benefit it’s based on the number of children that you’ve got
so you have the standard set amounts. Now some are paid monthly aren’t
they or four weekly so you might get a large amount but the 2 examples
we’ve seen, we’ve got a £15.50 ..

LB 75.

AG Is it £15.75, that’s been fed in as £115.75 and we’ve got another one for
£25.30 ... was is 25 or 26?

LB £26.30. £226.30

24.00 AG £26.30 fed in as £226.30 so you must have a bit of a nervous finger there
because you’ve fed in 115 and 226. Now that’s obviously a different
payee because it’s a different amount. If we were to go to that person and
get a statement from them and they were to deny that they’d not been paid
the £100 so that’s 2 people. Again we’re on a 50/50. Either we get 2

dishonest people and they both say, no we won’t pay it out or we get 2

honest people and they say yes it was paid out, I was only waiting for you
to come and collect it from me. So there’s 2 examples, so they’re 2
different people. It’s not the same person every week, it’s 2 different
people. Steve’ll show you a couple more examples I think.

25.00 SB Can you just sign the bottom of that to say that you’ve seen it. And that
one as well. Just a couple more. Sign the bottom.. the top of that. OK.
The last example we’ve just shown you, I’m now gonna show you part of
the transaction log that was run off at quarter past 6 on the S“ for that one
for the 23". And you see the highlighted bits, that’ll be known as SB7.
There’s the £115.75 that’d been claimed at 9:42 but also what else has
been paid out at the same time?

LB Invalidity benefit. What do you mean?

SB Well, that’s all part of the same transaction so you haven’t just paid the
child benefit out at that time, a group 14 pension has also been paid out.
LB Right.

SB You see what we’re getting at, it wasn’t just a one transaction when
you’ve been busy and you might have double pressed the key, you’ve
actually keyed in 2 different ones haven’t you, 2 different groups, pensions
and that’s the amount you paid out ‘cos if you add them 2 together...

LB It comes to that.

SB It comes to that amount.

LB Right.

SB So we’ve now got a slight variation of what we’ve been speaking about of
just paying out 1 voucher, we’re now paying out 2 vouchers and still
coming across mistakes. Could there be any explanation?

LB No.

LB And it’s not there?

AG What’s the date on that?

SB 30".

AG Of?

SB May. We haven’t got the dockets with us ...

LB Right.

28.00 SB ... but it can be got hold of, but again that’s the one that’s missing.

LB It’s missing. It’s not there?

SB Well it’s not right. Have you any explanation of why? OK. We can get
hold of it.

LB Yeh.

SB it’s not a problem but that is missing, as it’s not here ...?.. that’s
missing or the amount is wrong. We’ve now got 3 or 4 different
examples, you’ve said to me that in your words you’re not crap.

29.00 LB No, I never said I’m not crap.

SB I think you did before.

LB I’m not perfect.

SB But we’ve now suddenly .... £500, now we’re getting a bit away from just
being genuine mistakes now aren’t we.

I think it’s a mistake.

You're losing 2 or 300 pound a week.

I’m not doing the job very good.

And that’s on a day that you’re not normally in. We’re now, you know,
£500 and we’ve only gone back a few weeks. We’re only talking 2 or 3
weeks and I believe you were on leave the other week. You were on
leave the other week?

I don’t when I was on leave. I’ve had leave, I’m not ..

I’ve had it confirmed by your boss that you’ve been on leave and there
were no discrepancies that week.

I can’t believe it ...?..

So you admit that you’re making the discrepancies then?

Well I obviously have, haven’t I? It’s me who’s logged on.

But don’t you think a clerk with 13 years experience, it’s a bit ... No,
there’s an explanation. I don’t think it’s just being careless and pressing
the wrong key twice. It’s happening too often. I’ll show you this ... it’s a
print out .. you know the pensions go through Lisahally to be checked and
sealed up and off in the pouch, well week 42 of the last cash account year
01/02, Lisahally have checked them and the group 13, one order value
£35.05 has been claimed as £135.05. That was down to B stock, B date
stamp, you were using B date stamp. Again the following week, group
13, £76.95 has been claimed as £176.95 and again B date stamp. You see
where we’re going.

Yeh. I haven’t got it.

It’s not careless. Do you think somebody else is using your code?

No, no one can, no. I work fast, I’m not thinking but I work fast, try and

get through the queue as quick as I can. The pressure’s on and I try and

work as fast as I can.

SB But if we look at these, the explanation was with the £15.75 that you’d
pressed the key twice for £115, that would be £335 not £135, wouldn’t it?

LB Yeh.

SB And the same would be with that one, that would be £776, not £176 so
the explanation of pressing the key twice doesn’t quite work in these
examples does it?

LB No.

33.00 SB So you know ... week 44 which is the week after, again group 14
£115.50, that’s been claimed as £215, again to use your explanation of the
double press of the key, that would be £1115. Then week 45, £22.48 in
group 13 claimed as £122, another £100 out.

LB God.

SB Group 5, £25.85 claimed as £125.85, another £100. Group 14, £140.55
claimed as £240.55. Another £100 out and that’s just on the checks that
have come back. So I don’t think it’s just an explanation of pressing the
key, I don’t think you’re that poor a clerk, do you Lisa?

LB No, I don’t think so, no.

SB If it’s not carelessness and it’s not somebody else doing it, what does that
leave us with?

LB You think I’m taking it.

33.40 SB Well are you?

LB No, I haven’t got it. Not that that’s an excuse.

not that it’s an excuse. My head’s up my arse most of the time, I’m
sorry. I’m trying to work as fast as I can.

34.00 SB But we’ve gone through the possibilities that when you’re working as fast
as you can and hitting a wrong key would normally show whatever the

first number of the pension you’re paying out would be. But these
examples where it’s a different number completely and you notice what’s
very ... well, of all the examples that you’ve seen ...
LB 100s and 200s.
SB It’s an equal amount every time isn’t it, £100, £200.
AG They’re not transposed figures are they? We’re not feeding 52 in instead
of 25, it’s just a straight £100 or £200 isn’t it?
LB Yeh.
SB As you say the safety valve for the post office is the balance and I don’t
think any of your balances have reflected this.
LB No, I’ve balanced all right.

35.00 SB And I don’t think you’ve paid out to all the customers for that much
money. I’m sure everybody pays ... I’m not saying that all your customers
are honest ..

LB I'd say half and half would come back. Am I losing it any other time
during the day?

SB No. It’s all on the pensions. All down to B date stamp

LB Yeh.

AG We’ve got a choice of 2 things haven’t we Lisa, either you’re totally
incompetent and you’re costing the Post Office 3 or 4 hundred pounds a
week and therefore we can’t afford to keep you...

LB Don’t sack me.

AG Or you’re fiddling the pensions deliberately and you’re pocketing the
money.

LB No, I haven’t got it, I haven’t got it, I haven’t.

AG Someone’s got it.

LB Thaven’t got it.

36.00 AG All these customers being paid out too much, not one of them says at the
time. If I was due for £25.60 or £26.30, whatever the amount is, and you
gave me £125, I would say why are you giving me all that and I’m damn
sure that you know as a reasonable counter clerk, you know that to pay
out on the screen for a docket that’s worth £25 means you’ve made a
mistake.

LB Yeh.

AG Now, I accept that you might! so you bring those
to work and then you just...

LB I’m trying not to, I didn’t think I was.

AG Well this has been going on since... what’s the date of this, January of this
year so it took you 6 months and if it’s £200 a week.

LB It’s a lot of money.

AG How much is that?

LB A lot of money.

SB It equates to about £5000. No, I don’t think it’s carelessness. I don’t
think Tony thinks it’s carelessness.

LB T haven’t got it.

37.00 SB It’s somewhere. It’s all through your stock and there’s no way that
you’ve made that many mistakes, careless mistakes. You’re too
experienced a clerk.

AG “Expensive to keep. Have you got a mortgage?

LB Yeh.

AG How much is the mortgage?

LB T owe £288.

AG A month?

LB Yeh.

AG So there’s 2 weeks, almost 2 weeks pay goes on the mortgage.

LB My husband pays it.

AG Does he?

LB Hmm.

AG So you haven’t got a mortgage then?

LB Well yeh I have

AG So if your husband is paying the mortgage, you haven’t got a mortgage at
the moment. So you don’t have to pay £280 a month out of your £180 a
week.

LB No.

38.00 AG So you get £180 a week to look after “what other bills

have you got?

LB Nothing, just basic bills. ‘Leccy and whatever else.

SB How much do you pay for your electricity.

LB I get about a tenner a week.

SB That’s £40. £10 per week. What about gas?

LB ..-2... [get my bill. Buy a stamp or wait till I get my bill.

SB So if you buy a stamp, what would you say you pay, your gas bill going
out. What was your last bill, quarterly bill?

LB £78.

SB £78 a quarter.

LB I had £40 in stamps and I paid it the other day.

SB Yeh. £78 so £25 give and take a pound a month. £1 a week.

AG Do you go out at all?

LB No.

SB .2.. per week.

LB T’ll say 40 but it’s not even that, it won’t be that much.

39.00 SB Call it £30. What about travelling expenses?
LB My dad bought me a car.
SB What about petrol then?
LB I only live down the road.
SB How much do you put in a week?
LB I don’t know, I just fill it up when it needs filling up.
SB £10 a week. Who pays the tax and insurance?
LB Insurance £27. A month.
SB A month. Are you responsible for paying for the tax?
LB Yeh.
SB So that would be another £5 a week, £10 a month.... It’s £100 isn’t it, £2
isn’t it. So that’s a third of your wages going on that before you’ve sort
of done anything. Any other expenses? Insurance policies?
LB No, they just come out of my wages anyway.
40.00 SB Out of £180 or do you go home with £180?

LB T go home with £180.

SB So you actually earn a little bit more than £180. OK. If we just go off

this, not that you’re saying that these are all mistakes, carelessness .. isn’t
it a bit strange that they’re just happening in the pensions and not in your
other work?

LB Like in what?

SB Well your giros have not been proved to be wrong, your savings bank has
not been proved to be wrong. It’s only pensions that have proved to be
wrong by £100 or £200 at a time.

LB Dunno

AG I think it’s a question of not whether you’ve done it but why have you
done it.

in just a few weeks.
