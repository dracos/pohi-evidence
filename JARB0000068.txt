Subject: Meeting

Dear James

Good to catch-up up with you again yesterday and I enjoyed our
discussion.

It was particularly interesting to share views and ideas on the
subject of the Reserve Forces and I'll give some thought of what more
we can do to be more visible and vocal in our support.

I also enjoyed our brief discussion about the Falklands; I'm sure
I'll get back there one day.

I'll contact your office about a potential constituency visit during
one of your Fridays in autumn; it would be good for members of our
team locally to meet you and for you to see what we are up to in your
area.

With regards to The Post Office, as discussed, I really do think that
a continued open and inclusive engagement with Paula Vennells would
be the best way forward. I hold her in very high regard and she is
without doubt the most morally and socially aware CEO that I deal
with. I always think with these kind of sensitive situations that
agreeing a common approach on the issues is often best for the people
who are affected. Do let me know if you think I can help in any way.

In the meantime, I hope you find time to enjoy some of the summer and
I'll look forward to seeing you at Conference (if not before) where I
think it would be good for me to introduce you to our CEO, Duncan
Tait.

Best regards
