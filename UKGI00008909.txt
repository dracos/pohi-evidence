Good if it is going to the Board. I’ve re-read the wording of the note and it’s pretty clear - there’s no mention of the
Board or the sub-committee in relation to the decision to appeal. I’ve emailed Tim Parker about it.

On BEIS I think it would be wise to tell BEIS what POL intends to do and give people a chance to ask questions or
disagree if they want to. Consultation may be too strong a word for it. I doubt it will be contentious although an
appeal will probably involve more litigation costs and I imagine will probably raise more questions for Ministers from
MPs and NAO.

I have asked for the export reports. They may be subject to confidentiality provisions until the Horizon trial starts but I
shall wait for POL’s response.

On para 4.8 lets discuss with POL when we meet tomorrow. I think that process is what Jane proposed in the Board
litigation update note you forwarded before Xmas. I had certainly understood that the decision would also go through
the board litigation sub-committee. Not sure about the merits of consulting BEIS. Certainly they should be kept
informed. I am catching up with BEIS Legal colleagues tomorrow and a POL litigation update is on my list so I will see
what they think.

Kind regards
Richard

We need to push back on 4.8 don’t we? Could you ask Jane (not Rod) why she thinks it’s appropriate not to put a
decision to appeal through the Board and the litigation sub-committee and why BEIS wouldn’t be consulted ona

decision like this? Suggest you also ask if Tim Parker agrees with that course of action.

Have you asked for the experts reports on Horizon?

Richard, Josh,

In accordance with the Information Sharing Protocol agreed on 11 June 2018, I attach an update on the Post Office
Group Litigation.

We suggest that the headings in this update be used as a rough agenda for our meeting at 1145am on 8 January 2019,
in particular sections 2, 3 and 4 which deal with the delivery of the judgment on the Common Issues and potential

appeal.

With kind regards and best wishes for the New Year,
Rodric
