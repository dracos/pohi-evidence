1. Introduction
This document is an Operational Level Agreement (OLA) between Post Office Network and
ICL Pathway. It outlines the practical arrangements that have been agreed between the two

organisations for interfaces in relation to ‘Product’ Reference Data changes as part of the
overall Horizon service.

2. Purpose

This OLA facilitates a joint understanding, and consistent approach to managing and
supporting the operational interface.

This OLA will be used by both organisations as a firm basis for developing appropriate
working level procedures.

3. Scope

This OLA applies only to the interfaces across which ‘Product’ Reference Data Changes are
passed between BSM/OSG - ICL Pathway - BSM/OSG.

Where appropriate, this OLA conforms to the concepts and principles of the joint Service
Management Framework agreed between PON and ICL Pathway.

3.1. Exclusions
¢ The verification and authorisation of ‘Outlet’ reference data changes

* The transfer of Reference Data between PON RDS Chesterfield and ICL Pathway RDMC
* The delivery of Reference Data from ICL Pathway systems to Horizon counters

3.2 Service Management Framework

Where appropriate, this OLA conforms to the concepts and principles of the joint Service
Management Framework [Reference13] agreed between PON and ICL Pathway.

3.3. Duration

This OLA is effective from the date of signing, throughout National Roll Out, CSR+ and into
Business as Usual.

4. Status

The OLA does not supersede or override any existing Service Level Agreement and is regarded
as a non-contractual working document. As such, it is without prejudice to both ICL Pathway
and PON, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed as affecting, existing
contractual obligation or creating new contractual obligation between the two parties.

5. Contractual Obligations

Schedule G10 of the PON Agreement specifies the Service Level Agreements relating to
reference data. Schedule G10 sets deadlines for PON delivering reference data to ICL Pathway.
It also sets targets for ICL Pathway delivering reference data to Post Office outlets.

The TPS Contingency Plan [Reference 7] identifies risks and triggers, defining, actions required
to maintain service after failures at any level and identifies contingency actions for Major
Business Continuity Incidents.

6. Objectives of this OLA
The objectives of the OLA are:

+ To provide a consolidated summary of all the day to day operational and support
arrangements for the verification and authorisation of reference data changes across the
PON/ICL Pathway boundary

* Toclarify the respective roles and responsibilities of all relevant groups involved in the
verification and authorisation of reference data changes across the PON/ICL Pathway
boundary

* To facilitate the development of comprehensive and consistent working level procedures for

the verification and authorisation of reference data changes across the PON/ICL Pathway
boundary

* To define procedures for the regular review and evaluation of operational performance

7. Normal Data Processing Arrangements

7.1 OBC Product Verification Process Description

7.1.1 Business Service Management Outlet Systems Group (BSM/OSG) provide product
information to ICL Pathway and the Reference Data Operational Team (RDOT) as part of the
Operational Business Change (OBC) process. This is done by way of completing the relevant
OBC forms, which are then sent via e-mail. All OBC forms sent by BSM/OSG via e-mail will
contain a Return Receipt.

7.1.2 Requests for an Operational Business Change may be raised by the Internal Account
Management Team (IAMT), by Transaction Processing, or, occasionally, by BBM/OSG. An
OBC10 form is used for this process.

7.1.3 BSM/OSG will attempt to resolve any queries from the RDOT and Pathway relating to
the forms.

7.1.4 — BSM/OSG will allocate a unique OBC Number to each change by BSM/OSG. A prefix
will be used to identify the type of change, The prefixes are based on agreed convention.

7.1.5 BSM/OSG will validate the accuracy of the data input to RDS (within current RDS
procedural and system limits) and notify any errors to Pathway or the RDOT.

7.1.6 For an Advanced change, an OBC2 form is sent to ICL Pathway containing sufficient
information for ICL Pathway to begin impacting the change, and for certain preparatory work
to commence. For example, menu hierarchy requirements, accounting node details,
approximate number of outlets.

7.1.7 For the majority of change types, an OBC4 form is completed which is the reference
data details of the change. This is sent to the RDOT in Chesterfield, who will key the data
against the unique CCN. BSM/OSG will include the date by which RDOT need to transfer the
data to ICL Pathway. RDOT will send a “Confirmation Document” to BBM/OSG when the
data has been input into the RDS and sent to ICL Pathway.

7.1.8 Once the OBC4 is completed a hard copy is produced. If it is deemed necessary a
double check will be made by someone other than the person who has completed the OBC4
form.

7.1.9 The electronic copy of the OBC4 is forwarded to the Reference Data Team in cases of
Reference Data only changes and to the Reference Data Team and Pathway in the case of
Advanced changes which also require reference data changes. The subject box will be
annotated with the Change Control Number. Relevant files will be attached to the e-mail, and
the Return receipt option selected.

7.1.10 When the OBC4 is sent, the details are entered on the OSG Change Control Number
database.

7.1.11 The OSG OBC e-mail box is monitored to ensure that a receipt has been received for
items sent within the agreed timescales. Additionally, the OSG OBC e-mail box is monitored to
ensure that a response file has been received from the RDOT within the agreed timescales. The
Transfer File Number from the response file is recorded on the BSM/OSG Change Control
database.

Report to BSM/OSG and delivers the actual Reference Data change to the BBM/OSG.
verification counters, as appropriate. The reports are provided in an Excel workbook, with a
number of worksheets in each book. The number of worksheets and the amount of information
contained in each, are dependent on the amount and nature of the changes which have been
sent to the counter.

7.1.13 Once Verification is complete an assessment is made by BSM/OSG as to whether the
changes can be released to the live estate. Once the decision is made to release, BSM/OSG give
authority to ICL Pathway (via e-mail) to release the changes to the live estate.

7.2 Non-Receipt of Notified Data

BSM/OSG will contact ICL Pathway RDT via a telephone call and an e-mail to the OBC
mailbox.

7.3 Error Management

Errors identified by ICL Pathway and/or PON during Reference Data validation, are classified
as pre-live incidents and are handled separately from those which occur after the data has been
authorised.

Where such an error is detected by ICL Pathway, RDT will raise a pre-live incident and record
it on the internal ICL Pathway database known as PinICL. The incident will be initially
allocated to RDT who will then allocate it to the appropriate PON unit (in general, RDOT for
system or keying errors and BSM/OSG for others). Errors detected by BBM/OSG which
impact ICL Pathway will be reported to RDT for recording as PinICLs.

As PON do not have visibility of the PinICL system, RDT will send a copy of the PinICL to the
relevant part of PON for action. PON will respond to the PinICL within a timescale which is
consistent with the priority of the incident, and provide any data necessary to correct the
incident. Where BSM/OSG provide data in response to a PinICL, BSM/OSG will also send
RDT a supporting e-mail confirming data has been sent.

When the response to the PinICL is received RDT will update the PinICL details with the
response from PON and re-allocate the PinICL back to RDT. RDT will then monitor
subsequent data (if appropriate) to ensure that the error identified is satisfactorily resolved.

On a periodic basis RDT will supply PON with a statement of outstanding PinICLs.

74 Verification Terminals Hardware Incidents

Refer to PON Verification of Reference Data Changes - ref. CS/PRD/033.

7.5 Late Implementation

Alll instances emanating from ICL Pathway will be reported by ICL Pathway RDT to BSM/OSG
via a telephone call and confirmed via e-mail.

All instances emanating from BSM/OSG will be reported by BSM/OSG to ICL Pathway RDT
via a telephone call and confirmed via e-mail.

BSM/OSG (after consulting other BSM teams and/or ICL Pathway RDT) will be responsible
for deciding what action is to be taken in the event of potential, or actual late, deliveries of
Reference Data

Pathway RDT by post to overcome any lack of clarity difficulties.

If the fax service becomes unavailable and/or unsuitable, data can be copied onto floppy
disk(s) for transfer between ICL Pathway RDT and BSM/OSG. The disk(s) will be physically
transported by ICL Pathway RDT and/or BSM/OSG staff or via an independent courier.

8.2 Disaster Recovery

In the event of a disaster being declared by the Post Office at Concept 2000, Farnborough where
BSM/OSG are unable to access their Horizon counters for verification, ICL Pathway will use all
reasonable endeavours to provide BSM/OSG with the use of Horizon counters at their sites at
Feltham or Bracknell within 48 hours.
