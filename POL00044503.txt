IN THE NORWICH CROWN COURT

REGINA
-V-

ALLISON HENDERSON

DEFENCE STATEMENT

1.) The defendant is not disputing that £11,957-78 appears to be missing
from the Worstead sub Post-Office, where she was the sub-Postmistress.

2.) The defendant offers no particular explanation and does not understand
why there is a discrepancy, however does believe that any
discrepancy(s) are the result of a malfunction of the Horizon
computerised accounting system. The defendant also believes that any
discrepancy could have been discovered by the Post Office auditor,
particularly as he initially alleged £18,000 was missing, this was reduced
to the alleged sum in a matter of minutes. Further investigation by the
auditor would have discovered the whereabouts of the alleged missing
sum.

3.) She categorically denies appropriating and money from Post Office Ltd.

4.) The defendant is not in any financial difficulty, is of previous good
character and has not moved any monies or made any significant
purchases during the period in question.

5.) The defendant accepts that she is contractually obliged to pay the
amount of £11,957.78 to Post Office Ltd, and has instructed her
solicitors to approach prosecution as to how best this can be arranged.

Signed,
