OFF-SEN: POL update for Perm Sec.
Dear Colleague Post Office Kelly Tolhurst MP 22 May 2019.pdf

CLASSIFICATION: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: COMMERCIAL

weekend to get him back up to speed on POL. I suggested that you sight him on (1) the Mail campaign

and (2) Kelly’s letter to POL on the litigation and Board. As discussed, the latter requires quite
sensitive handling.

1. The Mail have been running a “Save Our Local Post Offices” campaign for nearly two weeks
now. I attach their list of demands, mapped against our policies. SpAds are increasingly keen to
draw this to a close and willing to frame a Government response as a concession to their
demands. Jacob is meeting the Mail on Monday and we'll then agree next steps, including
publishing a possible op-ed from Kelly to address the Mail’s demands. Kelly also sent a ‘Dear
Colleagues’ letter on this last week (also attached);

2. Kelly remains concerned about POL’s Board and Governance and, in particular, their
handling of the litigation. On 29 May, Kelly wrote to Tim Parker, Chair of the POL Board (you
should have this) to ask for further information on POL’s legal strategy and risk assessment in
relation to the litigation. Alex should be aware (in confidence, as UKGI are not aware and her
office have only discussed with the policy team) that Kelly has been thinking about what further
action Government could take to challenge the POL Board. For now she is content that his
letter is an appropriate first step, but she is likely to raise this with Alex on the 11°.

also mentioned that you should be receiving a Quarterly Update for the Perm Sec on POL next week
(the last one was 4 March), which covers the full range of live issues. Please do also commission us for
some briefing in advance of Kelly and Alex's meeting on the 11".

Let me know if any questions.

Best,
Eleanor
