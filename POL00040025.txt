Andy,

Please find attached the “Horizon Risks” document, which I have amended following input from Cartwright King on the
criminal law risks. Can you please check that it will still serve the purpose of notifying insurers of the grounds for
potential claims?

Once you are happy it does, I intend sending it to our broker under cover of the following email:

“Mark, Richard,

Please find attached a note from our solicitors outlining the risks presented by the recent investigation into the
“Horizon” IT system used in Post Office branches. Can you please share this with our insurers so that they are aware of
the circumstances which could potentially give rise to claims against the policies we have with them, preserving so far as

possible the legal privilege attaching to the note.

“I note that you are not our brokers for our D&O insurance. Can you please let us know how we should provide this
information to that broker if you are not able to do it for us.

“Thank you for your assistance, Rodric”
Please let me know if you have any comments on the proposed email or approach generally.
Thanks, Rodric

Rodric Williams I Litigation Lawyer
