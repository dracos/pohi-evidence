Thanks for the update Lin
Can I ask you to continue to own this issue until resolved for this specific issue.

It looks like there may be a bigger issue in that we don’t have a single content owner for Horizon help desk material -{
would have expected it to be owned by someone in Network although the content itself may originate
elsewhere. Angela — do you think I need to pick that up with someone?

Hi Simon

Further to our earlier conversation, I have struggled to identify an overall owner for Horizon on-line help. I've spoken to
Sandra McBride, Network Support Change Advisor and she advises that when training identifies the need to change any
documentation she approaches the specific Product Manager. I have also spoken to Julia Marwood and she has.
confirmed that each Product Manager is responsible for the content of their respective pages within the help menu but

that it is less black and white when it involves issues around general accounting. Within her Network team she has
managers that face up to the different product areas and Stefanie Rush is responsible for engagement with the Banking
Team which is where this particular query lies.

As to an overall owner I will keep making enquiries.

Regards

Lin

Craig, Angela

I think Lin might be out. Who owns the help content for the Horizon system?
The investigation has found some errors that I would like to get fixed.
Thanks, Simon

Andy,

V’'ve just had a play on our test system and it looks like the documentation is wrong.

What surprised me particularly was the fact that the Office copy is actually printed out before the Giro slips.

Simon: is it worth getting James to put together a story board for this as he did for Recovery. Also who in POL should be
updating the User Guide? In particular there is no button to just print the Giro Deposits report. It is included in the
Counter daily report group. Is this old Horizon documentation ~ though it does clearly say Horizon Online (I did think
that the slip was printed before the Office report — but that could be on Horizon rather than Horizon Online)?

Regards

Gareth

Gareth

Attached is the Horizon online help for Giro transactions. You'll see at the top of page called "alcb_09_02a v1.0" that
the SPM is required to "Select to print the office copy” of the Giro daily report. This suggest that the printing of the
branch copy of the daily report is not automatic as previously thought but requires manual input from the SPM.
Would you mind looking into this and confirming the position (for both Giro deposits and Giro withdrawals)?

Kind regards
Andy
