This statement (consisting of one page each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief

Further to my previous statements, I now wish to add the following.

Flexible Planning generates an ideal nightly cash holding based on information from the last
six weeks of business, taking into account the deposits and payments at the branch. In a Post
Office branch similar to South Warnborough, a reasonable expected maximum holding would
be in the region of the sum of weekly payments, plus around £1,740 for coin. This figure
represents a bag of each coin denomination. i.e.

£2 coins - £500

£1 coins- £500

50 pence’s - £250

20 pence’s - £250

10 pence’s - £100

5 pence’s - £100

2 pence’s - £20

1 pence’s - £20

However, the Flexible Planning system remains the most accurate guide to what the branch

should hold and is the main tool we use in determining the required levels of cash in a branch.
