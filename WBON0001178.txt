Hi Andy

I've read today and other than to say I think it is a very strong piece of work I have no specific comments on
the text. Clearly, as past experience tells us, there is the possibility of both leak and misinterpretation of the
text, wilful or otherwise, but I don't see in here any glaring issues on which I would suggest change.

Have a good weekend
