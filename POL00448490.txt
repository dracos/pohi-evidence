jubject:Re: Nick March Ministerial Meeting

Hi Jamie - thanks for the update I just heard the news on our end as well.

BTW as there was no update for the Fujitsu and Project Boland (on Suspense Accounts) agenda item, I
removed it from our final agenda. So we could probably skip the update on this.

Our current agenda is as follows:

1. Post Office Ltd's Central Costs
2. Compensation Progress (incl. Update on the recent Bill)
3. Post Office Ltd’s Approach to addressing Shortfalls
4, AOB
Many thanks,
Enifome

Hi Enifome,
Apologies for another email! Nick’s EA has confirmed the meeting has gone in for 11-11.30 on Thursday on teams

One small note on the agenda if I may, Tim McInnes who’s leading on Boland is away next week so Kathryn will provide
only a brief update on this on Tim’s behalf

Many thanks,
Jamie

Thanks Enifome do give me an update on the date when you have one

Yes should think that’s fine for Kathryn to regularly attend — I believe she does already and with the first ‘standing iter’
being cost that makes sense

Many thanks,
Jamie

Hi Jamie - No updates I'm afraid. The provisional date of 25" March is still in the diaries.

By the way, I’ve been asked by Lorna Gratton and James Coppin from UKGI to see if we could invite
Kathryn Sherratt from POL team to these meetings going forward?

Many thanks,
Enifome

Hi Enifome,
As you suggest I understand the date is not yet firmed up but happy to work on the agenda in the meantime

I’m happy with the below but perhaps we could add an item on Compensation to capture updates on the Bill
going through the House and the compensation schemes

Many thanks,
Jamie

« POL’s approach to addressing shortfalls

Many thanks,
Enifome

Hi Jamie - thanks for your email.

Minister Hollinrake's Private Office has just confirmed that the meeting will be shifted by a week or so.
I've no yet gotten a steer regarding agenda items but I will begin prepping for this by early next week
so should get back to you then.

Many thanks,

Morning Enifome,

Hope you’re keeping well

I understand the next monthly ministerial meeting for Nick will be on 19"* March which seems quite soon but
understand this may be because of recess at the end of the month?

In any case can I ask if (i) it’s still going ahead and (ii) if you’ve got an early indication of what you’d like to
have on the agenda?

Many thanks,
