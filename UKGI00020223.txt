Spotted it on Twitter. Just tried to call, can you call back when you get a mo? Pre BNR.

Patrick, Mark

The JFSA website has been updated to state that “High Court proceedings have been issued against POL”, although the

wording on the page is quite vague.

Have POL received any notice of this from JFSA or their legal firm? Perhaps we could have a quick chat — if one of you is
able to give me a call asap that would be great. We are seeing BNR at 10.30 and I will probably need to mention it then.

Thanks
Laura
