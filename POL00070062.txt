To: ‘Richard Morgan’

Ce: Tom Beezer

Subject: P.O -v- Castleton - hearing on 11 January 2007

Attachments: LETTER_1252170.DOC

Dear Richard,
I hope you had a great new year and have recovered from jet lag.

I called Mr Castleton yesterday and wrote to him again today to ask him to clarify what exactly
it is he is seeking and whether he intends to proceed (copy letter attached). My impression is
that he doesn't really know himself, but that however irrelevant the document is, he will try and
make as much as possible out of it and that we will therefore end up in Court a week on
Thursday.

I'm not minded myself to suggest to Mr Castleton that he recalls Anne Chambers to cross
examine her about the Tivoli Events log, but if he suggests it then I don't have any strong
objections. If he asks to do this, do you think we should just agree, subject to

(a) anything the Court may say; and

(b) making the point that Anne has already said this is irrelevant and that he is therefore
wasting time and costs

and ask Anne if she can attend a week on Thursday so that we can get it done and dusted
without the need for a hearing other than the one on the 11th?

Iam going to call Mr Castleton again tomorrow to see if he has any clearer idea of what it is he
wants and then I'll revert to you,

Kind regards.
