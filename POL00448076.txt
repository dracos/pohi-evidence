1. Scoring Table

Below table sets out the Residual Risk Score and Rating that will apply upon review of the
Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy, to determine how effective the policy is, any
control weaknesses or gaps and whether the policy needs enhancements/improvements.

Rating Description

The framework of governance, risk management and control is adequate and effective.

Some improvements are required to enhance the adequacy and effectiveness of the
framework of governance, risk management and control.

There are significant weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management and
control such that it could be or could become inadequate and ineffective.

There are fundamental weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management
and control such that it is inadequate and ineffective or is likely to fail.

2. Overall Rating / Residual Risk Score of The Review

The overall rating and residual risk score applied to this review is:

There are significant weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management and
control such that it could be or could become inadequate and ineffective.

This is predominantly driven by:
@ The need to articulate additional key risks
* The need to revise the minimum control standards
The need to add clear KPIs in order to assess the effectiveness and monitoring of the policy
@ The need to improve the capturing, analysis and then decision making based on root cause
analysis.

What works well:
¢ Overall trend is improving in the numbers of aged open items.
© The process has been captured well.
© — Staff are aware of their duties and have clear roles.

The minimum control standards are all being met, but there are significant flaws in the risks and

control standards themselves. These need to be addressed in order to make the policy more
effective.

3. Objective of the review

To assess the validity of the policy within the universe of risk framework. To review the lead
and lag indicators of the policy and to sample check some of the key minimum control
standards in the Network Transaction Corrections Policy. Finally, to assess whether the
effectiveness of the policy is being implemented across the group.

4. Background

POL00448076

The Retail Engagement Director has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the
management of Transaction Corrections and Transaction Acknowledgements in the
network. The network is an agenda item for the Risk and Compliance Committee and the
Post Office board is updated as required.

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
identification and issuance of Transaction Corrections and Transaction Acknowledgements.
All cash held in branches, that are not self-funded, is owned and funded by Post Office
through the central funding agreement that exists between Post Office and central
government.

This policy details the procedures for issuing Transaction Corrections and Transaction
Acknowledgements to postmasters, which is intended to ensure that any discrepancies
identified between files received from third parties (clients or suppliers), or cash and stock
centres, and the data recorded by the branch in Horizon, are corrected accurately.

5. Methodology

The assurance review will consist of the following:

. Is the policy capturing the correct risks?

. Is the risk appetite correctly identified?

. Are the key personnel correctly identified?

. Are reported minimum controls actually controls?

. What are the key controls?

. Are the KPls adequately identified and measured?

. Is the process/procedure correctly articulated?

. Does the evidence show the policy is working?

. Given the above, can we be sure the policy is fit for purpose?

. Source of Information

The review is based on speaking with various members of the Network Monitoring Team, examining
‘on site’ programmes used by the Teams to support the conformance of this policy, and through
supporting material supplied by Teams both before and after these conversations.

The source of the information came from:
e Network Transaction Corrections Policy
e Head of Network Monitoring and Reconciliation

* Senior Network Monitoring & Reconciliation Operations Manager

Issue Finding
Is the policy The key risks areas for Transaction Corrections have
capturing the been identified. However, there are risks that have

not been captured within this policy.

For example, the key risks are based on an
assumption that the raw data which is used to
determine whether a Transaction Correction is
required, is accurate at the point it is received.
Whilst this may fall outside of the policy, this risk
has not been captured and needs to be addressed in
this policy. Should include a risk which identifies the
dependency on other areas of Post Office, such as
the central finance system, credence, HORIce, and
other programmes. Should also identify who is the
GE owner of this risk.

Also, the evidence provided shows that Transaction
Acknowledgements rely on human intervention to
ensure they are processed correctly. This is not
captured as a risk in the policy.

May also be worth considering how risks are
worded in the Policy, as risks are to both
Postmasters and Post Office.

Example:

“If Transaction Corrections are issued for incorrect
values, there is a risk of inconvenience to the
postmaster.”

This does not take into account the risk of an
incorrect balance to Post Office by issuing the
incorrect Transaction Correction.

Is the risk appetite

There is a risk averse appetite in connection with

correctly dispute resolution. The process identified within the
identified? policy is consistent with this appetite level.

The minimum control standards need to be

better.

This policy also flows into other policies and it is not
obvious whether there is collaborative work
between teams. For example, other policies that
flow into this policy includes Account Support,
Accounting Dispute Resolution and Postmaster
Training. No evidence of close working with other
teams leading on these policies was seen.

This is a very complex area of the business.
Transaction Corrections rely on complex data
assumptions and complicated spreadsheets to
manage the process. Based on the current minimum

« Identify further risks, including the reliance on raw data from other teams/programmes
being accurate.

© Minimum Control Standards should be reworded to ensure they are proper controls.
© Introduce KPIs.

Consider whether other relevant policies should be linked closer, for example (but not
limited to) Postmaster Account Support and Postmaster Account Dispute Resolution.

Check whether new starters are provided training on the policy after joining the team.
