Subject: Submission to Ministers on Post Office Horizon

Andrew cc. Rob, George

Please find attached note that we discussed with the Minister yesterday regarding the Post Office Horizon issue and
potential group civil action against Post Office.

The Minister asked for a sense of timescales. Until a letter of claim is received by Post Office and they are informed of
the details of the claim, it is difficult to judge timescales, but we will provide further updates as and when we receive
any. The solicitors state that the letter of claim will be sent to POL within 14 days.

Rob, George — happy to chat through any additional background if intend to put this to your SpAds/Minister.

Thanks
