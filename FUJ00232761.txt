. Removed references to Simon Wilson as the team work for Steve Evans
. Watermark changed to “POA INTERNAL”
. Consolidated Peak document update list action into Live Defect Section (moved Root Cause

list to this action)

. Improved wording to clarify that a Live Defect is one that is present on the LIVE system and

something likely to need a fix (it can also be present.on a test system but if it is not present
on the live system then it is not a Live Defect)

when cloning an investigation Peak to create a defect Peak

). Clarified technique for Peaks declared as on “monitor”
. Added reference to Release Peaks and Peaks that have been Baselined
. Clarified that only one. HDR-* Cl or Collection should be set and if both could apply then use

HDR-Fin

. Clarified that when Release Management set the Planned Out Live date they use the date

the first time the fix was deployed to the live environment (irrespective of rollout schedules
that may decide on the rollout to the whole live environment)

Added.recommendation that Peaks that are resolved but not ready to be closed as the
resolution actionsis to be ‘monitored’ can remain in a non-closed state but must have a
Forecast Date added to the Response so that this warns the support specialist and team
leader that the review date has arrived and the Peak should be reviewed for closure
Added statement that Release Management processes will apply to 3° party deployments

Introduction

This document describes a number of improvements to the Post Office Account ways of working to
enhance the end-to-end process of Live Defect Management. It describes how the systems should be
used and how various teams will need to interact to ensure an effective end-to-end process is
followed and can be tracked and reported on.

A PPT has been created for a quick overview.

Our interactions need to be system and process driven, not people and experience — and that will
create a clear audit trail too.

We need to limit the dependency on meeting-specific reports or embedded tables in minutes)to show
progress on important matters.

Transparency is key — to the fullest sensible extent, POL need to see everything= and they need to
be able to see it in their systems or from consistent reports from our.systems, That way, POL are
informed and able to make decisions for us or with us.

Terms and Terminology

New terms

Throughout this document, there are new terms and phrases that will need to be understood so we
increasingly use a common language. A diagram is provided below this list. The main ones are:

e Live Defect — is a logged Incident that is present on the Live system that is within Fujitsu’s
scope of obligations and is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service
specification. It is, therefore, a fault thatis likely to need fixing

e HDR Defect - Live Defects that affect, or have the potential to affect, branch operations
(financial, experience, or end customer)

¢ Horizon Defect Review (HDR) - aweekly meeting with POL to review HDR Defects. POL
need to know the HDR Defects and their status. They share this with postmasters. This is a
very important meeting that Sees Fujitsu and POL aligned on the HDR Defects

¢ Investigation Peak — is an Incident that is being investigated where the cause and required
action are not yet confirmed. A linked TfSNow Incident may well exist - and MUST exist if
POL need to be aware. The Peak Call Type should be “L’ if this is a Live Defect

e Defect Peak =is.a Peak that is not linked to a TfSNow Incident and that describes the
confirmed Live Defect that will be progressed through the SDLC (BIF, PTF, Dev, Test,
Release) to live deployment

¢ Investigation Incident (TfSNow) — is an Incident that is being investigated where the cause
and required action are not yet confirmed. The Incident MUST be bonded if POL need to be
aware

e Defect Incident (TfSNow) - is a TfSNow Incident that describes the confirmed Live Defect
that will be progressed by a Resolver Group that does not use Peak (e.g. Networks, Security,
Unix)

e Potential Live Defect (Peak) — is a Live Defect that we are still looking into. There will likely
be an investigation Peak open and probably a TfSNow Investigation Incident too. The Peak
Call Type should be “L”

e Confirmed Live Defect (Peak) — is a Live Defect where the cause and required action to fix
are known. The investigation has concluded. A defect Peak will exist with Call Type “#”

e Potential Live Defect (TfSNow) — is a Live Defect that we are still looking into that is logged
as a TfSNow Investigation Incident. The State will be “Acknowledged, Work in Progress, or
Researching”

e Confirmed Live Defect (TfSNow) — is a Live Defect where the cause and required action to
fix are known. The investigation has concluded. A TfSNow Defect Incident will exist with the
State field set to “Fix in Progress”

e KBA- Knowledge Base Article. The term KEL is no longer to be used

Terminology — Overview

We need to be clearer and consistent about what we mean by, and how we use, various tools and
processes within POA. The following entries are intended as an initial simple summary. They will be
expanded on as the workstreams progress and sub elements will also be reviewed too, They cover
Incidents, Problems, Peak, Release, Live Defects, Live Defect Management, BIF, CBIF, HDR and
the KB.

Incidents
o All Incidents which POL should be aware of must be created andmanaged in TfSNow and be
bonded so that they replicate to POL ServiceNow. Although actions and progress may
happen in other tools, systems and processes, the primary sourceoof all relevant content
MUST be TfSNow.

Problems
o All Problems must be raised in TfSNow and be reviewed on an agreed schedule with POL.

As Problems cannot be bonded, additional work will be needed to manually share updates
and hold mutual reference numbers:

Peaks

o Peaks can be used for many,purposes. Where Peaks relate to Incidents initiated from
TfSNow, the relevant Investigation Peak updates MUST be synchronised with TfSNow.
Peaks raised outside of an Incident MUST also be raised as TfSNow Incidents if they require
the awareness or involvement of POL.

o Peak is the only system used.to record and manage Live Defects.

o Peaks do notyneed to be shared with POL. If the awareness or involvement of POL is
applicable then there will be a TfSNow bonded Incident and this will contain all relevant parts
of any Peak so that the Incident that POL see is a suitable complete reference. Progress
updates for POL on HDR Defects will take latest extracts from the Peak system and provide
the update in a report.

Release
o Release Notes must state all Peaks that are being closed when the Release goes live. This
must be included in the related Change ticket
o There must be a report showing the Peaks and any associated POL HDR Defect references
so that POL are able to keep their tracking in sync
o Release dates must be held in Peak so that Peaks can be tracked to deployment

Live Defects
o ALive Defect is defined as an issue that:
e Is present on a LIVE system
e Is within Fujitsu's scope of obligations
«Is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service specification
e Is, therefore, a fault that is likely to need fixing

e The Horizon Defects Review (HDR) scope will be those Live Defects that also have
at least 1 of the following attributes (HDR Defects):

= Affects, or has the potential to affect, branch financial outcomes (add the
“HDR-Fin” Collection)

= Affects, or has the potential to affect, the way a postmaster is required to use
the system (User Interface, Report, Function) (add the “HDR-Exp”
Collection)

= Affects, or has the potential to affect, the experience of a Post Office
customer or client (add the “HDR-Exp” Collection)

Note: Only one HDR-* Collection needs to be set and if both could apply then HDR-Fin should
be chosen

IAdd Incident to Collection

HDR-Exp —- Horizon Defect Review - SPM Experience [Public] ¥][ Add to Collection

HDR-Exp ~- Horizon Defect Review - SPM Experience [Public]
jorizon Defect Review - Financial Impact [Public]

e There may be a workaround, but the underlyingiissue still meets the criteria above

e The HDR Defect may be under investigation and is not confirmed to meet the criteria
above but has attributes that meet the criteria above (aypotential HDR Defect)

o When the HDR Defect is being investigated there will be a TfSNow Incident open and
bonded. POL may track status using their ServiceNow Incident reference or may create a
ServiceNow Problem record and manage it with that reference. All progress during
investigation is to be added to the TfSNow Incident so that it is visible to POL in their
corresponding Incident. It is POL’s responsibility. to keep their Problem record up to date if
they have opened one.

e Note: If the Incident has been escalated to a Problem in TfSNow then updates on the
investigation work willbe provided within the weekly status update report which
shows confirmed Live Defect

o When a HDR Defect.is confirmed then a specific defect Peak reference will be added to the
closing comments in the'TfSNow Incident. Fujitsu will then manage the HDR Defect in Peak
and will provide status update reports — from Peak — to POL at their weekly HDR Forum.

o Non-HDR Defects)will be managed internally by Fujitsu using Peak. Reports will be available
for POL to show overall progress but it is not intended that every non-HDR Defect will be
discussed.

Live DefechManagement

o All Live Defects must be rigorously managed until resolved.

o The status of all Live Defects must be known at all times and they must be shared with POL:
the more branch impacting ones at POL’s Horizon Defects Review Forum; and the rest by a
separate report. Fujitsu must assure POL that Live Defects are well managed and must keep
POL aware of progress.

BIF
o All confirmed Live Defects must go through the Business Impact Forum (BIF) and must have
all the required meta data and tags added/checked.
co The dates of BIF meetings, the outcome, and the reasons for CBIF submission must be
recorded in the Peak.

CBIF
o CBIF submissions will be based on criteria held in Peak.

co The criteria are shown later in this document and that criteria will be agreed with POL.
o CBIF will become part of the POL HDR weekly meeting.

co The Horizon Defects Review (HDR) Forum is the new name for what was the Known Error
Review Forum (KERF).

o This is a critical meeting which sees POL and Fujitsu having mutual awareness of the main
Live Defects and the progress being made on them.
It is a joint weekly forum to manage HDR Defects that meet the stated definition.
POL will maintain a list of all HDR Defects and their progress. Fujitsu will provide updates to
the HDR Defects being tracked.

o There must be a POL Problem reference and a corresponding Fujitsu Incident, Peak.or
Problem reference.

o The updates to the Fujitsu tracked Incidents, Peaks and Problems will be shared at the HDR
Forum.

KB

The Fujitsu KB is an information repository used for support purposes.
Any observed defects will be recorded as a Knowledge Base Article (KBA) but the progress
to investigate and address them will be done via Peak(s) and/or Incident(s).

o KBAs do not need to be shared with POL as the tracking needs to be on the Peak and/or
Incident.

o If the awareness or involvement of POL’ is,applicable then there will be a TfSNow bonded
Incident and this will contain all relevant parts.of any KBA so that the Incident that POL see
is a suitable complete reference.

Systems and Teams

Managing Incidents

o An Incident is defined in the HNG-X contract as “any perceived abnormal or undesirable
occurrence relating to the Services”

o Incidents for the Live environment that POL need to be notified of and be aware of must be
logged in the Fujitsu service management toolsets, TfSNow, and bonded so it is visible in the
POL service management toolset, ServiceNow

o Fujitsu must ensure TfSNow Incidents are raised and bonded where POL notification is
required (e.g. when relevant KBAs are created, or faults are identified whilstdoing other work
such as testing or problem determination)

o Service Operations should only use TfSNow for communicating Incidents,between Fujitsu
and POL

o Incidents cannot be raised by email by POL or Fujitsu. Incidents must be raised in TfSNow
by Fujitsu or in ServiceNow by POL

o The Summary field should be understandable by most readers as this feeds Peak and also
shows on reports

e Forsystem monitoring this is set by SMC, bonded incidents it comes from POL,
otherwise it's Fujitsu staff (MAC & Security) that choose its content

co The Incident should be a complete and comprehensive self-contained reference to the status
of an Incident

o Incident progress MUST be shown on.the Incident im TfSNow and cannot be managed via
separate emails. Emails must be added to the,Incident in TfSNow if relevant to
demonstrating progress or status

o The Incident should appear to be integral = the fact that 3 and 4" line use a different toolset
should not be apparent

co There should be no references visibleto POL (going forward) to toolsets used by Fujitsu that
are not accessible to POL such as)Peak or KBA for status information (as these are Fujitsu
internal) — a Peak reference is acceptable for a reference to a defect Peak that is being
progressed. References for Fujitsu use only must be maintained

o Incidents mustibe updated to contain relevant updates from systems such as Peak (but not
private updates) and relevant parts of KBAs (not the internal instructions)

o Incidents raised as Fujitsu internal that do not need to be notified to POL may contain
internal system references
Incident updates should contain meaningful and appropriately detailed technical content
Incident updates, and in particular updates summarising the current status, should be written
in plain English to be understandable to most readers

o Aclear statement of the latest status and the next action should be obvious within the
Incident. This needs to be the last, or very recent, update

e The “Additional comments (Customer visible)” field must provide a latest status view
— at least periodically and for POL bonded Incidents mainly — so it can be easily
understood by any reader. Peak uses a dedicated field for this and uses the following
format:

= Business impact: [description of the business impact, succinct]
= Status update: [description of current status — succinct]
= Next action: [next action to be taken and expected date for next update]

o For bonded Incidents we need to use the agreed set of categories, sub-categories and Cls so

that the replication interface retains the settings. The original setting will stand throughout the

life of the Incident. You cannot change the Category/Sub-Category or it breaks the replication
link. You can change the Cl but it will be retained Fujitsu side but will not replicate
o We need to use the designated open and close categories to better monitor Incident
categories
e Open category — TfSNow has Configuration Items that should be used
e Closure code — TfSNow has these and they should be used
co The Peak closure codes must map to TfSNow Incident closure codes. As at the date of this
document the mappings are as follows:

Peak Closure Code Fujitsu

‘Advice after Investigation POA-Advice & Guidance
‘Avoidance Action Supplied POA-Fujitsu Operational
‘Administrative Response POA-Administration
‘Advice and guidance given POA-Advice & Guidance

No fault in product POA-No Fault Found/No Action

Duplicate Call Cancelled
Solicited Known Error POA-Advice’& Guidance

User error POA-User Error

Unspecified Insufficientevidence Unidentified Root Cause

Call withdrawn by user Cancelled
Fixed at Future'Release POA-Peak Fault Found
Enhancement Request POA-POL domain
Suspected hardware fault Unidentified Root Cause

o Incidents outside of the Fujitsu domain that are identified by Fujitsu are passed to POL
ITDSD. If there are no consequential implications for Fujitsu then the TfSNow Incident will be
set to Suspended to await feedback to help us advance our KB (perhaps for the agreed
Suspend period and then we close). If there are implications then we leave the Incident open
as we need to know the outcome

o Only the originating organisation can close an Incident

e Incidents we have marked as requiring a fix should be closed in TfSNow with the
defect Peak reference added as that is what will be tracked and managed to
conclusion

e For Incidents closed that relate to process or user issues then we should propose
system improvements — and this should be done in conjunction with an equivalent
process for Peaks closed with the same reasons

o Fujitsu will set an Incident to Suspended in TfSNow until POL close their original Incident

* Note: Resolved in TfSNow only means that the last assigned Resolver Group has completed
their action — but it may require other actions by other Resolver Groups. Therefore, Resolved is

not replicated to ServiceNow or POL will wrongly assume it is Resolved and will likely close their
Incident. When all possible actions are complete and MAC believe it is truly Resolved then they
will request POL to close it.
« When POL close an Incident it notifies MAC and MAC can then close the TfSNow
Incident
e Incidents in a Suspended state are reviewed weekly between the MAC and POL
teams and it is included in the monthly SMR pack
= Where the Incident is Suspended as no further action by Fujitsu is possible
then after 10 days the Incident will be closed. When the Incident is set to
Suspended the following text will be added as the final update “Please be
aware that the incident will automatically be closed after 10 days if no
response is received from you.”

o Fujitsu must tag Incidents that POL are tracking (mostly for HDR) so,it.is awareof Incidents
where POL have an interest so that it can review content and status frequently. Adding any
relevant POL references, such as the POL Problem reference, should be considered

o ALive Defect is defined as an issue that:

e Is present on a LIVE system

e Is within Fujitsu's scope of obligations

« Is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service specification

e Is, therefore, a fault that is likely to needsfixing

¢ Incidents that meet the definition of a/Live Defectymust have the
“LiveAffectingDefect” Cl added in TfSNow

e The State field values must be used

State Work in Progress v

= Acknowledged = Fujitsu is aware of the Incident but is not yet working on it
= Work In Progress/Researching — Fujitsu is investigating the issue described
in theincident
= Fix In Progress — Fujitsu has confirmed that the Incident requires an action to
fix it — most likely linked to a Change ticket
= — Suspend — action is complete by Fujitsu or is required from another entity
e AnIncident that has the LiveAffectingDefect Cl and State of Acknowledged/Work In
Progress/Researching is a potential Live Defect. Suspend will also be classed as a
potential Live Defect too for simplicity
« » An Incident that has the LiveAffectingDefect Cl and State of Fix In Progress is a
Confirmed Live Defect
o The POL Horizon Defects Review scope will be those Live Defects that also have at least 1
of the following attributes (HDR Defects):

updates. For Peaks cloned for, GDC for GDPR obfuscation reasons this will only apply up to
April 2020 as'from that date the original Peak was obfuscated and a clone was not created

o Peaks that are closed that have a ServiceNow reference with the reason being that a cloned
Peak is now to be tracked will be sent back to Peak by MAC to reopen the Peak as this must
be maintained,to ensure the continued automatic flow of updates to the originator

separate emails or meeting comments

o Weneed management reports for Incidents to see trends. This needs to be part of the

= Branch Code - an Incident may relate to one FAD (Branch Code will be set to
the nnnnnn FAD by either Fujitsu or POL) but it may relate to many FADs
(Branch Code set to POA SMC by Fujitsu or MAC by POL)
Service requests should not be accepted as Incidents, but whilst they are very few (those that
relate to investigations are now re-directed through other channels) this will be accepted and
reviewed periodically

Managing Problems

°
°

°
°

Problems must be logged in the Fujitsu service management toolset, TfSNow

Problems cannot be bonded, like Incidents, to cause mutual replication between the Fujitsu
and POL service management toolsets so each organisation needs to maintain its own
records independently

POL need to provide their Problem reference for Fujitsu to record and link to its own Problem
& POL also may need to provide status updates back to Fujitsu —- we need to escalate POL
inefficiencies at SMR as well as at the inter-company Problem Review Meeting

Fujitsu internal Problems are managed entirely in TfSNow.

If a Problem is tracking a Live Defect then the Problem needs to hold the Peak reference as
that is where progress will be actively updated and reported

Peaks related to Fujitsu Problems will need to have the Fujitsu Problem reference added so
the association is clear when checked from either system

Note: Fujitsu use Problem tasks and manage the updates to those

Major Incidents will lead to Problems being raised to close out on all findings

Fujitsu MAC will notify Problem of underlying issuesidentified from Incidents -these tend to
relate to Unix, NT etc (TfSNow Resolver Groups) and no Peaks (Peak has its own processes)
Problems also use the State field - Acknowledged, Work In Progress, Researching, Fix In
Progress, Suspend — to record and'track status

The Problem should have the applicable Configuration Item assigned (HDR Defects):

e Affects, or has the potential to affect, the experience of a Post Office customer or

Note: Only one HDR-* Cl needs to be set and if both could apply then HDR-Fin should be chosen

Problem reporting should have HDR tagged Problems
Incidents where the resolution is a fix to address a Live Defect may be both a Peak and a
Problem (the former for management, the latter for joint process validation)

FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY (POA ONLY)

System Changes
e Added Cls for HDR-Exp, HDR-Fin, LiveAffectingDefect

New Ways of Working
1. Sandie - We need to regularly check

that any Incident that POL need to be notified of or be aware of has been logged in
TfSNow and bonded

that we do not reference KBAs, Peaks or include internal content in TfSNow bonded
Incidents and that the TfSNow Incident contain all relevant contentand be a
comprehensive self-contained reference to the status of an Incident. The only Peak
reference that should be added is for defect Peaks (if applicable)

Incidents are being updated and that we are not using separate emails to share
progress that is not embedded into the Incident updates

Incident updates are well worded and use language. that is understandable to most
readers — challenging and coaching where needed

the current status and the next action on an Incident is clearly stated so any reader is
in no doubt that the Incident is under full control - challenging and coaching where
needed

the Summary field is well worded and understandable by most readers

the relevant open and close categories are being used when handling Incidents —
applying additional caution withybonded Incidents to use the mutually agreed settings
the LiveAffectingDefect Cl is being set for Live Defects

the HDR* Cls are being set by,Fujitsu management where applicable (and that the
POL Problem Referenceiis.also added to the Incident)

when an Incident is,placed into Suspend as no further Fujitsu action is applicable
then the text of “Please be aware that the incident will automatically be closed after
10 days if no response isyreceived from you.” has added. After 10 days, these
Incidents should be closed

2. Sandie/Steve Ba — create,a process/report to share Incidents and Peaks closed due to
process or user issues with POL monthly to encourage POL to consider system
enhancements that could avoid the occurrence of the issue

FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY (POA ONLY)

Managing Peaks
co The use of Peak and the updates to Peaks must be consistent and documented. That takes
the onus off the people and it enables anomaly reporting and management oversight
co If the awareness or involvement of POL is applicable then there will be a TfSNow bonded
Incident and this will contain all relevant parts of any Peak so that the Incident that POL see
is a suitable complete reference
co If any 3LS, 4LS or Architect creates a Peak in the course of their normal duties that matches
the definition of Live Defect:
e Is present on a LIVE system
e Is within Fujitsu's scope of obligations
e Is, or appears to be, inconsistent with the agreed design or service specification
e Is, therefore, a fault that is likely to need fixing

...then it must be given the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection and an Incident must be raised
in TfSNow if one is not already open.

I Add to Collection

co Ifa Peak has had the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection added, and it also has at least 1 of
the following attributes (Horizon Defect Review)»

e Affects, or has the potential to affect, branch financial outcomes (add the “HDR-Fin”
Collection)

e Affects, or has the potential tovaffect, the way a postmaster is required to use the
system (User InterfaceyReport, Function) (add the “HDR-Exp” Collection)

e Affects, or has the potential to affect, the experience of a Post Office customer or
client (add the “HDR-Exp” Collection)

Note: Only one HDR-* Collection heeds to be set and if both could apply then HDR-Fin should be
chosen

co If a Peak raised independent of TfSNow is subsequently qualified as being an Incident that
POL should be aware of, then Fujitsu MAC need to be contacted. Fujitsu MAC will create a
new TfSNow Incident which will be bonded and then assigned to 3LS. This will create a new
Peak. The content of the original Peak must be copied to the new Peak so that updates can
automatically flow back to TfSNow. The original Peak should be closed citing that it has been
superseded by a Peak linked to TfSNow
o When the investigation into an issue defined in a Peak originating from TfSNow is concluded,
the ‘investigation’ Peak can be closed
e If the investigation Peak is an existing clone then the Peak can have its Call Type
changed to “#” (for GDC obfuscated Peaks this will apply to any cloned Peaks
created prior to April 2020)
e The investigation Peak has not been cloned then it needs to be cloned to create a
defect Peak (for GDC obfuscated Peaks this will apply to any Peaks obfuscated
since April 2020)

The defect Peak reference should be added to the investigation Peak as part of its
closure activity. The defect Peak reference will then be mentioned in the TfSNow
Incident so that it replicates to POL ServiceNow

co The interface between TfSNow and Peak (OTI) must protect the internal system references
to Peaks or KBAs and updates should appear to all be generated in TfSNow — except for a
reference to a defect Peak that is shared for future tracking purposes

o The Summary field needs to be written so as to be understandable to most readers as it will
be used in internal management and external POL reports

o New fields are being introduced to help Live Defect Management tracking and reporting and
these will need to be completed by various parties as the Peak progresses

See section Live Defect Management — Key Fields in Peak

o Cloning processes and rules need to be applied consistently:

Page I 16

Cloning carries forward all Collections, References and Key Fields and it must show
cloned from and cloned to support chain of events tracking

Cloning should be for specific purposes and the reason will appear as a prompt when
cloning is initiated:

Assignment to GDC (so we can redact/obfuscate)

* Note: Since April 2020 UK Bridge do \not clone Peaks but instead they
obfuscate the original so it can be widely shared and updated whilst
maintaining any links to TfSNow Incidents. Peaks cloned prior to this date
that remain open will have broken the,auto links to any TfSNow Incidents

Splitting into multiple threads linked to a single origin (e.g. Data Centre &
Counter, phased fix — urgent perhaps by script/refdata and follow-on for
code)

Disassociating from the TfSNow incident (e.g. documentation, follow-on to
an initial response to anjincident)

Creating the defect Peak to progress the Live Defect to resolution

Creating Test. Only\Peaks where the test in a particular environment can't
mirror the entirety of the issue described e.g. 3° party connections are not
available. This is tare. Testing is then done on the clone in that environment.
The master defect Peak is still open as it may be used for the full testing in
LST. The Test Only Peak will be closed once testing is completed
successfully

Note: if a Peak has been assigned to a Baseline then cloning should be done
with caution and include consultation with the Baseline owner in advance

When,the [Clone] button is clicked, the following menu is displayed:

o Peaks that are cloned that have a ServiceNow reference cannot be closed by EDSC until the

receive updates. For Peaks,cloned for GDC for GDPR obfuscation reasons this will only
apply up to April 2020 as from)that date the original Peak was obfuscated and a clone was
not created
o Peaks that have been held by EDSC due to having been cloned and having a ServiceNow
reference must be periodically reviewed to ensure updates from the cloned Peak are applied
o Peaks that are closed that have a ServiceNow reference with the reason being that a cloned
Peak is now to be tracked will be sent back to Peak by MAC to reopen the Peak as this must
be maintained to ensure the continued automatic flow of updates to the originator
Rules,on use of Call Type need restating so we ensure greater consistency
All Peaks must be owned by a team whose manager will check that progress is being made
We need regular management quality checks — use of fields, age of Peaks, progress being
made — and this needs to be summarised and reported upwards to ensure executive visibility
and confidence
e The report created by Fujitsu MAC is useful but does not appear to cause action to
be taken
co The origin of a Peak - SPM, POL, SMC, Fujitsu — is identifiable by scraping the Contact

may add KBA into reference text instead of into the References field which limits query-

ability.

o Peaks closures:

o Peaks closed as user/process error should be considered along with TfSNow Incidents closed

Incident related Peaks are closed when the investigation phase has concluded and
no further action is needed, when further info required (as it passes back to TfSNow),
or when the next action needs to be assigned to another TfSNow Resolver Group
(the Peak is no longer needed)

Incident related Peaks are closed when the investigation phase has concluded and
we have a confirmed Live Defect. This would see a cloned Peak raised as Call Type
“#". If the Peak is not linked to a TfSNow Incident bonded to POL then the Peak can
just be reassigned to Call Type “#”

Defect Peaks are closed when the Release they are targeted at is deployed —
ideally by automating the process — this will probably be Peaks at Status “F”

All other Peaks are closed based on team/process specific rules — as per current
processes

for the same reasons to provide a monthly report to POL to recommend enhancements that

could avoid the occurrence of the issue. A likely source of these could be Peaks closed with
the following Root Cause values:

e “39 General — User Knowledge” — caused by lack of knowledge with the user

e “40 General — User” - caused by an action performed by the user which was

outside expected use

e “41 General — in Procedure” — caused by not following defined procedure
Peaks/Incidents closed as “66 — Final - Enhancement Request” should also be reported on
monthly to POL to recommend enhancements are submitted to Fujitsu. KBAs also needs to
be updated to show the outcome was that POL need to raise an enhancement request

o Peaks that are resolved but not ready to be closed as the resolution action is to be
‘monitored’ can remain in a non-closed state but must have a Forecast Date added to the
Response so that this warns the support specialist and team leader that the review date has
arrived and the Peak should be reviewed for closure

o The Peak closure codes must map to TfSNow Incident closure codes. As at the.date of this
document the mappings are as follows:

Peak Closure Code Fujitsu

‘Advice after Investigation POA-Advice & Guidance’

Avoidance Action Supplied POA-Fujitsu Operational

Administrative Response POA-Administration:

‘Advice and guidance given POA-Advice & Guidance

o An Incident may relate to one FAD but it may relate to many FADs -— this is recorded in the
Business Impact text showing the number of branches affected

o To ensure we avoid updates being overtly associated with an individual the updates should
be system driven — not separate emails or meeting comments

o For the occasions where Fujitsu is required to share actual Peaks, it will need to define a
Peak extract process that will brand, classify and version control content. The process must
also redact/obfuscate to remove Pll and remove internal only Progress updates. This extract
process is not under consideration as at the date of this report

Release Management
o Deferred Peaks should be recognisable against the release they were deferred from and the
release to which they are subsequently targeted

o Only Peaks can be deferred — POA Jira’s or other things stored outside of Peak CANNOT be
deferred

o Deferred Peaks (that do not relate to test environment findings) become Live Defects. When

a Peak is deferred, the Fujitsu party obtaining the agreement must ensure:
e the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection is set where applicable

[Add Incident to Collection

e the “Deferral Agreed” Collection set
e The Call Type set to “#” if the Live Defect is confirmed ‘and a fix.can be progressed,
or the Call Type set to “L” if the Live Defect still needs further investigation
e Target Release Type changed to “Proposed for” for subsequent update via BIF/PTF
e If the deferred Peak has at least 1 of the following attributes (Horizon Defect

“HDR-Fin” Collection)
= Affects, or has the potential to affect, the way a postmaster is required to use

o Release Notes must list all Peaks that are fixed and being deployed. The extract/report must
also show the POLPRB- reference for HDR Defects and the Fujitsu Problem references if
they,have been tagged to be tracked by the Problem manager(s). This is achieved by
clicking the button to the right of the listed Peaks in the Release Note which creates an Excel
spreadsheet that can attached to the TfSNow Change ticket (format similar to below):

o The action of deploying the Release should cause the relevant Peaks on the Release Note to
be closed. As a minimum it should ensure all are set to Status “F” and alert the originator that

the fix is deployed and they are asked to close the Peak
° Te ton of ey eRe shouety SSC shat relat KBAS canbe

o “Release Peaks” are administrative reference Peaks for Release Management. They do not
act as master Peaks so the defect Peaks must be kept updated independent of the Release
Peak settings and dates

co Ifa Peak has been assigned to a Baseline then cloning should be done with caution and
include consultation with the Baseline owner in advance

o Release Management processes will apply to 3° party deployments that are within the Fujitsu
scope of responsibilities. For example, Ingenico fixes will be deployed under releases and
Peaks will be Targeted At, Proposed for, and Reported In release numbers identified for
Ingenico fixes — currently 90.xx

o Hotfixes are a mini release and will use the new 3-node release numbering xx.yy.zz where
the primary 2 nodes are the release that they relate to and.the third node is the hotfix
number.

o If arelease has gone Live, then any Peaks which require a hotfix should NOT be Targeted At
the master release, but at a hotfix release. For example:

e PBS - the master releases was 20.94. Any hot fixes have their own release
20.94.01, 20.94.02 ... 20.94.11 and so.on

e 71.10-the master release was 71.10, already released from FJ to CC for packaging.
Any hot fixes for this would be,71.10.01, followed by 71.10.02 and so on

o If a hotfix is needed, Release Management will create the hotfix release in Peak with its own
set of dates, so that it can be properly tracked

o Any peaks that are not urgent, anditherefore not a hotfix, should go to BIF/PTF for release
via the Maintenance Release process

o Release Management will maintain the Target Release date table:

e All past Releases must state the actual release date for deployment (if phased, this
should be the Pilot release date when at least 1 live branch saw new code installed)

e All future Releases must show the latest anticipated release date for deployment —
irrespective of who will be leading the deployment

« The Release date should be the first time that the deployment was made to any live
environment (Model Office or agreed pilot rollout sites). The date will therefore show
ithe first time the fix was deployed to a live counter/branch eventhough a phased
rollout may mean other counters/branches did not receive the fix until a later agreed
date

« ~The Target Release screen should be used to make universal changes to Peaks
when release information changes — especially the Planned Dates for the whole
Release. The dates can be changed and then the “Reset Date” button is used to
apply the new date to all Peaks Targeted At the updated release (see below):

e We all know that the goal is to progress from logging a perceived fault to fixing it
(unless it isn’t really a fault) as quickly as we can. The added objective here is to
ensure POA management and POL management are aware of the packages of work
we have and are fully engaged in determining priorities and dates. The only thing
stopping us making an immediate fix should be a POL supported decision to not take
immediate action. We should never determine what we fix or don’t by ourselves
(unless Fujitsu is the only beneficiary of the fix). So, here are some actions I feel
move us closer to that goal;

System Changes
« Create a button alongside the listed Peaks on the Release Note that gather the content for

New Ways of Working

1. Managers will need to conduct spot checks on Peak data entry quality and encourage new
habits — fields filled in, fields read well, clones created for correct situations - See Appendix
A

2. Adam/Steve Ba/Sandie — Peaks closed as user/process error should be considered along
with TfSNow Incidents closed for the same reasons to send a monthly report to POL to
recommend enhancements that could avoid the occurrence of the issue

3. Adam/Steve Ba/Sandie — Peaks/Incidents closed as “66 — Final - Enhancement Request”
should also be reported on monthly to POL to recommend enhancements are submitted to

efect Management Changes

hhave been some changes to the Defect Management process to enable more accurate reporting. Please consider the following when reviewing a potential defect Peak:

Is this a Live Defect? If so, add the ##LiveA fectingDefect Collection,
Is the Call Type correct? Change to L ~ Live Incident or # ~ Defect Identified as applicable.
Does could this affect branch operations? If so, add either the HDR-Fin (Financial) or HDR-Exp (Experience) Collection.
Is there a Workaround? If so, add the Workaround Reference field and set it to Yes.
Have you added a Impact update? There is a new template to guide adding an impact.
Is the Priority correct? The default priority from TFSNow is often too low
re the Product & Product Group fields correct? Multiple products can be added if required,
is the Status (Response Category) correct? Does it reflect the current activity inthe defect process,
Where possible ensure your progress updates are understandable to non-technical users.

Peak Incident Management System - RMG Account

o Live Defect Management must have a designated owner on POA to manage and evolve the
processes and systems used
o Staff will need training and guidance on how POA wants Live.Defects to be managed and
how the systems need to be kept up to date
o Live Defects must be recorded as Peaks and managed using the Peak system
e Fujitsu may have Problems open for Live Defects but the Problem record needs to
hold the relevant Peak reference as this will be where progress updates will be
derived
o We must know how many Live Defects there are at any,point in time — and importantly, we
must know which ones are part of the HDR\Defect tracking led by POL and we must store the
POL tracking reference on our defect Peak
o We need to be able to differentiate between Live Defects that are still being investigated and
are not confirmed, and Live Defects:that have been confirmed and require action to resolve
o We need to know the statusjof all Live Defects and whether there are any issues needing
attention
o We need to be able to review trends and attributes of Live Defects to identify patterns — for
example, we need new.reports to show trends, volumes, efficient areas, inefficient areas,
process stalled, aging entries, mix by priority, targeted at, time by stage, defects by system
area
Live Defects must be clearly titled so that they can be understood by the majority of readers
Live Defect status must be clearly stated and be current and not require the reader to read
contentiand come.to a summarised view themselves
All Live Defects must have a clear next action stated that can be tracked
All Live Defects must be owned by a team at all times whose manager will ensure the right
actions are being taken (this can be a different team throughout the lifetime of the Live
Defect)
o Managers must ensure that Live Defects within their areas are reviewed regularly and action
taken to ensure processes are being followed — this may require manual reviews
o When a HDR Defect is being investigated there will be a TfSNow Incident open and bonded.
POL will track status by referring to their ServiceNow Incident. All progress on the
investigation is to be added to the TfSNow Incident so that it is visible to POL in their
corresponding ServiceNow Incident
e It is POL’s responsibility to keep their Problem record up to date if they have opened
one

investigation Peak and Incident will be closed with no further actions required. The Peak will
be closed with Response Category “95 -- Final — Advice after Investigation” [or “66 — Final —

Enhancement Request’] which will see it excluded from Live Defect counts in the future. The
HDR-* Collection should remain so we know it was considered within the HDR Forum

o When a HDR Defect is confirmed as a Fujitsu owned Live Defect, then a new defect Peak
will be created that summarises the fault and the required fix and carries all the required
meta data tags. The defect Peak reference will be added to the investigation Peak which will
then replicate to the TfSNow Incident. The investigation Peak will be closed along with the
TfSNow Incident. Fujitsu will then manage the Live Defect in Peak and will provide status

update reports from Peak that will be shared with POL for POL to use as part of the weekly
HDR Forum

o Live Defects that are not classified as HDR Defects are managed internally by Fujitsu using
Peak. Reports will be available for POL to show overall progress but it is not intended that
every non-HDR Defect will be discussed

co There are a number of new and updated fields that comprise the key meta data used to
manage defect Peaks. These fields must be kept up to date by Fujitsu staff and checked and
amended by team managers regularly

o Deferred Peaks (that do not relate to test environment findings) become Live Defects. When
a Peak is deferred, the Fujitsu party obtaining the agreement, mustiensure:

o We need a documented process that reviews any Fujitsu internal Jiras and ensures they are
monitored and raised as Peaks when needed so:they follow the»processes. Jiras meeting the
criteria stated in Appendix C require no action'as Appendix C is a POA policy

o We need to hold dates when Releases went live,and when future Releases are proposed for

so we have an outcome for any defect Peak

We need to provide a full list of ALL Live Defects closed in a Release with their associated

POL Problem references so that POLare also able to manage their HDR process

o Reports are needed for management to show the overall status, trends, and patterns related
to all current Live Defects and historical Live Defects

co CBIF rejections will get a POL,reference that we will add to the Peak References field and
also to the KBA so we know this was a POL decision not to take further action. The Peak will
be closed with Response “63 -- Final -- Programme approved - No fix required”

o CBIF submissions will be\documented in a file that will be attached to Peak. The file will use
the File Type “CBIF Proposal” so it can be readily identified. This will be sent to HDR so that
the meeting has the information in advance

co The outcome of BIF/CBIF/PTF meetings will be held in concise notes in the relevant text
boxes,on the Release Mgt tab. No need for separate minutes

o Peaks that haveibeen tested successfully and are still to be deployed must not be closed and
mustbe routed to RM-x and assigned to “Release to Live" so it is clear that the Live Defect is
still present in the system but that its fix has been tested and is awaiting release

o “Release Peaks” are administrative reference Peaks for Release Management. They do not
act as master Peaks so the defect Peaks must be kept updated independent of the Release

Peak_settings and dates

o Anumber of Response Category field values are considered No Fault Found. See Appendix
F
o We should ensure that any Live Defect is promptly investigated until we confirm no fault is
found or that a fix is needed and change the status to Defect Identified. Anyone owning a
stack with Peaks classed as ##LiveAffectingDefect that is open and still being investigated
should ensure progress is made optimally
o If we have a Live Defect that is Defect Identified and it has either of the: HDR-* Collections,
or is Priority A or B we should:
a. Explore every option we can to find a workaround — and implement it
b. Get it Targeted At a release as fast as possible(immediate BIF and PTF)
c. Geta strong proposed date for these Releases (So we have a go live date in
mind) — this may require more input from/POk
d. Propose a hot-fix is considered and invite POA management and POL
management to decide if they want,to or not (forget'the constraints — this is a
management call)
e. Stack owners and Release Management must ensure this is done
co If we have a Live Defect that is Defect Identified and is Priority C/D/Z we should:
a. Get it Targeted At a maintenance. release as fast as possible
b. Normal BIF and PTF scheduled meetings can continue
c. Demand more maintenance teleases with confirmed dates
d. Stack owners and Release Management must ensure this is done
e. We should expectto putLive Defects that are Defect Identified into the next
month's maintenance release ‘at the latest’

o Take ALL numbered and dated Releases to Demand Planning so they can be prioritised
alongside other work by POA and by POL and POL know the implication of not allowing us to
progress them

o Summary — must be written so as to be understandable by most readers. This will need more
thought when Peaks are raised. Management should amend this during weekly clean-ups
(careful to preserve links where raised in another system)

co Impact — tab and free form field to articulate impact, status and next steps so it is easy to
understand for anyone. This will be maintained for HDR Peaks weekly. For other Peaks it can

be as needed
e Business impact: [as used currently, mention how many branches are affected if
helpful]

e Status update: [description of current status — succinct]
e Next action: [next action to be taken and expected date for next update]

o Collection ##LiveAffectingDefect (formerly ##LiveAffectingSoftwareFault). This Collection
must be set when the Peak meets the criteria for a Live Defect at the earliest possible
opportunity. It is likely that Call Type “L” will frequently carry this ##tag but it will not always
be the case so needs selectively applying. The Collection descriptive text is “Fault that is
present on the Live system that is inconsistent with the agreed design and/or service
specification”

by some of POL’s other suppliers and POL will need to manage and

* — The fix may need to be done concurrently with a separate future
planned change, due to the two fixes being logically related, and
POL would need to confirm their willingness to accept any potential
delays in deploying the fix.

* — The fix may relate to active discussions between Fujitsu and POL on
a specific and separate topic and hence should be discussed within
that context (Fujitsu management discretion).

* Fujitsu does not believe a fix is a sensible option and seeks POL’s
agreement to record the circumstances in a KBA only.

factor for submission to CBIF

agreed template (see right) and approval process so it
is clear that this is what the decision needs to be made
on (not additional dialogue during a meeting)

Peaks to be discussed at CBIF are determined by Peak

¢ CBIF rejections must get a POL reference which we add to the Peak and also to the
KBA so we know this was a POL decision. The Peak is then closed with Response
Category “63 -- Final -- Programme approved - No fix required”
There will need to be a weekly report seen by management of what is to be presented at
CBIF, and what the status is of open CBIF items and POL decisions

e Fujitsu must ask POL for their Problem reference so it can be added to the Fujitsu
Incident (and any related Peaks) so we have the POL reference
e Fujitsu embeds any relevant KBA or Peak content into the Incident it shares
e Fujitsu tags its Incidents and Peaks with the applicable HDR-* Cl or Collection tags
e Fujitsu does not reference its KBAs (and does not share them with POL in their
native form)

is known and a fix is to be taken through the fixing process. Fujitsu will close the

investigation Peak and the linked Incident as the confirmed defect Peak reference
will be the one that will be managed from this point
e If a KBA, or internal Peak, is created that identifies a condition that meets the
definition of HDR Defect then Fujitsu raises an Incident by contacting Fujitsu MAC
with the relevant KBA content in it and Fujitsu MAC bonds the Incident and alerts
POL
e Updates on potential Live Defects is provided via bonded Incident updates
e Updates on confirmed Live Defects is provided by defect Peak weekly reports
«The above ensure POL has visibility at all times either from their ServiceNow
Incident or by maintaining their ServiceNow Problem record (POL will need to
transpose data from the weekly Fujitsu reports into its Problem records)
e As this is an early warning forum too, we will also issue an email alertito the Fujitsu
Duty Manager distribution list and a POL distribution list to alertinterested/parties
o Summary
e Potential HDR Defects will be reported automatically to POL via'the service
management toolset replication driven by Fujitsu updates tothe TfSNow Incident
e Actual HDR Defects (including any deferred) will be shared with POL weekly by an
extract report from Peak that will be sent to POL in advance of the meeting showing
the latest update
e New CBIF content will be shared with POL on a weekly report from Peak that will
include the proposal and will be sent to POkkin advance of the meeting
e Updates to CBIF content will be shared with POL weekly by a extract report from
Peak that will be sent to POL in advance ofthe meeting showing the latest update
co The Incident will be worked by Fujitsu if it is within the Fujitsu scope of obligations —
otherwise it will be passed to POL ITDSD to assign to the relevant POL third party
o POLwill probably convert the SefviceNow, Incident to a ServiceNow Problem — but that is
their choice
o If Fujitsu completes its investigation and confirms there is no HDR Defect then the
investigation Peak and Incident will be closed with no further actions required. The defect
Peak will be closed with Response Category “95 -- Final — Advice after Investigation” to say
the HDR Defect was not confirmed
co For the purposes of Live Defect Management, Fujitsu will use Peak references not TfSNow
Problem references,
o Fujitsu will provide its view of status — from its systems — and manage any difference of
opinionwith ROL
o Fujitsu will provide weekly updates prior to the meeting
« » Potential HDR Defects — no action required as the updates will already be in POL
ServiceNow
e Confirmed and deferred HDR Defects — by sharing the latest update on the defect
Peak we are managing our side in the form of a report.
« CBIF new Live Defects — for decision by sharing the pro-forma proposal in a report
and inviting a decision
° — Note: Any reports will be checked and sent in advance of the HDR Forum so POL can add it to

their Problem record and ensure they are ready to provide a decision to the CBIF new Live
Defects

o The HDR Forum needs to evolve away from a “talking shop” to one of quick facts that
demonstrate systematic control and confidence. Fujitsu should reduce the number of

If POL need more information, the Fujitsu Incident, Peak or Problem owner is tasked to get it
and add it to our system — or we get the CBIF proposal updated for resubmission. The new
information must be added to the system
POL need to hold the Fujitsu Incident or defect Peak reference in their Problem record so
they know what to ask us for an update on — and what to apply our report updates to in their
system
The HDR minutes need an overhaul for Fujitsu. This is the Fujitsu specific meeting and yet it
lists numerous Live Defects that are not related to Fujitsu and the minutes are sprawling and
hard to follow. POL will be advised that:
e They need to make it clear which HDR Defects are within Fujitsu's scope of
obligations
e They need to show the Fujitsu Live Defect reference (ServiceNow/TfSNow Incident
or defect Peak)
e They need to show Fujitsu's latest update
« Asummary view at the top is needed - New, Open, Closed, by Severity, by area
affected, and trend
Any ad-hoc calls should only be required when the next scheduled meeting is too far away.
Updates from Fujitsu must come from the Incident update,or defect Peak report with any
additional comments made during the meeting being added,to the Incident or defect Peak
There is no definition of HDR in the contract — this needs to be addressed

Refer to Appendix D for instructions on how to create the'weekly HDR Report for POL.

B —Info only

The Fujitsu KB is an information repository used, for support purposes

Any observed Live Defects willberecorded as a KBA but the progress to investigate and
address them will be done via Peak(s) and Incident(s)

KBAs do not need to be shared with POL as the tracking needs to be on the Peak and
Incident raised to progress them:

If the awareness oninvolvement of POL is applicable then there will be a TfSNow bonded
Incident and this will contain.all relevant parts of any KBA so that the Incident that POL see
is a suitable complete reference

If POL accept a Live Defect — namely decide that no action is required — then the KBA will be
updated accordingly and will have the POL applicable reference added so it is clear that it
was notfixed by POL decision. This is a contract responsibility on POL to record these and
issue Fujitsu with a notification

Appendix Al — Peak data anomaly checks

To ensure the data in Peak remains consistent with the intentions of the changes within this
document, period checks will be needed (in addition to the checklist actions owned by stack owners
and support staff) to ensure the data remains ‘clean’ and that the checklists can be updated to
gradually capture every potential edit needed. POA Defect Manager will need to enable automated
reporting and suitable cross-checking.

The checks relate to Peaks that have the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection added.

4. Status is “F’inal but the fix is deployed

5. Status is Open — appear to be waiting action
o WHY - Peaks with Status “O” are usually those thathave just been logged before
someone picks them up and starts to work on them. At that point the status changes

Appendix A2 — Peaks closed that POL should consider following up on

Peaks are closed when the outcome is something that requires a new feature request to be submitted
or sometime to explain why the solution works the way it does when that may in fact be causing
issues for POL or its postmasters. Peaks that are closed in this way warrant review by POL as it may
determine that it would like to add either new features or more user supporting features to reduce
Incidents and improve the solution. These should be reported on to POL for them to consider. The
frequency of sharing should be monthly with the list growing based on a cumulative view.

The checks relate to Peaks that have the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection added and hence relate to
the Live system.

1. POL Feature Consideration Report
o WHY —although we may consider our work done when we close a’Peak as needing
POL to take action, not us, it would be more helpful if we collated;the previous
month/quarter of things we decided were not going to be progressed and presented
them to POL for a properly considered decision. Thistisjin itsearly days and POA
does not have an owner or defined process for this yet

Appendix A3 — Peaks closed with no obvious Release

Peaks can be closed with no obvious reference to when the fix went live. This may be because the
fix did not go live under a Release so there are no Planned Out Live dates showing on the system.
Until this process is fixed, these Peaks need checking.

The checks relate to Peaks that have the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection added and hence relate to
the Live system.

1. Peaks closed without a Release

°

WHY - a closed Peak SHOULD be because there was no fault found and hence no
fix required, or because the fix was deployed. At the moment there is,no process or
tagging to enable Peaks to be associated with TfSNow Changes or 3“ party delivered
changes outside of Fujitsu’s control. A process will be defined, andpuntil itis, this
prompt is intended to ensure that the Peak has not been incorrectly updated

az:

[Release Management] The key fields on any Peaks presented at BIF, CBIF or PTF must be
checked and amended accordingly

[Release Management] Peaks with release set to “Re-target” should have the PTF Action
automatically set

[Release Management] Check that Peaks that have the CBIF flags set do not have the PTF
action set until CBIF has been updated (catch the accidental setting of PTF Action after BIF but
before CBIF decision provided)

[Release Management] All Peaks with Planned Out Live (Date Out Live,field on Peakiscreens)
in the past should be Closed. The ‘fix’ has been deployed. If they are StatusiF.then the Call
Logger or Call Logger Team manager should ensure these are closed

[Release Management] All Peaks where the Planned Out Live (Date Out Live field on Peak
screens) is blank or in the future should not be Closed as the*fix’has not yet been deployed

o These Peaks can be closed if they have a No Fault Found Response Category as
this shows they were subsequently determined to\require no action by Fujitsu

[Release Management] All Peaks with Target Release Type of “Targeted At” are Release
Management responsibility to drive to deploymentdemanding action from other teams as
needed to ensure timely progress

[Release Management] When a Peak is discussed, for the first time at a BIF, CBIF or PTF
meeting then the applicable Planned Date,and Actual Date should be set to the same date. If
the Peak is re-presented at any of these/meetings then the Actual Date should change to the
date they were reviewed. Suitable comments should be added to the relevant section and
updates should be appended to maintainia log

[Release Management] If a Peak is approved at BIF then it must have the “BIFApproved”
Collection added and the BIF Actionremoved

[Release Management] If a Peak.is approved at BIF and does not need to go to CBIF then it
must have the PTF Action set and the BIF Action removed

[Release Management] If a Peak is rejected at BIF then it is expected that the Peak will be
closed with an appropriate\update. The Peak must have the “BIFRejected” Collection added
and the BIF Action removed

[Release Management] If a Peak is not approved at BIF (and not rejected) then the BIF Action
should remain so the Peak is picked up at the next BIF meeting

[Release Management] If a Peak is targeted at PTF then the PTF Action should be removed
[Release Management] If a Peak is not targeted at PTF then the PTF Action should remain so
the Peak is picked up at the next PTF meeting

[Release Management] The BIF Action should only be removed if BIF approves or rejects a
Peak

[Release Management] The Root Cause on any Peak should be maintained and it should be
checked carefully when being targeted and prepared for release to live

[Business Development] Any Peaks with the Collection "Deferral Agreed" should be Call Type
"#" unless the defect needs further investigation in which case it is Call Type "L"

e Deferred Peaks must have the ##LiveAffectingDefect Collection added once the
release they relate to is deployed (unless they relate to issues in test environments
and NOT the Live system)

e This can exclude Peaks where the Planned Out Live (Date Out Live field on Peak
screens) is in the past and the ‘fix’ has been deployed

[ALL Dev Teams] When a Live Defect is confirmed, if the Peak is bonded to TfSNow and POL
ServiceNow then it must be cloned. The clone reference is to be added to the original Peak
and the original Peak closed with the Response Category “Cloned to create defect Peak”. If the
Peak is not bonded to TfSNow and POL ServiceNow then it can just have the Call Type
changed to “#”

e Are not Call Type "#"
e Do not the Planned Out Live (Date Out Live field on Peak screens) in the past as the
‘fix’ has been deployed
e Are not closed as they had a No Fault Found Response Category
e And were not Deferred

* Collection must get an urgent BIF/PTF review to be assigned a Release as well.as a Release
Date. A hot-fix must also be proposed for POA/POL management decision:

e [Release Management] Peaks that are Call Type "# - Defect Identified” but have not yet been
to BIF (BIF action not yet set and BIFApproved not in Collection) then. action is needed unless
they are scheduled for the next BIF meeting

e This can exclude Peaks where the Planned,Out Live (Date Out Live field on Peak

e This can exclude Peaks that are Targeted At as they may have been handled prior to
the new processes

e These Peaks can be closed if they have a.No Fault Found Response Category as
this shows they were subsequently determined to require no action by Fujitsu

« [Release Management] Targeted At Reaks should be Call Type "#" as the Defect is identified.
This should have been caught at BIF and/or PTF

screens) is in the past and the ‘fix’ has been deployed

«These Peaks can be Closed if they have a No Fault Found Response Category as

« [Release Management] Peaks that are identified as “Re-target” should have the PTF action set
to force the continued discussion so a next step is clear

e [Release Management] Targeted At and Proposed For - where Planned Out Live (Date Out
Live field on Peak Screens) is blank or in the future should be Open (O or P) and not Closed (F
or C). Although F is still technically open, the Call Logger may deem it acceptable to close it
prematurely — hence Status F should be avoided

« [Release Management] Where release numbers are referenced in Target Releases, a date for
the release should be added and reasons why no date can be assigned should be challenged

e [Release Management] We need to highlight where the Target Release is ‘Rel. Ind.’ or ‘Next
Counter Release’ — perhaps with POL so they share our enthusiasm to schedule and fix - and
in so doing we keep momentum

e [Release Management] If a Peak has been to BIF it needs to have the BIFApproved or
BlFRejected collection added. If not then it should have the BIF Action flag set as it is to be re-
presented

e [All] Managers/Team Leaders must check for Peaks that have been cloned to ensure the
reasons match the conditions agreed. If they do not, then appropriate action must be taken
(update the cloning rules, remove the clone, ensure the reason for cloning is captured on the
master Peak and that the purpose of the new clone is captured in the cloned Peak)

Appendix A6 — Live Defect Management Monthly Report Creation
Work Instructions

To create the monthly Live Defect Management for POA stack owners and leadership, follow these

steps:

o Create the Peak extract to build the report from

Then, open any version of the “Peak_Defect_Management extract dd.mm.ccyy
hh.mm.xisx” spreadsheet and Enable Content and go to the Data tab and click
Refresh All on each tab. The password to run the embedded queries needs entering
3 times and is ‘ir . Save the resulting file with the timestamp toymatch when
the extract was created — so it can be referred back to. Turn off’AutoSave:

o Prepare the report

A spreadsheet format has been used to date so the previous month's
“POA_Live_Defect_Management Monthly Report ddzmm.ceyy hh.mm.xisx” should
be used as the basis for the new report. To show history, copy the white box on the
top left of the Summary tab and paste it to the right as an image (you may need to
delete a previous image)

Save the file with the same date and time values as the Peak extract created earlier
so you know which extract the report‘felates to

o Go to the ##LiveAffectingDefect tab and filter as follows,

Then the 5 tabs are derived as follows:

co Still Investigating

Clear all filters
Filter the Planned Out Liveidate so it is in the future or blank (it has not been
deployed)
Filter out the No Fault Found Response Category values (see Appendix F)
Filter Call Typéito exclude “Defect Identified”

To ensure the data in TfSNow remains consistent with the intentions of the changes within this
document, managers will need to conduct manual checks. Those checks should cover at least the
following. Expanded checklists should be created within each team. The POA Defect Manager will
also need to do this at a cross-function level.

The checks relate to TfSNow Incidents that have had the ##LiveAffectingDefect or any HDR-*

Appendix C — draft criteria for closing Defect Peaks with NO action

There will always be Live Defects that experience and judgement says are simply not worth fixing. To
ensure this is a matter of policy and not one of subjective decision making, criteria is needed that
staff can use to make decisions.

The following is an initial draft to build upon.

A fix for a Live Defect will NOT be progressed if at least THREE of the following conditions apply:

*

The frequency of occurrence of the Live Defect is rare — less than TWICE penannum

The impact of the Live Defect is minor — it does NOT affect branch operations,or Fujitsu
service delivery

The impact of the Live Defect only affects Fujitsu service delivery— and Fujitsu has
compensating controls in place and Fujitsu management.has agreed to taking no action

The impact of the Live Defect is accepted by POL —- anda KBA has been created by both
Fujitsu and POL clearly stating the decision and the decision maker

The Live Defect is in a part of the system that will be decommissioned before any fix could
be developed and deployed

The Live Defect relates to Fujitsuinternal documentation only and the remedy will not affect
the understanding or supportiof the system by Fujitsu

Live Defects recorded in Jira’s that meet the above criteria do not need to be raised as Peaks as
doing so would simply see the Peaks immediately closed. A Jira that describes a Live Defect that
would warrant a KBA must have/a KBA written to help future support activities.

Appendix D - HDR Report Creation Work Instructions

To create the weekly HDR Report which is shared with POL, follow these steps:

o The criteria to be used to determine HDR reporting candidates to share with POL will be
determined by creating 3 lists using the following logic. The resulting lists will then be merged
and the HDR candidates identified.

co Prepare the report to send to POL

« Aspreadsheet format has been used to date so the previous week's POL “HDR
Defects update report — dd.mm.ccyy v1.0.xlsx” submission should be.used as the
