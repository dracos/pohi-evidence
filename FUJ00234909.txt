22

2.3

24

25

1.1.1. the Clauses, Schedules and Annexes to this Agreement and to the Contract
Controlled Documents and Contract Referenced Documents listed in its
Schedules shall only be made; and

1.1.2 documents forming part of or related to Work Orders, where the amendment or
change satisfies the criteria specified in paragraph 5.3 of Schedule A2, may be
made,

in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

Within the context of the following sections of this Schedule the term "change" includes
both amendments and changes.

Notwithstanding the above, the parties agree that certain changes that relate to the KS
cloud platform will only need to follow the Change Control Procedure where the
circumstances set out within paragraph 2.3 of Schedule I4 are met.

PRINCIPLES

Where Post Office or Fujitsu Services identifies the need for a change, then Post Office
may at any time request a change or Fujitsu Services may at any time recommend a
change. Such a request or recommendation shall only be made and shall only be valid if
authorised (in each case) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 of
this Schedule.

Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu Services shall unreasonably withhold or delay their
agreement to any change or proposal in relation thereto.

Until such time as a change has been fully authorised in accordance with the procedures
set out in paragraph 3 of this Schedule, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall continue
as if the change had not been made.

Any discussions which may take place between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a
change before its authorisation shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party.

Any purported change provided by Fujitsu Services that has not been otherwise agreed
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1 above shall be undertaken entirely at
the expense and liability of Fujitsu Services. If so required by Post Office, Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense promptly take all steps necessary to reverse and remove the
effects of such purported change.

3. CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE

3.1 Standard Change Procedures

3.1.1

Discussions between Post Office and Fujitsu Services in relation to a change to
be effected through the Change Control Procedure shall result in any one of the
following:

3.1.1.1 no further action;

3.1.1.2 a request to make a change by Post Office's authorised representative (a
"Change Request" or “CR");

3.1.1.3 a recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services;

3.1.1.4 the use of a Change Work Order (“CWO”) form to enact a Work Order
the contents of which are as detailed in Schedule D2, paragraph 4.2.

Post Office shall send Change Requests to Fujitsu Services Commercial Change
Manager and Fujitsu Services shall respond to such Change Request by
submitting a Change Work Order (“CWO”) and/or Change Control Note (“CCN")
to Post Office Contract Management.

If Fujitsu Services considers that the preparation of a CWO and/or CCN,
requested by Post Office, would necessitate allocation of resources in excess of
five man-days, Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office accordingly and, on
agreement by Post Office, Fujitsu Services will make a proposal for a paid study
of the cost and implications of producing the required CWO and/or CCN. Pending
Post Office's acceptance of that proposal or in the event that Post Office does not
agree that such proposal should be submitted, Fujitsu Services will be relieved of
its obligations to produce such CWO and/or CCN.

A recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services shall be submitted to
Post Office Contract Management in the form of a CWO and/or CCN.

For each CWO and/or CCN submitted, Post Office shall evaluate the CWO and/or
CCN and, as appropriate, during the period of validity:

3.1.5.1 request further information;

3.1.5.2 authorise the change set out in the CWO and /or CCN in accordance with
paragraph 3.1.8 below;

3.1.5.3 suggest modifications to the CWO and/or CCN (including, without
limitation, corrections of minor errors to avoid unnecessary rejection); or

Schedule A3 Version 15.0

CONFIDENTIAL

rejection) of the CWO and/or CCN.

The period within which Fujitsu Services shall respond to a CR, and the period of
validity of each CWO and/or CCN from the date it is submitted to Post Office shall
be:

3.1.6.1 one week in the case of CRs and CCNs whose sole effect is to change
or introduce CCDs or CRDs previously reviewed by the Parties (through
such document review processes as the Parties may agree from time to
time);

3.1.6.2 one week in the case of CRs, CWO's and CCNs (or any changes thereto)
whose purpose is to effect a change to the description of a Work Package
or Work Package Element, in approved form where such Work Package
or Work Package Element is the subject of or incorporated in a Work
Order, but only where such change would fall within paragraph 5.12 of
Schedule D2; and

3.1.6.3 three weeks or such other period as the Parties may agree for a particular
CWO, CR or CCN.

Fujitsu Services may submit CWOs and CCNs electronically.

A change shall only be authorised if the relevant CWO and/or CCN has been
signed by:

3.1.8.1 one of the VP, Digital Transformation & Innovation Delivery Executive-
Post Office Account or their nominated representative in their absence,
on behalf of Fujitsu Services, such representatives to be notified to Post
Office in advance; and
