Subject: FW: In Confidence - Spot Review 5 Response
Sensitivity: Confidential

James: I'll send a proper response to your latest email later today but the idea
of a 2nd July meeting is certainly a good one so we'll agree to that. Also, I
don't think we'll need your help in getting POL to respond to the Spot Reviews.
They are RESPONDING... but not yet ina form that will really WORK in our
Interim Report or in the 8th July Meeting. They are still - understandably I
suppose - incredibly defensive and nobody - at the levels producing the
responses - is ready to give an inch. They probably fear it will be career death
to concede any failings whatsoever. We have consistently and clearly asked for
short, easy-to-understand, honest and complete answers to the assertions that
we have put forward. What we are getting are highly technical, multi-page,
responses that will appear to many to have been crafted so as to avoid actually
giving any answers to those assertions and allegations at all. Without wishing to
burden you with detail, the attached is a pretty good example of the POL/2nd
Sight dialogue... and shows my exasperation in trying to get them to ANSWER
THE BLASTED QUESTIONS.

T'll try again, in a conference call tomorrow (actually later this morning!), to get
POL to understand how difficult it is going to be for Ian and I to summarise
their side of each of the stories that are to be included in the Interim
Report/July 8th Meeting if they fail to provide the crisp, straight-talking
answers that everyone will be expecting. Spot Review 05, the subject of the
following emails, is one of those that will be addressed on July 8th.

Best regards, Ron.
