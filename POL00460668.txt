Spoken to Z, I am going to speak to Sonal myself tomorrow to try to secure her on PAYE employee and give
her a pay increase. I will also speak to Morson to understand why they recommended a ridiculously high rate
(and who internally supported this). It feels my team have allowed other people to move out of the HR function
into Z's contractor population (which I was not told about), but nevertheless as a rule, we need to put a stop to
moving all PAYE into contractor positions, we need to proactively plan for resources (and recruit them with
good governance) and we need to get Morsons to step up. If I cannot get Sonal to move as an employee (with
protection of employment etc etc) I have agreed to appoint her on a day rate (against my better judgment) to get
this sorted. Z agrees Nic Marriotts appointment (and a new recruitment head, who I have lined up) will be
fundamental to changing the approach we have on contracting v employment. It's 8 weeks in, and I am starting
to feel like POLs Lara Croft! Everyday is a battle! I need a strong team to fix it. Lee needs to go, I am
pondering over Helen, and I also need to have a strong (but small) internal comms team to ensure I can drive a
solid cultural change programme across the whole business (Richard has to relinquish this - we can discuss this
Friday, but it has to be one of the fundamental things that changes - we are too sedentary and opaque in our
internal comms / marketing); we need clever campaigns, energy and some fun, as well as a continued focus on
our plans/strategy/response to feedback and shouting about all the good things...it is letting us down).
