Governance Review

2"4 August 2013
FUJ00174800
FUJ00174800

Background FUJITSU

= As part of the CSIP process, the account management team has identified the need to:
® Improve business engagement/governance at the Executive and Management levels;

®@ Understand the tensions on either side as the relationship between Fujitsu and the Post
Office changes with the implementation of the Towers model;

m Where necessary, reconfirm scope, purpose and the inputs/outputs of relevant meetings;
® Ensure discipline and focus is maintained in BAU during the transition phase covering:
¢ Performance (Run);
e Change;
¢ Improvement;
¢ Innovation.
= Target date for closure is August 2013 and should include Structure, Plan and Membership
etc.

@ In parallel, discussions across the Senior Management team between Fujitsu and the Post
Office (LS, NW, RB) had identified the need to look at this topic in more depth to ensure it
was operating correctly.

FUJ00174800
FUJ00174800

Approach FUJITSU

= To move this forward, a baseline of the existing approach to governing the account via existing
contractual and non-contractual frameworks is proposed, assessing performance based on
objective input from key stakeholders covering:

= Effectiveness
¢ Are the right decisions being made using the right content at the right time?
= Efficiency
e Input versus output.
= Potential
¢ The possibility to make a major difference in the future.
@ A working group is planned consisting of:
= Richard Bryant, Haydn Jones, Neil Wilkinson, Gavin Bell, Mark Arnold.
a All parties recognise the importance of this work given:
= Volume and importance of change across the account;
= The critical nature of services delivered by Fujitsu;

= The evolution of the supply chain in the context of the Towers model, and the importance of
ensuring performance of Run and Change does not slip.

m Where sensible, recommendations will be made based on reference to best practice seen within
other accounts.

@ Initial recommendations for broader, subsequent phases of work to be provided by end August.

Summary Findings FUJITSU

™ Broadly speaking, with the exception of the Executive level, the
Governance framework has been operating as expected.

m@ At the Executive level, the higher level, Board to Board meetings have not
been taking place. These sessions have morphed into weekly Bid Review
sessions for D level attendees on both sides. The demands of the bid
commercials have necessitated this, however, as the Towers model begins
come together, we should shift towards, more regularised, higher level,
strategic sessions. These could cover:

™ Good News

@ Bid — Update (inc. MVNO)

m@ Run

lm Change (inc. HPBB)

= AOB

These sessions would include data from the relevant forum.

Next Steps FUJITSU

™ Move the Weekly FJ/PoL meeting, to fortnightly, with the ambition of shifting
towards monthly timing - whilst not a contracted governance forum, given
the evolution of the Towers framework, stakeholders on all sides need to
understand and balance status across three areas:

@ Run
l Change / Grow
@ Bid

Materials will be presented on each of these topics, as well as other agenda
items as appropriate.

m™ Reinstate the Quarterly Executive level meetings, as per the contract.

m= We also need to understand how we engage the broader stakeholder
community.

= Draft terms of reference and diarise meetings for the next 12 months.

FUJ00174800

What is Governance? FUJITSU

™ Some common definitions of governance across all
industries

& ‘IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear
governance is to assure the investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated
with IT projects’.

& ‘The use of institutions, structures of authority and even collaboration to allocate resources and coordinate or
control activities’.

= ‘Provide a decision making framework that is logical, robust and repeatable to govern an organization’s capital
investments. In this way, an organization will have a structured approach to conducting both its business as usual
activities and its business change, or project, activities’.

m ‘As a process, governance may operate in an organization of any size: from a single human being to all of
humanity; and it may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. A reasonable or rational purpose of
governance might aim to assure, (sometimes on behalf of others) that an organization produces a worthwhile
pattern of good results while avoiding an undesirable pattern of bad circumstances’.

m™ Fujitsu UK & Ireland definition of governance

™ Governance for Fujitsu is the management of the Company in line with the BMS. Compliance is effectively the
management of the BMS and Assurance is how we evidence that the Company is being managed in accordance
with the BMS. These definitions (or some worded very similarly) will go onto Wikipedia.

= Good Governance is effective and cost efficient, whereby the desired outcomes were achieved as proved by
Assurance.

IT Governance and Change FUJITSU

@ Some general principles
@ Allows the organisation to balance Run with a Change or Growth agenda
@ A structured way of taking defined risks to drive the business
® Objective is right time, right cost, right technology
™ Assuming Run is in good shape, change or growth can be accelerated
@ Apply the test
® Can the organisation respond to critical changes in the business model?
@ Changing any kind of governance is not easy

& Small demonstrable steps are required, focused on changing the governance
model to support the business

m= Change or growth investment can be used to track impact on Run cost, all of
which needs to be underpinned by a cost model set against revenues

@ It will take 18 months to two years for an effective governance model to emerge

™ Establishing the framework needs persistence and sponsorship and must be
supported by a team of analysts to drive the narrative and set pieces to gain
traction
