Subject: Sparrow update

All

I wanted to give you an update on Sparrow.

As you know the BIS select committee takes place on Tuesday starting at 0930.

The first hour will be evidence from the CWU (Andy Furey), JFSA (Alan Bates) and NFSP (George Thomson).
That will be followed by an hour with Paula, Angela and Second Sight.

We are working today on finalising briefing and key lines (hence my absence from SLT, for which I am really sorry). We are also
submitting our evidence to the committee.

We held a mock session yesterday with a team from Brunswick including ex-senior journalists and political advisers. This was
hugely helpful in assessing strengths and weaknesses in our briefing so far.

We are preparing for potential media interest by making contact with senior editors on key programmes and will engage vigorously
should we need to do so, in line with our strategy of containing coverage as much as possible.

In other developments:

- Al is meeting Second Sight on Monday to discuss our finance systems

- the minister has now replied to JFSA in (we understand) strong and helpful terms

- Paula and I updated the Board on Wednesday

- we are preparing a submission as requested by the Criminal Cases Review Commission
I hope this is helpful. Happy of course to answer any queries.
