Dear Lucy,

I am writing just to ask whether you have yet managed to see Second Sight and, if so,
what conclusions you have drawn.

It would also be helpful if you could let me know what you now see at the timetable for
the investigations being conducted by the new Chairman of the Post Office.

With best wishes,

OLIVER LETWIN
