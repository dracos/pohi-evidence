Dear Cath,

Thanks for your email of today.

Please can you look at the list of documents attached to my last email. This shows what daily snapshots we have
in the red file. Did you take any others?

Kind regards. Stephen

Stephen,
The only documents that I took from Marine Drive were cash accounts and snap shots.Are they in
the red file ? I have spoken to Vicky and she told me that she thinks you have them, I hope so.

I did not take any Giro receipts from the Branch.

One of the main things that Mr Castleton said, was that the suspense account software had a fault
and that the suspense account kept doubling the figures, but as you will see from the cash accounts the suspense
account wasn't used until several weeks of mis balances.

Regards,

Cath.

Dear Vicky,

Thanks for your 3 emails of today. I have also received the manuscript audit notes by special delivery. This is all
helpful info.

1. When your colleagues visit the branch, they should only sign for those documents they actually take away for
copying and that when they return the originals, they get something in writing to acknowledge that they have
returned them all.

2. The missing giro receipts are particularly important, especially the ones for 11 to 31 March 2004, because the
shortage in the Cash Account week ended 17 March (week 51) was £11,210.56. John Jones says its the giro
receipts that prove that there was a physical shortfall in the cash. I await confirmation from Tony Utting as soon
as possible as to whether and how quickly all the missing receipts can be obtained.

Mandy (Keith - for info)

as discussed yesterday.......... please find attached the statement from Jan Holmes which was used in a
prosecution of a counter clerk at Camberwell Branch Office in 2002.

(See attached file: Revised Witness Statement Jan Holmes.doc)

the one below is the current draft of a statement that supports the production of archived data

(See attached file: Draft Fujitsu new.doc)

I would suspect that the Jan Holmes statement is more or less exactly what you'll need should the ‘Castleton’ case
proceed all the way (however I seem to recall that at the time, as it was out of the normal this statement did cost

us ‘an arm and a leg'.... but I maybe wrong).

Please bare in mind I've only asked Fujitsu to prepare a report on Castleton responding to the Bond Pearce letter
dated 18 November 2005.

Regards

Graham
