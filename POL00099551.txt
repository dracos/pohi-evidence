So a couple of other points James may ask about compensation as Alan Bates keeps referring to us needing a fund
between £50 - £100 million. What we have consistently said is that we need to look at this on a case by case basis, the
result of mediation may have several outcomes ranging from an apology, POL to agree to change its processes, the
SPMR agreeing that POL had been correct, or compensation. So we need to start working thro the cases.

Also re costs the suggested amounts were approved by Kay Linnell of JFSA.

We do need an answer to 3 tho which I think is that SS have not finished the work on the MPs cases, they are now going
to go thro the mediation process ( all cases are} so it wouldn’t be appropriate to report until that process is finished... so
what does he want to do in Oct. Also remember we are going to try and talk to all the MP’s (hopefully) and offer then a
discussion about their cases.

Subje leeting with James Arbuthnot, 9am, 11 September 2013

Dear Jorja and Alwen,

James is very much looking forward to seeing Alice, and you Alwen, tomorrow
morning. He wonders if he might touch on the following during the meeting, but
is aware this is your meeting, and you will have plenty of things you wish to
raise.

1. How is new mediation process working so far?

2. Chairman of working party — has a decision been made as to who?

3. October —- MPs meeting and final report of first tranche of cases — how
is this going?

If you give me a call on extension 4649 on arrival, I will come and collect you
from reception at Portcullis House.

Kind regards
Janet
