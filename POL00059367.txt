c.c. Graham Brander

REGINA v JOSEPHINE HAMILTON
WINCHESTER CROWN COURT

Further to my previous minute regarding the above please note that Counsel requires the following
statement. Please see responses to points below, which I am in the process of covering in further
statements.

4

A further statement from Allen as to why no extra training was given on handover ie could
she explain was this because the Defendant already knew how the system worked to a good
‘standard.

When an applicant is interviewed for the position of spmr they would
be offered the normal training package. In cases where it is an
existing spmr or assistant who is experienced, then the training
would still be offered but in the vast majority of cases, applicants will
only ask for training on any areas where they feel it is necessary. As
there is no record of training here, then I can only assume that Mrs.
Hamilton declined our offer in view of the fact that she had been
running the branch and doing the balancing on behalf of the
previous nominee spmr for a fair period of time. (N Allen)

A further statement of Portch, this should set out how much cash she would expect should
be held at any one time at an Office similar to the Defendants.

Flexible Planning generates an ideal nightly cash holding based on
information from the last 6 weeks business, this takes both
payments and deposits into account. In an outlet similar to South
Warnborough, a reasonable expected maximum holding would be in
the region of the sum of the weekly payments plus around £1740 for
coin (a bag of each denomination). However, the Flexible Planning
system remains the most accurate guide to what the outlet should
hold and is the main tool we use in determining the required levels of
cash in a branch. (R Portch).

Could Portch or someone else give details of the extent of the offenders training on Horizon,
her handover, how it happened and what help / training she got.

Because the transfer took place nearly four years ago, I can't say for
certain whether a transfer audit was done, but it is very likely that
one did take place. At transfer, the auditors check the final cash
account of the outgoing spmr and the incoming spmr is supposed to
check the cash/stock on hand. Horizon training is part of the
standard training package - I don't know where she learnt how to
use the system and very unlikely that any info would now be
available to confirm. (N Allen)

4 A further statement from Colin Woodridge regarding his conversation about the shortfall of
£1,500 in May 2003.

I do not recall a conversation around May 2003 concerning a loss of £1,500.
If I did have one, I would have offered her advice on security aspects to
ensure Cash was not at risk. I have found on my laptop a log of a visit I made
to the branch on 21/01/ 2004. That refers to a loss of £3196.47, in week 42,
which started as a loss of £2,072 in week 36. I discussed the loss at that visit
and learned that the postman was being admitted to the secure area, so told
her that the practice must cease. I also discussed how the loss could have
occurred, and told her she would have to repay it. I checked with
Chesterfield that there were no matters outstanding to account for the loss,
and advised Jo that she could apply to repay the loss by instalments.

I have no record of any subsequent conversations about the loss.

lalso have a record of a visit to the branch on 23/12/02 when Jo ran the branch on behalf of Alwen
Stacey, the previous postmaster. There were no issues then with understanding of balancing or
losses. I attach that log as well. My job tile at that time was Performance Advisor. ( Colin
Woodbridge).

Please note that the logs referred to by Colin are included as separated attachments on e-mail to
you.

5 Could a statement be provided dealing with who is available if the Defendant finds she is
struggling ie dealing what help would be afforded.

When a new spmr has been appointed, they are visited a short while
after their appointment by the local manager which at that time
would have been a Performance Advisor (Colin Woodbridge). At that
time, if a spmr required help or assistance, they could call the Post
Office helpline. If they couldn't deal with the issue, it would have
been referred to the relevant Area Office (Bournemouth) who would
attempt to sort the issue out. If it required a visit, then the
Performance Advisor would attend. (N Allen)
