Sorry should also have said below - as we know, there is antagonism vs NFSP from JFSA. Stating in our
release that NFSP will be in the group could be inflammatory. We might just mention "other
stakeholders" whilst our priority is on managing JFSA. P.

Interesting idea of Patrick Burns, I think he could do this well.

1 do think the adjudicator/ombudsman role has an attraction and we'd better have a
view: as you say Mark, I can see JA wanting to announce such. In fact, Patrick Burns or
Mike O'Connor, who is looking for a new role (portfolio - so would be ok), would be
ideal ombudsman candidates/types.

Mark, is it worth bringing Mike G into the loop - he will have past insights and is just a
good thinker as to how we could make it work?

I like much of the draft statement. Thank you. And will read again in the morning. I did
suggest to Alan Bates that I would be happy to offer him a quote. Worth a punt? P

Very interesting. In principle I am attracted to it, though obviously there
are lots of issues and clearly we would have to have some important
safeguards.

In the statement just sent, we have proposed the Branch User Forum
and also a working group to review our processes around support and
training. So it would be possible for Alan to bring this idea to the group
and I think we should look at it, without committing too hard at this
stage. Could we get an independent reviewer, a Patrick Burns type
figure, to lead this review?

I was also musing on the way home about whether we could create an
independent and confidential hotline/helpline which might be another
way of creating this middle man role.

They are quite attractive ideas politically - they can be linked in to a
responsible business agenda.

Funding is an issue and it could become an industry.
But worth thinking about.

1am only sending to you in the first instance. Alan
shared this in a goodwill sense. And although he didn't
say it was confidential, it was a genuine gesture on his
part.

I think there is some merit in it - I think I prefer
ombudsman or independent expert than adjudicator,
but would bow to the experts on appropriate

terminology.

Martin, thx for the board mail - does this change any of
it do you think?

Subject: Monday Meeting

Hello Paula,

The following is the content of the
email I sent through to James
Arbuthnot earlier today, it really is in a
raw state. Regarding meeting on
Monday, I am free any time after 3pm
and may be able to make it slightly

POL-0098595
earlier if Ican move another
appointment, if that would help.

Regards

Alan

Dear Mr Arbuthnot,

Further to our telephone conversation
yesterday, I have listed my thoughts on
how Subpostmaster, Post Office and
Horizon issues might be addressed in
the future. I have long since held the
view that there has to be a third party
that a Subpostmaster can approach if
they suddenly find they have problems
and nowhere else to turn. I have just
expanded on that view but these are
only my initial jottings on the issue, yet I
think they are adequate to illustrate the
type of structure that might be
acceptable.

Independent Adjudicator

An external independent adjudicator
has to be appointed to review cases and
Horizon issues between Post Office and
Subpostmasters.

If a Subpostmaster has had problems
that the normal Post Office system
cannot resolve, before that
Subpostmaster finds themself in a
position of no return, they should have
the option to approach the adjudicator
in total confidentiality. The mechanism
would not replace any of the Post Office
systems that are there to deal with the
serious cases of actual fraud or theft,
but would exist to provide a means that
a Subpostmaster may use to stop a
small problem becoming life and career
threatening.

POL00099012

POL-0098595
The adjudicator should have the
authority to demand documents from
Post Office and the Subpostmaster as
well as having a team of skilled
technical and legal staff they can call
upon who are able to gain access and
check any system or documents that
they deem necessary. As part of the
agreement, and before a case is
accepted, both parties would have to
accept the decision from the
adjudicator’s office as being final.

Why is there a need for such a body?

The position between a Subpostmaster
and Post Office with the use of Horizon
is in part unique. Post Office designs,
funds and maintains its Horizon system
which it requires its agent, the
Subpostmasters to use. Post Office
then holds the Subpostmaster liable for
all losses from that system regardless of
however caused and without allowing
the Subpostmaster full access to that
system. In effect this removes any onus
from Post Office to improve the system
or user friendliness of that system to
the benefit of the Subpostmaster,
because any cost would be for Post
Office to bear.

This situation has existed ever since the
introduction of Horizon and has been
behind much of the dissatisfaction that
Subpostmasters have had with using
Horizon, and which has often led to
conflict.

Key Points:-

e The adjudicator would not
replace or act asa
Subpostmaster representative
organization, the role would be

POL00099012
POL00099012

POL-0098595
POL00099012
POL00099012

solely to be involved with day
to day operational issues
affecting Subpostmasters.

e The adjudicator has to show
they are totally
independent. They can neither
be funded by Post Office, nor
work from any Post Office
building.

Whilst liaison between Post
Office and the adjudicator
would be a necessity, all
instances would become a
matter of record.

e Each case undertaken would
conclude with the production of
a report of the findings and
decision of the adjudicator.
Copies of that report being
issued to Post Office and the
Subpostmaster.

e = The adjudicator would retain
the right to refer a case directly
to Post Office to address or
correct as it would if it began to
find evidence of criminal
intent. On such occasions the
adjudicator would receive a
report from Post Office as to
what action they had
undertaken with that case.

e¢ The adjudicator would maintain
records and statistics of case
numbers, types and causes
altering Post Office to issues
that became common place.

Possible Funding Options

e Alegacy from government after
privatization.

e = Anannual ‘insurance’ levy
/option for a Subpostmaster.

e Aset fee based case charge to
stop frivolous cases, £x’s for
simple cases or £xx’s for more

POL-0098595
complex cases, matched by a
similar amount from Post Office
in each case that the
adjudicator accepted.
Combination of the other
options
