will not need changing for the introduction of the NBS (and in particular that
no memory upgrade to counter equipment will be necessary or carried out),
other than for PIN Pads in accordance with paragraph 2.7 of this document;

and

2.1.3 ensure that Banking Transactions shall be in a standard format for all Banks,
and shall be driven by Post Office Reference Data e.g. each type of Banking
Transaction shall be Bank independent with the context being set by the IIN.

Transaction to be supported but Fujitsu Services shall not develop that
capability for any further types of Banking Transaction unless and until

agreed under the Change Control Procedure.

5.1.4 Banking Transactions in the table above shall all be carried out across on-line
network communication links between the NB System and the NBE.
[NBRO009]

5.1.5 I Where required in respect of a Banking Transaction in accordance with the
terms of this Schedule, Customer Verification shall take place in accordance

with paragraph 5.8.2 of this DocumentDocument.

5.1.6 I The Banking Transactions (and underlying Post Office Products) and Issuer
Schemes (as such expression is defined in the CCD entitled “A/S Reference
Data to Pathway” (BP/IFS/010)) supported by the NBS for each type of NB

5.2.2 The NB Counter Application shall comply with the CCD entitled “Network
Banking Counter Dialogue — Activity & Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003). Post
Office Reference Data held locally in Outlets shall be used by the NB System
to determine the appropriate counter dialogue for each Banking Transaction.
Each type of Banking Transaction may involve a number of different
dialogues between the NB System and the Counter Clerk and between the
PIN Pad and Customer, depending upon a number of variable factors (such
as, without limitation, whether, and if so what method of Customer
Verification is required in respect of a Banking Transaction). Prompts to
Counter Clerks displayed by the NB Counter Application shall be standard
for all Banks. The principles upon which text is to be generated by the NB
Counter Application and displayed to Counter Clerks and text displayed to
Customers on a PIN Pad, together with specific agreed text shall be as set
out in the CCD entitled “Network Banking Counter Dialogue — Activity &
Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003). [NBR451, NBR439] [PPRO11, PPRO21,

Infrastructure such that a Counter Clerk shall be able to serve a Customer by
carrying out any of the various types of Transaction supported (e.g. OBCS,
EPOSS, APS and NBS) as required by that Customer and all Transactions
for that Customer shall be included in the same EPOSS Customer Session.

All Transactions shall be conducted under a common access control regime
such that a Counter Clerk is required to log-on once only (providing only
their allocated user identification and password) in order to make use of both
the NBS and Existing Services. ,[NBR449]

Reference Data held locally in Outlets shall be used to carry out initial
validation of NB Tokens presented by Customers for the purpose of carrying
out Banking Transactions. [NBR240]

5.2.11 The NBS shall operate in a single currency and Banking Transactions shall
be recorded in that currency which, unless agreed otherwise under the
Change Control Procedure, shall be sterling. Fujitsu Services shall design the
NB System in a way which will not preclude a future development to
transact business in EUROs. However any such development shall be subject

to agreement through the Change Control Procedure. [NBR153]

5.2.12 I The NB Counter Application shall be designed and implemented to minimise
(within the constraints associated with performing Banking Transactions in
accordance with the CCD entitled “Network Banking Counter Dialogue
Activity & Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003) and the constraints imposed by the
Hardware and the development tools connected with the Software used to

processing elements particular to each variation of a Banking Transaction
involving data entry via screen or keyboard (and not using an NB Token
swipe). The CCD entitled “Generalised API for OPS/TMS” (TD/STD/004)
shall be updated to reflect the design characteristics and limitations of the NB

Counter Application as implemented. [NBR447]

5.2.13 Banking Transaction data that Fujitsu Services is responsible for shall be

recorded at source to ensure the integrity of that data. [NBR453]

5.2.14 The NB Counter Application shall provide a print preview facility

5.3. Transaction Flow

5.3.1

Banking Transactions shall follow the RACOC1 Model. [NBR038, NBR020]
Requests, Authorisations and CO Confirmations shall be processed using on-
line network communication links between the NB System and NBE.

[NBR038] The C1 Confirmations committed to the transaction stack shall be

replicated in the manner used for Existing Services. [NBR021]

The date/time stamp which shall be inserted in Requests shall be based on the
local time in the relevant Outlet, as present on Counter Equipment in that
Outlet. Such date/time stamps shall be carried through any dialogue with a
Bank (in Requests, Authorisations and Confirmations) and the Customer

receipts to ensure consistency. [NBR157]

The Request, Authorisation and Confirmations for each Banking Transaction
shall have a common identifier as defined in the CCD entitled “NBE
Horizon Application Interface Specification” (NB/IFS/008) which is unique
to that Banking Transaction. [NBR158, NBR536]

The C1 Confirmation shall form part of the associated EPOSS Transaction
such that a message shall be recorded at the Outlet at the end of a Customer
Session in addition to any CO Confirmation recorded at the Outlet during a

Customer Session. [NBR182]

C1 Confirmations shall be generated in all cases where a Request has been
generated. CO Confirmations will be generated and transmitted on-line to the
NBE if:

(a) a Banking Transaction is Declined at the Counter Position (unless a

Decline has been received from the NBE);

(b) a Banking Transaction is failed at the Counter Position; or
(c) there is system time-out either at the Counter Position or at the

Authorisation Agent such that an NBE Authorisation is not received

at the Counter Position for a corresponding Request.

Post Office shall be responsible for ensuring that the NBE supports receipt of
CO Confirmations sent to the NBE, and is able to generate C4 Confirmations

to the DRSH, as applicable.

5.4 Processes and Procedures

5.4.1

5.4.2

Fujitsu Services shall develop for agreement by Post Office (such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld) clear and unambiguous processes and
procedures for the operation of the NBS in Outlets. Fujitsu Services shall
document such agreement in a PPD (the “NB PPD”) and such other PPDs as
the parties agree to be appropriate. However, until such time as the NB PPD
is agreed by the parties, the processes and procedures to be followed at
Counter Positions shall be those set out in the CCD entitled “Network
Banking Counter Dialogue — Activity & Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003). The
parties intend that the content of the CCD entitled “Network Banking
Counter Dialogue — Activity & Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003) which needs to
be maintained after completion of development of the NBS shall be included
in such other CCDs as the parties agree to be appropriate and references in
this DocumentDocument to that CCD will be replaced as appropriate.
[NBR232, , NBR463, NBR026].

Fujitsu Services’s Help Desk and the NBSC processes for dealing with
enquiries from Outlets in connection with the NBS shall be enhanced by

NBR046, NBR047, NBR452] [NBR272]

5.4.3 In addition to its obligation in paragraph 5.4.2 of this DocumentDocument,
Post Office shall be responsible for providing a support desk service which
in respect of the NBE and its associated links to LINK and/or Banks, shall
act as a central point for obtaining information on the working state of the
NBE, and shall be responsible for notifying Fujitsu Services of any scheduled
interruptions. Such support desk service shall be the reporting point for
Fujitsu Services to log faults in systems and services outside the Post Office
Service Infrastructure and shall be responsible for progressing the resolution
of faults and for notifying Fujitsu Services when faults have been resolved.
A description of the service operation of such support desk shall be
documented in the Working Document entitled “ICL Pathway/Post Office
Interface Agreement for the NBSC and HSH Interface” (CS/IF'S/007).

5.4.4 Post Office shall ensure that all Users of the NBS in Outlets are trained in the
use of the NBS within their role and the procedures as set out in the NB
PPD. Each User shall be so trained prior to using the NBS, Post Office shall

be responsible for the production of the relevant training material.

5.4.5 To enable Post Office to design and develop training for NBSC personnel
Fujitsu Services shall provide in a timely manner such accurate information
about the NBS (beyond that which is contained in the NB PPD or other NBS
related CCDs) as may be reasonably requested by Post Office.

development, introduction and use (for the purposes of the NBS) of WebRiposte, the
NB Counter Application, new Post Office Reference Data objects, PIN Pads, and any

consequential changes to the counter environment to be made by Fujitsu Services.

5.6 Customer Sessions

5.6.1 Banking Transactions shall be carried out within a Customer Session.

5.6.2 Each Banking Transaction shall be separate from other Banking
Transactions, such that, for example, a deposit and a withdrawal by a
Customer shall be two separate Banking Transactions with no system

relationship between them. [NBR151]

5.6.3. The NBS shall ensure that Session Mobility is prohibited between the start of
a Banking Transaction and the time that the C1 Confirmation is written to

the transaction stack. ,[NBR070]

5.6.4 The NBS shall ensure that suspend session as described in Requirement 825
of Schedule A15 of this Codified Agreement is prohibited between the start
of a Banking Transaction (as described in paragraph 5.7.2(a) of this

apture

The NBS shall enable the Counter Clerk to capture certain details from the
Customer’s NB Token electronically or manually (as described in this
paragraph 5.7 below), select the Banking Transaction type (e.g. withdrawal)
required by the Customer and the details of that Banking Transaction (e.g.
withdraw £50). Banking Transactions shall be capable of being initiated only
when in the serve customer mode described in the CCD entitled
“Generalised API for OPS/TMS” (TD/STD/004).

For the purposes of data capture, the NBS shall operate in accordance with
the following principles and in compliance with the provisions applicable to
data capture set out in the CCD entitled “Network Banking Counter
Dialogue — Activity & Screen Flows” (NB/SPE/003):

(a) Initiation of Banking Transaction shall occur when a NB Token is
swiped through and recognised by the magnetic card reader, or
when the Counter Clerk manually selects a Banking Transaction
(e.g. because the NB Token swipe fails) using the keyboard or
touch screen. [NBR164] [NBR486]

(b) The IIN recorded on the NB Token in conjunction with the method
of data entry and whether or not a PIN Pad has been installed shall

determine the Banking Transactions which the NBS shall support

for that NB Token. [NBR006] A separate NB Token swipe will be

required:
(i) for each individual Banking Transaction; and
(ii) unless a PIN is determined to be invalid at the Outlet, if an

incorrect PIN is input to the PIN Pad.

(c) Once the NB Token details have been successfully captured and
validated in accordance with paragraph 5.8.1(a) of this
DocumentDocument, only the Banking Transactions available to the
Customer using that NB Token shall be selectable. The Counter
Clerk shall be prompted to select the Banking Transaction type
required and, in the case of cash deposits and cash withdrawals
(excluding Banking Transaction type “Withdraw Limit”) to enter

the appropriate financial amount in the prevailing currency.

(d) Following Banking Transaction initiation by manual selection, once
data entry is complete, the Banking Transaction data flow shall be
the same as for a Banking Transaction initiated by NB Token swipe,
with the NB Counter Application recording that initiation was

manual rather than automatic. [NBR536]

signature comparison). If Customer Verification is required the

method used shall be one of the following:

. Verification by the Counter Clerk comparing the
Customer’s signature with that on the NB Token, as the

only method

. Verification involving the Customer entering a PIN using
the PIN Pad, as the only method; or

. Verification by signature comparison as an alternative to
PIN entry, where the PIN Pad is not available by reason of
it not having been deployed in accordance with Schedule
G12

(a) Following successful NB Token Validation, a Banking Transaction

shall not proceed unless a network connection to the Data Centre
can be reasonably expected to be established to obtain on-line
Authorisation, as set out in the CCD entitled “Nenwork Banking
Counter Dialogue — Activity Screens & Flows” (NB/SPE/003).
Once that connection has been established, a Request shall be sent
to the NBE, and the Banking Transaction shall only proceed if a
positive Authorisation is received from the NBE and that Banking
Transaction is not Declined by the Counter Clerk. In the event that
the Counter Clerk Declines a Financial Transaction a CO
Confirmation shall be sent on-line to the NBE. [NBR010, NBR008,

(b) There shall be no local facility within an Outlet to override a Decline

response in an Authorisation. [NBR156]

(c) If the Authorisation is not for the same amount as the Request, the
Banking Transaction will be Declined by the NB System, except in
the case of a Request for a Banking Transaction type “Withdraw
Limit”, which will be permitted to proceed subject to the maximum

limit set by Reference Data.

(d) The MAAWP and the MCWP shall be:

(i) set as parameters in the NB System;

(ii) common for all Banks; and

(iii) configurable by Pathway Reference Data.

8.2 Reconciliation

8.2.1 This paragraph 8.2 describes the functionality for that part of the end-to-end
network banking reconciliation system required by Post Office which shall
be developed and operated by Fujitsu Services as part of the NBS. Such
part is referred to in this DocumentDocument as the “Reconciliation
System”. [NBR040]

8.2.2 Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall follow the reconciliation and incident
management procedures (applicable to each of them) for the investigation,
reporting and resolution of business incidents related to the NBS as set out
in the CCD entitled “Network Banking Reconciliation and Incident
Management” (NB/PRO/002). [NBR041, NBR500, NBR504]

Reconciliation of EPOSS Transactions to the Cash Account shall be dealt
with at summary level using the reconciliation functionality used for EPOSS
as an Existing Service [NBR454]. Such reconciliation functionality shall
ensure that all Banking Transactions (reflected in C1 Confirmations) are
included in the Cash Account, but shall not identify erroneous Cash Account
mappings which cause such Banking Transactions to be included in the
wrong line of the Cash Account, or non-Banking Transactions to be
included in Cash Account lines intended for Banking Transactions.
Reconciliation to the Cash Account described in this paragraph 8.2.4 will be
performed after the electronic Cash Account is produced, which will be an
indeterminate time after the Transactions have been settled (in the same

manner as for the Existing Services).

8.2.5 Branching data-flows

(a) The Reconciliation System shall enable reconciliation of Financial
Transactions arriving at the DRSH from the following three sources:

[NBR183, NBR212, NBR229]

(i) _ the Confirmation Agent (i.e. the Cl Confirmations received by

which reconciliation shall be reported by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with the CCD entitled “Network Banking End to End
Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

In the event that a CO Confirmation is sent to the NBE the relevant C1

Confirmation will indicate that a CO Confirmation has been generated.

(b) The Reconciliation System shall monitor the Financial Transactions

and report Banking Transaction states which are:

(i) intrinsically anomalous, in that their occurrence implies

malfunction in End to End Banking; or

(ii) anomalous in that an expected state has persisted for an
unexpected duration (e.g. where C1 Confirmations are
received from the Confirmation Agent and C4
Confirmations are received from the NBE but the
Confirmation from the TPS Host has not been received

after an abnormal delay),

identifying any such anomalous Banking Transaction states which

require human analysis for resolution. [NBR042, NBR228]

(c) The expected Banking Transaction states and Banking Transaction
states which constitute exceptions are those set out in the CCD
entitled “Network Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting”
(CS/SPE/011).

Transaction) (together, “Sensitive Data”) between the NB Counter

Application and the Service Boundary with the NBE. [NBR538]

(b) Once captured, Sensitive Data shall remain encrypted whilst it is
within the Post Office Service Infrastructure whether in transit or in
storage, save as necessary during the process of translation from
encryption under keys used within the Post Office Service
Infrastructure to encryption under keys in force at the relevant time
in the NBE. [NBR567] [NBR445] [NBR538]

(c) The technical security architecture shall differ between those

use of such digital signatures is in addition to the security provided
by the virtual private network deployed at the Outlet LAN and the
WAN between the Outlet and the Data Centres. [NBR445]

In the event of a duplicate Request being submitted to the Data
Centre, which has been copied from the original Request without
authority, the NBS software will identify the duplicate Request as
having been originated at the Data Centre. Only Requests that
originate at a Counter Position will be passed to the NBE.
Furthermore if by some other means a duplicate Request is
submitted, the Authorisation arising from a duplicate Request
would not be processed by the Counter Position as it could not be

paired with the originating Request. [NBR580]

10.6.4 The Data Centre/NBE Interface

(a)

All interface connections between the Data Centres and the NBE
shall in addition to other security measures specified in this
paragraph 10 be protected by a combination of firewalls and
