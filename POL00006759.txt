Further Issues Trial

The update on the Further Issues trial was NOTED.

Approach to Defences

The approach to the defences was NOTED.

Common Issues Judgment/Permission to Appeal Hearing

An overview of the hearing held on 12 November 2019 on leave to appeal the Common
Issue trial judgment was provided. The Judge had challenged our position on relational
contracts and duties of good faith. We were not confident that he supported POL’s view.

We thought we would lose the arguments on relational contracts and good faith and if so
would need to look at how we amended our contracts and operations.

Any Other Business

Al Cameron noted that the information being provided to the working group considering the
settlement for the Shareholder included a letter from him as the CFO setting out what could
be said at this stage about funding the settlement.

Date of Next Meeting:
10 December 2019.
