Subject: Final HNG-X report from Business Assurance

Attachments: HNG-x_DA_report_V4 issued_062409.ppt

Dear all

For your reference, here is the final HNG-X report from Business Assurance as at 1 June 2009. The updates since the
previous version were mainly to reflect Lester's feedback i.e.

« although I would agree that there is outstanding work on the schedule and the project management activities, I
would posit that actions are in progress on both of these so might question their still being flagged as "RED" when
this = "Management action is required (and not yet planned) to achieve Amber or Green status”

PW: Agreed, now that PO Ltd has accepted our plan

* we may want to acknowledge that we have met with POL and stated our position on bringing the date forward, so
the point in slide 20 about POL "squeezing" the pian has been addressed

PW: Agreed, slide updated to state that PO Ltd has accepted a March 2010 completion date is not achievable

e not sure how we can estimate a Total Cost to Complete @ £90.8m when there is no corresponding resource
estimate

PW: there is a corresponding resource estimate but you are right to flag we cannot have confidence in the

estimate because there are no corresponding detailed resourced MSP plans to show the right volumes of

resource are engaged. Also this TCC is before adjustment for other BA findings on the accuracy of the cost
to complete.

i have added a note in slide 22 to clarify the TCC is based on a detailed resource profile

* on “technical” I think there is still an issue around getting to a coherent Infrastructure Team structure, with a clear
management line, accepted accountability, and with better responsiveness to programme direction and progress
tracking/reporting needs (see Alan if this isn't clear}

PW: OK, new bullet created to reflect this concern on slide

e on "resource and communication", I think we should say something about keeping the war-room current and
relevant (1 think this is in hand, but these reports serve as both records and useful aids for future reviews)

PW: OK, new bullet created to reflect this suggestion

e« on “next steps” (and comms, morale, etc), I note that there has already been a “social event" which has helped
morale, but wondered whether it might not be a good idea to have some form of "programme re-start” event to
inform the wider team on the outcome of the last few weeks work, the improvements, the customer meetings, the
new plans, etc, etc. ~ it feels like it would reinforce in people's minds the attention this has had, and is getting, and
also help morale... I would be glad to attend if it helps... this is one for Andy I think

PW: good idea; I have made this a recommendation under “Account” since Andy is owner

I also agreed with Alan to down grade Project Management to Amber status given the number of management actions
taken on or around 1 June 09 to address findings.

An up-to-date picture of progress to implement recommendations will be collated by means of an Action Tracker (a
Powerpoint presentation does not serve this purpose well). Alan and I are scheduled to meet 3 July 09 to go through the
Action Tracker and to discuss more detailed responses on observations made by BA as part of this review on the Risk
Plan, Cost to Complete and Programme plan.

Kind regards
