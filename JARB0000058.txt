Interim report on Sub PostMasters investigations released today

At 6pm Monday 8 July 2013, James Arbuthnot, MP for North East Hampshire, will chair a
meeting considering an interim report into alleged problems Sub PostMasters throughout
the UK have encountered in the course of their work. He will be available for comment
following this closed meeting, which is expected to end at around 7pm.

A year ago, James and other MPs called on the Post Office to review these problems. As a
result, independent forensic accountants were appointed by the Post Office to look at a
number of individual cases. Second Sight, the accountants, have spent the past year
investigating a series of cases and the interim report will be released at 6pm tonight. Copies
will be available electronically on request (see below).

James will issue a further statement which will be released at 6pm.
