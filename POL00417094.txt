Mike,

If it is helpful re your meeting with Paula — please see below my draft response to BIS’ (Mike
Whitehead’s) direct question which I'll send over to them later this afternoon. Of course, BIS may well just
copy this in their letter back to the MP and we should bear in mind that it will become BIS’ quotable
position (they may, for example, come back and ask us about the nature of the clearance processes for
example).

Thanks

Mike

Mike,

In response to your query;

The system is based on a user log in, and all actions have to be endorsed by the user. POL
cannot remotely control a branches system. Any technical changes by Fujitsu that impact the
system have to go through clearance processes which would prevent any amendment to
existing data. The independent audit file is in place and can show all the system activity, down
to a single keystroke, in a particular branch.

Thanks
Mike

Re the Lord/Misra case, can we quote POL as categorically stating that there is no remote
access to the system or to individual branch Horizon terminals which would allow
accounting records to be manipulated as JFSA claims?
