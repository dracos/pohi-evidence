The interview was recommenced at 1055 hours. Ms Brennan was reminded that
she was re cautioned and that she was entitled to her legal rights as previously
stated.

1.50 SB OK Lisa, just as the other tape was coming to an end we were talking about the
pension and allowance discrepancies that have been found using B date stamps.
and that. While I

You were telling us that you’ve had
understand that you’ve been working under pressure, you gave us an
explanation then and you tell us you work quite quickly, is there any reason why
all these discrepancies are only appearing in pension and allowances when none
of your other work ..?..

LB No, I’ve got no explanation.

SB It amounts to close to £1000 in a few weeks, it’s getting a little bit more than

just being careless.

LB Yeh, it is.
SB Your balances haven’t reflected.
LB No.
SB Nobody’s come back to you.
LB No.
3.00 SB I don’t know how much we believe that everybody’s completely dishonest when

you’ ve overpaid them. You haven’t double keyed a number because the
numbers are different on the front on some examples.

LB Yeh. I haven’t got it, that’s all I can say. I haven’t got it.

SB There’s got to be a reason for it, you can’t just lose £1000...

LB What if I’m serving them and say I pay off the docket and I’m giving it
somewhere else short in the day and not knowing or .. I know I’m like clutching
at straws here.

AG So you’re making 2 mistakes you’re saying.

LB Several, I don’t know. I really don’t know.

SB They’re all mistakes all centred around the pensions, you’re not making
mistakes anywhere else. I mean it’s not... you’re duty’s not just about paying
out pension and allowances. You’ve got a number of transactions to perform
but all your mistakes ..and they’re very convenient, £100 or £200 with a
different number in the pensions.

LB I don’t know what to say, I haven’t got it, I haven’t got it. I don’t want to lose
my job if I’m crap or even if you think I’m robbing. I don’t want to lose my job.

4.00 SB Is there any reason why the Post Office should continue to employ you, giving
£1000 away in a few short weeks.

LB I don’t want to lose my job. I love my job. I thought I was good at my job.

SB We'll be making further checks, what if we find even more. When do we draw
the line between it being careless and deliberate?

LB I don’t know.

4.30 It was explained to Ms Brennan that this check was initiated by Chesterfield.
The week 41 check was read out to her from the 205Sa.
05.30 LB And that’s me?

AG No. And there’s another one, group 14, there’s 3 at £79.05 claimed and there’s
4 received. Now, that’s probably because what they’ve done there is they’ve
worded it the other way round. What they’ve said is there’s a docket for £79.05

that hasn’t been claimed but it’s a docket for £179.05 which is isn’t there which
has been claimed so in effect that probably is you if we have a look at that one.
So to carry on from that, week 41 found these errors so a further 4 weeks were
checked and the same sort of errors every week.

LB Yeh.

AG So then we’ve had a look at the pouch each week when it’s left here and there’s
a lot to go through and we’ve found further mistakes so we haven’t asked for
Lisahally to make any further checks in between yet because the matter’s quite
serious, we’re losing £100, £200, £300 a week, if I just check that one in fact,
because we have the listings here. Right, we’ve got week 41 which is there,
that’s 42. And they’re talking about a group 14. It’s that one there isn’t it?
Yeh. I’m just going to show you that one, Steve’s gonna give that an initial as
well and a number.

7.00 SB SB9. Again, date stamped as B. 4 at £79.05 claimed and the one that’s ..?.. one
at £179.05 claimed but not there.

AG There you go, that’s £100, exactly the same as the others. So if we just look at
these, the £100 there plus another £100 is £200 plus that one is £300, 4, 5, 6, 7,
that’s £700 in 5 weeks. Now if you have a look at that on an annual basis, £700,
it’s about £7,000. That’s more than you get paid. We can’t afford to keep you
can we?

LB Don’t sack me.

AG I’m not going to sack you but Jan Mullen is going to get a report and she’s ...
LB Well give me a refresher course or something, don’t sack me.

8.30 AG You don’t need a refresher course do you? To be honest with you I think
you’ve stolen it.

LB Thaven’t stolen it.

AG There’s no other explanation.

LB Thaven’t got it.

AG There’s no other explanation is there Lisa.

LB If it looks that way. I know that’s what you think.

9.00 AG Week after week after week there’s exactly the same mistakes, we’re now going
to go away and ask Lisahally to check the whole year, which is gonna take them
some time isn’t it because this office pays out £400,000 a week. It’s gonna take
a while to check all the dockets isn’t it? Well eventually they will come back
with a list of al the mistakes that have been made at this office and Pll guarantee
there’s £100, £200, £300 a week, week after week after week. Now what would
you say if we came back and said that, you know, we’re talking about £6000,
£7000. No amount of refresher course is going to teach you how to slow down
and press the right buttons. You’re doing it on all the other transactions. Your
giros, your giro in payments, your out payments, green giros, telephone bills.
You said you balanced almost to the penny.

LB I didn’t say that.

AG But then we have a look at the mistakes that are being made in the pensions and
that’s the only place where we found mistakes “cos that’s what the auditor’s just
done, is just check your stock. The only major discrepancies he’s found is the
ones in the pensions. Why do you think we’re here. Because we’ve got the
same pattern week after week after week.

LB I wouldn’t do that, I’m not that bloody soft.

AG T’ve heard that a few times before as well

SB But it hasn’t happened every day.

LB Yeh.

SB So if you worked 4 days, so if you’re to be believed that you’re telling us
because of the way you work and you’re working quickly we would have at
least 4 occasions each week if you’re working the same way each day.

11.00 AG You'd be making mistakes on your pensions all the while wouldn’t you. You’d
be £100 over or £100 short, £50 over because you’re working so quickly the

keyboard is so .. I don’t know, so difficult to operate when you’re paying a
pension out. It’s Not you then. You’ve not stolen any money?
LB Thaven’t got it, no.
Ms Brennan was informed that further checks would be made.

LB Thave not got it.

SB Do you think somebody else has got it then?

LB T dunno.

AG How can anyone else get it, they can’t key in figures can they?

LB No, no one else can take it out of my stock can they?

AG No one else uses your code do they?

LB No.

12.00 AG You say yourself that you stay with the same stock.

LB Yeh.

AG So you don’t leave the stock and say will you serve out of this one and I'll go
and have a cup of tea.

LB No, not like that, no.

AG So nobody else can be blamed for it, whether it’s genuine or whether it’s
deliberate, it’s you isn’t it?

LB Yeh, What can I say?

AG You said you didn’t do it. So we have to go away and write a report and see
what other people think. We don’t have any control over it, all we do is present
the evidence that we’ve got. There’s the evidence, we go away and do a few
more checks and we add that to the evidence that we’ve already got and then
someone makes a decision about you.

LB I love my job, I love doing this.

13.00 AG Well if I was pinching £200 or £300 a week I'd love it as well. Some subsidy to
your income that isn’t it, £200 a week plus £200 or £300 out of the drawer.

LB It would be wouldn’t it. I haven’t got it.
