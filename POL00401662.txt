Dear Keith,
Key Refresh — Clause 409
I am writing in response to your letter of 5'° September 2001.

By implementing the key refresh programme ICL Pathway is not introducing or changing any
products or services beyond those it is contractually obliged to provide. ICL Pathway is not,
therefore, in breach of its contractual obligations under Clause 409 of the Codified Agreement
and is not in Default of the Codified Agreement.

ICL Pathway is contractually obliged to refresh the keys as documented in the following
Contract Controlled Documents:
1. Security Functional Specification, RS/FSP/001, version 4.0, sections 8.3.2.5, 8.6.2.1
and 8.7.2.2.
2. CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD, CS/PRO/090, version 5.0,
section 4.7.

However, without prejudice to our stated position that ICL Pathway is not in Default, we are
prepared to treat your letter as a formal emergency request to temporarily suspend the key
refresh process currently underway, as a waiver of the usual contractual procedures required
to be followed in relation to such requests, and as a release from ICL Pathway’s contractual
obligations as set out in the above two CCDs. On that basis we will therefore be suspending
the key refresh process for any new keys as from tonight, 6” September.

We will progress, again without prejudice to our stated position that ICL Pathway is not in
Default, at an operational level the bullet points 2, 3 and 4 in your letter.

In order not to unduly delay the key refresh activity which we are contractually obliged to
perform, we will be reinstating the key refresh process with effect from Monday 17th
September unless by Friday 14” September we formally receive a Change Request from
yourselves requesting an acceptable change to our contractual obligations as documented in
the Contract Controlled Documents detailed above and stating the reasons why such a
change is required.

Yours sincerely

I GRO

Colin Lenton-Smith
