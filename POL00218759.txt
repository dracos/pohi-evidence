Attachments: Mediation Scheme (Dossier Highlights) final - 0950 - 140115.docx; ATTO0001.htm

Hi Swani
Pse can we send to SLT, with a note saying:

"It is possible that over the next few days there may be more media coverage over the Mediation Scheme we set up to
address the complaints of a small number of mainly former subpostmasters who believe the Horizon system is to blame
for losses in their branches.

"Given this, I thought that you might find the attached briefing note useful. It sets out our position on this issue and
what we have done in response to the complaints made (in addition of course to the branch support work being led by
Angela Van Den Bogerd).

“Please don't hesitate to contact me if you or your teams have any questions. And if you or your team would welcome a
briefing on the issue I would be happy to make time to do so."
