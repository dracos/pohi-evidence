Over the last couple of years we’ve had a couple of cases where EOD (which runs at 19:00) interferes with transactions
being written at the counter. If this happens, then there is an Event written to the NT event Log.

Given we only have a couple of instances, and a fix is as likely to cause further problems, then we're reluctant to make a
change to Horizon. However if Horizon data is being used in evidence for the prosecution of a Postmaster, it is probably
wise to also check to see if any such events were produced during the period in question. Is this something that can /
should be built into the ARQ process?

Regards

Gareth

Mik,
As discussed, I am still uneasy about this, but I agree that it is probably safer to leave things as they are.

I've discussed this with Mike and I'll mention this to Pete Sewell so that he can ensure that if we are providing
evidence for an ARQ that we also check on relevant events.

Regards

Gareth

Gareth,
OK - I understand that you don’t want this to be left un-fixed...

On the basis of the evidence that we have - there are 35 errors per week ( inside the 7-8pm Wednesday
window) and two in 35*52(weeks) = 1820 are known to have caused a discrepancy.

a) SSC staff spending lots of time monitoring these events for 1-2 per year is simply not cost-effective
b) Fixing the underlying problem of holding the "lock" for too long is feasible - from PC0152376 BUT

c) I would want some assurance that making this change to the live estate, to resolve 2 reported issues,
is NOT going to have a knock-on effect anywhere else...

I know that this is a difficult request - but I don’t like changing Horizon at this stage - and I would like to
be convinced that it is necessary, and that we wont make things worse..

Regards
Mik
