i. ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
1.1 PURPOSE

Schedule B7 (Authorities’ Agreement), paragraph 2.2, requires that
Pathway will supply BA/POCL with a Functional Specification (FS)
within one week of execution of the concract, for agreement by a target
date of 30 June 1996.

The fundamental purpose of this process is to establish an early level of
agreement between Pathway and the Authorities concerning a.more
detailed level of specification of functionality of the services to be
supplied, and by association, the underlying products from which such
services are derived, such that service and product development activities
can be undertaken with expedition and a high degree of confidence.

Schedule B7 paragraph 2.2 provides that changes to the FS definition
subsequent to agreement will be subject to a process of agreed change
control. The purpose of such change control is to facilitate necessary and
agreed change in a scrutinised and orderly manner, and is neither to
prevent such change nor implicitly vary any party’s obligations under the
contracts.

1.2 STRUCTURE AND SCOPE

This FS is organised in a manner which anticipates the Service
Architecture Design Document (SADD), which is required according to
Clause 401.1 in the Authorities’ Agreement. Pathway proposes that this
FS is developed under change control from its initial form such that it
becomes the SADD itself when satisfactorily complete and detailed and
that it is maintained thereafter as the SADD. In this manner there will be
a complete description and unbroken audit trail of changes proposed and
changes agreed. It is anticipated that the SADD will reach this state in
readiness for July 1977.

Figure 1-1 shows the structure required ot the SADD according to the
terms of the initial agreements.

Figure 1-1: Required structure of the Service Architecture Design
Document

The scope of the SADD, and hence the target scope of this document, is
therefore the Steady State Service Definition of the Pathway Service as a
whole, divided principally into the two Steady State Service Definitions
applicable to the two Contracting Authorities but with certain topics
which are logically for description at the Pathway Service level.

At early levels of revision of the FS only those parts necessary for the
immediate purpose will be populated. Over time it is anticipated that
material from the body of the document will be abstracted to appropriate
appendices.

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 form a concise description of the Service
Architecture.

CONTRACTUAL BASIS OF STRUCTURE

Where appropriate, the defining clause for an element is shown; for
example, A401.1, D405.2 or P405.4, denoting respectively the
Authorities’, DSS or POCL Agreement clause in question. Similarly the
schedules associated with each element are identified in brackets, in
italics where they are to be produced. Requirements and, in due course,

Solutions are denoted by Rnnn and Snnn respectively; for example,
R9S1.

The Card Management and Payment Authorisation Services embrace a
number of second order services; for example; the BPS Management
Information Service. These are grouped as common service elements
within the DSS Service Architecture.

1.2.2 PFI SERVICE LEVEL COMPONENTS

It is in the nature of the total service solution that the end-to-end aspects
of the Benefit Payment Service (BPS) are for specification at the top level
of Service Architecture. The Card Management and Payment
Authorisation Services (CMS, PAS), together with several supporting
services, are defined within the DSS Service Architecture, while the
Benefit Encashment Service (BES) forms part of the POCL Service
Architecture. ;

In addition certain aspects of the security architecture are for
specification at the top level of the Pathway Service Architecture.

In order to assist understanding of the operation of the services, this
document provides information about the products on which they are to
be based. -Pathway reserves the right to modify these underlying systems
in order to meet its obligations under the agreements.

PFI SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
PFI SERVICE INFORMATION FLOWS

Figure 2-1 shows the Pathway-centric view of the information flows
between Pathway and entities external to Pathway. Many of the
information flows are program-based, but some are paper- or voice-
based. For example:

A customer ;aying a bill is served at the counter. Pathway inpayment
services will effect the logical. completion of the information flow by
notifying both the POCL client and the POCL transaction accounting
system TIP.

A customer collecting his benefit will be able to do so because CAPS has
sent a payment authorisation which Pathway has made visible to the BES
application. Pathway will subsequently complete the logical information
flow by notifying CAPS that it was paid and notifying TIP that the post
office made the payment.

Similarly, a benefit customer who has lost his benefit card will report this
by telephoning the Pathway CMS help desk. The CMS help desk will
complete the logical information flow by arranging for a Pick Up Notice
(PUN) to be sent by Royal Mail to his home address, and a replacement

- card to be sént by Royal Mail to his nominated post office.

2.2 PATHWAY SERVICE COMPONENT RELATIONSHIPS

Figure 2-2 shows how the total Pathway service is divided into its major
service elements and the relationships between them and the program-
based entities within DSS and POCL.

It also shows how the principal program information flows referred to
above are mapped between the service elements. For example:

The benefit encashment flow starts at CAPS with a payment
authorisation which PAS transfers to TMS and BES, having taken
information about the customers who can collect it from CMS. BES and
TMS then control the payment process. The post office accounting
routines will similarly notify TIP of the payment.

The bill payment flow proceeds from the 4?$ or EPOSS service to the
recipient POCL client. The post office accounting routines within
EPOSS will notify POCL’s TIP system of the transaction.

2.3 BPS END-TO-END SERVICE DEFINITION
2.3.1 PFI RELATIONSHIPS

The Benefit Payment Service (BPS) is defined as the end-to-end service
provided by the combination of Benefit Encashment Service (BES),
Payment Authorisation Service (PAS) and Card Management Service
(CMS) (Schedule A1). As such it is an abstraction comprising a
combination of services which themselves are part of both the. DSS and
POCL Service Architectures.

The BPS is unique within the PFI architecture: the DSS is the only POCL
client whose host processing falls within the procurement boundary as
shown in Figure 2-3.

2.3.2 A WALK-THROUGH OF BPS

The physical and logical mapping of the Benefit Payment Service is
shown below in Figure 2-4. In essence BPS uses the DSS Service
Architecture for back-end processing and the Transaction Management
Service (TMS), the Office Platforii Service (OPS), the EPOS Service
(EPOSS) and BES elements of the POCL Service Architecture as its route
to customers.

2.3.2.1 DSS SERVICE ARCHITECTURE

Payment authorisation and card traffic originates and terminates at DSS
mainframe systems running the CAPS applications. These CAPS servers
a.e located on four sites, Washington, Livingston, Norcross and
Swindon.

The CAPS Access Service (CAS) is implemented in secure partitions
within the DSS mainframes themselves. It handles transfers of payment
authorisation and card management traffic in both directions between
the CAPS application and the Pathway central servers located at two
sites; Bootle and Wigan. Pathway assumes responsibility for the traffic
from the CAPS-CAS interface.

Pathway

The CAS performs basic checking and record and data compression
functions.

Transfers over the high speed wide area network connections between
DSS and Pathway are encrypted.

PAS and CMS are logically separable services implemented in ORACLE7
on Sequent Dynix platforms. At this level also are the linked Help Desk
telephony platforms.

2.3.2.2 POCL SERVICE ARCHITECTURE

The Correspondence Servers are implemented as four groups of large
servers, two groups per Pathway central site with a number of servers per
group. Interaction between the Central Services layer and the
Correspondence Server layer is through a PAS/CMS Agent program
which acts as a real file manager. This manages the transfer of data
between the ORACLE7 and Riposte messaging system reformatting data

as required.

The Wholesale Broker program allows Agent applications to treat the
community of Correspondence Servers as a single entity by routing
transactions to and from correspondence servers. Agent programs
include those handling the traffic with POCL and POCL Client systems.

DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: — 3.0
Date: 22/5/96

This level also supports post office to post office transactions, in
particular those required for “foreign payment” processing.

The Riposte messaging system runs on both the Correspondence Server
and Post Office layer platforms handling the communications traffic
across the ISDN connections in co-operation with Windows NT.
Riposte acts as a distributed database, maintaining replicas of records
between the central correspondence servers and the post office counter
systems.

Benefit authorisation transfers down to the counters are protected over
this wide area connection by digital signature techniques.

Riposte supports application oriented interfaces to the EPUSS

application, and in turn to the several counter service applications of
which BES is one.

Sensitive benefit data stored on hard disk \irhin the post office counters
is protected by encryption.

2.4 PFI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
2.4.1 SECURITY STRATEGY

2.5.1 CONTINGENCY

Pathway will develop and agree with DSS and POCL the contingency
arrangements that will be used to ensure continuity of service, as
described in R830:

1. Pathway will ensure that all services are supported by Contingency
Plans including Fallback Transactions that will minimise or negate the

impact of failure in any part of the services.

2. Pathway will ensure that the Contingency Plans for each service are
compatible with an overall Service Continuity framework.

The Contingency Plans will be based on Impact and Risk Assessments
agreed between Pathway and DSS and POCL

3. Ownership of all contingency actions will be identified.

4. The Contingency Plans will include activation procedures and time
periods within which the contingency measures will be activated.

2.6 FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT
2.6.1 INTRODUCTION

The Fraud Risk Management (FRM) service will deal with the
identification, monitoring and management of encashment fraud within
the Benefit Payment Service and the POCL Strategic Infrastructure.

Pathway’s policy is to identify and minimise the risk of fraud within the
Pathway system. However, Pathway recognises that the threat of fraud
incidents exists inside and outside Pathway’s responsibility.

Pathway’s strategy is to identify high risk situations and adapt systems as
necessary to:

e Minimise fraud exposure within the Puwuway solution
© Provide an information service to DSS and POCL to aid fraud
investigation and to minimise fraud.

The information provided will be:
e Trend and pattern analysis for DSS to aid identification of fraud risk

and appropriate mitigation actions
e Information to aid in the investigation of actual fraud incidents

developing improved procedures

e Analysis of incidents and trends within Pathway’s immediate control,
to improve its systems

2.6.2 FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICE ELEMENTS

The FRM service will comprise two core elements:

e A management information system, to analyse trends, fraud losses and
to profile data patterns. This is part of Pathway’s own MIS systems.

e A fraud monitoring system, to profile abnormal or irregular
encashment patterns and identify potential fraud incidents, as required
by R895, see below

2.6.2.1 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

The MIS will provide both standard and ad hoc reports. Key areas of

3.1 DSS STEADY STATE SERVICE
3.1.1 CARD MANAGEMENT SERVICE
3.1.1.1 INTRODUCTION

This section describes the processes within the Card Management
Service (CMS) and how BA, BA Customers and POCL will use the
service as part of the end-to-end Benefit Payment Service (BPS). The
CMS is required to be available 24 hours a day every day of the year.

The CMS is a central computer service that will store details of all BA
customers who are entitled to a benefit payment card. It will maintain a
cardholder record for each customer, with an ‘greed amount of
historical information regarding card activizy, accessible for reporting
and enquiries.

The CMS manages the production; automatic renewal, issue and
distribution of magnetic cards, Pick Up Notices (PUNs) and Temporary
Tokens. CMS also manages enquiries from the CMS Help Desk for
reports of lost, stolen and damaged cards.

Cards and Temporary Tokens remain the property of the Secretary of
State and can only be used for bencfit payment unless otherwise
authorised by the Secretary of State.

Pathway’s strategy for. the migration from magnetic cards to integrated
circuit cards is not described at this level of specification.

CMS provides the Pathway Payment Authorisation System (PAS) with
cardholder details required for payment processing including cardholder
verification details.

Within this document each major aspect of the service is presented from
the view point of BA, POCL and the Customer.

3.1.1.2 INTRODUCE NEW CARD HOLDER

- On receipt of instructions from the BA, via the CAPS Access Service — =:
(CAS), CMS will add new cardholders to the system. The BA will
ensure that correct postal addresses including post codes are used.

The system will'validate the new cardholder details received from BA for
format in line with the BA/POCL Service Interface Definition. All valid
records will be added to the CMS. Cardholder records that fail
validation will be returned to BA via CAPS for resolution.

3.1.1.3 MAINTAIN CARDHOLDER DETAILS

On receipt of instruction from the BA via CAS, CMS will apply
amendments to personal details. As a result of these changes it may be
necessary to issue a new card.

A new card will automatically be issued where a cardholder has a change
of name, for example, the change from maiden name to married name,

change of nominzted post office, or English to Welsh and vice-versa.

CMS will forward changes to PAS for use during payment processing.

RECORD CARD HOLDER NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

The objective of this process is to record that a card holder is no longer
eligible for benefit and will not require 2 card in the future.

On receipt of an instruction from CAPS, CMS will validate notifications
and return failures to CAPS.

Accepted notifications will be applied within CMS. Where a current
card exists and is not expired CMS will prevent its use for future
encashment. The card will be designated ‘dormant’ and stopped on the
nominal expiry date unless new personal details are received
beforehand. In this case the card will be reactivated.

THE CARD

The card design will be subject to approval from the Secretary of State.
The design will allow for different liveries, will conform to financial
standards and include a number of security features, e.g. hologram and
indent printing. The card will include a signature stripe and will be
embossed with the following information:

. CARD PRODUCTION

Pathway will operate an ‘Urgent’ and ‘Nc.i Urgent’ timetable for card
production and distribution which is:

e Urgent orders:

new cardholder

replace lost or stolen card

replace damaged card

change in personal details
reinstated customer, no active card

ee RK

e¢ Non-urgent orders:

* reissue card on expiry

CARD PERSONALISATION AND DELIVERY TO NOMINATED
POST OFFICE.

Pathway will generate personalised magnetic cards to the appropriate
design as specified by BA. On completion of the card production
process, cards will be batched by customer name within post office.
Royal Mail will ensure secure delivery into post offices where their
receipt is recorded on CMS and validated against expected arrival.

In the event that the Royal Mail service is disrupted by a postal dispute
or other unforseen circumstances, Pathway will employ alternative
carriers.

For the majority of cards, Pathway propose to use sealed cardboard
trays with lids for the delivery of cards to post offices. However, where
a batch for a post office contains fewer thai. cen cards, the cards will be
delivered in a secure envelope.

Each batch will contain the post office address, the batch ID and number
of cards in bar code format. This format will be recognised by CMS
when booked on to the system at the post office.

Pathway will maintain within CMS an audit trail of all cards produced
from initial request via CAPS, or the help desk, through to delivery and
pick up by the customer at the post office counter.

3.1.1.10.1. CARD LIVERIES/ LOGOS

The Pathway solution will allow for mult‘ple card liveries within the
system. However, a customer will have only one active card type at any
one time.

3.1.1.10.2 =POCL VIEW POINT

Cards will be delivered to the post office by Royal Mail. The post office
will be responsible for the receipt, recording within CMS and secure
storage of cards prior to issuing the card to the customer on pick up.

The supporting clerical activity and sequence of events is fully described
in the Counter Procedures.

3.1.1.11 THE PUN

The PUN will contain the cardholder’s name and nominated address.

The PUN will contain a bar code which includes a Card Activation ~
Number (CAN) which is matched against system held information

during card activation.

The PUN will contain pre printed information for the customer in
English, Welsh and a number of other languages agreed with the BA.

[DN: Agreement on PUN languages required.]

The PUN communication may also contain information notices and the
like.

[DN: Discussion and organisation of such collateral material is required
from time to time]

Pathway will produce a PUN under the following circumstances:

e all new cardholders

¢ collection of » replacement card having reported to the CMS help
desk that his existing card is lost or, stolen, damaged or his personal
details have changed.

e reinstated cardholder, no active card

» In all circumstances where a PUN is produced the card cannot be
collected without the PUN being presented.

Where a customer fails to collect the card within 40 days a second
reminder PUN will be sent.

Where a customer has lost, not received, or reported his PUN stolen and
the card is available for collection, there are two scenarios to be
considered:

The PUN in question is the first PUN. In this case the customer will
receive a PUN reminder which can be used to collect the card. The
reminder will have a new CAN.

The PUN in question is the second, the custon.er not having received
the first one either. In this case the custom 2r should call the CMS help
desk which will reorder a third PUN, with anew CAN. On production
of a second PUN reminder, Pathway proposes that details of the
transaction are sent to BA via CAPS.

(DN: Process to be agreed.]

3.1.1.12 DELIVERY OF PUN TO CARDHOLDER’S NOMINATED ADDRESS

Pathway will inform the authorised person that the card is available for
collection by issuing a PUN to the cardholder’s nominated address via
the Royal Mail. In the event of disruption, a similar contingency to that
described above will be invoked.

The delivery of the PUN will be synchronised with the delivery of the
card to the cardholder’s nominated post office, to ensure that the card is
available at the post office for collection by the customer.

The PUN will be accompanied by a mandate form to allow a customer
to use an agent without having to cc!lect one from the post office

3.1.1.12.1 BA VIEWPOINT
Where a cardholder has no fixed abode, the cardholder’s PUN can be
delivered to the person’s local Benefit Office as per information
provided by BA to Pathway via CAPS,

abode. Procedures for subsequent changes to be agreed with Pathway]

3.1.1.12.2  CUSTOMER’S VIEW POINT

The customer will collect his card from his nominated post office. In
order to collect his card, the customer will present either the PUN or his
old card (when current card expires), together with an independent
means of identification.

Pathway will produce a PUN for the following Pick Up types:

e all new cardholders
e collection of a replacement card having reported to the CMS help
desk that his existing card is lost or, stolen, damaged or his personal
details have changed. - a
e on the third consecutive keyed entry of a damaged cards details
e reinstated cardholder, no active card

The PUN will contain personal details including, name, NINO, address
and security information which will be matched on the system during
the card activation process.

In addition to the personal details contained on the PUN, Pathway will
pre-print supporting information in English, Welsh and an agreed
number of other languages.

[DN: Agreement on PUN collateral languages required.]
Where a PUN is produced as defined above, the customer will not be
allowed to collect his card without its presentation at the post office. If

for any reason the customer loses his PUN, he will need to request a
replacement via the CMS Help desk.

The PUN will contain the cardholder’s name, nominated address and
NINO. To improve security and minimise the risk of fraud, the PUN
will be encoded with a Card Activation Number (CAN). This CAN will
be matched against system held data during card activation. The PUN
will contain pre-printed information in English, English and Welsh, and
English and other minority languages.

Pathway will generate a PUN under the following circumstances:

e all new cardholders,

e card reported lost or stolen to the CMS Help Desk, or his personal
details have changed.

e on the third consecutive keyed entry of a damaged card’s details

e reinstated cardholder, no active card

COLLECT AND ACTIVATE CARD

The object of this process is to record autliorised collection of the card
and to activate that card to enable subsequent collection of payments.
The process also ensures that outstanding payments are allocated to the
newly-issued card and no longer collectable by presentation of the old
card. This is to ensure continuity of payment collection.

Customers will present the PUN at their nominated post office with an
independent means of identification during card pick up.

The supporting clerical activity and sequence of events is described in
the Counter Procedures in Section 4.

CUSTOMER UNABLE TO COLLECT CARD

Pathway will handle this eventuality according to whether the customer:

e is replacing a card routinely
e is replacing a card following card loss or damage
e is newly enrolled into the benefit system

REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CARD ON CARD EXPIRY

When a card is within six weeks of its expiry date, Pathway will
automatically generate.a replacement card which will be available for
pick up at the cardholder’s nominated post office on the presentation of
the card which is due to expire.

The damaged card will continue to be used until the replacement card is
available.

3.1.1.18 REPLACE DAMAGED CARD

When a card has been reported damaged to the CMS help desk by the
customer, a replacement card and PUN will be generated. The card will
be delivered to the customer’s nominated post office, ready for
collection on the presentation of his PUN.

The damaged card will continue to be used until the replacement card is
available. The damaged card will be required to be presented with the
PUN when the new card is collected. Te

3.11.19 REPLACE LOST OR STOLEN CARD

When a card has been reported lost or stolen to the CMS help desk, an
urgent card order and PUN will be produced The card will be delivered
to the customer’s nominated post office, whilst the PUN will be
delivered to the customer’s address supplied by BA.

3.1.1.20 REPORT NON-ARRIVAL OF BATCH OF CARDS AT POST OFFICE

The object of this process is to detect non-arrival of a batch of cards at
the post office within the designated time period (based upon _
anticipated production and delivery schedules) and to instigate action.

Whenever a card order is placed within the CMS, the card production
and delivery status is monitored through to recorded receipt at the post
office.

The system will automatically and immediately suspend any card not
received at the nominated post office within three working days after
expected arrival.

CMS will create an exception record for presentation to the CMS Help
Desk so that the late delivery can be investigated. The exception event
reporting will be repeated each day until the batch is booked in, the
batch is cancelled, or the allowed margin for delivery has expired.

The CMS Help Desk will investigate and either extend the margin or
cancel the batch of cards. Cancelling the batch will automatically
include the setting of each individual card status to lost. The help desk
may reorder the batch of cards after investigation.

3.1.1.21 INHIBIT CARD ON FAILURE TO COLLECT

The purpose of this process is to inhibit ca: ds not collected by the
customer within a predetermined number of days (currently 56) from
the date of issue.

BA will define the period within which a customer must collect a card.
Failure to collect will lead to cancellation of the card and.an exception
report to BA.

The supporting clerical process is described in the Counter Procedures.

CMS card status will be available to PAS for use in payment processing
such as enrichment.

CMS will report non-collection to BA via CAPS.

3.1.2 CARD MANAGEMENT SERVICE HELP DESK
3.1.2.1 INTRODUCTION

The CMS help desk will provide a single point of contact for all
enquiries relating to benefit cards and PUNs. It provides separate
telephone numbers for BA, POCL staff ana for BA customers. In
accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993 a service (including
separate telephone line) will be provided to Welsh speaking customers.

The majority of calls to the CMS help desk will be from members of the
public reporting lost, stolen or damaged benefit cards and PUNs,
although authorised BA and POCL staff will also require access to the

help desk in certain situations. See Appendix B for a full list of enquiry
types

As an integral part of the authentication process for the validation of
callers, BA and POCL staff calling the help desk will be asked to answer
verification question(s). This security measure will ensure that only those
members of staff nominated by the authorities will have access to the
help desk services.

Although the NINO provided by the customer will be the key by which
the help desk will access the card and payment management systems, the
caller will be.asked a further verification question, to ensure he is the
authorised cardholder.

Pathway’s internal access to the Card Management Service via the help
desk will be strictly controlled. Only staff with the appropriate security
level will have access to, and have the authority to amend the status of
card and PUN details. All status changes will be subject to a complete
audit trail.

3.1.2.2.1 CALLER VERIFICATION

On contacting the help desk the customer will be‘asked to provide his
National Insurance Number (NINO) or Primary Account Number
(PAN). This will enable the help desk operator to access the customer’s -
details. To verify the caller is genuine, the help desk will ask the
customer verification question(s) from information contained within his
personal details. Only on successful clearance of this validation process
the help desk will act on instructions from the customer.

If the customer cannot provide either the NINO or PAN, the help desk
will have a search facility to access customer details using surname and
date of birth, or surname and first line of address and post code.

If when the customer details are accessed, the National Sensitivity
Indicator is displayed, the call will be dealt with at the appropriate level.

[DN need ta confirm procedures. Remova! .f NSI from CAPS records is

further benefit encashments against that card. At the same time, the
CMS help desk arranges the issue of a replacement card and PUN.

There may be a reason why an automatic reorder of a card may not be
desirable at the time the loss/theft is recorded. The order may need to
be delayed pending the outcome of investigations by BA and the
replacement card and PUN ordered at a later date.

(DN: Process for such supervision of reorder to be discussed and agreed.]

3.1.2.2.3 REPORT DAMAGED CARD

The help desk will register the card as damaged on the system. There is
no requirement to inhibit use of the card, pending collection of its
replacement.

The help desk will order a replacement card for collection when the
customer next attends his nominated post office. The damaged card will
be handed in on collection of the new card.

3.1.2.2.4 REPORT NON RECEIPT OF PUN

Where the customer cannot present his PUN at the counter to collect his
benefit card because of non receipt or loss he will be referred to his

benefit office. - a

3.1.2.2.5 REPORT CARD NOT AVAILABLE AT NOMINATED POST OFFICE

Where the customer reports his card was not available for collection at
the post office on presentation of his PUN, the help desk will check the
card status on CMS and where necessary cancel the original card and
order a new card and PUN for the customer. If the customer has
payments due, he will be referred to his benefit office for a temporary
token.

3.1.2.2.6 REPORT CARD/PUN FOUND PREVIOUSLY REPORTED LOST

3.1.3 TEMPORARY TOKEN PRODUCTION AND ISSUE

3.1.3.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of the BPS, there is a requirement to provide a means whereby a
customer without a valid card can still collect his benefits at the post
office counter.
Pathway will use a Temporary Token, to allow the beneficiary to make a
single encashment at a particular post office. This token will be a ‘one
stop token’, retained and filed locally by the post office for later despatch
to a secure storage location.
This section of the document describes how Pathway propose to manage
the production, distribution, allocation and usage of temporary tokens.
[DN: Confirm the need for Welsh/English tokens.]

3.1.3.2 THE TEMPORARY TOKEN

Pathway will produce books of one stop paper tokens (number of tokens
per book to be defined). Each token within the book will be of the same
size as the encashment receipt as the two items are associated, this will
ease storage and retrieval should this be required at a later date.

Each token will have a unique identification number within each BA
office printed during the production process on the face of the token.
Each token will include pre printed declaration statement.

(DN: Declaration texts to be agreed.]

3.1.3.3 ORDER A BATCH OF TEMPORARY TOKENS.

Each BA Office will maintain a stock of Temporary Tokens. Pathway
will accept orders for stocks of Temporary Tokens from a CAPS
program interface or exceptionally via CAPS personnel contacting the
CMS Help Desk.

Pathway will ensure the delivery of a batch of tokens within seven
working days from the order being placed.

3.1.3.3.1 MAINTAIN REFERENCE DATA

CMS will hold details of each Benefit Office as a ‘customer’ requiring an
on-going supply of temporary tokens. Pathway will establish and
maintain:

e Benefits Agency address ( for delivery of tokens )
© Benefit Office token number range
e Token order status:

« ordered

3.1.3.4 PRODUCE AND DESPATCH TEMPORARY TOKENS

Pathway will produce and deliver token orders as received by the CMS
help desk to the appropriate BA office. Each token will have a unique
ID which will be incremented from the I.st number used in the allocated
range for a given BA office.

Token orders will be distributed via the Royal Mail to each BA office.
Tokens not reported at being received in the office within the agreed
period (3 days) will be investigated and invalidated if appropriate.

Pathway will employ alternative carriers in the event of Royal Mail
service disruption, as above.

3.1.3.4.1 BA VIEW POINT

Each BA office will need to maintain a stock of temporary tokens. The
BA office will be responsible for placing orders via CAPS to replenish
stocks.

BA will need to:

¢ maintain a minimum of seven days stock. of temporary tokens

e place request via CAPS for replenishment orders ensuring adequate
stocks exist tO ensure customer service is maintained

e sign for the receipt of a batch of tokens ftom Pathway, ensuring ‘next

book’ carries on from ‘last received’

reconcile the number received with the number ordered

resolve any anomalies via CMS help desk

advise CMS of receipt via CAPS

allocate temporary tokens to customers via CAPS (to PAS)

3.1.3.5 TOKEN ASSIGNMENT

Temporary Tokens will be assigned only by the local BA office to
customers known to CMS. This can occur where payments are
outstanding within PAS but the customer has no card for benefit
encashment (card in production).

© encash the payment at the particular post office within seven days of
assignment
e hand in the token on collection of payment(s)
© provide additional identification at the post office counter
3.1.3.6 PAYMENT PROCESSING
Pathway will ensure that the payment or payments associated with the
token are available for collection within 30 minutes of notice of
assignment.
[DN: Confirm that the requirement is 30 minutes, 90 minutes in some
references.]
Pathway will also associate all subsequent payments with the token
-until:
e the token is used,
e token expires,
e token is stopped,
e anew card is activated.
CMS will treat the token as a card issue against the given card holder.
CMS will advise PAS of token assignment as a cardholder amendment so
that outstanding or future payments can be assigned to the token.
A token expiry date will be calculated as date of assignment plus the
value of a system parameter, initial value seven days.

PAS will notify CMS when the token is used for encashment purposes.
The temporary token will only be usable for a single encashment at a
nominated post office.

CMS will maintain a token status whilst the token is valid and will place
a token status ‘stopped - used for encashment’ on notification of
encashment.

ISSUE TEMPORARY TOKEN PAYMENT

This process handles emergency authorised payments from CAPS for
customers without a valid card. Valid authorisations are logged and
distributed to the particular post office to await collection and CMS is
notified of issue of the token.

[DN: Emergency payments using a temporary token will need to be
distinguished within the payment authorisa.ion record provided by
CAPS.]

(The payment authorisation will be accessed via the temporary token ID.
Other payments besides the emergency payment will be accessed via the
associated NINO. An emergency payment may be not be present in the
record: in this case the temporary token method is being used to effect
encashment of pre-existing ordinary payments only.) -

A temporary token will be issued only to a beneficiary or appointee. A

customer must have a temporary token as his current form of card and it
must be active and available.

INVALIDATE TOKEN ON EXPIRY

CMS will identify temporary tokens where there has been no
encashment and the expiry date has been reached. The token status will
be updated to ‘stopped - expired’. The token will no longer be valid for
payment encashment.

CANCEL A TOKEN/ BATCH OF TOKENS

CMS will stop a batch of tokens .

3.1.4 PAYMENT AUTHORISATION SERVICE

3.1.4.1 INTRODUCTION

This section describes the services provided by the Payment
Authorisation System (PAS) and how BA and BA Customers and POCL
counter staff will use the service as part of the end to end Benefit
Payment Service (BPS).

PAS is required to be normally available for bulk data transfer to and
from CAS/CAPS for 24 hours a day every day of the year. The on-line
services supported by the help desk will be available to support the BA
and POCL normal business hours (0800 to 1800 Monday-Friday, 0800
to 1300 Saturday, Bank Holidays excepted.)

PAS provides facilities for the management of beneficiaries and
payments authorised for collection by beneficiaries or their
representatives. The key interfaces for PAS ate:

e CAPS Access Service (CAS) to PAS for adding, modifying or
cancelling beneficiary and payment details

e PAS to CAS for notification of payment collection, operational
reporting including exception reporting and management
information

e PAS to POCL Infrastructure Services to distribute payments and
collect encashment details

e PAS to PAS help desk to provide interactive information to Benefits
Agency and post office counter staff

e PAS to the Card Management System (CMS) for ensuring payments
to be collected are available to the appropriate cardholders and their
cards.

existing beneficiary details by the values from the CAPS record.
Beneficiary data will be copied directly from the CAPS record.

[DN: Discussion and agreement required on the archive treatment of
superseded data.]

The foreign payment details for the beneficiary will not be modified.
Beneficiary amendment details will be applied to any outstanding
authorised payments as well as being applicable to new authorised
payments.

BENEFICIARY NO LONGER ENTITLED TO BENEFIT

A beneficiary no longer entitled to benefit will be validated to ensure he
is. currently a known beneficiary and currently of interest” = ~~~

The beneficiary may have uncollected payments. These can still be
collected or expire as normal.

In the event the beneficiary becomes ‘of interest’ again they will be
deemed a new beneficiary.

Any card assigned to the beneficiary will not be collected as a result of a
notification of end of interest

AMENDMENT TO CARDHOLDER DETAILS

PAS will ensure that any outstanding payments that may be collected by
a cardholder will be aligned with the latest cardholder data. Cardholder
changes which will be applicable for payment collection are:

Authorised Payments will have additional validation on:

beneficiary NINO to ensure the beneficiary is known and is flagged
‘currently of interest’

payment ID to ensure no duplication for the authorised payment
the nominated post office indicated is known and is in service
when the beneficiary is also a payee that the beneficiary NINO is a
known, currently of interest cardholder

when the beneficiary is not a payee that .he first payee NINO is a
known, currently of interest cardholder

Additional checks will be carried out:

Other payee NINOs will be validated to ensure they are known,
currently of-interest cardholders. Any mismatch will generate
warning exceptions for reporting via CAS showing that the
authorised payment is accepted (subject to other validation) and the
payee group rejected.

To ensure.at least one payee has a card which can be used to actually
collect the payment. This includes payees with current usable cards,
payees with cards in production and payees with suspended cards.
Failure to meet this criteria will result in an exception reported to
CAPS. The authotised payment is accepted (subject to other.
validation), collection will require a payee to have a card issued
and/or unsuspended. The payment may be cash and/or tokens and
only encashed once.

[DN -The rules for administering signing agents/permanent group agents,
and their agents, are to be agreed.]

3.1.4.6 PENDING PAYMENT STOPS

Valid authorised payments are checked against outstanding payment
stops. Where a matching payment ID is found CAS is notified for

PAS will record payable authorised payments and forward the payment
records enriched with payee details to the POCL Infrastructure Services.

3.1.4.8 RAPID PAYMENTS

The difference in the service for normal and rapid payments is in the
timing for delivery of rapid payments. Rapid payments will be received
from CAPS via CAS up to 2200 on the evening before the day they are
encashable. Within PAS rapid payments will have no greater priority
than normal payments encashable on the same day.

[DN: There is inconsistent use of the term “urgent”, to be resolved.]

3.1.4.9 EMERGENCY PAYMENT - ~

Emergency payments vary from a normal issue due to the time allowed
for the payment being available for collection. Emergency payments
will be received from CAPS via CAS on the day they are encashable.
Emergency payments will be available for encashment within 30 minutes
of receipt.

3.1.4.10 CONTINGENCY PAYMENT

As contingency against the loss of CAPS, PAS can automatically generate
payments and provide details of encashments generated as exception
reporting for BA to action.

BA will advise PAS to invoke contingency payment processing. This
includes provision of start value payment, identifiers for generation of
contingency payments and notification of the contingency date for
payment.

The contingency payment will be based upon the last authorised
payment details. A new authorised payment will be created, this will use

Any complementary service functions including stops, enquiries and
further contingency payment generation can be applied.

(DN: The process for both initiating this contingency activity and for
reporting payment, expiry and stops, needs to be agreed.]

3.1.4.11 ENCASHED PAYMENT

3.1.4.11.1. CARD ALERTS ON MONITOR USAGE

Any usage or attempted usage of cards with monitor usage set for them,

PAYMENT AUTHORISATION SERVICE (PAS) HELP DESK

INTRODUCTION

The Payment Authorisation Service (PAS) receives payment entitlement
and related information from CAPS via CAS.

The PAS help desk, will provide BA/POCL with a single point of contact
for dealing with all enquiries relating to the entitlement, status of
automated benefit payments. The PAS help desk will provide separate
telephone numbers for BA and POCL counter staff. The help desk will
not deal with payment enquiries from BA customers. POCL counter staff
calling the help desk to enquire upon payment entitlements will be asked
to refer their customer to theif local BA office. See Appendix B for a full
list of enquiry types. ‘

As an integral part of the authentication précess for the validation of
callers, BA and POCL staff calling the help desk will be asked to answer
verification question(s). This security measure will ensure that only those
members of staff nominated by the authorities will have access to the
help desk services.

Pathway’s internal access to PAS via the help desk will be strictly -
controlled. Only staff with the appropriate access level will have the

authority to amend the status of payments.

The help desk staff will not be able to alter the amount of entitlement
indicated on PAS.

All status changes will be subject to a complete audit trail.

POCL COUNTER CLERK’S VIEWPOINT

The PAS help desk will act as a focal point for authorised POCL counter
staff to enquire upon payment information and request additional
personal information to confirm customers identity, where the Benefit
Encashment Service (BES) is disrupted.

CALLER VFRIFICATION

To ensure that the caller is an authorised user of the help desk service,
verification question(s) will be asked before any information is disclosed.

In order to access the information held on PAS, counter staff will be
asked to provide the customer’s NINO for each payment they wish to
enquire upon.

ENCASH PAYMENT VIA THE HELP DESK

Where a single counter post uffice encounters a system failure the post
office will contact the help desk to encash payments. The help desk will
update PAS, and PAS will update the post office counter when the
system is recovered.

ENCASH FOREIGN PAYMENT VIA THE HELP DESK

The help desk will also authorise foreign encashments for a post office if
its network connection is lost. On confirmation by the post office clerk
that the payment has been made the help desk will cause the appropriate
home post office’s records to be updated, preventing any further
encashments of that payment.

CHANGE NOMINATED POST OFFICE VIA THE HELP DESK

Changes to customers nominated post office can be made via the help
desk, where the system is down at the post office. Prior to making any
changes the help desk will ensure that there are no markers i.e.

3.1.6.1 OPERATIONAL STATUS

Operation of all system components of the Benefit Payment System
(BPS) will allow certification in accordance with Police and Criminal
Evidence Act (PACE) and equivalent legislation in other territories.

The operation of and data relating to CMS and PAS will support logical
separation of the two components of the BPS. The individual PAS and
CMS sections identify where data interfaces are required between the
two.

Pathway will maintain the audit trail during all periods of operation
including fallback and recovery. The audit trail will:

¢ record all transaction and data passing across service boundaries and
all major processing actions

e be capable of tracking a DSS business transaction through the services
for which it is responsible

e identify the source or sources of a transaction, its date and time.and
its outcome

e be available for inspection by DSS

© be retained for a period consistent with the requirements of thé
Companies Act

[DN: The application of the Companies Act to this data needs discussion
and agreement.]

3.1.6.2 TECHNICAL SUPPORT

As an integral part of the service components for BPS, Pathway will
provide a technical help desk. This help desk will respond to and
resolve any enquiries raised by BA operational and technical support
staff relating to the interfaces between BPS and DSS systems. Help desk
staff will also raise enquiries with BA staff.

3.1.6.3 VALIDATION OF CAPS DETAIL RECORDS WITHIN CMS/PAS

PAS will validate individual items on the detail records provided by
CAPS. Validation will be according to the semantics of the CAPS to PAS
and CMS Data Interface Specification. Any supplementary validation
for a specific record type is detailed within the CMS and PAS sections of
this document according to the CAPS Interface assignment of the
record.

Validation failures will usually result in a rejection of the beneficiary
detail record and exception reporting via CAS. The rejection will be
logged within PAS. Where a particular record is not rejected a warning
will be issued as part of exception reporting. Conditions which generate
a warning are described within the sections for each specific record type.

AUDIT AND CONTROL

Access to BPS will be controlled as prescribed by the BPS Security
system. Only authorised users will have access to BPS. All accesses and
changes to the system will be date and time stamped. An audit trail of
changes made to the system will be kept within BPS including:

user ID of user who made the change,

data and time of the change took place,

event record of any enquiry,

record content ‘ before’ and ‘after’ the change.

The above information will be made available.to the authorised staff for
later analysis

Records which are nationally or locally sensitive will be handled in
accordance with the latest version of DSS IT Security standards.

[DN: Confirmation of the use of NSI procedures is required.]

All aspects of CMS and PAS described here will be secure and auditable
and will allow for the production of audit trails for all cards and
collateral material, and changes for cardholders, beneficiaries and
payments throughout their life cycles.

MAINTAIN POST OFFICE REFERENCES

PAS will accept notifications of additions/amendments/deletions for post
offices from POCL Infrastructure Services. For any amendment and
deletion of a Post Office:

e PAS will re-assign any outstanding authorised payments allocated to
that office to the agreed alternative office. PAS will check for
beneficiary use of the office. Where a match is found the beneficiary
nominated office is amended to the new office. PAS will notify CAPS,
via CAS, of change of nominated PO records.

e CMS will check for cardholder use of the office. Where a match is
found the cardholder nominated office is changed to the new office.
CMS will provide an exception for reporting to CAS.

OTHER MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

The above reflects the catalogued management information needs. A
considerable number of measures of performance against Service Level
Agreement have also been defined. by Pathway for use in measuring the
attainment of Pathway. in servicing the Contracting Parties and also the
attainment of Pathway’s suppliers with regard to service provision.

These measures are relevant to the establishing of under performance or
over performance and to establishing the level of penalties or rewards.

It is anticipated that many of these measures will also be visible to the
Contracting Parties and therefore could be considered at a later level of
specification as an extension to the management information catalogued
above.

CAPS ACCESS SYSTEM ( CAS )

INTRODUCTION

The CAPS Access Service (CAS) haridles the exchange of data between
Pathway and the Benefits Agency’s CAPS. It is envisaged. that this
exchange will initially be at file level but recognised that the exchange
mechanism may evolve under change control to offer a messaging
capability. CAS will be available 24 hours a day, every day of the year,
subject to agreed service maintenance and availability of the common
CAPS platform.

DATA DELIVERY

The delivery of data from CAPS to Pathway will be managed by
introduction of a file transfer interface sited at the boundary of each
CAPS site and associated routing and encryption software. This interface
will ensure that the file is delivered across the link to the appropriate
locations securely. CAS also provides the decryption and file transfer
software at the receiving Pathway site.

Ref: PFS/PA/001
DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: — 3.0
Date: 5/22/96

3.1.8.3

3.1.8.4

The scope of CAS encompasses the file transfer from the CAPS domain,
management of the inter-site communication and the file transfer into
the receiving Pathway system.

The delivery of data from Pathway to CAPS will exploit the same
infrastructure.

MIS REPORTING

The CAS supports the delivery of CMS/PAS data such as exception
reports and ii:ariagement information. Where there is a defined interface
to CAPS, CAS will pass the data forward.

In the event there is no defined interface to CAPS, CAS will deliver to
BA on whatever media is determined and agreed. Where the interface
to CAPS or other BA user evolves, this will be managed by CAS without
impact upon CMS and PAS.

[DN: Contingency reporting routes to be discussed and agreed.]

DATA EXCHANGE

The key exchanges of data will be between CAS and the Card and
Payment Authorisation Services (CMS/PAS). The architecture will ensure
that data forwarded to Pathway is within the Pathway domain before it
leaves the BA site and that data forwarded to BA is on the BA site before
BA need to take ownership. In other words, Pathway is accountable for
the transfer into the inter-site communications network and the actual
movement across the inter-site network.

CAS will act as a buffer between CAPS and PAS/CMS and will address
data formatting so that each of the systems receives or despatches data
in the optimum format. The positioning of CAS between the application
systems also offers the opportunity to protect the application systems
from unnecessary change by protecting defined interfaces wherever

3.1.8.7 CMS & PAS INTERFACES

The CMS and PAS application data is held in ORACLE7 relational
databases. To facilitate loading of data ex CAPS into the database
tables, CAS will remove header and trailer information and will deliver
the data records into a directory designated for use as a repository for
the given interface.

The take on of data records into the CMS/PAS databases is based upon
use of standard utilities which require parameters defining operational
characteristics. A limit of 500,U00 records is set on any given data
record load execution.

In instances where there are defined groups of records (authorised
payment instruction with an associated payee list and/or message, for
example), CAS ensures that all records pertaining to.a given payment are
put in the same file.

Similarly, on the return interface from CMS/PAS to CAPS, CAS will
extract information out of designated database tables and will add
header and trailer records containing the appropriate control
information and to satisfy the interface definition.

3.1.9 PAS RECONCILIATION REQUIREMENTS

The formal requirements in relation to PAS comprise:

e reconciliation at the individual payment authorisation level of the
value as received from CAPS and the value of encashments as notified
by BES via TMS

© provision of the Common Basis of Settlement as between BA, POCL
(and Pathway) I

Reconciliation of value includes tokens by type as well as of monetary
amounts.

Clearly if the same datasets are used to represent the data received from
CAPS and that notified to BES, then the solution to the first two
requirements can be merged into one.

The role of BES is described in. Section 4.

PAS-RELATED RECONCILIATION

The fundamental reconciliation task is the end to end checking of
payment authorisations. This canbe seen as reconciliation between the
enriched payment authorisations sent to BES via TMS and the
encashment and stop notifications and expiry confirmations received
from BES via TMS, having relied on the logical correspondence between
the raw authorisations and the enriched ones.

TIMING, LEGISLATIVE AND REPORTING CONSTRAINTS

As a matter of record, at the time of preparing this level of specification,
the formal requirement is for encashments to be notified by 0400 on the
day following encashment and for expiries to be confirmed by 0300 on
the second day following expiry (Schedule B3, Section 2.1.4, as amended
by the Invitation to Retender (ITR) subject to service level agreements).

A payment authorisation, strictly speaking, becomes effective at 0000-on .
its first day and expires at 2400 on its last day.

At present there are no post offices specified to be open between 0000
and 0500 and only three open after 2200 and before 0600.
Nevertheless, if opening hours were extended, or indeed if a late opening
post office remained open for a few minutes after midnight, such a
payment would be legally encashable in precise accordance with its
validity.

3.1.9.1.2 ENCASHMENT AND EXPIRY REPORTING

These requirement and constraints taken together mean that encashment
processing cannot be undertaken with finality until just after midnight,
while systems have to be capable of reporting an encashment at 2400 to
CAPS within four hours.

Expiries have to be confirmed curing the payment’s home office on line
day following the midnight of expiry. Special “day of grace” processing
will allow controlled late payment where an office has been down during
a payment’s last day of validity. (The precise definition of such i
downtime will defined at a later level'of specification.)

It is assumed that encashment notifications and expiry confirmations will
be trickle-fed from BES and TMS back to PAS during the on-line day and
that they will be fed back to CAPS in files containing no more than
500,000 entries. This convention will limit nugatory processing in the
event of file and record validation exceptions.

3.1.9.1.3 EXCEPTIONAL LATE REPORTING

As described, PAS may receive encashment notifications for immediate
reporting right up to midnigint (and a few seconds after). However, it is
possible that an encashment notification may be prevented from reaching
PAS on the day of encashment because BES was not available, for
whatever reason: equipment or telecommunications outage, staff dispute
and so on. In this case the encashment notification will reach PAS during
the next or subsequent day.

A payment authorisation expires at midnight on its last day of validity.
The fact that the nominated offices of the possible payees closed earlier
that evening does not mean that the authorisation can be deemed to have
expired at those earlier times. A payee could collect by way of a foreign
encashment right up to midnight. PAS will therefore normally receive
expiry confirmations during the on-line day following that of expiry.
However, there is a situation in which such normal expiry confirmations
will not be made; if BES was not available, again for whatever reason:
equipment or telecommunications outage, staff dispute and so on, a
beneficiary may not have been able to collect a payment on its last day of
validity. In this case BES will provide for, and if possible notify PAS of, a
one-day extension of the expiry date, and the payment will be permitted
on the next working day (day of grace encashment), with either expiry or
encashment being reported subsequently.

PAYMENT STOPS

PAS and BES will handle payment authorisation stops in support of
accurate reconciliation. (A stopped payment authorisation is sometimes
referred to as cancelled, invalidated or voided.) There are two classes of
stop specified: an immediate stop, received during the DSS on-line day;
and a non-immediate stop received as part of the “next working day”
transactions. On receipt of a stop notification PAS will establish if the
payment has been encashed by reference to its own tables then, if
necessary, by reference to TMS and by extension to BES. If the payment
has been encashed then the definitive encashment notification will be
returned at that point if not already returned. If the payment has not
been encashed then TMS and BES will in effect mark the payment as
stopped and CAPS will be notified definitively of the successful stop at
that point. The payment authorisation and stop status will be retained
for reconciliation and settlement reporting.

SCOPE OF RECONCILIATION

Thus PAS will take account of:

e ordinary encashment notifications executed up to midnight and
notified up to midnight (or very shortly after)

e ordinary encashment notifications executed correctly after midnight

(invalid ones attempted after midnight will be prevented by BES) for

reporting by 0400 on the following day in respect of the calendar day

in which they occurred

validity date extensions for day of grace situations

day of grace encashments

expiries both ordinary and for day of grace situations

stopped payments

Note that suspension of a payment suthorisation is reversible, so it is
possible that a suspended payment may be later stopped and reported as
above, or may expire in the suspended state.'

TREATMENT OF PATHWAY ADJUSTMENTS

The formal requirement includes the reporting of differences between
the authorisations and the encashments caused by Pathway’s adjustments
“to resolve errors or due to maintenance activities”. None is defined at

1
Payment suspensions may not be a formal requirement, but are included at this level of
specification.

this time, except for the day of grace process described above. However,
a clear distinction will be made in, data between a payment authorisation
that has been raised by CAPS in the normal way and one that has been
manufactured by Pathway according to the requirement to provide back-
up to CAPS unavailability (R797, 963).

The means by which the results of this reconciliation process is conveyed
is not specified. It is assumed that it will be included in the Common

Basis of Settlement Report, q.v.

THE COMMON BASIS OF SETTLEMENT

The purpose of the Common Basis of Settlement (CBOS) is to facilitate
financial settlement between BA and POCL and in turn between BA,
POCL and Pathway.

The principle is to form a daily CBOS report using the results of the
CAPS-to-BES reconciliation with additional information for stopped

payments.

The periods of time for which reconciliation is performed are specified as
calendar days, measured from 0000 to 2400.

There will be up to’seven such reports a week: there are currently some
115 post offices open on Sundays and Bank Holidays, and this number
will increase to 200 in the near term.

It is intended that a primary financial settlement be made on the basis of

credits.
It is further intended that a secondary and final financial settlement be
‘made on the basis of the reconciliation exceptions when these are
resolved by a tripartite meeting of the parties. This secondary settlement
will produce its own audit trail outside of the automated system, that is
there will be no retrospective adjustment to the TMS record.
Over time, as reconciliation exceptions are better understood, benign
ones can be absorbed into the normal operating methods and taken as
part of the primary financial settlement.

Note that a stop or payment enquiry from CAPS for which PAS cannot
find a matching payment authorisation is handled separately from the
reconciliation process. In particular where a stop is in respect of a
payment authorisation not yet received from CAPS, PAS will hold it ina
state pending réceipt of the authorisation which will then lead to a
successful stop originated at the PAS level.

3.1.9.2.2 MATCHED AUTHORISATIONS

This output will be the explicit matching of a payment authorisation that
has been paid, stopped or has expired with the evidence of payment, stop
or expiry.

For each payment authorisation that was, in respect of the immediately
preceding 0000-2400 period:

© notified to CAPS as encashed (including those definitively reported as
having been encashed on stop request)

© notified to CAPS as stopped successfully

© confirmed to CAPS as having expired

a status to that effect, together with:
e the original payment autl.urisation’, plus, as applicable:

© acopy of the encashment notification record

© acopy of the stop notification and associated definitive encashment
notification (for unsuccessful stop requests where thé encashment
was notified with the stop response)

© a copy of the stop notification and stop success notification (for
successful stop requests)

e acopy of the expiry confirmation

3.1.9.2.3 RECONCILIATION EXCEPTIONS

In the process of matching encashments, expiries and stops against
payment authorisations PAS will discover exceptions. Although in ideal
circumstances there should be no such exceptions, in practice there will
be, and each will require individual explanation and resolution both in
terms of system behaviour and financial responsibility.

Certain classes of reconciliation exception will be anticipated and will be
so categorised:

e Salient data check. The salient data within payment authorisations
should be checked for correspondence with that in the encashment or
stop notification, or expiry confirmation’. Elements of the NINO,
nominated post office, payment date, expiry date and of course value
of cash and tokens will be checked. Matched records for which any
salient data differs will indicate a data corruption, program fault or
fraud. Records whose paid amount differs from the authorised
amount will be a reconciliation failure since in all circumstances
(defined thus far) all payment authorisations must be paid in full or
not at all’, Records indicating late paymenc by reason of day of grace
procedures will be so marked for visibility. Records indicating early
or other late payment will indicate data corruption or fault in either
BES, TMS or PAS, most probably initially a fault in BES. Day of grace
encashments should be shown separately as these are predictably
benign exceptions.

e An unmatched inbound record from BES/TMS (encashment, expiry)
will indicate:

e (encashment) an erroneous or fraudulent injection from the TMS
side (that is paid without authorisation from CAPS) or a double
payment or failure in PAS, all requiring immediate investigation. A
double payment is possible if the policy adopted on foreign
encashment authorisations is such that a payment is made on the
basis of the TMS record when the nominated office is down and a
two way telephone authorisation is not undertaken. However, only
a single, that is one-off, double payment is possible and the
beneficiary’s benefits will be rescheduled to compensate

e (expiry) either a failure in PAS or in TMS or BES requiring
immediate investigation

e An unmatched resident PAS record awaiting payment or expiry
notification after such a notification has become fundamentally

* Where a day of grace extension is in operation neither an encashment notification or
expiry confirmation will have been received from BES/TMS. The payment authorisation
will be held by PAS possibly marked as day of grace extended.

* There has been discussion of payment of a predefined amount in the event of collapse
of the public infrastructure. If implemented this would be against a payment
authorisation whose description from BES would indicate such a payment and PAS
would carry the value as personal data. This extension is not defined at this level of
specification. Note also that where the £1000 maximum rule or Post Office cash limit
applies whole payment authorisations are still paid.

overdue, that is overdue even if a day of grace has been n applied,
would represent:

© an enduring PAS error indicating a duplicated payment
authorisation within PAS

© an “orphaned” PAS record. Orphaned records could occur if a post
office had been put out of action by some event and had not yet
been either brought back into service or officially closed down. In
the case of such a dormant period that is rectified by restart of the
office, any blocked payment notifications, expiry confirmations or
successful stops that did not make it to TMS before the event will
then clear down the orphaned records. If the office is eventually
closed down then the closedown process will be required to notify
such valedictory notifications or confirmations on behalf of the now
defunct office. Alternatively, orphaned records could occur if TMS
had misdirected payment authorisations, payment notifications,
expiry confirmations or successful stops.

It is proposed therefore that such unmatched records are retained on
the reconciliations exception report for visibility and investigation.

UNENCASHED BALANCES

The thrust of this requirement is to supply to BA, by Agency code (NI
Pension, War Pension, Child Benefit, Income Support...), volume and
value data for benefit authorisations that are available for encashment
but which have not yet been encashed in order that track can be kept of
the contingent liability. The data will also be of value to POCL for
contingency cash planning and to Pathway for understanding periodic
variations in resource utilisations.

Care will needed in handling certain classes of work in progress and in
accumulating values within the right torals.

The requirement is to show the effect of encashments, expiries and stops,
and exceptional items.

In the following description the assumption is that this processing takes
place at about 0430 in respect of an unencashed balance as at the
preceding 0000.

The unencashed balance will automatically take account of regular
payments which will have been received by 0800 two days previously,
“next day” payments which will have been received by 2200 the previous
day and urgent payments which will have been received by the close of

excluding Bank Holidays, Schedule A1).

e Volume and value of payments brought forward not having been
notified to CAPS as encashed, stopped or expired as at 0000.

This will be equal to the corresponding volume and value of payments
brought forward a day earlier:

e PLUS new payment authorisations notified during the previous day
for immediate validity

e LESS expiries confirmed in respect of the previous day

¢ LESS encashments notified in respect of che previous day

¢ LESS immediate stops successfully applied during the previous DSS
on-line day (up to 1800) (including stops that were held in suspense
for payment authorisations awaited and which were notified for
immediate validity)

e LESS any new stops successfully applied during the batch day (up to
2200) (including stops that were held in suspense for payment
authorisations awaited and which were notified for immediate
validity)

e PLUS new payment authorisations which became valid at the 0000
just passed

These control totals will be verified by column addition. During the
column addition process volume aiid value totals will be accumulated for
payments which have not yet been notified as paid, expired or stopped,
that is are still live within PAS, but which had nominally expired. at 0000
one day earlier. These will represent potential day of grace situations
and unmatched resident records. The nominal expiry date will be readily
variable to two or more days earlier: experience may indicate that late
expiry confirmations, especially during periods of industrial dispute,
should be filtered to manageable levels.

Payment authorisations which become valid on subsequent days will
need to be added into counters for future reference. It is uiilikely that
payment authorisations will be notified more than seven days in advance.
Stops which apply to payment authorisations which are not yet valid will
need to cause their removal! from such counts.

Counters will be maintained for volume and value, and within value
distinguishing between money and types of token.

3.1.10 CMS RECONCILIATION

The formal requirements are to reconcile the card and temporary token
actions against instructions received from BA, recognising that this is
solution-dependent and, in the Pathway solution, involves POCL as a
subcontractor handling card management at the counter.

The near term steady state relationships differ somewhat from those of
PAS: in the case of temporary tokens the primary BA input is not from
CAPS but from the BA offices via the CMS Help Desk.

The CMS card actions are specified in Section I of the BPS functional
specification, Section 2 of the BES functional specification and a
Memorandum of Understanding from Post Office Counters concerning
card receipt and issue. In addition the BPS MIS lists a number of reports
in this area, although not the specific ones detailed below.

3.1.10.1 CMS-RELATED RECONCILIATION

The purpose of this reconciliation is for the parties to be assured that:

e for every customer for whom a card is required a suitable one is
available or in course of preparation for the purpose of payment
encashments, and contrariwise, that for every customer for whom
access to a card is explicitly not required that none is available

e for every BA office order for temporary tokens one is available or in
course of preparation

Some of the specifications referenced and certain responses to
requirements anticipate more operations being required on cards and
temporary tokens than is explicit in others. For example the SID does
not include card suspension or card stop at the behest of the DSS. This
level of specification includes such functions even though they may not
be formally required at this time.

3.1.10.1.1  CARD-RELATED RECONCILIATIONS

At the time of preparing this level of specification there are only two
programmatic transactions initiated by CAPS:

e new or revised personal details notification
e end of interest

FUJ00119561
Pathway Ref: PFS/PA/001
DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: — 3.0
Date: 5/22/96

For the purposes of reconciliation these act broadly.as a simple on/off
switch. Revised personal details may, or may not, require the card to
replaced. While a card is in course of such replacement the current card
remains available.

The process of reconciliation therefore reduces to keeping a track at
CMS which reflects the various statuses which a card can have. These
are shown in the table below. The full range of statuses which should be
provided for is given. Changes to requirements in this-area can be

anticipated.
Statuses of suspended or non-suspended cards
Inactive Uncollected I Yet to be activated, in production, transit,

Dormant Notified no further interest
Expired Past expiry date
Cancelled Dormant card not replaced when

The requirement does not specify how reconciliation reports.are to be
communicated. It is therefore assumed that a report should be produced
monthly covering:

© those specific customers for whom a card is required and for whom no
card is available or in preparation

° [DN: During stream meetings a scheme was worked out whereby a card notified as
being of no further interest would not take any further part in payments unless a
renewed personal details transaction was received, when it would be revived. If it expired
before such revival it would be cancelled on expiry... This allowed people to move in and
out of benefit without card replacement. The SID, however, requires that a card be
cancelled on no further interest.]

having been received and not superseded and for whom the card
status is not invalidated. This should be an empty report provided it
is taken immediately after a card/PUN production order sequence.

3.1.10.1.2. TEMPORARY TOKEN-RELATED RECONCILIATIONS

During the near term steady state BA offices will order temporary tokens
to replenish their stocks by calls upon the CMS Help Desk who will
update a temporary tokens order file. CMS will scan the order file and
produce an order on the temporary token supplier for the numbers
requested and the destination addresses, numbering the temporary
tokens in each individual order incrementing from the last number used
in the allocated range. It is not expected that the BA office will ring up
to say they have arrived so reliance on paper methods of recording
delivery and calls from the CMS help desk to establish arrival will be
required.

In the medium term such orders are expected to be made via a CAPS
application available to BA offices and at that time the application should
also facilitate the confirmation of arrival.

The process of reconciliation therefore is to show that there is a
correspondence of replenishment orders with orders placed on -
production.

Statuses of suspended or non-suspended temporary tokens

Inactive Unissued Yet to be issued by benefit office, in
production, transit, or at benefit office
Lost Did not arrive at benefit office by due time
Stolen Stolen from benefit office
Damaged Could not be issued
Active In use Activared, the normal state
Stopped Reported lost (or found)

Reported stolen (or impounded)

Figure 3-6 provides an overview of the DSS Service Infrastructure in each
of the two Pathway datacentres.

The Service Infrastructure will be configured with sufficient capacity to
recover from a failure in CAPS of a maximum duration to be agreed.

3.2.1 HARDWARE

The heart of the CMS/PAS systems will be a Sequent SE70
multiprocessor machine.

All operational files will be mirrored across independent controllers.

The configuration includes a number of Spectralogic tape subsytems.
These are used prismarily to hold database archives. The number of cape

sub-systems to be coiifigured will be determined following agreement on
archiving and retention periods.

[DN: Agreements required cn archiving and retention periods.]

Each CMS and PAS help desk position is based around a PC that is
connected to the LAN. The connection to the Sequent processor will be
on the same logical LAN.

SOFTWARE

The Sequent operating system will be Dynix. This is an implementation
of UNIX developed by Sequent to exploit their multiprocessor
architecture.

The database will be implemented using ORACLE version 7.3. Most of
the application code will interface with the Oracle database. Normally
code will be written in Pro*C which is Oracle’s extension to the standard
“‘C’ language to enable the support of SQL.

The transfers of data from CAPS will be received using File Transfer
Facility (FTF). This is an ICL file transfer protocol implemented within
the Sonnet suite that supports ICL communications to Sequent.

Specialised packages will be used for database archiving and retrieval,
work scheduling and automated monitoring, alerting and control of the
platforms and databases.

The CMS and PAS help desk application will be an ORACLE7 Client
that runs on a Windows NT platform.

OTHER COMPUTER & TELECOMMS EQUIPMENT

This will be described in more detail than that shown in the figure above
at a later level of specification following resolution of encryption
equipment and its connections.

Communications from each of the four ACCs to Pathway will be
concurrent file transfers of compressed data to both the Pathway
operational centres (Bootle and Wigan) via high speed WAN links.
These are expected to be 2Mbits/sec Megastream links. Each ACC will
have 2 routers/encryptors for resilience purposes. SMDS may be used in
preference to Megastream, but this is dependent upon the approved
encryptors being able to support the higher speeds of SMDS.

For security purposes, ali data sent across the WAN will be encrypted
using the Rambutan mechanism, or other CESG approved method.

3.3 DSS SERVICE ENVIRONMENT
3.3.1 DSS COMPUTERS

The DSS operates a number of systems supporting the assessment and
calculation of the different benefit payments (in:this context these are
taken to include the-Social Security Agency (Northern Ireland) benefit
payments and the Employment Service payments for Income Support
and Unemployment Benefit).

The DSS has four Area Computer Centres (ACCs) which together cover
the UK interconnecting DSS offices and computer systems. Each ACC
has a number of computer systems supported on Ethernet segments.
Each ACC will have a CAPS system, holding benefit details by claimant’s
NINO, providing a consolidated service of benefit payment
authorisations and encashments across the UK. The ACCs are
interconnected via a national network (GDN) such that, in the event of a
failure, payment requests may be collected from the source systems in all
four ACCs and payment authorisations produced centrally at a single
CAPS system.

The DSS has contracted EDS to operate their IT services at the DSS Area
Computer Centres. Pathway will establish clear contractual agreements

with EDS as system manager for the CAPS service, as well as the DSS for
the provision of CAPS data.

BUSINESS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SERVICES

BUSINESS SYSTEMS

CAPS Release 1 supports a batch interface. An on-line interface is a
stated future requirement. Pathway will implement a secure batch
Interface between CAPS and the PAS/CMS systems which has a number
of components:

© a secure partition within the CAPS VME processor to pick up/deliver
named files from/to CAPS and which runs a file transfer program to
control the transfer of CAPS files to and from the Pathway PAS and
CMS Oracle systems;

e high speed. WAN over which the File Transfer product operates;

e processes in the Pathway Central Services processors to carry out the
necessary record validation, logging, record formatting and delivery of
files to and from the PAS and CMS systems.

The processes at the CAPS end, and the file transfer product will be
capable of managing a range of file types. The processes within the
Central Services processors will be specific to the types of data
transferred.

The CAPS functions supported through the batch interface are as
follows:

e Send files of authorised payments and associated records to the
Pathway PAS/CMS systems

e Receive Confirmations (post validation in PAS/CMS) that files of
authorised payments etc. have been accepted (or rejected plus
individual record error reports)

e Receive files of encashmeni notifications and other records back from
PAS/CMS

e Maintain a log file which records every file transfer event, plus
reporting facilities

CAPS will place files ready for processing by PAS/CMS in “Out-Trays”
on their side of the partition and inform Pathway that these files are
ready for collection. The reverse process will take place for files and
messages from PAS/CMS to CAPS.

3.3.2.1.1 PROCESSES WITHIN CAPS COMPUTER

There will be a “CAPS Outbound Process” to handle files being
transferred from CAPS to PAS/CMS, and a “CAPS Inbound Process” to
handle files and messages received over the WAN which are placed in the
appropriate In-Trays on the CAPS side of the partition.

The CAPS file formats follow the simple structure:
© astandard Header record defining generic properties of the file;
e aseries of detail records;

a file specific Trailer record which contains all control items to ensure
functional integrity of the data.

"3.3.2.1.3 PROCESSES WITHIN CENTRAL SERVICES PROCESSORS
RUNNING PAS/CMS

The “PAS/CMS Inbound” process will receive files sent from CAPS, carry
out the necessary pre-processing for PAS/CMS, and load them into the
filestore in the Central Services processors.

The “PAS/CMS Outbound” process will take records/files from the

filestore in the Central Services processors, reformat them into the

required structure for CAPS and dispatch these to CAPS via the File
Transfer product.

3.3.2.2 BUSINESS SERVICES

The data transmitted between CAPS and the Pathway PAS/CMS systems
are defined in the DSS document “CAPS to PAS / CMS Data Interface
Definitions” (Version 5). There will be are up to 6,000,000 payment
authorisations per day.

3.3.2.2.1 FILES RECEIVED FROM CAPS - CAPS OUTBOUND PROCESS

CAPS files ready for processing will be held as named files in “Out-trays”
on the CAPS side of the secure partition in the VME mainframe.

[DN: Pathway will be informed that a file is available, through a
mechanism which is yet to be defined, but is assumed to include a
message.]
1 The message is copied to a “file transfer log” with date and

time.
2 The file characteristics are logged

(file sequential number, file type, priority and number of records).
3 File level validation is carried out:

(a) Header Record checks:
The file characteristics are checked.
[DN: Detailed rules to be agreed.]
(b) Trailer Record checks:
e total record counts in files match trailer records
e sub-totals for each type of data group within each
record within the file match trailer values
¢ total financial value held within the file matches
¢ sub-totals.for each amount field within each record type
matches
(c) If the check fails, the DSS is informed by returning a
message giving the reason for failure (and the event logged)
4 Accepted files are passed to the file transfer product and
scheduled for transfer. This event is logged.

Where possible, this file validation will be carried out in line with the
transfer over the WAN.

3.3.2.2.2 FILE TRANSFER OVER WAN

The facilities listed in “File Transfer. Product” will be used to ensure
error free transmission. Data compression will be used, and a log file
will record file transfer events for audit trail and network statistics
purposes. Data sent across the WAN will be encrypted as advised by
CESG.

Scheduling transfers according to priorities, and file transfet procedures
in fall-back scenarios, will be automated. .

The file transfer mechanism will be visible and controllable at the central
network management centre.

Files received within the Central Services processors will be validated by
PAS/CMS.

The results of the validation will be recorded in the log file, and a copy
sent to CAPS. Where all records submitted in the file from CAPS are
successfully validated, a single message giving the file sequence number,
time and date will be provided. Where individual records fail validation,
the failure reasons for the individual records, and their identifiers, will be
returned to CAPS.

The records will be re-formatted, e.g. the headers and trailer records
removed, to optimise the process of loading the records into the PAS
database. . There is no requirement to sort the Payment file.

3.3.2.2.4 FILES SENT TO CAPS -.PAS/CMS OUTBOUND PROCESS

Files which have been produced by the PAS/CMS database for onward
transmission to CAPS will be re-formatted into CAPS file formats (e.g.
insertion of headers and trailer records).

3.3.2.2.5 FILES SENT TO CAPS - CAPS INBOUND PROCESS

Files sent to-CAPS will be placed in the appropriate CAPS In-Tray, and a
message sent to CAPS (mechanism to be agreed).

The message, appropriately time and date stamped, and identifying the
file, will be entered in the log file.

3.3.2.3 HOUSEKEEPING

3.3.2.3.1 LOG FILE

A log file will be maintained, with consistent copies on each server. This
log file will be used to record file transfer events, and provide simple,
selective reports. It will be accessible from the central systems
management centre and will be used to analyse Pathway’s performance
and consistency with Service Level Agreements.

A means of selective archiving is required. A means of exporting the log
file to the Oracle database in the Pathway Warehouse is required.

4.1 POCL STEADY STATE SERVICES
4.1.1 BENEFIT ENCASHMENT SERVICE
4.1.1.1 INTRODUCTION

This section refers to all BES transactions handled at the Post Office
counter.

The BES application provides support for all counter functions necessary
to support the distribution, issue and use of magnetic stripe based benefit
cards, BES will interact with the central CMS/PAS components of BPS
through the TMS and CMS/PAS agent(s) subsystems.

BES makes use of the Office Platform Service (OPS) and runs within the
general architecture of the POCL Service Infrastructure (PSI), using the
EPOS Service (EPOSS) for common underlying customer service
functions. Other counter applications will coexist alongside BES. In
particular, the Order Book Control Service (OBCS) and transaction
recording for paper based benefit payments will co-exist alongside BES
until the roll-out of the benefit card as the sole payment mechanism is
complete. -

A function or product shown in capitals, for example, ‘CARD RECEIPT’
refers to a menu button displayed on the screen. The required function
or product can then be selected by either touching the screen or using the
keyboard.

4.1.2.4 APS FUNCTIONS

APS can be considered as comprising two groups of functions :

FUJ00119561
Pathway Ref: PFS/PA/O01
DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: 3.0
Date: 22/5/96

APS Host Functions

These are functions that relate to the receipt of Client data (reference
data updates, for example) and the storage/processing/dispatch of APS
transactions to the various Client systems.

APS Counter Functions

These are functions that relate to the tasks performed at the post office
counter that are specific to the processing of AP transactions. These
transactions, in common with all counter activity will use a set of generic
facilities (peripheral handling and initial data identification, for example)
together with a set of APS specific and Client specific processing.

Reference data filés will be used to determine how to interpret an APS
transaction and to supply any limits on processing (e.g. minimum
payment value). These functions are contained in the processing routines
and reference data files used by the Pathway counter system when
carrying out APS transactions.

Certain APS transactions are based around smart cards and keys. In
order to protect the integrity of data on these tokens the ability to read
and write requires the use of token specific code libraries.

Pathway requires that these will be supplied by POCL as executable

code.

4.1.2.4.1 APS HOST FUNCTIONS

The APS Host Functions will be provided on Pathway central systems
and will provide specific data storage and transaction handing functions
as required by POCL and POCL Clients. The operational characteristics
and technical requirements for these will be described in the set of
Automated Payments Client Specifications.

The generic functions are as follows:
Receive Client Reference Data
Steady State Service

This will comprise a batch dataflow from the POCL AP Host System and
/or a POCL Client system and will contain details of amendments and

additions to Client reference data. Such data will typically comprise
smart card tariff lists and /or stop lists.

A single daily dataflow will be supported from POCL and / or a POCL
Client. File-level validation and the recording of date / time for
operational control and service-level use will take place.

The complete operational characteristics, including the procedures for

success and error handling, and .he technical interfaces for these links
will be specified in the relevant AP Client Specification.

Future Optional Services

If new APS counter services are required, the nature of the AP transaction
may develop to include real time connections to support authorisation
requests and confirmations,

Receive TIP Reference Data

Steady State Ser

When the POCL TIP system is established, the APS Host system will
support a single daily dataflow of reference data additions or
amendments covering :

¢ Reference data about outlets for service management
¢ Reference data about AP tokens
e Reference data about AP clients

The record structures, technical interface and operational characteristics
is described in the POCL Interface Specification.

Interim Service

An alternative interface specification and technical implementation of the
APS Host system will need to be planned for should the TIP system not
be available in time.

Dispatch Client Data

Steady State Service

A daily batch dataflow will be provided to POCL and / or POCL Clients
which will comprise the transaction details of all AP transactions
conducted at the post office counter.

The content of the transaction record will be Client specific and may
include some preprocessing (e.g. sorting, record layout, summary records
etc.).

The record structures, technical interface and operational characteristics
will be described in the relevant AP Client Specification.

Interim Service

The steady state service for dispatch of POCL data will operate to the
TIP system. An alternative interface specification and technical
implementation of the APS Host system will need to be planned for
should the TIP system not be available in time.

Future Optional Services

If new APS counter services are required, the nature of the AP transaction
may develop to include real time connections to support authorisation
requests and confirmations.

4.1.2.4.2 APS COUNTER FUNCTIONS

All Steady State AP transactions will be invoked using either a Magnetic
card or a Smart Card or Key. Certain transactions may also be invoked
via the touch screen & keyboard in the event of magnetic card or card

reader failure.

All steady state transactions are associated with crediting a customer
account, typically a traditional bill payment.

Using a magnetic card

The customer is supplied with a megnetic stripe card by the utility or
company to whom the bill is payable. The magnetic stripe contains
details of the customers account or reference number with the company.
This information is also embossed on the front of the card which may
also include a suggestion of the amount payable each month. The card is
swiped through the magnetic card reader and the account / customer
information on the card is read by the system and processed according to
the relevant Client reference data.

The value of the payment is keyed by the clerk and forwarded, with the
account / reference number to TMS for onward distribution to the client,
via POCL central systems. In addition to ‘crediting the customers account

Date: 22/5/96
in respect of any credit tariff agreed with the utility or company, ‘tokens’
may be purchased to be used in the customers gas / electric meter etc., if
required.
Tokens are value stock items. Stock records will be adjusted by the
system following every sale.
Using a Smart Card or Smart Key
Smart Cards or Smart Keys are ‘charged’ with a monetary value to enable
them to be used to credit utility meters (e.g. electricity or gas). The card
or key contains details of the customers account / reference number with
the utility or company. Following insertion into the card / key reader,
this information is read by the system, the amount payable is keyed by
the clerk and the card / key is then ‘charged’ with the value paid. The
value paid together with the customers account / reference number is
forwarded to TMS for onward distribution to the client via POCL
central systems.
Transaction Selection
e As the transaction selection is ‘Event driven’ i.e., the appropriate
screens are displayed following the swipe of a magnetic card or the
insertion of a Smart card / key into the reader.
¢ Jn the event that the magnetic card cannot be read due to a fault with
either the card or the reader, select ‘AP TRANSACTION’ ‘Serve
Customer’ screen,
* If the smart card/key or its reader fails chen the transaction cannot
take place.

APS Receipts

A customer copy and an office copy receipt will be produced for every
APS transaction. The office copy receipt will be used to facilitate
transaction recovery in certain rare failure scenarios. Agreement will be
required on the tayout of APS receipts, the fixed and variable parts of the
layout, and the method of updating any Client specific information.

During the working day, and certainly by the close of business, all APS
transactions will have-been replicated to the central servers. There will
no longer be need based on contingency to retain APS receipts. POCL
may wish to retain receipts for reasons of customer service and a policy
will be required on this.

In a small number of cases it will be necessary for a post office to enter
transaction details that have occurred during a-period of failure. This
will typically occur when magnetic.card APS transactions have been
recorded manually, due to a PC failure. When the system returns the
clerk will be able to enter these transaction details, using the office copy
receipt, to ensure that client transaction data is captured and the stock-
unit cash position is correct.

4.1.3 EPOSS COUNTER TRANSACTIONS
4.1.3.1 INTRODUCTION

This section describes how all non BA or non APS transactions are’
handled at the post office counter. Following reconciliation at the
counter they are posted to the journal and routed to POCL central
systems via TMS.

BA and APS transactions, whether automated or not link into EPOSS for
reconciliation and accounting purposes. *

This section also describes the:

e Customer Session

This allows the counter clerk to serve customers with any of the products
and services available, and gives a detailed description of the serving
process and system outputs required.

¢ Administration Functions
Including the Counter Administration and Office Administration
functions. .

4.1.3.1.1 STOCK ITEMS

“All value stock sales are transacted along the same principle. If more than
one item is required, the number required is keved prior to selecting the
product. If the product is selected first, the system defaults to show only
one item having been selected.

4.1.3.1.2 PRODUCT / SERVICE DISTRIBUTION AND AVAILABILITY

Not all post offices transact all products and services, e.g., DVLA licences
are restricted generally to Branch Orfices and Local Schemes are
geographically limited to particular areas.

Product and service distribution anJ-availability is controlled centrally.
Any attempt by an office to select a cisallowed transaction will result in
the system displaying a warning notice with any further continuation of
the transaction being prevented.

41313 TERMINOLOGY

Method of Payment - MoP

The MoP may be selected either:

¢ During the course of the transaction, when a specific transaction
related MoP requires this, e.g., Redeemed Stamps.

e Atthe end of the customer session when one MoP may be used to pay
for a number of transactions.

To illustrate a MoP has been chosen, this document shows MoP selection
during the processing of the transaction and not at the close of the
customer session.

A function or product shown in capitals, e.g. ‘GIROBANK DEPOSIT’

refers to a menu button displayed on the system screen. The required ~
function or product can then be selected by either touching the screen or
using the keyboard.

4.1.3.2 STANDARD PROCEDURES

4.1.3.2.1 COMPLETING POCL SUMMARIES

Where cheques, (including travellers cheques and Banker’s drafts), Giro
transfers, DNS warrants, postal orders and savings stamps have been
accepted as a MoP, the following summaries are printed by the OPS back
office printer:

P4630: Cheques

P884MA: — Inward Remirances (Giro transfers)
DNSS3MA : DNS Warrants

P492MA: _ Paid postal orders

P3731MA: Redeemed stamps

4.1.3.2.2 MOP

All transactions will assume cash t be the preferred MoP. The text
identifies thar the clerk must ‘Select MoP* only if cash is not tendered.
In addition to cash, cheques (including travellers cheques and bankers
drafts), Giro Transfers, DNS Warrants, Postal Orders, Savings Stamps
and EFTPOS can be accepted for payment. Certain transactions though,
have a pre-defined allowable MoP and this information will be held
centrally within the reference data.

4.1.3.3 CUSTOMER PERCEPTION

The customer will initially notice that the transaction is handled with an
increased level of efficiency and automation although the documentation
will remain largely unchanged. As the service develops , many of the
clerically completed forms may well be replaced with system printed
documents, e.g., the DVLA licence disk. Arrival at this level of
automation is dependent upon agreement being reached between
Pathway, POCL and the Client ata future date.

Transactions are services or products provided by the counter clerk to
the customer. The products range from simple fixed price items, such as
stainps, to complex open value transactions like the payment of benefits.

4.1.3.4.1 STOCK UNIT

The clerk must have a stock unit attached in order to serve a customer.
The facility to select and attach a stock unit to a user is contained within

the Counter Administration function. The customer session will clearly
display whether or nota user has a stock unit attached.

4.1.3.4.2 READY STATE

Before the start of a customer session the system will be in ‘ready state’.
Te will return to ‘ready state’ at the end of each session.

4.1.3.4.3 CUSTOMER SESSION LOG

The customer session comprises a set of transactions undertaken for the
same customer at one visit to the counter. In addition to ‘Serve
Customer’ selection options, the desktop will display an on-screen
Customer Session log and a running balance for settlement. This log will
show all of the transactions. within the customer session. The
information displayed will include the name, quantity, unit price and
total value as well as any indicators to show linked transactions. The
clerk, having arrived at this-point will then have the option to complete
the session or select another transaction.

Upon completion of the session, the final settlement is calculated, and
following input of the total cash amount tendered by the customer, any
change due is displayed.

4.1.3.4.4 STOCK UNIT STATUS

The desktop will display an on-screen stock unit status which will include
the stock unit ID and the total value of stock and cash held. The stock
unit contents will be maintained up-to-date during the serving process.
The display will show whether the stock unit is being ‘shared’ with other
users. (This identifies any team balancing).

4.1.3.4.5 DESKTOP TRANSACTIONS

The 16 most frequently used transactions will be made available on the
main desktop for rapid selection by the counter clerk.

ABANDON A CUSTOMER SESSION
It will be possible to abandon a customer session before settlement is

_ reached. Transactions which nave aiready been settled cannot be

abandoned although they may be reversed, (if they are reversible). When
a transaction is abandoned the system will return to ‘ready state’.

SESSION SETTLEMENT

The session settlement in the form of a running balance to be paid in or
paid out will always be displayed. The allowable methods of payment for
each session will be dependent upon the actual transactions contained
within the session. The system wil! enforce a set of rules for a transaction
which will determine what method of payment is allowable for that
transaction.

END CUSTOMER SESSION

The end of the current customer session will return the system to ‘ready
state’. It will be possible to end a session only when the balance is set at
zero, following the settlement process.

4.1.3.4.17 PRINT A SESSION RECEIPT

An optional session receipt may be printed at the end of the customer
session prior to the start of the next session. Certain transactions, APS
and BA, will require receipting in their own right and the system will
force the production of such a ree*“pr, either in mid-session if other
transactions are also required, or «i the end of the session if these
transactions are in isolation.

4.1.3.4.18 I PRINT A DUPLICATE RECEIPT

The clerk will be able to re-print any number of duplicate receipts for the

£3, £4, £5, £6, £7, £8, £9, £10, £15, £20. Each postal order can be

payable for each postal order depending upon the value.
Redemption
Postal Orders must always be redeemed, if not attached to the purchase
of any product or service e.g., DVLA licences, for cash. If they are used
to purchase a product or service, although physical cash will not
be exchanged with the customer, their value is treated as cash for the
purposes ot reconciliation.
Fees
Postal orders and their fees are classed as value stock items and are linked
together, therefore when a postal order is sold the system will apply the
appropriate fee. Upon completion of the transaction, the system will
update the stock records to reflect the sale.
If more than one postal order is purchased, the appropriate fees must be
charged. If a single postal order is required but cannot be supplied due to

cancelled. Spoilt orders should be entered on the Inward Rems summary

4.1.3 ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONS
4.1.3.1 LOG ON

All users will be given a level of access to the system as determined by
their position within the office. For example, counter clerks will be
limited to serve customer and simple balance and reconciliation
applications, whilst managers will be given access to the whole range of
counter and office administration functions.

All users will be allocated a password which will require changing at pre-
determined periods. This action will be prompted by the system although
a lower level password may be changed by the office manager if
necessary, e.g., when a password has been forgotten by the user. A
facility will be ptovided to enable a sole user who has forgotten his
password to gnerate a unique key which is telephoned through to the
OPS Help Desk. A corresponding key is given to the office manager,
which when entered into the system, will allow access to the
administration screen from where the password can be re-set. Office
managers will require their passwords to be changed, by the appropriate
Local Security Officer.

A similar mechanism to the above will be used for POCL auditors, with
the result giving access to the Audit screen.

Successful and unsuccessful attempts to log on will be recorded by the
system. This information will be recorded along side the FAD code,
counter position and the date & time.

An external visitor, such as the RETAIL: Network Manager could be
given access to the system by the office manger.

[DN: Discussion and agreement is required on the possible use of smart
card for user sign-on.]

4.1.3.2 COUNTER ADMINISTRATION
This section describes the counter administration facilities.
4.1.3.2.1 SHARING A STOCK UNIT

one user at one time. When sharing a stock unit a number of users will
be able to divide the administrative functions between themselves, e.g.,
the declaration of cash and stock on hand may be carried out by each
user
and each declaration will represent that user’s proportion of the total for
the stock unit which will be used for balancing purposes.
4.1.3.2.2 ATTACH A STOCK UNIT
This will allow the user to select a stock unit for their use with the
following constraints:
e The stock unit must exist
e The user must not have a stock unit already assigned

‘Remittance Out’ receipt by the requesting outlet. The sending outlet or
CRU keeps the signed receipt as proof of the transaction.

4.1.3.2.7 STOCK UNiT BALANCING

Stock unit balancing is the process of reconciling the user’s current stock
unit contents against the transactions completed and the opening stock
unit contents. Each stock unit must be balanced at the end of the Cash
Account week, At this point the stock unit is ‘rolled over’ to the next
Cash Account week.

In addition to this compulsory balancing, a stock unit may be balanced at
any time during the Cash Account week. Specifically the user will balance
the stock unit at the end of the duty period. A shared stock unit cannot
be balanced whilst it is still being used for sharing.

The system will produce a ‘Stock Unit Balance’ form consisting of
approximately 4 A4 size pages providing a summary of the clerk’s
activity

during the balance period. A copy of this form is also used as the office
balance form and this is the amalgamation of all counter balance forms in
a Cash Account week.

The Balancing Process
Although balancing will be a largely automatic process, the counter clerk:

must perform the following activities:
e Confirm all the stock and cash movements (transfers and remittances)

e Declare actual cash in hand
e Declare actual stock in hand

Declare Stock in Hand

The clerk will verify the actual physical stock unit contents for each stock
item. If there is any difference between the actual stock held and the
stock as maintained by the system, this will be an indication that errors
have occurred.

This facility will produce a printed report of all stock items within the
stock unit.

Declare Cash in Hand

The clerk will verify the actual physical cash in hand in the stock unit by
denomination, (including coins). If there is a difference between the total
maintained by the system, this will be an indication that errors have
occurred.

Daily Cash Locked Up
The system will ensure that the ‘Declare Cash in Hand’ function is used

at the end of every day for all stock units, The end of day function will
not be possible until this action is completed.

Produce Trial Balance

The clerk will complete a trial balance before completing a final balance,
enabling the rectification of errors prior to the stock unit balance period
being closed.

Produce Final Balance

This is the irreversible confirmation that the trial balance has been
accepted. It will close the stock unit balance period and allow the
detachment of the stock unit.

Declare Losses and Gains
The clerk will declare any loss or gain transactions manually during the

service process.

Clear Losses and Gains
The clerk may clear losses and gains to remove them from the office

balance upon resolution of any queries.

4.1.3.2.8 PRINT REPORTS AND CLIENT SUMMARIES

The office manager will print reports and client summaries required
using data extracted from the stock unit and user as well as by day, time
ard date. The following set of reports and summaries is representative of

counter. This is similar to the counter administration function and is
provided here for convenience.

In the event of the unavailability of the counter clerk, e.g., due to illness,
the facility will be available to allow an authorised user to detach the
stock unit and reattach it to another user.

4.1.3.3.4 OFFICE CASH ACCOUNT

The Cash Account is a definitive summary of all of the business
transacted at the Post Office during the Cash Account week.

The production of the Cash Account can only happen after all activities
in that Cash Account week have been completed.

The Cash Account production process can therefore be carried out on
the data collected for one Cash Account week following balancing of the
stock units, whilst they are being used to serve customers in the next
Cash Account week.

4.1.3.4 OFFICE BALANCE (WEEKLY CASH BOOK)

The office balance is analogous to the weekly cash book used in sub-post
offices. For the purposes of this document the office balance and the
weekly cash book will be considered to be the same aid will be referred
to as the office balance.

The production of the office balance is a precursor to the production of

of all of the individual stock unit balances within the cash account week.
In order to produce the office balance all stock un.ts must have been
balanced and “rolled-over” to the next. cash account week.

The system will provide an office level snapshot, at any time, of
transactions, cash and stock levels across all stock units. The same
facility will be available to provide an instant snapshot of the transactions
and contents of any single stock unit.

END OF WEEK

The successful completion of the Cash. Account report will allow the
selection of an “end of week” function. This will “roll-over” the office
to next Cash Account week and make figures available to subsequent
processes such as Remuneration.

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

This function will ailow an authorised user to apply adjustment
transactions as required for the office balance process.

TRANSACTION REVERSALS

A facility will be provided to allow the reversal of transactions from a
balanced or rolled-over stock unit balance period. The transaction
should not have been despatched (i.e. client cut-off) from the office.
The reversal must be carried out by the office manager: He will select
the stock unit balance period and browse the transaction journal in order
to find and select the transaction for reversal. A loss or gain transaction
may need to be generated to account for any cash (or other MoP)
involved in the transaction. The stock unit balance report and any client
summary will need to be re-printed to reflect the reversal.

If the transaction has already been despatched (i.e. client cut-off) from
the office then it is not reversible. The error will probably result in the
receipt of an error notice from the client.

Note

There is a distinction between a reversal for accounting corrections, such
as the loss of a foil or stub, and a reversal due to a transaction refund
(e.g. when a customer changes his mind)

OFFICE REPORTS

This allows the printing of office daily and weekly reports.

e Allows all operations used in accounting and balancing of a.stock unit.

e Is functionally indistinguishable from normal operation, except that
clear indication is permanently provided that training mode is in use.

e Records all counter operations and transactions.

e Can be used at any time by any user (including a live post office

The EPOSS application will provide an effective training mode through
the implementation of “training” stock units.
4.1.3.16.1 TRAINING STOCK UNIT
All stock units have a Type attribute. A normal stock unit has its Type
attribute set to “Normal”, but a training stock unit is one which whose
Type attribute is set to “Training”.
4.1.3.16.2 WORKING IN TRAINING MODE
To activate training mode, the user simply has to attach to a training
stock unit instead of a normal one. When this is done the system is
automatically in training mode.
4.1.3.16.3 EXITING TRAINING MODE
To deactivate training mode, the user just detaches from the training
stock unit.
4.1.3.16.4 CREATING TRAINING STOCK UNITS
The system will have a default set of training stock units on installation.
The number and contents of each training stock. can be tailored to suit
the individual office environment using the office administration
functions.
4.1.3.16.5 I INDICATING TRAINING MODE IS ACTIVE
Since the training mode operation is functionally identical to normal
operation a clear, permanent and unmissable indication will be provided
to ensure that the user is aware that training mode is active.
In training mode the screen background will be a different colour from
normal operation. For example, if normally the background is blue then
in training mode the background will be red. Also, the word
“TRAINING” will be permanently displayed in LARGE type inset in to
the background and any stock unit level reports will be marked
“TRAINING”.

All counter functionality which involves the use of a stock unit will
continue to operate in the same way for a training stock. Exceptions to
this are those operations which involve other stock units, such as stock
transfers. Such functions will only operate between training stock units.

4.1.3.16.7. AND EXCLUDING TRAINING MODE TRANSACTIONS FROM
THE OFFICE ACCOUNTING BALANCING PROCESS

The office accounting, balancing and reporting process will automatically
detect and exclude training mode transactions.

Such data can be analysed to provide information about the use of
training mode within a post office.

4.1.3.16.8 I USING TRAINING DATA

Some transactions involve the use of centrally distributed data. For
example, BES uses payment authorisation data distributed by PAS via
TMS.

The use of centrally distributed test data for these transactions is useful
for testing and training. This data can be used in combination with a
training stock unit to provide a very effective training environment.

4.1.3.16.9 HOW TMS HANDLES TRAINING TRANSACTION DATA

Transaction data recorded during training mode will be marked as such
so that TMS can isolate it and handle it effectively. This data can be
analysed at TMS level to provide information about the use of training
mode within the post offices.

4.1.4 POCL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES

4.1.4.1 OFFICE PLATFORM SERVICE

This section describes the counter hardware infrastructure that will be
supplied by Pathway to meet the requirements of OPS and the required
application services (BES, APS, EPOSS ar: OBCS).

Each post office will have installed a set of PC based equipment
comprising a counter configuration per active counter and a back office

printer.

Two types of configuration will be provided :

FUJ00119561

FUJ00119561
Pathway Ref: PFS/PA/001
DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: 3.0
Date: 22/5/96

e A standard configuration which will be suitable for the majority of
post offices.

e A mobile configuration which will be required in approximately 100
outlets.

Opportunities may arise in the period up to roll out to make changes to
the specific products proposed. There may be commercial or operational
advantages associated with a new produc: or model. Further dialogue
with BA/POCL may refine the requirements of OPS or the associated
applications services which will result in'a change.

Pathway wil! carefully consider any such changes and ensure that
functionally and risk are not adversely affected. Any changes will be
discussed with BA/POCL.

4.1.4.1.1 STANDARD CONFIGURATION

The standard configuration will comprise a PC mounted underneath the
counter together with a range of peripherals positioned on the counter
top. Each counter position will have its own set of data and power
cables which will be installed as unobtrusively as local conditions allow.
One counter PC will be nominated the gateway PC and will support the
ISDN card for connection to the BT installed ISDN outlet.

The back office printer will connect via a parallel cable to the most
convenient PC. A local area network will be installed in every post office
with three or more counters using C\T-5 UTP Ethernet and unmanaged
hubs.

All single counter post offices will have an exchangeable hard disk fitted
to facilitate the rapid exchange of system and application data if the PC
fails.

A separate back office configuration will be installed in those post offices
where there is an appropriate physical environment and the business
activities and workload require this additional IT infrastructure. It is
expected that this will be limited to Crown post offices. The list of
outlets is subject to agreement with POCL, together with any variation in
counter peripherals (e.g. fewer peripherals, larger monitor etc.).

4.1.4.1.2 OPS BASELINE DEFINITION

R560 recognised that technological change will occur during this
procurement and that DSS, POCL and Pathway would wish to take
advantage of any advances within the bounds of operational and
commercial obligations. In particular PC technology will change during

the period from contract award to the start of roll-out in the areas of
processor speed and disc capacity.

In order that the OPS configuration at roll-out can be based on the most
suitable technology, Pathway will manage the introduction of a small
number of changes to the PC specification during the various integration
and testing phases which lead up to roll-out. These changes to the OPS
baseline prior to roll-out will be fully tested to ensure the operational
and functional obligations of Pathway are not compromised.

The target roll-out counter configuration will comprise :

Pentium 166Mhz PC running Windows NT client
Serial card

ISDN card (gateway PC only)

Colour Touch Screen (10 inch)

Keyboard

Magnetic Card Reader and Smart Card " eader
Barcode Reader

Counter Receipt and Slip printer

Smart Key reader (provided by APPU as required)

4.1.4.1.3 EQUIPMENT SUBSTITUTION

There will be a number of situations where OPS equipment will be
substituted from the baseline already declared to POCL or from the
above target roll-out configuration. This may result from new
functionality required by POCL, advantageous technological advances or
mutually agreed changes due to particular outlet circumstances.

Optional POCL requirements

One or more alternative data capture peripherals will be substituted for
the barcode reader if either or both of the optional data capture methods
required by POCL are confirmed. The optional methods requested by
POCL are :

© OCR / Barcode reading
e 2D barcode reading

Space Constraints

Pathway believes that there may be some outlets where the physical
counter space is so limited that a reduced footprint solution is required.
It is recognised that the full range of services will still be required but
some alternative methods of operation may be necessary. An approach
to address this may be to use a smaller compact keyboard and separate
card reader providing a reduced counter footprint and more options for
equipment placement.

MOBILE CONFIGURATION

A mobile configuration will be supplied to those outlets where physical
conditions or the nature of the service is not suitable for a standard, fixed
counter infrastructure. These will typically be satellite offices,
community offices and mobile offices. There will be less than 100 such
configurations.

4.1.4.1.5

A mobile configuration will be supplied where actual mobility is required
(e.g. the same equipment moving from site to site) or where mobility
within an outlet is regularly required.

Further discussion and agreement is required with POCL to define the
precise numbers and circumstances of each mobile configuration, and to
agree the services that will be required. This specification will have direct
bearing on the final configuration, although the principle of mobility is
understood and will be supported.

Target Mobile Configuration

Subject to a final specification, the target mobile configuration will be
based around :

Laptop PC

Slip printer (also used for receipting as required)
Magnetic stripe reader (with smart card reader if required)
Barcode reader (if required)

Housed in a robust carry-case

Network connection will either be made to a permanent ISDN line
installed in the outlet or via a GSM mobile phone. There are some areas
of the country where GSM coverage is not currently available. This will
need to be considered when agreeing the specification for any affected
outlets.

KEYBOARD

Pathway recognises the importance of providing a consistent and
ergonomically acceptable counter infrastructure, which meets the
operational needs of the user and is consistent with the physical
limitations of most post offices. The keyboard represents a key element
of this infrastructure, acting as a supporting device to the touch screen
and event activated counter system.

[Discussion and agreement is required on the selection of the keyboard, on
the use of colour, legend engravings and key positions.]

Pathway recognises that for some outlets, principally the single counter
offices, the limited counter space will have an important influence on
final OPS equipment selection. Pathway also strongly supports the need
for a consistent OPS configuration in order that equipment support,
spares and logistics processes are kept to a minimum.

Accordingly Pathway now propose that the following small-footprint
keyboard should be used for all outlets :

4.1.4.1.6 FINAL OPS CONFIGURATION

There are important and largely fixed milests 1es and lead times
associated with the procurement of the vo’ me of equipment required
for OPS roll-out. Some product enhancements may also be necessary to
ensure the optimum OPS configuration is available meet the POCL
requirements.

Pathway seeks to expedite this process by reaching agreement

offices and Pathway’s central processing sites. The software which TMS
comprises runs on both the post office and the correspondence server
equipment, presenting interfaces to central services systems such as PAS,
CMS, IM, TIP, POCL HQ systems and the OPS, providing linkage and
message store and forward between them.

The fundamental role of the TMS is that of a reliable distributed
database for the OPS and the central processing systems.

COMMERCIAL ATTRIBUTES

Before detailing the functional capabilities thac the TMS will provide, it
is necessary to recognise several required commercial level attributes
which impinge on design and implementation:

DISCRETENESS

DSS/POCL require that TMS will be kept logically discrete from other
services such that, “in extremis”, the service could be separately
procured.

In particular there will be a clear and documented interface between the
central services and OPS program functions. These interfaces will
include:

© specification of any programming interface that exists

© specification of any shared data and data standards

© specification of any other protocols that exist to allow communication
between functions within the services

© specification of any other constraint that enables the interoperability
between services

SCALEABILITY

TMS will be scaleable to meet POCL’s business needs.

POCL are looking to re-engineer current client transactions and develop
new capabilities. This may involve considerable volumes of transactions
needing authorisation from a. POCL Client system or a central point in
POCL.

Pathway expects to meet this requirement by expanding the TMS
infrastructure and underlying network to bring in more resources to meet
any workload growth beyond that currently projected. Pathway. expects

to monitor traffic patterns and resource usage during operational trials
and early live use to adapt TMS resource deployment.

The general method of configuring in new POCL or POCL Client host
based systems is to use an Agent program to provide the linkage and
translation between the host and TMS Host API.

4.1.4.3.3 EXCLUSIVITY

DSS/POCL require that services which connect to and utilise TMS (or the
OPS) will oii!) be provided subject to the express agreement of
DSS/POCL. At one or more levels there will be a list of those computer
systems which are authorised to access TMS.

4.1.5.4 FUNCTIONS TO BE SUPPORTED
4.1.5.4.1 BASIC TMS FACILITIES
4.1.5.4.1.1 CONNECTION
TMS will link into each instance of OPS <o allow the efficient transfer, in
both directions, of authorised data. Post office counter configurations in
multi-counter offices will be linked with Local Area Networks (LANs)
within the post office. Each post office configuration will be linked to an
ISDN Wide Area Network (WAN) using a basic rate card in the first or
only counter PC.
TMS will link to the post offices from the correspondence layer via ISDN
IP routers supporting primary rate connections.
A small minority of single counter post offices of a mobile variety will
use cellular telephony instead of ISDN.
TMS will provide links into other computer systems as required to
support DSS/POCL. These systems will include:
© systems operated on behalf of POCL’s Clients including PAS and CMS
e other POCL systems, for example TIP, IM and POCL HQ systems
e Pathway systems
These links will be through Agent programs interfacing to TMS through
multiple correspondence servers .
TMS will authenticate the identity of any computer system with which a
switched link is to be established (CHAP) and select and maintain
connection routes (OSPF, RIP).
TMS will produce reports detailing any attempt to establish’ a link which
is rejected. These reports will be available to DSS/POCL on request.
4.1.5.4.1.2 COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS SUPPORT
TMS will support ISDN communications between the Correspondence
layer and the post offices.
ISDN channel use will be optimised by facilities to force call termination,
explicitly open a call, vary transfer increments and flow control and retry
alternative destination addresses on final failure.

server to at least two other servers, of which one will be geographically
removed from the other two.

Data transfers may originate from an individual counter PC (e.g. a bill
payment) and will be replicated through TMS, or from a Central
Services system (e.g. PAS) and be replicated through TMS to transfer
data to OPS in a like manner.

Techniques will be used to maintain these replicas in step both in normal
operation and in recovery situations:

grouping of post office and correspondence server nodes
message numbering

marker (message high and low water marks) exchange
message transfers to equalise water marks

4.1.5.4142 DATAINTEGRITY

Three techniques will be used to ensure data integrity within the OPS
and as part of data/message transfer across TMS:

¢ CRCs will be calculated for all journal records, including software and
reference data

e Digital Signatures will be used for all data where assurance of content
and source are required (e.g. benefit payment authorisation records)

« Access to the journal only in read and append methods

All journal records will have a CRC calculated and applied when they are
initially written to the journal and this CRC will be recomputed and
checked whenever the record is read. Any failure of a CRC check will
cause the journal to be recovered in an efficient manner.

When authentication of the origin and content of data is important (e.g.
for benefit payment authorisations), a digital signature will be applied to
the data prior to transmission and then checked upon receipt. Digital
signature techniques will be available for use both outbound to the OPS
and inbound.

Detection of tampering or corruption though CRC or Digital Signature
failure, will be logged for subsequent investigation.

All transfers to the journal either at the correspondence layer or in OPS
will be written by appending a record (often a modified version of one
read from the journal). These journal messages will include all the data
required to identify the transfer uniquely. Data, once written to the
journal, will never be altered (except through the secure processes of the
archive).

4.1.54.1.43 DATAPRIVACY

Selective symmetric “codebook” encryption of data stored on disk will be
used to provide privacy for certain data items when stored on disk in the
post office.

Failure of the codebook logic self-test or subsequent access failure of an
apparently mis-deciphered record will be detected and logged for
subsequent investigation.

4.1.5.4.1.4.4 DATACURRENCY

e Application message transfers

As seen from a counter application or a TMS Agent application, it will be
possible to be certain, at some level, that data has been positively
acknowledged as received by TMS. In addition it will be possible, at
some level, to be certain that data has been positively acknowledged as
received by a peer application also attached to TMS.

These assured outcome transfers will be used to support foreign
payment, agent and systems management record access.

° Message store

TMS and OPS will automatically replicate the transaction data which is
created at the OPS from the post offices to the correspondence layer.

FUJ00119561
Pathway Ref: PFS/PA/O01
DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: 3.0
Date: 22/5/96

The data will then be available for processing by the relevant client
system which may include Pathway, DSS/POCL or POCL client systems.
The “keep awake” replication period between OPS and TMS will be
configurable as required by the urgency of the transaction data and the
general levels of traffic from the post office. Data replication will also
take advantage of connections that are established between TMS and
OPS for other purposes, e.g. a card or payment stop message, foreign
payment.

A particular limiting case is the single counter office where replication
will be facilitated periodically. The single counter office will be equipped
with a removable hard disk so that if the counter fails, unreplicated data
will be both preserved and capable of transfe. to a new system unit. In
addition TMS will cache such data accumulated since the last replication
in main store so that, in the event the removable hard disk fails, the
cached data will be replicated so the correspondence layer before halting
the OPS.

It.is a. key applications requirement that end-of-day procedures are
supported by ensuring that end of day markers are conveyed to the
correspondence layer to enable POCL Client processing to proceed on
consistent datasets.

EPOSS will initiate a connection to replicate the final POCL end-of-day
balances and this process will also force the replication of any
outstanding transactions that have not previously been sent to TMS.

Data transfers will be capable of being despatched as:

e Immediate
e Background/trickle feed
© Time deferred

4.1.5.4.1.5 I DATA TRANSFER OPERATIONS

TMS will provide data file collection and data file delivery services,
where a data file is defined as any set of electronic data. It should be
noted that the data aggregate paradigm used for transfer within Riposte
is the message aind it is this that is sed to map data aggregates of the size
required.

DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: — 3.0
Date: 22/5/96

TMS will support the distribution. and collection of both file and record
level data to and from the OPS. This will be achieved by both by
automatic replication of records extracted from files from the OPS in a
post office to a TMS server and the reverse, and by explicit file level
transfers. Large data transfers spanning transmission frames will be
capable of being delivered in the same order as sent.

4.1.5.4.1.5.2 DEFINITION OF SCURCES AND SINKS

This will be implemented by defining the group and node structure and
by the operation of TMS interfaces that allow the calling p.ogram to seé
the correspondence servers as a single virtual correspondence server.
(The “wholesale broker”). Agent programs will transfer data to and from
groups in a group scatter-gather manner. Dats transfers to/from attached
computer systems will be controlled by Pathway operations and by the
facilities provided by the Agents.

At the same program level there will be an API which will allow Agent
programs to address one or more specified groups , for the purpose of
transfers in both directions, enabling full concurrency in both directions.

It will be possible to for Agents to transfer data to all the groups specified
in a call, with the data being held once per correspondence server (not
once per group).

TMS will provide a facility to allow programs at the counter to make
logical access to other “foreign” office counters for the purpose of
retrieving payment authorisation records from those counters. (Whether
this access is achieved by physical access to the TMS replicas of those
counter journals or to the foreign office replicas is not specified provided
required updates are reflected in all replicas in a timely manner.)

4.154153 FILE OPERATIONS

TMS will support the transfer of file level aggregates between two or
more computer systems attached to TMS.

@ A file distribution function will be responsible for transfer, monitoring
and retry of file level aggregates, typically at nights and weekends

© TMS will support this function in relation to

* triggering of transfers
* reporting of failures and retry of transfers
* identifying the population of systems connected to TMS

© TMS will include the file processing capabilities described below.

4.1.5.4.1.5.4 I FILE PROCESSING

Data file processing will be provided by the TMS Agents. These will
perform specific functions in association with individual host systems.
Agents will be built using generic modules for:

e File acquisition from client systems and file or record creation for
distribution to TMS (such acquisition may also be in the form of
transactional transfers)

e Client processing of data :o/from host systems

The TMS Agents will be customised for each specific host system link
and will provide the required conventional file processing facilities:

* validation of data files

* concatenation and merging of files

* generating many data filcs from one data file

* reformatting the contents ofa data file

* generating control totals

* reconciliation of control totals

* producing reports, financial and other summaries

41541.5.5 DATA TRANSFER INITIATION

Data transfers will be initiated by:

© Operator action - This will be the normal operational activity in
managing the data transfer from Pathway host systems to TMS using
workload scheduling, or the normal actions of the counter clerk in
carrying out transactions on OPS. Once a datafile has been passed to
TMS or a counter transaction has been committed within OPS the
collection/delivery of this data will be automatic.

e Time - The OPS applications will have access to interfaces that support
real and delayed time initiation of activities. The TMS Agents will also

use similar techniques. The “keep awake” time interval for data
replications between OPS and TMS will be handled as described above.

e External message - The requirement for an attached computer system
to initiate a data file collection or delivery will be met by the
functionality specified within the relevant TMS Agent in conjunction
with thai of the file distribution function.

DATA TRANSFER RETRY

TMS will effect a form of retry through marker exchange and replica
maintenance.

The end to end recovery facilities available for data transfer between
TMS and an attached computer system will depend on the method of
connection and the protocols and file transfer standards that are used
between it and the file distribution function or TMS Agent concerned
and are fundamentally the responsibility of these, not of TMS. These
will be agreed between Pathway and DSS/POCL and POCL clients as part
ot the specifications for connecting attached computer systems.

BROADCAST AND MESSAGING OPERATIONS

Using TMS and OPS it will be possible to broadcast short mess.iges to all
or a subset of outlets. A message length of up to 2Kb will be supported.
The message should be brought to the attention of staff working in the
outlet at the earliest practical opportunity. It should be possible to
produce a hard copy of the message within the outlet.

The message will be input into an application running at the
correspondence layer and will be replicated to post offices as required.
At the local post office each counter position will access these messages
and selectively open and view the message. Reading a message will be
recorded in the journal.

The user will be prompted that a message is outstanding by an indicator
on the top of.their screen. On selecting the appropriate icon the user
will be presented with a list of messages with an indicator showing their
status (read or unread). The message will be capable of being printed on
the back office printer.

by PIRBPS, TIP is not sufficiently progressed in its implementation to
allow a definitive specification of the data it sends and receives. Similarly,
the content of the data files is equally dependent on the implementation
of EPOSS and the outlet applications.

Given this interdependency, the data file definitions will be derived using
an iterative process which takes into account the ongoing specification of

4.2 POCL CONTINGENCY SERVICE
4.2.1 INTRODUCTION
This section outlines the contingency arrangements in place for all BES,
OBCS (if selected) EPOSS and APS transactions handled at the post
office counter.
The following failures may affect the post office counter:
e Magnetic card reader failure :
e Bar-code reader failure (or OCR reader failure as appropriate if this
option is selected)
¢ Counter printer failure
e Weigh scale failure
e Back Office printer failure
¢ Keyboard failure
e Touch screen failure
© PC failure - single counter office
e PC failure - multi-counter office
e Network failure - ISDN connection
e Site-related failure
In addition, where failure affects communication from TMS to the post
office, contingency arrangements are in place to effect changes to the
current transaction data held by the office.
Prior to notifying the SIS Help Desk of any system failure, the clerk will
be required to consult a simple ‘check list’? which will be provided,
highlighting all of the obvious faults which can be corrected by the clerk,
for example; cables attached. .
Failure to resolve the problem within the post office will be reported to
the OPS Help Desk immediately by the clerk. In all instances,
contingency arrangements will be invoked at the discretion of the post
office manager or the nominated deputy.
The following text assumes all checks have been completed by the clerk,
the cards and documentation are in good repair and the hardware is
genuinely at fault.
Where contingency has been invoked, e.g., manual keying of account or
NINO detail, or the manual completion of a receipt, this will be
recorded by the system for audit purposes.

The Order Book Control Service (OBCS) is. an optional service which

Books by BA customers in post offices who are in receipt of various,
typically long-term benefits (e.g. Child Benefit, Retirement Pension).
These functions centre around the receipt and use of stop notices which
direct the post office clerk to stop, recall or otherwise restrict the

payment of order book based benefits when deemed necessary by the
DSS.

Stop Notice data records are received from the DSS ESNCS computer
system and processed by the OBCS Host system. This information is
then made available to post offices where the OBCS counter application
uses the stop notices to determine whether a payment request should be
made or restricted in some form.

The OBCS counter application, also enables the post office to verify that
Order Books received, and about to be issued, have not been
subsequently stopped.

The results of all OBCS transactions from all post offices are
accumulated during the day and made available to the OBCS Host
system via TMS. The OBCS host system will then collate these
transactions and dispatch them in an agreed format to the DSS ESNCS
system.

OBCS FUNCTIONS

OBCS can be considered as comprising two groups of functions :-
(a) OBCS Host functions

These are functions chat relate to the receipt and dispatch of data to/from
the DSS ESNCS system and to/from TMS together with all associated
processing. This will include the management of stop list data, data
reformatting prior to transfer to ESNCS or TMS and any transaction
collation as required by ESNCS.

(b) OBCS Counter Functions

Those functions that relate to the tasks performed at the post office,
either in the back office or at the counter. The back office functions will
include the checking of Order Books against a stop list upon receipt and
prior to issue ro the BA customer. The counter functions will include the
checking of the order book against the stop list whenever one is
presented for payment and the enactment of the BA business rules
associated with any stop notice that may be present.

All OBCS transactions will be recorded using the generic facilities
provided by OPS ard replicated to TMS.

The operational characteristics and technical interface to the ESNCS
computer systems is described in che DSS Client Interface Specification-
OBCS' together with the procedures for dealing with success and failure
conditions (e.g. transfer failure, corruption or non-arrival). Details of
the file status, date/time etc. are recorded as part of the OBCS Host log
for operational control and service-level use.

Validation of the data file will comprise a check for a sequentially
increasing file number and a check of the record count within the file
against the trailer record value. The Stop list is then processed according
to the validation criteria specified in the OBCS Processing Rules' . The
Master stop list is updated and the individual stop records are then

This process manages the accumulation of OBCS transaction records
from TMS during the day and appends these records to the daily ESNCS
transaction file.

As part of the end of day process in each outlet, the number of non-
barcoded vouchers encashed will be recorded and transmitted via TMS.
These records are processed, stored and dispatched to DSS as separate
file.

The non-arrival of these end-of-day OBCS records will monitored and
used for service level management.

At the agreed time all OBCS transactions are transmitted to DSS as a
single daily batch file.

Request Full Stop List

This is an occasional process which may be initiated by DSS or Pathway
and will operate as a batch file transfer. Following receipt of the full
stop list an exception report will be produced highlighting any
differences between the new and the current stop list.

STOP LIST PROCESSING

LOCAL STOP LIST

OBCS uses a local stop list to minimise the requirements for a UK-wide
stop list to be processed in every post office. The stop list records
received from the ESNCS system will contain the nominated post office
of the DSS customer. Each stop notice record is then only distributed to
the specific nominated post office. This process will create a local stop
list for each post office. The local stop list will be maintained in the
outlet by following the action code contained in each record received :-

Action Code Action
Stop Add to list
Recall Add to list
Purge Remove from list

!DN: Pathway anticipate that the ESNCS stop record can be enhanced to
include the nominated post office of the DSS customer]

[DN: DSS to supply details for calculation of date of recall]

4,.3.5.4.2 LOCAL NINO FILE SYSTEM

OBCS is supported by the Local NINO File System (LNFS) which
produces a local NINO list in every post office. This is to enable OBCS
to determine whether a customer is in his nominated office. The local
NINO list will be established in every post office from information
provided by DSS.

[DN: The implementation and early operation of OBCS can be simplified
if a beneficiary/nominated office list is provided by DSS. }

OBCS will check the bar-code details against. the local NINO list and if a
match is found then a check is.made against the local stop list. If no
entry is found on the local NINO list the OBCS counter a; plication will
request a search against a centrally held stop list.

The local NINO list will be maintained in the outlet by following the
action code contained in an LNFS change record. These records will be
created by the LNFS Host system following receipt of details from CMS.

CMS will routinely receive changes to customer personal details. CMS
will additionally forward relevant details to the LNFS Host system where
these changes relate to :-

e New Customer
e Customer no longer of interest
e Change of nominated post offic?

The LNFS Host system will then create LNFS change records with action
code of “add” or “delete” as required and then distribute these change
records to the relevant post office.

The local NINO file may also be updated in the outlet when a valid
order book has been presented, the NINO is not present on the local file,
yet the address on the book cover is that of the post office where the
transaction is taking place.

[DN: this process to be agreed with DSS. The alternative is that the
payment may proceed and an exception record be produced.]

4.3.5.5 OBCS COUNTER FUNCTIONS

The OBCS Counter functions relate to the tasks associated with the
initial receipt and issue of Order Books and the subsequent payment of
one or more foils upon presentation by BA customers.

single rack together with a morlitor and keyboard. Each Operational
centre will contain half the Correspondence Server configurazion.

Final load balancing and performance optimisation will take place during
the integration and test phases, which may require some adjustments to
be made to the above configuration (e.g. disc capacity and layout,
memory size etc.)

Each Correspondence Server will connect to two independent FDDI
100Mb/sec LANs. The first providing connection to the PAS and CMS
servers, and the second providing connection to the primary rate ISDN
routers.

An archive system will be established in each datacentre for the
correspondence servers. Data will be archived after 90 days and will be
written to a long term optical storage device.

HOST SERVERS

A variety of servers will be established to provide support for Client Host
processing and communication. These will typically be separate
Windows-NT servers each providing the host processing support for one
or more of POCL or POCL Clients. This will entail extraction of
appropriate TMS records, in-flight reformatting and temporary storage,
followed by end of day consolidation and file dispatch.

The final configuration for each Host server will be determined
following agreement of each Client Interface specification. This will
include any interim and final requirements for POCL involving initially
the AP-Hosts system and eventually the TIP system.

PATHWAY OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT

The operational management of the Pathway systems will use servers
located in both Operational Centres to support the Network
management and Systems management facilities.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE

The local area network within each datacentre is based on dual FDDI
providing separate network topologies for the Pathway central systems
(PAS/CMS) and the Host servers and separation from the Wide Area
Network and links to post offices. The physical and logical link fiom

the post office/WAN domain to the Central Systems/Client Host domain
is provided by the Correspondence Servers (TMS).

4.4.2 SOFTWARE

4.4.2.1 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT

A central Systems Management Service will be deployed, based ona
central service delivery capability able to interact with the outlets
through the PSI network infrastructure based upon IP
addressing/protocol structure and ISDN communications connections.
The following Systems Management services are provided:

4.4.2.1..1 REMOTE OPERATIONS

Facilities are provided for authorised inwards access to the OPS for the
purposes of remote control. This will enable central staff to undertake
specific fault analysis or diagnostic activities or to update underlying
software parameter data at the counter PC. The facility will be restricted
to central operations and help desk staff and wi!l normally operate as the
result of a call from POCL staff or agents for assistance. This facility is
implemented in conjunction with the standard Microsoft NT workstation
capability and operates via the standard ISDN network infrastructure.

4.4.2.1.2 STATISTICS

EPOSS will provide as part of its local reference data a histogram (table)
of transaction component timings fur each application’s core transaction
types. At the end of a customer serve transaction the relevant application
will pass to EPOSS the current values for incremental addition into the
histogram for that transaction type.

These times will include:

a) System Component Time - This is the running total of time within the
transaction consumed by system resource usage

b) Transaction Elapsed Time - This is the elapsed time for the
transaction measured from the earliest practical point (e.g. selection of
menu button or peripherally induced event) to the last practical
recording point (normally the completion of the transaction with the
final journal message written).

FUJ00119561
Pathway Ref: PFS/PA/OO1
: DSS/POCL Functional Specification Version: 3.0
. Date: 22/5/96

Periodically the EPOSS function will log the table to persistent store as a
chec!point; end of day routines at counter level will write these tables to
the message store for replication to the central TMS, where a statistics
agent application will read and consolidate the records from the outlets
for transfer to the Pathway data warehouse for storage and analysis.

4.4.2.1.3 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

A central database within the systems management function maintains
details of the hardware, software and applications asset base within the
installed OPS (Apart from hardware dependent components such as
Ethernet MAC addresses or processor serial number these will normally
be identical on all PCs at a particular outlet.)

This database will be available for enquiries by help desk staff as
necessary in responding to queries and calls from the outlets and will be
used by other components within the system stich as the software
distribution service. It will be updated automatically when any new
equipment is installed in an outlet or when new or updated software is
distributed and installed.

The database will be hierarchically structured, will employ SQL
technology and will be extensible to cope with any new
hardware/software objects/attributes deployed in response to future
services or applications needs.

4.4.2. 14 SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION

Software distribution facilities enable software files and installation
scripts to be distributed to a specific outlet, all outlets or a group of
outlets selected according one or more particular attributes.

Software distribution is normally done in two stages:

a) distribution across the ISDN network from the central to the gateway
PC

b) local replication from the gatew
(where present)

The distribution process separates the transfer of the software to the
target device(s) and its subsequent installation, which is controlled from
the installation script associated with the software package. This enables
the installation process to take effect ata particular date or time.

y PC to other PCs in the outlet

Distribution to a specific PC within an outlet may be required under
specific-circumstances but will not be the normal mode of operation.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT FOR OUTLETS

The configuration details to be installed in each outlet will be maintained
on a central service; during roll-out this service will be accessed to down-
load the precise configuration (specific software and reference data)
applicable to each particular outlet and install the file set on all PCs
within the outlet. (This function will operate in conjunction with the Key
Management Service, which provides equivalent facilities for the
management and distribution of cryptographic keys.)

This service will also be available during steady state to support
equipment replacement at an outlet in situations where configuration
details cannot be loaded from a local PC (typically at single counter post
offices).

A specific aspect of configuration management is reference data
management applicable to each outlet. This will support the management
of outlet reference data, including that transferred from POCL via TIP
(or other means), and its transfer to each outlet. This facility will include
the ability to date/time stamp the point of «pplicability of reference data
changes.

4.4.2.1.6 EVENT MANAGEMENT AND ALERTS

Events occurring on equipment at the outlet will be trapped through the
Windows NT event system. This permits the consolidation of hardware,
software and application events; a filter mechanism is provides to classify
events into those requiring immediate action (alerts) and those deferred
for subsequent reporting (normally consolidated into end of day activity).

Alerts will be transferred through the network, causing ISDN sessions to
be established where required, and will be subsequently processed by.the
central Alert management facility. The precise resultant action will
depend upon the nature of the alert but will normally result in a
displayed status and warning message to the Pathway system
management staff.

Network management will be run from a central service providing
facilities for reporting and diagnosing network events, consolidation and
interrogation of statistics and controlling the configuration and
parameter settings on network devices.

The global system will be divided into three levels for network
management purposes:

a) The backbone network, comprising the LAN hubs and LAN
attachments at the Pathway central sites, the megastream links between
the Pathway sites, and to BA and POCL, with associated routers.

b) The branch ISDN network, terminated at the central routers and at
the gateway PC at each outlet. Management of the underlying switched
circuit network will be provided by BT, operating as part of the Pathway
consortium.

c) The office LAN at each outlet, comprising the PC LAN attachments
and local Ethernet hub (present where 3 or more PCs are installed). This
will include a proxy agent able to operate locally and, via ISDN, in
conjunction with the central network management service.

The network management facilities will be based primarily upon the use
of SNMP mechanisms, with additional facilities provided across the
ISDN network at platform level via the Microsoft NT event system and
associated middleware.

Security Services

The POCL service infrastructure includes security services to provide
data integrity, data privacy, authentication, access controls and audit.
Within the solution overall there is a separation between the central
domain, operating in a relatively secure environment, and the local post
offices domain, operating in a relatively untrusted environment and
interconnectéd by public switched network infrastructure.

The description below reflects discussions between Pathway and CESG
and may be modified.

A summary of services provided within each level of the system is.
provided below:

Central Domain

The central domain, comprising the two Pathway sites and dara links
between them and to/from BA and POCL sites, is regarded as a trusted
base. Data will be stored in clear, although link level encryption will be
employed for data transferred between the two Pathway sites and to and
from BA and POCL sites.

Data processing platforms will provide security infrastructure based on
C2 level functionality with strict access controls and role based privilege.
Audit facilities will be provided on data flows to and from this domain
and also on staff access to central services within this domain. Physically,
equipment will be housed in secure accommodation.

ISDN branch network

The branch network provides facilities for ..thentication between called
and calling parties, using CLI at ISDN network level and CHAP within
the PPP link level protocol. Digital signature technology based on
SHA/DSA will be applied to sensitive data passing, across the ISDN
network between this central domain and the post office outlets. This
includes outbound benefit authorisations and inbound AP smartcard/key
transactions. Data encryption facilities to provide data content

confidentiality are not required on data passing across the branch
network for the current transaction set (BES, AP, OBCS and FPOSS).

Local Office Environment

This is regarded as an untrusted domain and security facilities will be
provided to enable data confidentiality and integrity provisions to be
applied to sensitive data stored within the outlet. These will be based on
Red Pike and SHA/DS.\ cryptographic mechanisms respectively. Red Pike
encryption will be applied to BA data stored on disc at the outlet; BA
payment data wil! be verified at encashment using DSA and AP smart
transactions will be sealed using SHA/DSA when written to the journal at
the outlet.

The traffic across the post office LAN comprises replica transfers from an
originating PC to all other PCs in the LAN in the course of journal
replication. Most of this traffic will be Unclassified, or Restricted not
requiting cryptographic protection, and will be transferred in clear,
although some will be simple-compressed.

The local office platform will be based upon a secure (C2 equivalent)
version of Windows NT, providing object based labelling, user
authentication, access controls and audit facilities. Riposte will operate in
conjunction with the Windows NT security subsystem to police user log-
in and time-out of unattended workstations.

[DN - Consideration will be given to utilising ihe CESG-specified
Thunderflash one-way encryption algorithm for password privacy in place
of the native Windows NT one.I

The counter application data will bz accessible only to the authorised
application set. User access to native operating system facilities will be
inhibited.

The data management of the journal within the post office (and
extending to the correspondence servers), corresponds to a replicated
database of sequential files accessed only by read or appena methods.
There is no normal logical update access (except for archiving
middleware). Transactions give rise to one or more journal record
appends each with a unique message sequence reference number for
which the middleware maintains monotonic sets.

distributed. Key values themselves will be supplied by CESG in bulk to
Pathway’. Pathway will store these keys on a secure, resilient platform,
using Red Pike disk encryption. Renewal of keys will be required after
not more than six months

Key distribution within the 2 central sites will be handled in clear;
Rambutan provides link level encryption of key material transported
between the two central sites during distribution operations. Keys
distributed within the central domain are the DSA key for PAS payment
sealing and Red Pike keys for encryption of the DSA key during its local
storage on PAS agent platforms.

Key distribution to the individual post office outlets will be organised as
a rolling programme involving the update of approximately 800 outlets
per week during steady state operations. This will be done during periods
of natural operational quiescence, trpically 1 weekends. Keys distributed
to each outlet are the Red Pike key for loc. dise encryption, the DSA key
for AP payment sealing and the CHAP key for authentication during
ISDN link establishment

Key distribution will use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm
between the KMS and the gateway PC at an outlet to generate a shared
session key which will then be used to encrypt the 3. keys during their
transfer from the KMS to the outlet. Diffie-Hellman will be used at a
second level to a generate session keys during the subsequent distribution
of keys to other PCs within the outlet across the local LAN.

Red Pike will be used to enerypr the DSA and CHAP keys during storage
at the outlet. Encryption of the Red Pike key is possible via a master key,
although this generates problems of installation and subsequent update.
Consideration will be given to using secure surface mail of a memory
card for input by the postmaster using a Pathway supplied utility
operating under specific role protection. Alternatively, consideration will
be given to the use of a secure 2 way hashing algorithm for local storage

of the Red Pike keys.

For the purposes of symmetric encryption of data stored on disk, the
current session key will be common across the LAN-connected PCs
within a post office. A common DSA and (where applicable) CHAP key
will also be used across the PC community at an outlet.

Pathway could alternatively seek accreditation to generate its own key
stock.

Steps will be taken to ensure that the right session key is available to
decrypt a particular journal entry and that older session keys are held for
long enough to be available for decrypting the oldest journal entries.

Note that some journal entries, of a so-called persistent type, will be
unchanged for an undefined period of time and may also not be accessed
for an undefined period of time. Non-persistent journal entries will be
discarded (in the post office layer) after not less than about four weeks,
although this period is a function of available disk storage not of time:
in a low-volume, rural office the disk store occupancy may not force
discard for a year or so,

It will therefore necessary to re-encrypt such ageing records with the
current session key at, say, annual intervals so that the old session key(s)
with which they were originally encrypted can be discarded, and the
keylist tidied.

Distribution of keys to the Ramburan devices will be based on
proprietary key management systems provided by the chosen supplier.
Investigations will be made to ascertain whether this function can be
consolidated with the wider KMS functions described above; the aim is
to at least share-a common secure platform

4.4.3 OTHER COMPUTER & TELECOMMS EQUIPMENT

This section gives a brief description of those computer systems used
within Pathway for Help Desk and internal operations management
(specifically service level monitoring). It also sets out the
telecommunications equipment used for WAN data traffic, and the
telephone links for Help Desk communications.

The diagram in the section “POCL Service Infrastructure” gives an
overview of the network components.

4.4.3.1 OFS HELP DESK IT SYSTEMS

The OPS help desk IT systems will run on servers in two locations for
resilience. These will support the call management system requirements,
for incident logging and fault reporting to other help desks: the call
management system is integrated with other Sorbus systems (such as
spares logistics and engineer assignment) to provide a comprehensive
service.

4.4.3.2 PATHWAY MIS
Large servers at Pathway operational centres will be used to run an
Oracle system which will support:
© service level agreement monitoring
¢ an alert management system
¢ asset/configuration management
© contract management
© invoicing
e ledgers
© fraud risk mana,ement analysis and reporting
© auditing
* ad hoc reports for policy development, and monitoring, Parliamentary
and Ministerial Questions
4.4.3.3 WAN INFRASTRUCTURE
The WAN infrastructure for bulk data transfers berween the DSS, POCL
and Pathway computer centres will be based on Megastream services.
These will be diversely routed for resilience, with data sent over the
WAN encrypted for security, using the Rambuzin mechanism or other
CESG approved method. Encryption units will be outboard of the high
specification Routers, which will be configured to provide resilience for
all links.
SMDS. may be used in place of Megastream services when the encryption
chipset can support the higher speeds.
ISDN services will provide the basis for WAN communications where the
level of data transfers is lower, specitically between the post offices and
the Pathway operational centres, and for automated payments between
the Pathway operational centres and the individual client centres. A
degree of resilience will be provided through the nature of the public
ISDN network, by over-configuring router connections at the Pathway
operational centres, and through the ISDN call management software in
supporting alternative addressing.
4.4.3.3.1 CAPS / PATHWAY LINKS
Diversely routed WAN links of minimum 2Mb/sec will be implemented
for each of the 4 DSS Area Computer Centres where.a CAPS link to
Pathway is required each having a link to each Pathway operational
centre.

4.4.3.3.2 POCL/ PATHWAY LINKS

A diversely routed WAN link of minimum 2Mb/sec will be implemented
between POCL (Chesterfield) and each Pathway operational centre.

4.4.3.3.3 PATHWAY INTER-S!TE LINKS

A diversely routed WAN link between the two Pathway operational
centres will he established with sufficient capacity to meet peak traffic
loads in all foreseeable circumstances. This will be a minimum of 2 x
2Mb/sec lines, rising as required to meet the projected growth in traffic.

4.4.3.3.4 ISDN LINKS BETWEEN POST OFFICES AND PATHWAY

Basic rate [SDN2 services will be established at each post office, with the
computer system at each post office having a set of preferred numbers to
automatically call when a circuit needs to be established between a post
office and an operational centre. The set of numbers will be arranged to
optimise load balancing of traffic between post offices and che
appropriate Correspondence Servers, and to provide high levels of
resilience. Call management software will optimise the processes of call
set up, holding the call open, call disconnect.

Primary rate ISDN30 services wilt he established at the Pathway
operational centres (Euro ISDN standard 1421), configured such that
either centre can support the projected traffic from all post offices.

The ISDN traffic will be managed by resilient Router configurations at
each Pathway operational centre.

4.4.3.3.5 ON-LINE LINKS

The on-line links considered here include automated payments and
EFTPOS transactions.

Pathway will transfer automated payment details to individual clients on
a daily basis, normally overnight. The volumes involved indicate that the
ISDN infrastructure will be appropriate.

ISDN or a permanent on-line link will be used for EFTPOS payment
authorisations, depending on the Merchant Acquirer requirements.

Figure A-1: Context Diagram

This diagram shows how Pathway fits within the overall Benefits Agency
and Post Office Counters solution.

The round cornered box in the middle represents the whole of Pathway.
The square boxes surrounding it represent ‘External Entities’ - i.e.,
external to Pathway. The lines represent data flows between Pathway
and these External Entities. The annotation next to the lines identify the
data that flows.

A.2 DETAILED DIAGRAMS.
A.2.1 KEY TO DIAGRAMS

The diagram below is a key to the following diagrams. Each shaped box
has a different meaning. The name within the box in this key identifies
what that style of box represents.

Data Flow _,

Figure A-3: Key to Data Flow Diagram Conventions

A process represents an IT component that manipulates the information
in some way.

An external entity represents some component that sits outside the scope
of the diagram and communicates with an internal process.

Conventionally flows between external entities are ‘not shown, but in this
case they are shown where they add to the overall understanding of the
diagram.

A data store is a mechanism by which data is held in a persistent manner
for a significant amount of time. Significant in this context means longer
than the processing time of the processes to which it connects - in other
words transient data is not held within a data store.

The data flow arrow is self explanatory.

a number of cases potential comiplexity within a diagram caused by too
many data flows has been rationalised by using a more general data flow
that is then defined in the following dictionary. Not all names used in
