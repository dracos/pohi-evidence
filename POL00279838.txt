A restructure has taken
place (effective from
23rd April 2019) which
means that this function
is now carried out by
Change Managers,
freeing up the Business
Support Manager (new
role introduced as part of
restructure) to solely
focus on supporting
branch operators. The

have been implied,
requiring Post Office to:

- provide adequate

to branch operators;
and

- provide reasonable
co-operation, as
necessary for the
performance of the
branch operator's
obligations.

Post Office was
criticised in the
Judgment for a "culture
of secrecy" and
"excessive
confidentiality". To
address this, Post Office
should be more open
and transparent with
branch operators.

The Branch Insights Tool
has been created to give
a snapshot of key
indicators of the way a
branch is operating (cash
declarations, calls to
Branch Support etc.) and
can flag up early
warnings that a process
is not being followed
correctly. This is shared
with the branch operator
as part of routine field
visits by the field team
who can then arrange for
help and support to be
provided before a small
issue becomes a risk. For
example, this might take
the form of additional
training being provided.

the highest risk cases
to the audit team, with
full reasons for the
audit.

There was no
documented initial
rationale for
conducting an
audit that could be
easily shared with
the branch
operator.

New contractual terms
have been implied,
requiring Post Office:

- not to exercise any
discretion arbitrarily,
capriciously, or
unreasonably; and

- to exercise any
discretion in
accordance with the
obligations of good
faith, fair dealing,
transparency, co-
operation and trust
and confidence.

The Audit Rationale

created when an audit is
requested and sent to
the Audit and Contract
teams prior to the Audit.
It explains the reason for
the audit. The

with the branch operator.

Post Office was criticised
in the JJudgment for a
"culture of secrecy" and
"excessive
confidentiality". To
address this, Post Office
should be more open
and transparent with
branch operators.

Post Office's previous
policies deployed in
parallel with suspension
were also criticised in
the Judgment. To
address this, Post Office
should not deny the
branch operator access
to copies of information
and records if requested,
unless justified (eg for
data protection
reasons).

Post Office's contractual
right to withhold
remuneration during
suspension has been
struck down.

The suspension letter
wording has been revised
to include the reason for
the suspension, to cross
refer to the audit report
(which is sent separately)
and to confirm that the
branch operator will
continue to receive
remuneration whilst
suspended. The 'tone of
voice’ of the letter has
also changed.

Branch operators are now
paid during the period of
suspension. This is based
on average remuneration
during the 6 months'
prior to suspension.
