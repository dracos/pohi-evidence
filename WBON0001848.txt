I should mention that Tony thinks having DC there is a very good idea.

Thanks

Availability was put into the letter — not in the negative (as in "cannot do") but in the positive — i.e.,"can do" Thursday &
Friday next week. We all expected it to be next week but Green made a fuss about detail being needed hence this
extra witness statement which has shifted timings into the week after. No one expected that.

Tom,

I have spoken to Tony and he would very much like to be there. He has asked in the Judge knew it would be him
who would be making the application and if so if he knew he was not available on the 3%

Thanks

Cheers Rob
Fingers crossed...
If it comes down to an extra few quid to get the settlement away, let me know...!!

Would be great to have Lord Grabiner available for this one before Mr Justice Fraser — that is a nice to have. The
super vital "must have" is Lord Grabiner before the CofA as I am assuming that will have to happen....

Amy,

Thank you for the below.

I will know very early next week regarding Tony’s availability. I am hopeful that he will be able to make the 3 but
cannot guarantee that.

Thanks

Rob
For your information, the Judge has set the following timetable for the recusal application:

Post Office to file a witness statement by 12pm on 26 March

Cs to confirm whether they will oppose the application by 12pm on 27 March
Cs responsive evidence to be filed on 29 March

Skeletons on 2 April

Hearing on 3 April

WRWNPe

I understand that Lord Grabiner is in trial on 3 April, and we are discussing with Post Office the options for attendance
at the recusal hearing, but it would be appreciated if you could let us know if Lord Grabiner's matter settles.

Kind regards
Amy
