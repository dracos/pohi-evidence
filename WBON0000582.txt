Thanks Andy

I was just about to email Helen to say I needed to think more about the content once the structure was sorted
as I haven’t had the opportunity to compare the statement to the list of issues yet. I think to make the
statement make sense to the extent she is covering investigations which is definitely on the list of issues she
needs to mention that POL prosecutes people and that this is done privately. (If that’s correct, why I wanted
to check) That’s one of the ultimate reasons for having the security team. The email below links to a
comment in the statement asking for a sentence on this.

There is currently some content in the statement about prosecuting which I think will need to go but I was
planning a cull once the structure was sorted. In my view I think this is one of the statement we may not
serve at all, but it needs the content before we can make that decision.

Is it ok to add a sentence on this point for now?

I'll be able to review the content again either later today or tomorrow.

Hmmm...

I don't think we want to go near prosecutions. It's a can of worms. Why do we need to mention it?

Also its effectively an undeniable fact that POL prosecutes people and a matter of public record. I don't think we
need evidence on this to prove this point.

Happy to be corrected on this.

Andy / Amy

I'd like to add some wording to Helen Dickinson's statement around Post Office bringing its own prosecutions i.e. that
they can do this and a brief explanation.

Can you think of a document which explains this which we could provide to Helen C? I'm pretty sure Second Sight
covered it but wouldn't want to take info from there...!

Thanks

Victoria
