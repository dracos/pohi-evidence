Subject: RE: Release Acceptance Meeting/Release Acceptance Board - R16.24 Enhanced User
Management (EUM) - Update on O/S Items

Dear All

At the Release Authorisation it was identified that there were two outstanding items. Now that the pilot has ended, I
have listed them below along with an update on each.

Audit Reports
¢ An element of the R16.24 solution is dependent on the HDCR R15.20 ARC v2 platform, planned to deploy 16th July.
As the v2 platform is not yet available, a subsequent incremental release of EUM will be required once it is available.
This affects the ARC reports:

* 1 existing report changed to include an additional column “POID” — Hx_Events_Num
* 2 new reports — Hx_POID and HX_POID_User

Update: These reports were delivered to live on 31/07/2017. Sample reports were provided 28/09/2017. POL/Atos
have confirmed that they are correct.

Two requirements to be monitored during the Pilot:

© BAU PODG Alerting for live monitoring requirements (EUM-11.0 / EUM-12.0) throughout the Pilot phase.

° KEL raised that instructs SMC/SSC to raise a Peak for each PODG ForgeRock XML file that is reported as failing
validation during the pilot phase.

Update: During the pilot phase there have been a limited number of ‘warning’ messages from the ForgeRock XML file
to BRDB interface (IFS403) — they are all to do with POID version numbers in the XML files being higher than the next
expected version. There is no impact to the interface nor the solution (because we will always load the latest record
version anyway). A Peak PC0261755 has been raised to suppress these ‘warning’ messages raising alerts and is
currently being progressed through LST. The KEL will be updated once the Peak has been deployed to live.

Subject: RE: Release Acceptance Meeting/Release Acceptance Board - R16.24 Enhanced User Management (EUM)

Dear all
Many thanks for your attendance at today’s combined Release Acceptance (HNG) and Release Authorisation (HNG DC
and HNGx Counter), for R16.24 EUM.

Acceptance of Release R16.26 was granted by Esther Harvey (POL) and Graham Bevan (ATOS)
Release Authorisation for the DC and HNG-x Counter was granted by Esther Harvey (POL) and Graham Bevan (ATOS)

It was noted at the meeting that;

° As the ARCv2 platform is not yet available in Live, part of the EUM deployment will need to be released as
an increment in July.

° As the CC HNG-A Counter builds have not yet been received for testing in LST, that HNG-A will need to be
subject of separate future LST Testing and RAB activities.

If any issues which may impact the RAB decision are identified at any stage during the deployment these will be raised
to the board for consideration.

Please find attached the final version of the presentation used at the meeting.
