Post Office Limited &

Proposal to carry out an Independent Review of past fraud and
theft cases in order to determine whether the facts support the
business's findings and the charges brought against individuals

Proposal:
Proposal for an Independent Review of past fraud and theft
cases:

Second Sight has been invited to carry out a review of a yet to
be determined number of closed, and possibly some still open,
fraud and theft cases. The background here is that the Post
Office has, in accordance with its historical and statutorily-
authorised powers, pursued cases involving fraud, theft and
false accounting principally in the criminal courts. This has
resulted in a large number of prosecutions and restitution of
stolen funds. In recent years, a number of defendants have
asserted that the Post Office's National Computer System,
‘Horizon’ is the real culprit here. They claim that it has been
throwing up mysterious differences (shortages) for which they
have taken the blame. Some of these cases have been taken
up by Members of Parliament and this has resulted in
heightened publicity attaching to individual cases and to the
issue as a whole. This involvement and publicity has also lent
support to assertions that Horizon really is the root cause of the
problem and that some of those convicted only made false
accounting entries because there seemed at the time to be no
other viable course of action. They claim, in effect, that they
have been unfairly convicted and financially ruined. It has
become obvious that a truly Independent and thorough Review
needs to be carried out and indeed this has, we understand,
been requested by some MPs. This Review would determine,
for the sampled cases, whether:

» the Post Office has thoroughly investigated the facts,
including the alleged perpetrator’s claims about Post Office
systems and other inadequacies

» there is any indication that assertions that “Horizon is the Real
Culprit” have any basis in truth

POL00096576

POL00096576

» the Courts have been presented with all relevant investigative
findings and that any evidence that might support any

defendant's case has also been properly considered by the
company's investigators and then disclosed to the Court

» there is any indication, or pattern, as to where the missing
funds reaily went (the point here being to review defendants’
claims that the false accounting - that most of them have
admitted - was their only way out when those “mysterious,
shortages’ hit them)

» there exists any evidence of systemic flaws or control
weaknesses within the old or new Horizon systems and the
Post Office's related operational procedures

» the Post Office has failed to do anything that it should have
done... or done anything that it should not have done... in
regard to the investigations and prosecutions

Our investigators have extensive knowledge of complex
financial systems and a wealth of experience of investigating
fraud. They will, as discussed, need to be given powerful rights
of access to data and Post Office employees and agents.
Clearly, were the Brief, or our investigators’ access rights, to be
unduly constrained, then the quality and utility of the resultant
conclusions would be seriously devalued . We are delighted
that, in our initial meeting, there was not the slightest
suggestion that the Post Office is calling for anything less than
the sort of comprehensive, thorough, independent Review. that
we would be delighted to undertake.

Proposal:

Proposal for an Independent Review of past fraud and
theft cases, cont'd:

We will bring @ dedicated and experienced team to carry out
this work and our aim will be to utilise a flexible and scalable
approach involving meetings, interviews, documentation
reviews and testing to achieve a reliable and robust result. in
order that we may deai with prior commitments, we plan to start
the work no later than June 26th

As to our fees, we know that you understand that we cannot, at
this early stage, present you with a firm ‘total job’ budget. We
can assure you that you will not be paying for any ‘on the job
learning’ and that, with the sort of good and fast communication
that we confidently expect, things will move quickly ane
therefore at reasonable cost, We will be better able to forecast
over-all costs ance we have completes the initial review of
some of the selected cases and that will give you an opportunity
to maintain control aver costs. As pattems emerge, over-all
conclusions will become easier to derive and more reliable. Our
findings will be addressed to Susan Crichton, Legal and
Compliance Director... and no Final Report will be issued untif a
craft has been verbaily agreed and approved by the Post Office

We consequently propose that we work on a ‘Time & Materials
plus expenses’ basis until the work is compieted or until such
time as the Post Office indicates that it has no further
requirements from us,

We propose that our fees, for lan Henderson and myself, will
each be charges at a rate of £1,350 per day (plus VAT and
expenses at cost), We envisage that budget of around
£15,000 plus VAT should be allocated for this initial Case
Review,

Should you have any queries, or wish to discuss this
further... or hi is Proposal... pieast

Case Review — Approach:

This Case Review will include the following

tasks:

» Select a representative sample of cases
that have led to prosecutions/court-
appointed restitution. The sample needs to
cover cases:

» where defendants ciaim they didn’t
take any cash

» where assertions have been made that
‘The System’ (i.e. Horizon) caused the
shortage (include old and new versions
of Horizon if possible)

» which have been taken up by MPs

» Carefully review all company-held
documentation focussing heavily on
probable reasons why shortfalls occurred or
built up

»Interview company investigators to gain
insights and to verify fairness of findings

» Review defence submissions focussing on
evidence of innocence (consider separately
False Accounting and Theft)

» Try to establish WHY the shortages arose
{assign each case to a Probability Category
such as: Skill shortfall; Diversion to Failing
Business; Straightforward Theft (by whom?);
Mysterious Disappearance; etc.)

» Review all materials from the viewpoint
of the Defence (seek Proof of innocence
and test evidence indicative of guiit)

» Study and selectively test, the ‘Horizon’
system in order to find any ‘Black Hole’,
Program Bug; etc. that might have caused
mysterious shortages

» Reach conclusions on each case and
identify any systemic issues/concerns
