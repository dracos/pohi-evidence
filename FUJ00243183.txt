options.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Chris
Thank you for your message.

lam the right person for you to contact within Fujitsu Services Limited in the first instance for this sort of matter. By way
of introduction, I am a solicitor in Fujitsu’s legal team and have been supporting Fujitsu Services Limited as a Core
Participant in the ongoing Post Office IT Horizon Inquiry.

I think it would be helpful for us to have a call on the phone (or on zoom or teams) to discuss your request.

In summary, Fujitsu Services Limited does not provide witness statements attesting generally to the reliability /
trustworthiness of the Horizon System. This is it would amount to expert IT opinion evidence which FSL cannot provide
independently as it has designed, developed, implemented and currently supports the system.

Moreover, any complex large IT system like Horizon will have bugs, errors and defects present at any one time and an
investigation is required to ascertain whether such bugs, errors or defects could have operated to cause discrepancies /
transactions that are the subject of suspicion. Remote access powers also exist to the system and would need to be
examined to ascertain if they could have impacted the matters under investigation.

We will co-operate with the Police to help you to identify and thereafter produce records to facilitate your
investigations. If witness of fact evidence is required from Fujitsu personnel, we will need to take that through internal
governance and provide legal assistance to the witness(es) when their evidence is taken.

Best regards

Chris

Hi Chris,

The Post Office investigation team provided me with you email in order to provide a statement attesting to the reliability
and trustworthiness of the new Horizon system (post 2015). I’m not sure if you have a standardised report for this?
However, if you are willing to provide a statement on the matter, please let me know. You can also send over the

content you would like in the statement so I can convert it into an official statement and send it back to you remotely for
signing.

Kind regards,
