Significantly improved participation
in pulse survey, and encouraging

Currently developing an L&D plan
Mid year review comms encouraged

FY 2016/17

Transaction to transfer ownership
of some/all of Land Registry out of
the public sector completed by end
2017

+ Approval to start market testing
has been given by SOS for
Education (Justine Greening now
responsible Minister for the sale
under machinery of Govt changes)

+ Investor meetings commenced w/c
26 Sept and market testing due to
complete 18 Nov

+ Bidders submitted their final offers
on 12 Sept

+ No. 10 has decided thatthat no
parliamentary time can be found
for it so transaction is on hold for
the life of this parliament

+ Discussions are ongoing on how
to set up a strategic review of the
future of LR. This review would
build the evidence base for options
to help ministers make an
informed decision on LR’s future

If market testing is positive and is
swiftly followed by a sale launch first
week of Jan ’17, there is still time to
complete sale of the first tranche by
the end of the financial year. Due to
delays in decision making with the
change in responsibility to DfE there
is now no contingency in the
timeline, however, so further delays
would make this unachievable

Transaction is at a critical stage as
we seek to take forward a preferred
bidder to agree a deal

Activity is now focussed on running
a lessons learned exercise and
ensuring project materials are
properly filed

Urenco

Royal Mail
Pension Assets

Restructure Urenco by March 2017
to provide optionality for HMG
around a future sale

Test whether fair value and VFM
can be achieved via a secondary
market transaction and, if so,
execute the sale by end of March
2017

+ German Govt provided its written
approval to the Dutch Govt in Aug
for a proposed new corporate
governance structure, which would
have enabled a possible future
trade sale of all or part of Urenco

« Following an NSC update in Sept,
the BEIS SoS wrote to the Dutch
Minister signalling the UK’s
approval for the Dutch legislation

+ However the two German
shareholders (E.ON and RWE)
rejected the proposed structure

+ Work to identify and consider
whether there are other options to
enable HMG to sell all or part of its
stake in the future is underway

+ UKGI has engaged financial and
legal advisors and is engaging
with portfolio managers whose
consent is needed for a sale
process

+ Subject to agreement of key terms
with portfolio managers, it is likely
that the process could start in Oct /
Nov

* The Dutch will not now move
forward with their legislation and a
restructuring, which would have
given us the optionality to sell all or
part of our stake should there have
been Ministerial appetite for a sale
and if such a sale could be shown to
be VFM

+ Optionality of a future sale is not
possible in the immediate future

+ Wewill submit any possible options
that are identified to BEIS ministers
in due course

+ Key issues will be assessing VFM
of bids received compared to hold
scenario; and execution risk as a
result of portfolio managers’ consent
rights
