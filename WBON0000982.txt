Action required: please confirm that we may send the attached letter to Fujitsu / provide any comments you
may have.

Please find attached a draft letter to Fujitsu asking them to preserve documents relevant to the group action. It is
difficult at this stage to draw out a specific list of documents that we wish Fujitsu to preserve but we have tried to draw
their attention to at least some broad categories of information they should consider. I suspect that Fujitsu may say
that some of these requirements are onerous on them or come with a cost, in which case I have asked them to contact
me so we can then discuss the cost / benefit of implementing any of these steps.

Please can you provide a contact person at FJ to whom we may send the letter.
All thoughts of course welcome.

Kind regards
Andy
