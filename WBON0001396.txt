The edit did not come through. I struck through the words “of the debt” in the last line, so it reads “suspend
collection until the dispute is resolved”.

Owain,
Am I misreading something? Your draft below appears identical to Freeths.

When we agree these flowcharts, can your clerks file them together with the Aussie submission?

Broadly, but it is contrary to our pleading - GDXC, para. 43(3). It is a disputed debt.

How about this: “(2) A corresponding debit or credit is made in the SPM's customer account with Post
Office. Ifa debit, this will be treated as a debt by Post Office unless the SPM contacts NBSC to lodge a
dispute, which should suspend collection of the debt until the dispute is resolved”

That side-steps the semantic point and prevents the Judge saying that we have changed our case!

Dear Sirs,

We believe the position on the evidence, was that an amount settled centrally but disputed, results in
collection of the debt being suspended, but factually a debit is considered by Post Office to be a debt. We
propose the wording below, which we believe fairly reflects this.

(2) A corresponding debit or credit is made in the SPM's customer account with Post Office. If a debit, this
will be treated as a debt by Post Office unless the SPM contacts NBSC to lodge a dispute, which should

suspend collection of the debt until the dispute is resolved."

Otherwise we are willing to agree your position for the sake of ensuring agreed documents can be filed as
was clearly the Judge’s preference.

Please could you confirm by return that this is all now agreed, and then arrange to file with the Court before
4pm.

Dear Sirs,

We refer to your letter dated 17 December 2018.

The Branch Trading Statement flowchart is agreed.

Regarding the Transaction Correction flowchart, your amendments are agreed save for changes to the "Settle
Centrally box". Your proposed change is not neutral and is inconsistent with Post Office's case that TCs may

be disputed. We propose the following wording for the box;

"Settle Centrally"
(1) A credit or debit entry for value of the TC is made in the SPM's branch account; and

(2) A corresponding debit or credit is made in the SPM's customer account with Post Office. If a debit, this
will be treated as a debt by Post Office unless the SPM contacts NBSC to lodge a dispute."

Please confirm your agreement to the above and if so please amend the flowchart accordingly.

In your letter you asked requested evidential references with regards to the effect of the Seek Evidence
option. Please see F4/21/11.

We do not think it would be helpful to submit two TC flowcharts to the Judge as it would be confusing to the
Judge. Please confirm you agree.

Yours faithfully
Womble Bond Dickinson
