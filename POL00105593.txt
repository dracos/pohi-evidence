The earliest Rob can speak to me is 3pm (I have told him you are meeting with Alice at 3:30pm). He has, however, sent
over a few initial comments:-

     •     He has concerns regarding the PR implications over an audit being conducted. I guess the point here is carrying
           out an audit in response to the `noise' surrounding the integrity of the Horizon system potentially looks reactive
           and will be seen as POL having lost confidence in the system.

     •     Rob also has concerns regarding the costs that would be incurred in carrying out an audit. Depending on the
           scope of that audit, the costs could potentially be significant.

     •     An audit commissioned by POL may not have the desired effect of curbing these challenges in any event. It will
           always be said that the audit was not independent. Ultimately the only way to avoid criticism would be to appoint a
           joint expert.

     •     Rob does not believe an audit would have a great impact on current prosecutions in the sense of finding a
           "smoking gun" which explains that the losses were due to computer error, but if POL is required to disclose that
           an expert has been appointed to conduct a review there would be a strong argument that the cases should be
           adjourned pending the outcome of that review. I wil l need to test with Rob the extent to which this would need to
           be disclosed.

     •     Rob remains firmly of the view that an audit should not be carried out. In his words: "POL has to grit its teeth and
           get on with prosecuting and defending civil actions".

Kind regards
