| have examined the “Technical expert’s report to the Court prepared by
Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd” which |

provide a statement regarding to my views on the report with regard to the
Horizon system and also about my analysis of the data regarding the
transactions carried out in Branch 126023 which | understand to be the

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

| would like to re-iterate that my expertise relates to the Horizon system only
and not to Post Office Ltd’s Back end systems. However such systems are
irrelevant to the Branch accounts that are produced on Horizon since any
externally initiated transactions (such as Transaction Corrections and
Remittances which will be discussed later) must be authorised by a User of
the Horizon system in the Branch before they are included in the Branch’s
accounts.

In Section 1.2 of his report, Professor McLachlan lists a number of
“Hypothetical issues” with the Horizon system. However there doesn’t
appear to be a thorough justification as to why these might be relevant. |
wonder if you might be prepared to use slightly stronger wording. There
doesn’t appear to be any evidential bases for the hypotheses at all.

Specifically, in section 1.2.1 he hypothesises that “The User Interface gives rise to
incorrect data entry: poor user experience design and inadequately user experience testing can
give rise to poor data entry quality.” Although | was not responsible for the Design
and development of the Horizon user interface, | do know that one of the
key goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it
could be used by Users with no IT experience. Please explain why the
interface is easy to use — colour buttons, simply worded and highly visible
instructions etc. Are any photos or diagrams of assistance to explain the
user-friendly display to the jury?

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

In Section 1.2.2 there is the hypothesis that ‘The Horizon system fails to properly
process transactions: accounting systems are usually carefully designed to ensure that accounts
balance after each “double entry” transaction.. Horizon is indeed designed to use
“double entry” transactions. Further Professor McLachlan refers to the need
for database systems to use “‘two-phase’ commit” technologies. Again, Horizon
is designed using such concepts. However in a distributed environment
with multiple systems it is not possible to handle all failure scenarios through
2-phase commit mechanisms. What has to be included in the design is
what happens when the outcome of a 2-phase commit is indeterminate and
Horizon’s design does that. | don’t understand this. Please use layman’s
language.

Finally, in Section 1.2.3 there is the Hypothesis that “External systems across the
wider Post Office Limited Operating Environment provide incorrect externally entered
information to the Horizon accounts through system or operator error outside Horizon.”. | am
not quite clear what Professor McLachlan is referring to here. However
what | can say is that any transaction that is recorded on Horizon must be
authorised by a User of the Horizon system who is taking responsibility for
the impact that such a transaction (has) on the Branch’s accounts. There
are no cases where external systems can manipulate the Branch’s accounts
without the Users in the Branch being aware and authorising the

transactions.

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

In Section 2.2.1 of his report, Professor McLachlan outlines a number of
limitations in the scope of his investigation. In some of these cases, they
are irrelevant to the processing of transactions in Horizon.

Specifically, the report states “It was not possible to examine the process for introducing
Transaction Corrections that can give rise to changes in the cash that Horizon records at the
branch”. As | have stated earlier in this statement, any Transaction
Correction that has been generated by the external Post Office Ltd systems
must be explicitly accepted into the Branch’s accounts by an appropriate
User. In many cases there is the opportunity to reject the Transaction
Correction allowing a separate process to agree whether or not it is valid
before it is accepted into the accounts (perhaps give an example).
Therefore, | would say that it is not necessary to examine the process for
generating Transaction Corrections. Please also explain how a transaction
correction comes about. It isn’t a mechanical message from the back-end
but an evidence-based, human decision. An example may help — eg. Cash
in pouch on inspection doesn’t match the Horizon record.

The next Bullet states “It was not possible to examine the processes for Remittances (the
movement of cash and stock) into and out of the branch that changes the cash and stock that
Horizon records at the branch.” Again, any Remittance into the Branch has to be
explicitly accepted by the User (who will have had the opportunity physically
to count the cash) and a receipt is produced stating the amount that is being
introduced into the Branch accounts. Should this differ in any way from the

amount recorded on the cash pouch or the amount of cash found inside the
pouch, there are processes to query such differences. Therefore, | would
say that it is not necessary to examine the process for generating
Remittances.

The third bullet states “It was not possible to examine the processes for revaluing foreign
currency which could change the value of cash held at the branch.”. Revaluation of
currency doesn't affect the cash position. It purely affects the notional value
of the Foreign Currency as it is reported in the accounts, but has no impact
on the Cash (sterling) position. It’s only impact might be on the liability of
the postmaster for any currency that is subsequently lost (which would need
to be repaid at the current value). Note that revaluation can be positive or
negative.

Finally, the 4" bullet states “It was not possible to examine the processes of reconciliation
conducted by the Post Office that could give rise to Transaction Corrections.”. As stated
earlier this is not really relevant since any Transaction Corrections will have
been accepted by the User into the Branch accounts and should not be
accepted if not understood. Accepting a Transaction Correction implicitly
means taking responsibility for that in accounting terms.

Moving on to Section 2.2.2 of Professor McLachlan’s report which is titled
Opportunities for Reconciliation. | accept that the Horizon system has not
been designed to automatically provide vouchers for every transaction. It

was not a requirement for Horizon to produce such vouchers and in fact
there were specific requirements from Post Office Ltd regarding transaction
times that preclude printing such records. Are you able to explain why? My
experience as a user of Retail systems (such as supermarkets) is that such
vouchers are not normally generated there either.

In Section 2.3 of his report, Professor McLachlan looks at hypothetical
issues with Data Entry. Section 2.3.1 looks at the calibration of the touch
screen. | accept the fact that a misaligned touch screen could certainly
cause confusion to the User and result in incorrect buttons being activated.
However | don’t understand how Professor McLachlan is suggesting that
such a misalignment would cause discrepancies within the accounts
(perhaps invite M to give examples). Presumably the instructions and
figures produced on the screen would alert the user immediately to a
problem.

In section 2.3.2, Professor McLachlan states that “Poor user interface design can
contribute to poor data entry quality and user errors.”. | agree with this as a statement.
However Professor McLachlan makes no attempt to explain in what way the
Horizon User Interface design is “Poor”. As | stated earlier one of the key
goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it could
be used by Users with no IT experience. A significant amount of effort was
put into designing and agreeing the User Interface with Post Office Ltd.

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

In Section 2.3.3 of his report Professor McLachlan hypothesises that errors
can be introduced by incorrect use of the “Fast Cash” button. In particular
he challenges my analysis of unsuccessful Debit Card Transactions.
Please set out your analysis of unsuccessful debit card transactions, in
layman's terms. | would like this statement to be able to stand alone, as
much as possible, to avoid all parties having to cross-refer to your other
statements. | have re-checked the transaction for £7,000 on 11" January
2007 and this transaction was actually settled by a Cheque and not cash.
This was covered by case 1 in my email to his which is reproduced in
Appendix | of his report. Therefore in this case the User must have been
aware that the Debit Card transaction had failed in order to ask for a
cheque. Even supposing the Cheque button was pressed in error for Fast
Cash, then there would have been a discrepancy in the value of cheques
and there is no evidence of such discrepancies.

Later in this section, Professor McLachlan claims “the ‘Fast Cash’ button is
demonstrated to be a source of data entry error (the reversals confirm this).”. | don’t agree
with that. | can see no evidence to support this statement. The fact that
there are reversals following a failed Debit card transaction is due to the fact
that some transactions cannot be abandoned and need to be settled and
then reversed. This was a specific requirement on Horizon from Post Office
Ltd. The fact that this has been done shows that the user was well aware of
the failure of the Debit Card transaction and followed normal process when
the failure occurred.

Professor McLachlan explores issues with training of the Users in section
2.3.4 of his report. | support his finding regarding discrepancies in cash in
almost every period. Can you expand on this and explain in layman’s terms,
perhaps giving a couple of examples? | do not understand exactly what M is
referring to and your agreement might be interpreted as a concession that
the Crown’s case is entirely flawed. Discrepancies are always to be
expected. What is not to be expected is that daily errors will be ignored but
that then, at the end of the branch trading period, the SPM will show a
considerable deal of competence by balancing the branch with carefully
fictitious figures. Isn’t it usually possible for an SPM to discover the source
of a mistake and correct it? Won't any SPM look under every possible stone
to find the cause of the problem? Isn't it implausible that there would be so
many small mistakes leading to a £75,000 loss? Are there discrepancies
that result in a surplus? If not, why should the “mistakes” always go one
way? M seems surprised that thefts over a long period should go
undiscovered. This is rubbish. If a SPM is cooking the books only an audit
will reveal the truth. | also did an analysis of the daily cash movements
compared with the daily cash declarations and could see very little
correlation between the two which indicates that the variances between the
declared cash and the system cash figures were not being monitored very
well within the Branch. | would agree that this could be down to Theft /
Fraud, or incompetence by the Branch staff. isn’t theft rather more likely?
Are these equally valid possibilities? Why would a SPM not monitor the

system well on a daily basis? Not to do so risks throwing their own money
down the drain. However there is no evidence that this is down to any sort of
System failure. Further | would suggest that small discrepancies are to be
expected in such an environment due to mistakes in giving change etc. My
understanding is that Post Office investigators expect such small
discrepancies in normal operation.

Section 2.4 of Professor McLachlan’s report than describes 2 possible

issues with Horizon.

| accept that there was an issue with the Post Office in Calendar Square
Falkirk as descried in the email reproduced in Appendix C of the report and
covered by a previous Witness statement | made on 8" February 2010. As |
stated in the email, the problem was fixed in March 2006 and so is not
relevant to the period of data that | have examined in this branch. Also,
when the problem manifested itself it was clear from the various logs that
there was a problem in the system. There is no evidence of such problems
from the various logs that have been examined for this branch. Therefore |
see no relevance for this problem to the period of data that is being looked
at for this case. In particular, Professor McLachlan says “It demonstrates that

there have been faults with the Horizon system which give rise to discrepancies that can cause

losses. It is not reasonable to exclude the possibility of system problems when considering a case
such as Misra. ”. | would dispute that. It was clear from the Events generated
at the time in Calendar Square that there was a problem. No such events

have been seen in West Byfleet in the period in question and so this cannot
be responsible for the losses in that period. Please provide your full
explanation of why Callender SQ doesn’t apply, so that this statement can
stand alone. The Defence are going to bang on about this. Please describe
the symptoms and effect of the Callender Sq problem. These symptoms
were immediately apparent to the users and the problem reported. If Misra
had ever suffered from the problem you would presumably have expected
her to be able to describe the problem. My understanding is that Misra is
unable to describe at all wnat may have been going wrong with her system.
According to her Defence Statement she simply put the losses down to theft
by employees and/or incompetence. This appears to me to be ludicrously
vague. She should at least be able to say where the losses were occurring.
Are you not surprised that M’s reports appear to have received no guidance
whatsoever from Misra? Were you surprised to see that Callender Sq was
still an issue for M? Did you have any idea that he wanted the earlier logs
before you received his fina! report?

In section 2.4.2 Professor McLachlan describes a “travellers cheque stock
problem”. | disagree with his description of what happens in this scenario.
Horizon doesn’t attempt to control Travellers’ Cheques at a denominational
level. In other words it only manages the total value (in dollars) of
Travellers’ Cheques and doesn’t distinguish between $1,000 being held as
10 $100 Travellers’ Cheque or as 50 $20 Travellers’ Cheques or any other
combination. Horizon is only concerned with the fact that it holds Travellers’

Cheques to a face value of $1,000. Therefore following through Professor
McLachlan’s scenario, the system initially has $1,000 of Travellers’
Cheques. When a customer purchases one Travellers’ Cheque for $100,
then this will be reflected by reducing the stock of Travellers’ Cheques by
100, leaving 900 Travellers’ Cheques in stock. This would be reflected on
the Stock Report.

| also note that in this section Professor McLachlan states that he has
discussed this scenario with me and that | “acknowledge that this is a known feature
of Horizon and that the Post Office have not instructed Fujitsu to change the system to produce a
meaningful stock report.”. | don’t recall any such discussion. | have seen such a
scenario described in a separate report that Professor McLachlan has
written for a separate case, and did explicitly check out the scenario and
produced a report for Post Office Ltd refuting the description. Please set out
here in simple terms how your experiments refuted the theory, again so this
statement can stand alone. | do accept that there are some cases where the
way in which Travellers’ Cheques can appear to be slightly misleading
(please expand on what you mean - the Defence will otherwise exaggerate
the significance of this comment), however there is nothing as blatantly
incorrect with the system as Professor McLachlan suggests.

Therefore | would contend that section 2.4.2 of the report is irrelevant. What
do you think of his suggestion that a staff member will be tempted to make a
manual correction to a perceived problem? Isn’t this in fact something that
should never be done?

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

In Section 2.5.1, Professor McLachlan looks again at Transaction
Corrections. Here he refers to Appendix G of his report which describes
some analysis | have done concerning transaction Corrections (my email on
this is actually is in Appendix D of the report). This shows that if we analyse
all Transaction Corrections during the 13 month period that the net value is
£1,840. I’ve subsequently gone over the data again and found some
additional transaction corrections that have been processed and the total
net value of all such Transaction Corrections is actually slightly less namely
£1,619.43.

He then refers to a slightly wider scope that he has taken in Appendix J
where he comes up with an absolute value of £82,918.35 (though a net
value of £19.257.21). | have now had a chance to examine this data in
more detail and have the following observations to make on Professor
McLachlan’s analysis:

T still need to do this analysis, so I'll come back to this.

Later on in the section Professor McLachlan states “There is no record of Misra
requesting evidence in the transactions provided between 1 Dec 06 and 31 Dec 07. ”. This is
incorrect. There was one such example on 13" December 2006 and two
more on 14 March 2007. | accept that | had omitted these from my initial
analysis.

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris JENKINS.

Finally, towards the end of the section Professor McLachlan hypothesises
“There are missing Transaction Corrections which would reduce the cash balance expected by the
Horizon system (i.e. be in favour of Misra).”. This may indeed be true. Why? Isn't
this wishful thinking by M? There is no evidential basis whatsoever for his
assertion. Have the transaction corrections disappeared by magic? However
my understanding is that normally branches are well aware of such errors
and would have contacted Post Office Ltd to enquire as to why no
Transaction Correction was being made in favour of the branch.

Section 2.5.2 of the report discusses remittances. However | don’t
understand the relevance of this discussion to the case. Professor
McLachlan mentions that my analysis “identified a pattern or remittance transactions
which is consistent with Misra’s statement that she declared cash held in remittance pouches in the
safe which was not actually present.”._ In my view is this not an indication of guilt?
Please rephrase and expand. It is surely surprising that a SPM should go to
all the trouble of preparing scores of empty bags rather than trying to find
out what the problem was. In fact Misra had considerable computer
experience — you may want to speak to John Longman as to her CV.

Section 2.5.3 then refers to incorrect transaction processing. However there
is no indication as to what types of transaction processing may be incorrect.
It should be noted that the Horizon counter application has recently been
replaced and the last Horizon Counter migrated to the new system in

September 2010 and so there are no longer any Horizon counter systems to
examine. isn’t it in fact impossible to perform helpful lab condition
experiments? You would need a Misra clone. M shouldn't need to conduct
experiments — he should be guided by Misra who was on the scene at the
time. Doesn't the fact that Misra appears to provide no guidance at all
suggest that there was no computer problem?

Professor McLachlan’s report than attempts to draw some conclusions in
section 3.

Section 3.1queries why it took Post Office Ltd so long to notice the pattern
of discrepancies. Much of the detailed information regarding such
discrepancies is only available within the branch to assist the sub-
postmaster in managing their branch and so is not routinely available to
Post Office Ltd until and investigation is carried out as in this case. As |
mention above, if the SPM is fiddling the accounts only an audit will uncover
the problem. Misra would have known this.

Section 3.2 mentions screen calibration issues. While | can’t 10% rule out
such issues as causing some issues. However | can’t see how this could
account for anything like the full extent of the losses. Please rephrase. This
will be taken as a damaging concession. You need to explain what is meant
by “screen calibration issues”. Give simple examples if you can. How can

any such issue lead to a deficiency? Above you only refer to the possibility
of confusion arising, not a deficiency.

Section 3.3 refers to Horizon issues. As stated earlier, the Calendar Square
issue is irrelevant and there is no issue with Travellers’ Cheques.

Finally in 3.4 is challenging the integrity of Post Office Ltd’s back end
systems. My view is that any faults in these systems are irrelevant to the
Branch accounts and hence the losses. This is because, as stated earlier,
any transactions generated from a Post Office Ltd back end system must be
explicitly accepted onto Horizon by a User and cannot be introduced into the
Branch accounts without their knowledge.

has been in operation, how robust a system it is etc. What do you think of
the suggestion that there may have been a problem with Misra’s equipment
of which she was blissfully aware? What about Varsani’s statement that M
