Further to my statements of 2nd February, 8th February 2010 and 9t" March
2010 I would like to add the following.


I have examined the "Technical expert's report to the Court prepared by
Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd" which I
received on 1S` October 2010.                         I have been asked by Post Office Ltd to
provide a statement regarding to my views on the report with regard to the
Horizon system and also about my analysis of the data regarding the
transactions carried out in Branch 126023 which I understand to be the
Branch that the defendant managed.

I would like to re-iterate that my expertise relates to the Horizon system only
and not to Post Office Ltd's Back end systems. However such systems are
irrelevant to the Branch accounts that are produced on Horizon since any
externally initiated transactions (such as Transaction Corrections and
Remittances which will be discussed later) must be authorised by a User of
the Horizon system in the Branch before they are included in the Branch's
accounts.

Specifically, in section 1.2.1 he hypothesises that "The User Interface gives rise to
incorrect data entry: poor user experience design and inadequately user experience testing can
give rise to poor data entry quality.". Although I was not responsible for the Design

In Section 1.2.2 there is the hypothesis that 'The Horizon system fails to properly
process transactions: accounting systems are usually carefully designed to ensure that accounts
balance after each "double entry" transaction.'                  Horizon is indeed designed to use
"double entry" transactions. Further Professor McLachlan refers to the need




Finally, in Section 1.2.3 there is the Hypothesis that "External systems across the
wider Post Office Limited Operating Environment provide incorrect externally entered
information to the Horizon accounts through system or operator error outside Horizon.". I am

not quite clear what Professor McLachlan is referring to here.                            However
what I can say is that any transaction that is recorded on Horizon must be
authorised by a User of the Horizon system who is taking responsibility for
the impact that such a transaction (has) on the Branch's accounts. There

Specifically, the report states "It was not possible to examine the process for introducing
Transaction Corrections that can give rise to changes in the cash that Horizon records at the
branch".        As I have stated earlier in this statement, any Transaction
Correction that has been generated by the external Post Office Ltd systems
must be explicitly accepted into the Branch's accounts by an appropriate
User.        In many cases there is the opportunity to reject the Transaction
Correction allowing a separate process to agree whether or not it is valid
before it is accepted into the accounts (perhaps give an example).
Therefore, I would say that it is not necessary to examine the process for
generating Transaction Corrections. Please also explain how a transaction
correction comes about. It isn't a mechanical message from the back-end
but an evidence-based, human decision. An example may help — eg. Cash
in pouch on inspection doesn't match the Horizon record.


The next Bullet states "It was not possible to examine the processes for Remittances (the
movement of cash and stock) into and out of the branch that changes the cash and stock that
Horizon records at the branch." Again, any Remittance into the Branch has to be

explicitly accepted by the User (who will have had the opportunity physically
to count the cash) and a receipt is produced stating the amount that is being
introduced into the Branch accounts. Should this differ in any way from the

amount recorded on the cash pouch or the amount of cash found inside the
pouch, there are processes to query such differences. Therefore, I would
say that it is not necessary to examine the process for generating
Remittances.


The third bullet states "It was not possible to examine the processes for revaluing foreign
currency which could change the value of cash held at the branch.".          Revaluation of

Finally, the 4th bullet states "It was not possible to examine the processes of reconciliation
conducted by the Post Office that could give rise to Transaction Corrections.".   As Stated
earlier this is not really relevant since any Transaction Corrections will have
been accepted by the User into the Branch accounts and should not be
accepted if not understood. Accepting a Transaction Correction implicitly
means taking responsibility for that in accounting terms.

vouchers are not normally generated there either.


In Section 2.3 of his report, Professor McLachlan looks at hypothetical
issues with Data Entry. Section 2.3.1 looks at the calibration of the touch
screen.        I accept the fact that a misaligned touch screen could certainly
cause confusion to the User and result in incorrect buttons being activated.
However I don't understand how Professor McLachlan is suggesting that
such a misalignment would cause discrepancies within the accounts
(perhaps invite M to give examples). Presumably the instructions and
figures produced on the screen would alert the user immediately to a
problem.


In section 2.3.2, Professor McLachlan states that "Poor user interface design can
contribute to poor data entry quality and user ertrors.". I agree with this as a statement.

However Professor McLachlan makes no attempt to explain in what way the
Horizon User Interface design is "Poor". As I stated earlier one of the key
goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it could
be used by Users with no IT experience. A significant amount of effort was
put into designing and agreeing the User Interface with Post Office Ltd.

Later in this section, Professor McLachlan claims "the 'Fast Cash' button is
demonstrated to be a source of data entry error (the reversals confirm this)."_                   I don't agree
with that. I can see no evidence to support this statement. The fact that
there are reversals following a failed Debit card transaction is due to the fact
that some transactions cannot be abandoned and need to be settled and
then reversed. This was a specific requirement on Horizon from Post Office
Ltd. The fact that this has been done shows that the user was well aware of
the failure of the Debit Card transaction and followed normal process when
the failure occurred.

Professor McLachlan explores issues with training of the Users in section
2.3.4 of his report. I support his finding regarding discrepancies in cash in
almost every period. Can you expand on this and explain in layman's terms,
perhaps giving a couple of examples? I do not understand exactly what M is
referring to and your agreement might be interpreted as a concession that
the Crown's case is entirely flawed. Discrepancies are always to be
expected. What is not to be expected is that daily errors will be ignored but
that then, at the end of the branch trading period, the SPM will show a
considerable deal of competence by balancing the branch with carefully
fictitious figures. Isn't it usually possible for an SPM to discover the source
of a mistake and correct it? Won't any SFM look under every possible stone
to find the cause of the problem? Isn't it implausible that there would be so
many smal l mistakes leading to a £75,000 loss? Are there discrepancies
that result in a surplus? If not, why should the "mistakes" always go one
way? M seems surprised that thefts over a long period should go
undiscovered. This is rubbish_ If a SPM is cooking the books only an audit
wi ll reveal the truth.                I also did an analysis of the daily cash movements

down the drain. However there is no evidence that this is down to any sort of
System failure. Further I would suggest that smal l discrepancies are to be
expected in such an environment due to mistakes in giving change etc. My

Cheques to a face value of $1,000. Therefore following through Professor
McLachlan's scenario, the system initially has $1,000 of Travellers'
Cheques. When a customer purchases one Travel lers' Cheque for $100,
then this will be reflected by reducing the stock of Travellers' Cheques by
100, leaving 900 Travellers' Cheques in stock. This would be reflected on
the Stock Report.




discussed this scenario with me and that I "acknowledge that this is a known feature
of Horizon and that the Post Office have not instructed Fujitsu to change the system to produce a
meaningful stock report.". I don't recall any such discussion. I have seen such a

scenario described in a separate report that Professor McLachlan has




here in simple terms how your experiments refuted the theory, again so this




incorrect with the system as Professor McLachlan suggests.
Therefore I would contend that section 2.4.2 of the report is irrelevant. What
do you think of his suggestion that a staff member will be tempted to make a
manual correction to a perceived problem? Isn't this in fact something that
should never be done?

In Section 2.5.1,                 Professor McLachlan looks again at Transaction
Corrections. Here he refers to Appendix G of his report which describes
some analysis I have done concerning transaction Corrections (my email on
this is actually is in Appendix D of the report). This shows that if we analyse
all Transaction Corrections during the 13 month period that the net value is
£1,840.         I've subsequently gone over the data again and found some
additional transaction corrections that have been processed and the total
net value of all such Transaction Corrections is actually slightly less namely
£1,619.43.


He then refers to a slightly wider scope that he has taken in Appendix J
where he comes up with an absolute value of £82,918.35 (though a net
value of £19.257.21).                  1 have now had a chance to examine this data in
more detai l and have the fol lowing observations to make on Professor
McLachlan's analysis:


             I still need to do this analysis, so I'll come hack to this.                  1
Later on in the section Professor McLachlan states "There is no record of Misra
requesting evidence in the transactions provided between 1 Dec 06 and 31 Dec 07. ". This iS

incorrect. There was one such example on 13th December 2006 and two
more on 14th March 2007. I accept that I had omitted these from my initial
analysis.

Finally, towards the end of the section Professor McLachlan hypothesises
"There are missing Transaction Corrections which would reduce the cash balance expected by the
Horizon system (i.e. be in favour of Misra).". This may indeed be true. Why? Isn't

this wishful thinking by M? There is no evidential basis whatsoever for his
assertion., Have the transaction corrections disappeared by magic? However
my understanding is that normal ly branches are well aware of such errors
and would have contacted Post Office Ltd to enquire as to why no
Transaction Correction was being made in favour of the branch.


Section 2.5.2 of the report discusses remittances.                                     However I don't
understand the relevance of this discussion to the case.                                     Professor
McLachlan mentions that my analysis "identified a pattern or remittance transactions
which is consistent with Misra's statement that she declared cash held in remittance pouches in the
safe which was not actually present.". In my view is this not an indication of guilt?

September 2010 and so there are no longer any Horizon counter systems to
examine. Isn't it in fact impossible to perform helpful lab condition
experiments? You would need a Misra clone. M shouldn't need to conduct
experiments ® he should be guided by Misra who was on the scene at the
time. Doesn't the fact that Misra appears to provide no guidance at al l
suggest that there was no computer problem?

Section 3.1 queries why it took Post Office Ltd so long to notice the pattern
of discrepancies.                  Much of the detai led information regarding such
discrepancies is only available within the branch to assist the sub-
postmaster in managing their branch and so is not routinely available to
Post Office Ltd until and investigation is carried out as in this case. As I
mention above, if the SPM is fiddling the accounts only an audit will uncover
the problem_ Misra would have known this.
