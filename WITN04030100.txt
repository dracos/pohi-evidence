POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MR PAUL RICH

I, MR PAUL RICH, will say as follows...

Introduction

1. 1, Mr Paul Rich, previously employed by Post Office Counters Limited
("POCL"), provide this statement in response to the request under Rule 9 of
the Inquiry Rules 2006 dated 7 June 2022. This statement relates to Phase 2
of the Inquiry: Horizon IT system: procurement, design, roll out and

modifications.

2. | make this statement to the best of my recollection. Some of the documents
provided to me by the Inquiry | had not previously seen and, where that is the
case, | have highlighted this in my statement. | have answered all the questions

asked by the Inquiry in good faith and as openly and honestly as | am able.

Career background

3. | began my career working in a mixture of Marketing, Commercial and General

Management roles in the private sector.

4. In March 1987, | joined the POCL Marketing Department.

5. In August 1993, | was promoted to a business head of the Marketing
Department with the courtesy title of Financial Markets Director. This role
included, amongst other things, responsibility for the Benefits Agency as a

POCL client.

6. In September 1995, | was appointed Partnership Development Director (again
a courtesy title). In this role, | reported to the POCL Executive Resources
Director. | attended the POCL Executive, although | was not a member. The

focus of my role was to take forward the Horizon project post-evaluation.

7. In April 1996, | was appointed as a member of the POCL Executive. | worked
as a Development Director reporting to the POCL Managing Director. An
internal newsbrief of my appointment dated 2 April 1996 is exhibited to my

statement (WITN0403_01/1

). The focus of my role was the
Horizon project, including the day-to-day sponsorship of the Programme
Delivery Authority ("PDA") on behalf of POCL. It is worth highlighting that the

PDA formally reported via the PDA Board (of which | was a member) to the

Page 2 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

new Programme Steering Committee ("PSC"). Both the PDA Board and the

PSC were multi-organisational bodies.

8. In March 1997, | became a POCL Company Director.

9. In March 1999, | left POCL and took up a new role as Managing Director of
Customer Management for the entire Royal Mail ("RM") Group. Given my
knowledge of Horizon, | carried on providing strategic advice on the project's
strategy and roll out until late May 1999. In June 1999, | formally resigned from
my POCL Company Director role. After this point, | had very little personal

involvement in the Horizon project (but see paragraph 12 below).

10.In 1999, as part of a PO reorganisation, POCL was split into three business
units each with its own new Managing Director: Network (including the Horizon
roll out); Banking Services; and Cash Handling & Distribution. The three MDs
reported to a Group MD sitting on the Group Executive Board. This Group

Executive Board then reported to the Group CEO.

11.In November 2001, Post Office Limited ("POL") recombined these three

business units into one company as a subsidiary of the RM Group.

12.|In August 2001, | was appointed Acting Group Managing Director of POL whilst
external recruitment for a new POL CEO was carried out. My temporary role

reported to the PO Group CEO and | attended the main PO Board but not as

Page 3 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

a member of it. When POL was incorporated in November 2001, | became a

company director of it until the new recruit was in post.

13. By April 2002, a permanent POL CEO was in place. | ceased my acting group
MD role and resigned my POL company directorship at the same time. | was
then appointed Group Corporate Development Director working on short-term

projects for the PO Chairman and Chief Executive.

14.In November 2002, | was promoted to Deputy Managing Director and
Marketing Director of RM and became a member of the RM Group executive

board and a company director of RM Group.

15.In September 2004, due to restructuring of roles and directorships, | ceased to

be a RM Group director.

16.In early 2005, | left the RM Group. | subsequently became an NED/Chair in
both the public and private sector. | am now retired from paid work and |

volunteer as an NED Governor of a not-for-profit hospital.

Background to my involvement in Horizon

17.A helpful chronology of the Horizon project appears at Appendix 3 of the
National Audit Office Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General "The

Cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card Project" ("the NAO report")

Page 4 of 55
WITN04030100

WITN04030100

published on 18 August 2000 (WITN0403_01/2, POL00000805). | have read

this report to refresh my memory of the details of the project.

18.As mentioned in paragraph 5, from August 1993 | headed up the Marketing
Business Unit for all financial service clients, including the Benefits Agency
("BA"). In this role, | became responsible for the perennial annual contracts

with BA.

19.At the time the BA were the Post Office's largest client, and the revenue from
handling benefits payments accounted for over a third of POCL's income (see
page 23 of the NAO report (WITN0403_01/2, POL00000805)). Individuals
coming into post offices to collect their benefits monies then also used other
POCL services and co-located private retail outlets. Moreover, BA work
underpinned the underlying cash distribution balance that post offices fulfilled
nationally. This balance was made up largely of cash benefits being paid out,
with corporate deposit business paid in, via the recently privatised Girobank's
corporate deposit service for businesses at post offices. Losing BA as a client
would have led to many post office closures, estimated to be in excess of 4,500
closures, and a likely spiral of decline for POCL. It would also have led to a

sudden huge imbalance of cash distribution nationally.

20.BA were determined to move towards Automated Credit Transfer ("ACT") and

replace the existing paper-based methods of paying social security benefits

Page 5 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

with a far more automated system. BA believed this would save transaction

costs and provide better fraud protection.

2

.POCL wanted to retain business with BA as long as practically possible. | was
involved in numerous other commercial projects to enhance the viability of
POCL and make best use of its assets and infrastructure, such as selling
national lottery tickets and offering Bureau de Change services. We were also
undertaking studies and creating models to consider POCL's other commercial
options, but essentially POCL needed a managed transition if benefits were

going to move to ACT with a resulting loss of a large part of our business.

22.POCL also could see the benefits of automation for the post office, as explored
in the Government's Green Paper on the future of the Post Office dated June
1994 (WITN0403_01/3, RLITO000002) ("the Green Paper"). Automation had
the potential to link all the post offices in the future via an electronic national

network, and generate new business.

23.1 was involved in the internal POCL discussions to debate the potential
automation of social security benefits. A meeting note of these discussions on
30 July 1993 can be seen at WITN0403_01/4, POL00028137. At this point, |

was the designate Director, Financial Markets.

24.1 took on the role of the commercial lead in and was an architect of the

Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") negotiations with BA, which was to

Page 6 of 55
WITN04030100

WITN04030100

underpin a transition in our relationship and support what became the Horizon
programme. POCL needed a medium term commitment with BA with a
tapering floor level of business so that the relationship did not come to a
sudden end (and did not need to continue to be negotiated annually). POCL
were willing to commit to help commission an automated, cheaper and less
fraud prone way of paying benefits. To help with our negotiations for the MOU,
POCL brought in consultants and commissioned various financial models and
we postulated various assumptions, and involved BA in these, to work up a

viable model.

25.We ultimately secured an 8-year agreement with BA. A MOU was
subsequently signed between POCL and the BA Finance Director with an
agreement to procure a new benefit payment card. This was an in principle
agreement with much of the detail of the project still to be decided. | have not

been provided with a copy of this MOU.

26.We recognised that in due course the relationship between POCL and BA
would need to be formalised in contractual documents. It was identified that
these contracts would need to be back to back with contracts signed with the
ultimate benefits payment card supplier, and would also involve the Social
Security Agency in Northern Ireland ("SSA"). Therefore, we needed to await
formal appointment of the supplier before finalising more detailed contractual
arrangements with the BA and the SSA — though Heads of Terms were

progressed as much as possible in this period.

Procurement of Horizon — Early 1994 to May 1996

27.Once the MOU had been signed, POCL's focus moved to the procurement
process to procure a new IT system. We commissioned a joint feasibility
study after which the procurement process was actioned jointly for a new
platform and benefit payment card. Getting to this point involved a lot of buy

in across government and with other stakeholders such as sub-postmasters.

28. During the procurement process, | was a member of the Project Evaluation
Board. The Project Evaluation Board was chaired by one of POCL's
Executive Directors Bob Peaple. The Project Evaluation Board's aim was to
create evaluation criteria that the suppliers could be reviewed objectively
against and with the right arms-length expertise (see paragraph 35 for the
Value Assessment Model). As a member, | gave my input into the evaluation
criteria including on customer acceptability and operational use by agents in
offices. The Project Evaluation Board then reported their recommendations

to a steering committee (see paragraph 31 below).

29.1 have been asked by the Inquiry to describe the purpose of the PSC. The
PSC was not created until after the contract was awarded to Pathway in May
1996. The purpose of the PSC was to steer the strategic decision making
process. As described in the Project Initiation Document for the Programme
Delivery Authority (WITN0403_01/5, FUJ00079001) pages 13 and 14, the

PSC had the ultimate authority to monitor, review and ensure the successful

Page 8 of 55
WITN04030100

WITN04030100

completion of the Horizon programme. The PSC worked under PRINCE

project principles.

30. The PSC comprised of the Managing Director of POCL, the Chief Executive

31.

32.

of BA, the Chief Executive of SSA and the Chief Executive of ICL. The PDA
Programme Director and the BA Project Director were attendees. Although |
attended the PSC, | was not a member. The MD of POCL sat on the
committee as a member and represented our organisation (please see page
14 of the Project Initiation document produced by the PDA dated November
1996 WITN0403_01/5, FUJ00079001). The PDA board reported the project's
progress to the PSC. A useful diagram of the organisations involved after the
contract was awarded to Pathway can be seen at figure 17 of the NAO report

(WITN0403_01/2, POL00000805).

During the procurement stages there was however a steering committee. |
did not sit on the steering committee and it was mostly comprised of senior
officials such as individuals from the Department for Trade and Industry
("DTI"), Department for Social Security ("DSS") and Treasury. As far as | can
recall, the steering committee was disbanded once the procurement was

concluded and replaced by the PSC.

POCL's objectives in procuring the new IT system are explained in

paragraphs 19, 21, and 22 above. The Green Paper (WITN0403_01/3,

RLIT0000002) explains that automation was seen as the best way to secure

Page 9 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

the network". It was vital for the Post Office to maintain their business as a
long-term choice for customers, improve their competitiveness in the market,
enable better customer choice and service, as well as maintain ties to the

BA.

33. The system was procured under the Private Finance Initiative ("PFI"). This
was a relatively new concept at the time and | recall it was government
policy, as a result of Treasury Guidance in the late 1980s, to consider this
option for the funding of projects such as this. Using PFI was seen to have a
number of benefits. As explained in the paper seeking PO Board authority to
proceed to the contract award stage of the counter automation project
(WITN0403_01/6, POL00028450), using PFI meant that a strategic alliance
could be forged with a private sector supplier. This brought in numerous
private sector skills such as those in product development and marketing.
The nature of the PFI contract meant that there was no capital investment by
POCL and that they would pay for the system as they used it, making the
project financially viable. Crucially, it also enabled the risks of the project
(such as the risks of benefit fraud and the risks of design, build, installation,
and operation of the system) to be passed onto the service provider. Neither
POCL nor BA had the resources or appetite to carry these risks themselves,
and so this became a critically important criterion for the bids to meet. This
was especially true for BA on the transfer of the risk of benefit fraud upon
which their own DSS business case was built. It was always clear from the

outset that numerous factors meant that the project would not be feasible as

Page 10 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

a joint venture, and that BA were opposed to POCL funding and owning the
system (see page 3 of the Investment Appraisal Commentary for BA/POCL

automation WITN0403_01/7, POL00028452).

34. However, using PFI did not mean that full control of all aspects of the project
would pass to the service provider. For example, BA ensured that business
rules relating to benefit encashments would not lie with the bidder. It was
understood that the businesses procuring the services each had certain pre-
requisite. For, POCL we needed to be assured that systems interfaces would
operate smoothly; that the system was easy to operate by agents; and would

not result in any deterioration in the service for customers.

35.As outlined in paragraph 28 above, during the procurement process | sat on
the multi-organisation Project Evaluation Board chaired by POCL's Executive
Director. | gave my input into the evaluation criteria. The Value Assessment
Model, which was a generic model that we collectively customised and
weighted according to the needs of the BA/POCL project, details how we
valued a good bidder for the contract and can be seen at WITN0403_01/8,

POL00028275.

36.When it came to evaluating the bids, in accordance with good procurement
practice, a separate assessment team scored how the bids met our criteria.
The assessment team reported their recommendation to the Project

Evaluation Board. The Project Evaluation Board then passed its

Page 11 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

recommendations on to the various stakeholders. In POCL the
recommendation would require approval from the Major Projects Expenditure
Committee ("MaPEC"), the PO Board Finance Authority, and the PO Board
itself. Concurrences towards that had to be given by POCL's MD
strategically, and from Group IT for technical concurrence. Members of the
POCL Marketing Department were also consulted to check the market

benefits claimed in the bids.

37.An embryonic joint PDA team was set up to help run the procurement and
evaluation/contracting process headed up by an individual from the DSS.
This team was later replaced in May 1996 by the joint PDA as described in
paragraph 44 below. The embryonic PDA drew upon best practice at the time
for procurement under OJEU rules, and had its own technical, commercial
and operational teams. WITN0403_01/9, POL00031279 is a letter from me in
February 1996, reaching out to the relatively new Group IT Director, clarifying
his role in technical concurrence. External experts were also called on by
POCL and the embryonic PDA as required, including external financial
advisors (e.g. Charterhouse), lawyers and modelling experts such as
Coopers & Lybrand. The embryonic PDA helped assess the bids against our
criteria, and provided options to the joint Project Evaluation Board and

ultimately the steering committee for decisions.

38.As far as | can recall, the project received many expressions of interest. After

the issuing of a Statement of Service Requirements, five potential suppliers

Page 12 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

went through to the next stage, and then three bidders were sent an
Invitation to Tender ("ITT"). Before issuing the formal ITT, a series of
discussions took place with relevant technical and market experts to
understand the impacts of the bids and see if any requirements would need
to be amended. | believe that these discussions would have been initiated by
the embryonic PDA or by PO's Group IT director or his team. Evidence of
these discussions between January and early March 1996 can be seen in
WITN0403_ 01/10, POL00031278; WITN0403_01/11, POL00031277;
WITN0403_ 01/12, POL00031275; WITN0403_01/13, POL00031276 and
WITN0403_ 01/9, POL00031279 (although some of these documents are
difficult to read). | recall that it was part of the Treasury Guidance for PFI
projects to encourage enterprise in the delivery of the project, but as outlined
above, there were certain requirements or "hurdles" and application of

business requirements from POCL and BA that had to be met.

39. During procurement, some risks were identified in Pathway's bid (which was
at that stage just referred to as "Dick"). The risks included:
a. the proposed technical solution;
b. the card technology;
c. fraud risk on the card;
d. Pathway's financial structure; and
e. the dependence that Pathway placed on their sub-contractor Escher

who was a small company.

Page 13 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

40. The Project Evaluation Board considered these risks in detail, as can be

4

seen in the meeting note from the Evaluation Board Meeting dated 26
February 1996 (WITN0403_01/14, POL00028288). The board considered
whether Pathway's suggestion of adopting an integrated circuit ("IC") card
would have helped clear the risk, but concluded that this would introduce
more risks. Instead, reflecting the risks and issues against them, it was
understood that Pathway would be allocated a substantial cost penalty in the
Value Factor assessment, and the Evaluation Board would give due weight

to this in reaching their decision.

.During this meeting, at para 2.8 page 3, Tony Johnson explained that after

much consideration, the Demonstrator team had concluded that the
Pathway's solution was not "fundamentally flawed" and that "from a strictly
technical viewpoint the hurdle had been cleared". | cannot recall who the
Demonstrator Team were, but they operated within the embryonic PDA
(please see page 3 of the Value Assessment Model WITN0403_01/8,
POL00028275). In addition, the PO Group IT director had to give technical
concurrence that the system would be acceptable as part of the approval of
the business case by the PO Board (please see my letter to the Group IT
director WITN0403_01/9, POL00031279; and page 6 of the PO Board paper:

regarding BA/POCL automation WITN0403_01/15, POL00031237).

42.Given the identified concerns about the financial structure, during the

procurement process the Evaluation Board enlisted the help of

Page 14 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

Charterhouse, financing and business strategy specialists, to evaluate the

tisks and advise whether some of the outstanding issues could be resolved.

43. By the time that Pathway was chosen as the provider, the risk against
Pathway's financial structure and dependence on its sub-contractor had also
been cleared. There were still some high level details that had yet to be
agreed between the parties. From memory, these were twofold: a) who led
the consortium as the prime accountable organisation; and b) would there be
parent company guarantees or similar. The Evaluation Board accepted that
to proceed with Pathway implied a degree of risk but agreed that such risks
were acceptable and manageable (as per the NAO report chronology at
WITN0403_01/2, POLO0000805). Eventually these were resolved with
Charterhouse's specialist advice as documented on page 2 of the revised

business case document WITN0403_01/16, POL00029120.

44. In parallel with the eventual decision to appoint Pathway, and in order to
mitigate any risks, the joint PDA was to be set up to act as assurance body.
Independent reviews were also regularly undertaken as part of the mitigation
of risk to keep an eye on the project, including those undertaken by PA
Consulting. One such review undertaken by PA Consulting and titled 'Review
of BA-POCL Programme’ is WITN0403_01/17, POL00028092. Please also
see paragraph 55 below. Commercial contracts between POCL and BA were
completed after the award of the contract to Pathway, to ensure that the

back-to-back agreements were aligned. Over time, as described below,

Page 15 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

further testing was put in place and resources were made available in the

post office network to support training and installation.

45.The JSC made the final decision to award the contract to Pathway based on
the Project Board's recommendations supported by ministers and the PO
Board. A decisive factor in the selection of Pathway was that they were the
only bidder to be PFI compliant in terms of risk transfer including the risk of
benefit fraud. As previously explained in paragraph 33, this was critically
important, particularly to the BA. Pathway also had to be acceptable on a
number of factors, including cost, technical acceptability, and usability by

agents and customers, and the potential to develop partnerships.

Implementation of Horizon — May 1996 to February 1997

46. After BA and POCL had jointly awarded the contract to Pathway in May
1996, the implementation of Horizon begun. There were some known risks
with the implementation (as set out above) and some which emerged,
including that Pathway underestimated the difficulties with roll out to Post

Offices and the training time required.

47.Some post offices were not easily suitable for IT infrastructure, as they did
not have the necessary space or equipment. Moreover, Pathway
underestimated the amount of new software development needed from its
sub-contractors e.g. Escher. A further issue was that the BA/DSS Customer

Accounting and Payments System ("CAPS") which was to feed data to

Page 16 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

Pathway's Card systems, was not ready for the new automation (please see

para 1.13 of the NAO report WITN0403_01/2, POL00000805).

48. During the early implementation of Horizon, following evaluation and contract
award, | was appointed Partnership Development Director in September
1995 reporting to POCL’ s Resources Executive Director, who had also
previously chaired the Evaluation Board (see paragraph 6 above). In April
1996, | was then appointed Development Director, reporting to POCL’s MD
(see paragraph 7 above) as a member of its executive. | was responsible for
the day-to-day sponsorship, inter alia, of the PDA on behalf of POCL. The
PDA formally reported to the multi organisation PDA Board of which | was a
member. The PDA Board reported to the multi organisation PSC (see
paragraphs 29 and 30 above). Therefore, although | had a certain mandate

from POCL, | was not the ultimate decision maker.

49. In late 1997, following the diminution of the PDA, POCL appointed its own
Horizon Programme Director to focus on implementation for POCL, reporting
himself to POCL’s MD. My focus was then on strategic or commercial issues

in relation to Horizon for POCL.

50.1 would like to clarify that Mena Rego did not replace me as POCL's
Development Director at any point. Mena's role was Head of Horizon
Development within the POCL and she reported to me, whilst | was the

POCL Development Director. Mena Rego is described as my ‘substitute’ on

Page 17 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

the Automation Transformation Steering Group at page 9 of the Report on
Automation Change Programme and Control (WITN0403_01/18,
POL00031271) because she would have acted on my behalf if | was unable

to attend a meeting.

Development and Testing of Horizon — February 1997 to Spring 1998

51. The extent | was involved in the development and testing of Horizon was as
a member of the PDA Board. | received testing reports as part of the monthly
progress reports received by the Board. There were two types of testing
undertaken: 1) testing to ensure usability of the system; and 2) "end to end"
testing to ensure that the authorisation systems were working for the BA,
and, for example, to check that individuals were not being authorised twice

for benefits.

52.1 also kept an eye on the progress in relation to technical concurrences by
discussing these with our IT colleagues. This can be seen for example in my
Horizon Technical Concurrence note of 3 March 1997 (WITN0403_01/19,
POL00028142) which sought to identify specific timed deliverables on issues

around additional technical testing and monitoring.

53.In my role as POCL sponsor for the PDA, | helped to ensure that the proper
testing methodology was in place, and remained uncompromised despite
delays. We included a staged approach to rollout, with a limited number of

post offices participating at each stage. This was so we could ensure that

Page 18 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

testing was accurate and the system was acceptable to users (please see

paragraph 66).

54.In 1997, it was decided by the PDA with sponsor support that there would be
a series of re-plans, the first of which was in February 1997. By spring 1997,
the project underwent a 'no fault replan'. Version 3 of this 'no fault replan' can
be seen at WITN0403_ 01/20, POL00028186. The multi-organisational PDA
liaised with ICL, and debated and approved this replan, as can be seen in the
ICL Pathway Monthly Progress Report of February 1997 (WITN0403_01/21,
FUJ00079044) and page 5 of the PDA Board Meeting minutes of 20 March

1997 (WITN0403_01/22, POL00028158).

55.Bird and Bird commissioned an independent report of the project in March
1998, and this was completed by Project Mentors. Page 7 of the draft of the
Independent Review report (WITN0403_01/23, POL00038828) provides a
useful explanation of some of the causes of this replan. The main catalyst for
the replan was the existence of slippages in the rollout timetable. Bird and
Bird attribute the majority of these delays to the fact that Pathway “seriously
under-estimated the effort and time needed to develop the services when
they prepared their proposal" and since the replan in February 1997, did not
allocate "sufficient resources to complete their contracted obligations within
the agreed timescale." | also recall that there was an issue with Escher, one
of Pathway's sub-contractors, which meant that software integration was not

as simple as Pathway had initially anticipated.

Page 19 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

56.As can be seen on page 10 of the draft report (WITN0403_01/23,
POL00038828), both BA and POCL were willing to scrutinise and re-examine
our actions leading to the no-fault replan in case there were any lessons we
could learn or changes that needed to be made. Taking note of Pathway's
programme review that the biggest cause of delay was security, the PDA
Board decided to commission a review of BA/POCL Security Requirements
from PA Consulting Group. Our objective was to check that our initial
Security Requirements had been appropriate for a PFl procurement of this
nature. The PA Consulting report dated October 1997 (WITN0403_01/17,
POL00028092) found no justification in Pathway's claims and no fault in PDA

or Sponsor actions.

57. The causes of the delay in the Horizon roll out were the same as the causes

of the no-fault replan (the replan took place because of delays).

58.DSS BA, POCL and ICL all felt the impact of the Horizon delays. For DSS
BA, these delays materially damaged their business case for the project. BA
had been predicting a fraud saving of £15 million per month according to the
NAO report (WITN0403_01/2, POL00000805) with the new card, which was
by this point seriously delayed. My perception at the time was that the delays
seriously damaged the confidence and political will within DSS. BA began to
reconsider their future involvement in the project. In 1992 before the genesis

of the project, BA had favoured an earlier and much more wide-ranging use

Page 20 of 55
WITN04030100

WITN04030100

of ACT, and this option was looking more and more appealing especially
since their systems were now better able to cope with large-scale
automation. Evidence to show DSS' diminishing confidence in the project can
be seen in the later letter from Stuart Sweetman regarding POCL's position
on negotiations with ICL dated December 1998 (WITN0403_01/24,
POL00028326). | have now seen this document, which highlights the risks of

continuing with the project from DSS' perspective.

59. For ICL Pathway, the delays damaged cash flow. Due to the PFI nature of

the contract, Pathway had yet to be paid the amount of money that they were

expecting for the project at the outset.

60. The delays were damaging for POCL too as they delayed other functionality

61.

planned in future releases and the national network. POCL had initially
planned for automation to extend beyond the benefits payment card to other
areas of the Post Office. The delay in the Horizon project pushed back this
automation and started to affect POCL's market position and other

commercial services we wanted to be able to offer.

The PDA, with sponsor support, decided that it was preferable not to litigate,
but rather to conduct a replan on a 'no fault’ basis with additional resources
promised (please see paragraph 54 above). However, to retain the possibility

of litigation in future, a formal breach of contract notice was issued by PDA to

Page 21 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

ICL Pathway on behalf of all sponsors in November 1997. A copy of this

breach of contract notice can be seen at WITN0403_01/25, POL00028442.

62. Throughout 1997, it was reported to the PDA Board that there were some
technical difficulties with Horizon. The first difficulty experienced was that
there was a difficulty in signing off “end to end" security for BA (i.e. ensuring
that benefits transactions and their authorisation were secure). A second
difficulty was that the software development was behind schedule for POCL
assurances. A third difficulty was the practical installation of the system. As
seen in paragraph 47 above, the Post Office network was vast and not all
offices had the same level of space and equipment. This, along with other

factors such as problems with utility companies, led to installation difficulties.

63.At this point, it is crucial to mention that an Independent Report conducted by
PA Consulting dated October 1997 (WITN0403_01/17, POL00028092) found
no fundamental technical issues with the system. However, it did mention
that there needed to be commitment from all three parties for the system to

succeed.

64. Despite the technical difficulties experienced, POCL refused to shift our
insistence on proper and thorough testing before approval releases or rolling
out to more post offices. This can be seen in the PDA Board minutes from
August 1997 (WITN0403_01/26, POL00028311) paragraph 2.3 where it is

explained that more emphasis was being placed on live trial and quality

Page 22 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

rather than speed. We were unwilling to forsake this testing for the sake of

completing the roll out of the project at an earlier date.

65. Moreover, in order to improve testing, we initiated a Review of Testing.
Subsequently, representatives from ICL Pathway and PDA Security teams
were tasked with producing joint proposals for ensuring that any security
related problems were identified early and that appropriate planning activity
was undertaken (see the minutes of the PSC Meeting dated 24 September

1997 (WITN0403_01/27, POL0002844

66. Alongside this increase in testing, in order to address the technical
difficulties, we created a more realistic replan of future schedules in terms of
timing and scope. We shifted the timescales and scaled down the number of
operational post offices we wished to achieve by the end of each month.
Evidence of this can be seen in the PDA Board minutes from 15 July 1997
WITN0403_01/28, POL00028317 e.g. in Matters arising and at paragraph
2.4.5; and at page 2 of the Minutes of the PSC Meeting of 15 July 1997

WITN0403_01/29, POL00028448.

67.We also created a more realistic replan in terms of the content that we
wanted within the post offices, focusing on a few key essential elements. An
example of such contingency replanning can be seen on page 5 of
WITN0403_01/30, POL00028534 which relates to a further software release

(Congo Release 4 (Pathway 1c)) and fallback options where it is explained

Page 23 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

that the focus was on testing and emphasis was placed on satisfactory

resolution of priority faults and error correction.

68. This was my understanding of the technical difficulties with Horizon at the
time but | would also add that those Post Offices to whom the service had
been rolled out largely reported that it was going ok. They did not raise many
technical difficulties and indeed many post offices who did not yet have

access to the system were saying that they wanted it.

69. Furthermore, the natural forum to raise these difficulties would have been at
the meetings between the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters ("NFSP")
executives and the POCL Network Director (the Meetings of the Negotiating
Committee). | have read the reports of these meetings provided to me by the
Inquiry at WITNO403_01/31, NFSP00000137; and WITN0403_ 01/32,
NFSP00000483. The only technical concerns raised in these documents
were that the platform for CAPS was a long way behind schedule (page 8 of
WITN0403_01/32, NFSP00000483) and that the Horizon platform was not
capable of processing APT (automated payment of bills transactions)
(WITN0403_01/32, NFSP00000483, page 8). | was not in attendance at

these meetings and this is the first time that | have seen these reports.

70. For completeness, | have also read the internal NFSP National Executive

Council meeting reports provided to me by the Inquiry (WITN0403_ 01/33,

NFSP00000504; WITN0403_01/34, NFSP00000452; WITN0403_01/35,

Page 24 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

NFSP00000468; and WITN0403_01/36, NFSP00000494). I have not seen
these reports before and they span across the period from October 1996 to
October 1997. Although reference is made to the delays in the Horizon roll
out, no overriding technical issues were reported during this period. The only
technical concerns mentioned are a passing remark of screens freezing
(WITN0403_01/33, NFSP00000504, page 52), issues with CAPs
(WITN0403_01/36, NFSP00000494, page 18), and a brief reference to a lack
of APT machines in post offices (WITN0403_01/34, NFSP00000452, page
26) and the practicalities of installation. In fact, in the early meetings, the
NSFP showed real support towards the Horizon project (WITN0403_ 01/33,

NFSP00000504, page 7).

. During this period in 1997 and early 1998, | had a small amount of
engagement with government officials. |, along with Mena Rego, Dave Miller,
Stuart Sweetman and potentially John Roberts, would receive calls from the
DTI principal and his assistant. | was responsive to their requests but did not
initiate contact during this period. | recall that Mena and the DTI assistant
spoke more regularly, and that Stuart did have some face-to-face contact
with ministers. The individuals within the POCL who would have had the
most interaction with ministers would have either been the MD of POCL or

the CEO of PO.

72. As a team we also created status reports for DTI ministers who had been

engaged to work up options for ministers across government in view of

Page 25 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

breach. An example of such status reports can be seen in the note of a
telephone call dated March 1998 (WITN0403_01/37, POL00028639). This
document records my providing DTI officials (in this case David Sibbick) with
information so that the DTI could lay out options. These status reports were

often requested by DTI officials on behalf of their Ministers.

Delays to the Horizon project - Spring 1998 to Autumn 1998

73. Between the spring and autumn of 1998, there were further delays to the

revised Master plan dated April 1997.

74. During this period | remained on the PDA board, however | was brought into
more and more strategic or commercial discussions to help inform decision
authorities beyond the PDA Board. | gave my input into the PSC, the PO
Board, the PO Board's own steering committee (named Counters Automation
Steering Group ("CASG")), as well as cross-government forums advising

Ministers. All of the input | gave was from a POCL point of view.

75. Relationships between ICL Pathway, BA and POCL were breaking down. As
seen in a letter from Keith Todd (WITN0403_01/38, POL00031117), in March
1998 ICL Pathway refuted the breach of contract notice that had been issued
by the PDA in November 1997 (as explained in paragraph 61 above), and
asked for a different approach to the project that they believed was more true
to PFI principles. In this letter, Pathway's CEO mentioned both BA and POCL

were responsible for the project delays, but he placed the majority of the

Page 26 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

blame on BA and asserted that they had misrepresented a true picture of the

availability of their systems.

76. The Government considered strategic options to resolve the project delays.
In September 1998, the Chief Secretary to HMT appointed special advisor
Graham Corbett to broker a new deal within one month between all parties.
His brief was to determine the project's future, including its scope. This
resulted in intense negotiations and a standstill agreement was reached
stating that the parties would continue working together whilst the new deal
was brokered (this standstill agreement is exhibited at WITN0403_01/39,
POL00028444). BA had made it clear during these discussions that there

would be no movement from them or DSS in terms of additional monies.

77.On 18 October 1998, Mr Corbett gave a report to the Chief Secretary at
WITN0403_01/40, POL00028098 that no commercial agreement had been
reached between POCL, BA and ICL Pathway. It can be seen in the report
that POCL were prepared to amend some contract terms (e.g. contract
length or refresh costs), however ICL Pathway refused to make realistic
amendments to the contract. Mr Corbett made a commercial proposal that
BA and POCL were prepared to accept (see Annex C), but ICL refused. Mr
Corbett concluded by determining that the way forward was to continue the

project, as it was likely to be of benefit to all.

Page 27 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

78.As far as | am aware, during this period there were some technical difficulties
experienced with the Congo 4 release. | do also understand that there were
other technical difficulties experienced, such as those described on page 5 of
the draft Project Mentors Independent Review (WITN0403_ 01/23,

POL00038828).

79. In order to combat these difficulties, the release 2 of the Horizon programme
was rescheduled and delayed. Eventually, in April 1999 the PDA and the
Horizon Programme Director for POCL gave an assurance to BA and POCL
that there would be a Release Authorisation. A letter from Dave Miller,
Deputy Director BA/POCL to Vince Gaskell, CAPs & Cards Programme
Director regarding this assurance can be seen at WITN0403_01/41,

POL00028407.

80. There was also an offer by POCL in June 1998 to support in principle a
migration from the benefit payment card to a smartcard/ banking system over
the right period of time. This offer can be seen in the letter from Stuart
Sweetman of POCL to Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of BA, at
WITN0403_01/42, POL00028650. However, the new system needed to be
practically feasible. POCL subsequently rejected several of the Treasury
Working Group's proposals on the basis that they were too risky or not
practically feasible, such as POCL becoming a regulated bank itself, or
POCL bearing the risk for benefit fraud in post office benefit payments. For

examples of these suggestions, please see Stuart Sweetman's letter to Steve

WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

Robson of HM Treasury dated April 1999 at WITN0403_01/43,

POL00028574.

81. | have been asked by the Inquiry to describe the Treasury Working Group
and my involvement in it. In order to try and resolve the project delays, HM
Treasury ("HMT") employed a specialist advisor Adrian Montague. This then
led to the creation of a HMT working group with DSS DTI BA and the Cabinet
Office supported by KPMG. Notes from the second of these meetings which

took place on 25 September 1998 are at WITN0403_01/44, POL00028091.

82. | contributed to the Treasury Working Group by giving my input on options
as they were developed by KPMG and others. However, | was not the POCL
representative and did not attend the Working Group, as this role was filled
by another POCL Director, Jonathan Evans, who was the PO Network

Director at the time.

83.1 understand that the purpose of the Treasury Working Group was to
consider various fallback options for their value for money, and the relative
legal strength of the public sector case if it wanted to withdraw from the
contracts in part or in full. The Group was then to propose to Ministers the

best way going forward.

84. WITN0403_01/45, HMT00000008 is a report completed by KPMG for HMT in

May 1999. It shows that in value for money terms, the best option was to

Page 29 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

carry on with the benefit card in a delayed roll out. DSS strongly objected to
this (please see the letter from Sarah Graham of DSS dated December 1998
at WITN0403_01/24, POL00028326) as it was not in their best interests, and
sought to persuade others that a variation should be pursued without their
involvement of a benefit card. | am aware that Ministers eventually agreed to

one of those variants in around May 1999.

85. As far as | know, the Treasury Working Group did not explicitly consider
technical difficulties with Horizon. However, access to published reports

would have been made available to them.

Negotiations over the future of the Horizon project - November 1998 to

December 1998)

86.During November and December 1998, | continued to give my input into the
Treasury Working Group. | also helped the PO Board Members consider and
respond to some of ICL's more radical commercial requests (a few of which

are detailed in Graham Corbett's report at WITN0403_01/40, POL00028098).

87.1 have been reminded of a further report from Bird & Bird dated 17 December
1998 (at WITN0403_01/46, POL00031114; and WITN0403_01/47,
POL00038829) which was a provisional version of "Position paper on
Requirements Analysis" based on an Independent Consultant's Review of
the "Payment Card programme". | do not personally recall commissioning

this review. | can see that it was sent to me on copy and as by this stage |

Page 30 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

was only dealing with some strategic inputs, | would have been expected to
pass it on to those who might have needed to take it into account. These
would have been people responsible for deciding whether the system was fit
for purpose, through testing and assurance principles processes laid down
earlier, to authorise further releases or rollout to more post offices. It would
appear | have circulated in my handwriting to Dave Miller (POCL Horizon
Programme Director) and Mena Rego (POCL Head of Horizon Development)
and filed it under a project code name too. Reading it again now, | note that
the content focuses on the alleged failings of ICL adequately or in a timely
fashion to undertake requirements analysis around BA's benefit encashment
services. It does not appear that any account was taken of the PFI nature of
the procurement. My recollection is that POCL did not necessarily agree with

the report as proving the system was fundamentally technically flawed.

88.In addition, during these two months, | was involved in a peer review by
POCL Finance Director of the best way forward in parallel with any
negotiations. In early January 1999, we concluded that to continue with the

project was the best option strategically for POCL (please see the POCL

Finance Director's review of the POCL/ICL ' deal! at WITN0403_01/48,

POL00031230).
89. Furthermore, | was also involved in helping POCL's lawyers draft some very
high level Heads of Term ("HOT") in early preparation for the contract

discussions that would take place once a ministerial decision on the way

Page 31 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

forward was made. A draft of this HOT dated January 1999 is at
WITN0403_01/49, POL00031113. | was not involved in the later contract
discussions, as | had moved to a different role by the time that these took

place.

90. During late 1998, BA and POCL agreed that ICL had breached the contract
and that we had a fairly strong case to terminate it if we wished. However, we
did not agree between us about the grounds of the breach (please see the
letter from Slaughter & May to David Sibbick at WITN0403_01/50,
POL00038847) or whether to terminate it in part or in full. Additionally, BA
and POCL did not agree strategically about the best thing to do regarding the
future of the Horizon project. BA wanted to withdraw from the card and move
to a much greater and faster ACT regime, and POCL preferred to keep the
card within the programme and replan for a longer roll out and extended

contract.

91. | have been asked by the Inquiry what | understand of technical difficulties with
Horizon at this time. | am aware that testing for interfacing with POCL's system
for transaction processing was not completed in November 1998 as planned.
A letter from Dave Miller to a number of colleagues at WITN0403_01/51,

POL00028421 confirms this.

92. | do not know personally how or when technical difficulties were

communicated to government ministers and senior officials at this stage.

Page 32 of 55
93.

WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

However, | do believe that senior officials (for example in the Treasury
Working Group) were aware of these technical difficulties and delays arising

from them.

| have been asked to describe ICL Pathway's proposed changes to the
acceptance criteria for the Horizon system in November 1998 and how the
Post Office responded. The accountability for deciding this would have been
with the Horizon programme director and the residual PDA. | was not
personally involved in the decisions around these proposed changes or the
Post Office's response. | would only have been involved if there were
strategic or commercial implications arising in my time, which | do not recall

dealing with.

Negotiations over the future of the Horizon project - January 1999 to May 1999

94.

95.

As detailed in paragraph 9 above, by March 1999, | had been appointed to
another role outside POCL, within the RM Group. From this date onwards, |
was less involved in the Horizon project and by May 1999, | was no longer

involved.

As mentioned in paragraph 88 above, | was involved in a peer review by

POCL Finance Director. In early January 1999, we concluded that to

continue with the project was the best option strategically for POCL.

Page 33 of 55
96.

97.

98.

99.

WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

During this period, | also gave my opinion on any new options for the future
of the Horizon programme to PO Board Members as requested. Evidence of
my doing this can be seen in my letter to Richard Close dated March 1999 at

WITN0403_01/52, POL00028631.

In early 1999, the relationship between the Post Office and BA remained
much the same as described in paragraph 90 above. It was announced in
May 1999 that BA were withdrawing from the card and that ICL would
continue to automate for POCL (please see the NAO report at

WITN0403_01/2, POLO0000805).

During this period, | recall having minimal personal engagement with
government officials. | did write a letter to David Sibbick of the DTI
responding to his request for our view on a commercial proposal from ICL
(WITN0403_01/53, POL00028616). On the same day, after a conversation
with David Sibbick, | reported the content of our discussions to the PO Chief
Executive via fax (WITN0403_01/54, POL00028615). | provided my input
where requested by colleagues, but beyond that | had very limited contact

with government officials as | was in the process of moving roles.

| have no personal recollection of any live trial technical issues, which would
have been under the supervision of the Horizon programme director. | note
that in the Post Office Board paper (WITN0403_01/55, POL00028629) dated

15 April 1999, there is no mention of any insurmountable technical issues. If

Page 34 of 55
100.

101.

102.

103.

WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

there had been any concerning issues, | would have expected these to have
been mentioned in the Board papers, especially considering the serious
decisions they were facing at this time. However, it is worth noting that | had

moved roles by the time of the live trial in September 1999.

Any technical issues that did exist would have been addressed by the usual

testing and assurance methodology used by ICL, BA and POCL.

| imagine that technical issues with Horizon were communicated to
government ministers and senior officials at this stage through the Treasury
Working Group at a high level. As far as | can recall, | did not personally

communicate any technical issues during this time.

| believe that the DSS withdrew from the Horizon project for the reasons
outlined in paragraph 58 above. The delays in the project had materially
damaged DSS's business case, and DSS now had a more improved CAPs
system that meant that they could choose a new route of automation and

move towards bank transfer payment systems.

The withdrawal of the DSS from the Horizon project did have a large impact
on POCL. In the short term, it meant that a replan of the ICL release
schedule and roll out was needed. It also led to a large financial hit on
POCL's balance sheet at PO Board level. Page 42 of the NAO report

(WITN0403_01/2, POLO0000805) notes that in November 1999, POCL

Page 35 of 55
WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

recorded on their accounts an exceptional charge of £571 million "for
acquiring an asset which does not at this stage yield sufficient income to
justify the cost." In the medium term, POCL had to find other ways to support
the network including gaining the possibility of new business for universal
banking and other banking services, and becoming the retail gateway to
government services. For the post offices most at risk by a loss of BA
business, for example the smaller rural offices, a new way of supporting them

for their social purpose would have to be explored.

Acceptance of the Horizon system — September 1999

104. As described in paragraph 9 above, in March 1999 | formally left POCL and
moved to another role within the RM Group. Therefore, as far as | can recall,
| did not participate in the decision to accept Horizon or the acceptance
process. Although | received an email from Keith Hardie (Head of Public
Relations and External Communications) regarding the further roll out of
Horizon (WITN0403_01/56, POL00028463), | received this email for
information purposes. | was one of several people who received this email

and | had no active participation in the decision to roll out the system.

105. | cannot comment on technical difficulties with Horizon at this time as | had

left POCL.

Engagement with the NSFP during the development and implementation of

Horizon

106.

107.

108.

109.

During the early development and implementation of Horizon (please see
paragraphs 27 to 45), | was involved with the General Secretary of the NFSP
in their discussions around BA's desire for an accelerated ACT programme. |

explained the long-term solutions we were evolving in order to gain support.

After the contract was awarded to ICL, | along with other members of POCL
occasionally met with NFSP to update them on the project's progress. ICL
sometimes attended. A good example of this can be seen in the letter on
NFSP future involvement in counter automation at WITN0403_01/57,
NFSP00000120, which mentions an initiator meeting that took place in
September 1996 between the NFSP, POCL and Pathway on a non-

contractual basis to explain the project's intent and ambition.

ICL also organised user awareness events for sub-postmasters locally to

explain the new incoming system. NFSP were aware of these meetings.

The NFSP would have typically raised any concerns they had via Post Office
regional management. | am not aware of the NFSP raising any concerns
about the technical viability and robustness of Horizon prior to its rollout

(please see paragraph 69)

The end of my involvement in the Horizon project

110. As described in paragraph 9, my direct involvement in the Horizon project
came to an end in March 1999 when | was promoted to MD of Customer
Management for the RM Group (please see the PO Board Minutes of 27 April
1999 at WITN0403_01/58, RMG00000023). For the next few months until
May 1999, | used my experience of the project to give input where called
upon. In June 1999, | formally resigned from my POCL Development Director
role. This was a Companies House resignation and | was no longer a POCL

director.

111. | gave input to the PO Board on how the Horizon platform could be used as
part of my new MD role in customer management (please see the PO Board

Minutes of 14 March 2000 at WITN0403_01/59, POL00021469).

112. | was not aware of any technical difficulties during this period other than

those previously mentioned in my statement.

Reflections

113. | can only reflect back on my time involved in the Horizon project, which

ended in May 1999.

114. As far as | can recollect during this initial period, whilst | was involved, | do

consider that the Post Office effectively scrutinised the technical integrity and

Page 38 of 55
115.

116.

117.

WITNO04030100
WITN04030100

robustness of Horizon. Before release or roll out, a jointly resourced PDA
team tested the Horizon system, and suitable assurances were given to
sponsors. | cannot recall any material accounting or reconciliation issues

from this time.

At each stage of the Horizon programme that | was involved with,
professional advice was taken where necessary or to add value in reviews.
Key stakeholders were advised openly and honestly about status and options

going forward.

Had | been aware of material faults of the kind that we now know led to the
unjust prosecution of so many sub-postmasters, | would have done all that
was in my power to intervene and resolve these issues. As a social business
associated with public sector values, it was not in the ethos of the
organisation at that time to put expediency above quality. POCL strove to put
its customers and its agents at its heart. | am truly baffled by the apparent
later professional advice, investigative processes and governance that
appears to have led to so many unjust prosecutions. It is not a culture |

personally recognise.

| would like to express my sadness at the many lives that have been affected

by the sub-postmasters' prosecutions. | will do all | reasonably can to assist

the Chair in this Inquiry.
