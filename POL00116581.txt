As regards the offer to help with Deloitte, not at this stage. I have asked Deloitte for a review type follow up face to
face meeting with their senior bods — possibly if that yields no fruit, then we might take up the offer.........

Thanks, so should we log with Alice that we might want to ask Mark for help? P

Hi All — just to close the loop on this, as some of you are more up to speed than others: Deloitte are still
on track for delivery tonight (by which they mean before midnight, so in reality it is unlikely to be
distributed to the Board before tomorrow morning). On the publication on the report itself, there has
been no movement; that said, the “pubic version” of the LL advice is now being titivated by Rod so that
it flows and its self-standing without express references to Deloitte or a Deloitte report. Cheers Chris

This is helpful from Alice.
So first of all - thx to M&M, our work - planned and spontaneous - in keeping RC on side clearly
paid off.

Belinda, the point re bringing in a GT in place of SS - is that assumption right on cost: are they
likely to be higher (how much?).

Chris, any further progress with Deloitte - are they still on for their hard stop of tomorrow? And
did you make any more progress with Deloitte agreeing to being named in any disclosure of the
report?

Lastly, thank you for all the prep for yesterday and for Friday. Mark, I'd like a debrief on the
Monday meeting? Can you call tonight?

Thanks, Paula

T have just come away from my meeting with Mark who has made two helpful offers.
On Deloitte, he says they often have difficulty with the Big Four over things like this
and he thinks they might be able to help if we need them to.

Second, he is willing to help us with Ministers over our recommendations/options
when we are ready.

We went over pretty much all the ground we covered on Monday. He was interested
to test the option of bringing in alternative investigators. Am I right in thinking you
believe they would be no cheaper (tho better and faster)?? No need to reply but to
consider as part of the menu of options on Friday.

Otherwise, all fine. No mention of the M word. Very friendly and supportive.

Alice
