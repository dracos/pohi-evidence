Dear Gavin,
I just sent the below email to James Davidson and his out of office reply was to connect with yourself.

As you may recall, back in 2012 we had commenced an integrity review of HGNX which was aborted shortly after we
completed phase 1 due to discussions between Fujitsu and Post.

I thought to reconnect in light of the press release today to see if there is anything we can assist with or revisit our
original engagement with potential variations to inform any expert reports.

Happy to meet or discuss over the phone.

My best,
Ervin

Dear James,

Just thought to connect given the press release today www. bbc. co.uk/news/uk-23233573 .

Mike Deaton suggested you as a point of contact for the Post account.

In 2012, we were engaged to assist Fujitsu validate and provide an independent view on the integrity of the HGNX
platform for the Post account.

At the time we had scoped a detailed approach and commenced field work. Our touch points then were via Mike
Deaton, Peter Beresford/ Torstein Godeseth and Gavin Bell.

The work was then halted due to some internal agreement between Fujitsu and Post soon after we commenced.

Given the current situation, I was wondering if it would be worth revisiting the engagement and seeing how we can
potentially assist.

Let me know your thoughts and hope to hear from you soon.

My best,
Ervin

Hi, Ervin and Chris,
I have been totally embroiled in our running our central shared services and not aligned to Post Office since
we last met. I would recommend you make contact directly with James Davidson who was assigned as our

Delivery Executive in relation to Post Office matters.

If you have any colleagues aligned to shared services best practice, I may be interested to hear how you could
help us.

Note that Peter has now left the business having returned t

Hi Mike,

Happy new year. I hope 2013 has got off to a good start for you an

I was just speaking to our Fujitsu account team and thought to circle back with you to see whether the initiative
around HGNX has drawn to conclusion or if there is still a potential requirement to support Fujitsu in driving an
outcome on this.

Happy to discuss how we can support you on this or any other key outsourced account.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

My best,
Ervin

Hi Ervin

I have been in contact with the account lead and seems Post Office are still exploring how they can
approach the broader topic of the full end to end piece, but seems our work is definitely off the table.

Should anything change, we will of course be in touch.
Thank you.

Mike
