Laura — another one for response. Again I will ask John to send it through e-case but we should aim to send a short
response on Friday off the back of the response to Ron Warmington.

Thanks
Harriet

Dear Lucy,

I have been forwarded this e-mail as Mr Warmington has yet to receive a response. Perhaps you could advise
given the seriousness of this allegation that Parliament may have been misled by the Post Office.

Kind Regards,

Andrew

Dear Baroness,

Further to the article written by Tim Ross in this weekend's Sunday Telegraph
UKG1I00005300
UKGI00005300

(see: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-mail/11778288/Post-
Office-under-fire-over-IT-system.html ), I have as yet received no
acknowledgement from Westminster in regard to my July 22nd and 28th emails
to Mr Freeman and to the Prime Minister.

The possibility seems to exist that Mr Freeman was inaccurately briefed on the
results of our firm's investigation. As stated below, we have concluded that
there were, and probably still are, systemic flaws within Horizon.

With regards,

Ron Warmington

Please pass this email directly to Mr Cameron. Thank you.
Dear Mr Cameron,

As yet I have received no response to my below-copied email to Mr Freeman. In
it, Tam challenging the words he used in the House in summarising my firm's
Reports on the Post Office and its Horizon operating platform. In that you also
incorrectly used similar words in the House, I respectfully look to you to ensure
that more care is taken on this matter so that broad reassurances are not again
mistakenly given.

With kindest regards,

Ron Warmington

Dear Mr Freeman:

I am puzzled, and not a little distressed, by your summarisation, in your recent
email to Mr Ian Warren, and more importantly in Parliament, of my firm's
UKG1I00005300
UKGI00005300

Interim and Part Two Reports (there were, in fact, three Reports). You have
summarised our Reports with the following words: "Second Sight have produced
two independent reports, in 2013 and 2015, both of which demonstrate that
there is no evidence of systemic flaws within the Horizon system which could
cause the issues reported". That is NOT a correct statement. I respectfully
draw your attention to paragraphs 21.27 and 26.8 of our Report, and to the
following additional paragraphs:

9.3; 9.6; 9.12; 10.10; 11.8; 13.8; 21.3; 21.4; 21.8; 21.30; 21.31; and 22.10.

You may have noted, from reading our Reports, and also from Post Office's
Rebuttal Documents, that Post Office has continually focussed attention on the
system itself (i.e. ‘Horizon’, and its successor system, ‘Horizon Online’), and
even more narrowly on the software, rather than on the entirety of the
operational platform used by its Subpostmasters. It follows that even if there
had never been any systemic flaws in either version of the system (that being a
contention with which we do not agree), that would not mean that the operational
platform as a whole was always fit for purpose for all of the tens of thousands
of users. As we have stated in our Report, it was not.

T have attached here a copy of our Briefing Report - Part Two. In that copies of
this Report are already in the public domain, releasing a further copy to you does
not constitute a breach of our Confidentiality Agreement.

Tam available at any time, subject to the constraints imposed (by our
Confidentiality Agreements with Post Office) on my firm, myself and on my
colleagues individually, should you call for any clarification.
