Further to discussions, and taking your points in turn:

POL will only mediate cases involving criminal convictions in exceptional circumstances e.g. when say a relative
of the subpostmaster, and not the subpostmaster themselves, was convicted of fraud or theft, or where the
matter for mediation relates does not relate to the conviction directly
e There are 37 cases what involve a criminal conviction. So updated numbers in the scheme are:
© There are now 106 cases still “live”
© 26 are with CDER awaiting mediation

Of the remaining 80:

= 37 are criminal and would not be mediated

* 43 are not criminal
So there are 69 (26 + 43) are still to be mediated
® We have liaised with POL regarding the WMS and the letter from Post Office and we will supply the letter, WMS

and POL lines on Monday (these are being prepared over the weekend).

Thanks

Richard

Laura,

The Minister noted the changes POL intend to make to the scheme and would be keen to get clarification on the
following points:

- Could you please clarify whether POL would mediate in any criminal cases and if so under what circumstances?
- Of the total number of cases (c109??} how many would not be mediated by POL (because they are criminal cases)?

- Could the Minister please see an advance copy of the press notice/ press lines?

WMS: The Minister’s preference is to lay a WMS but, as this is a matter for the post office rather than the Government,
would like it to be a very short. ideally it would be something along the lines of ‘I have received a letter/ document from
Post Office with an update on the Horizon mediation process and I am placing a copy in the libraries of both Houses’ ~
this would of course mean that we would need to liaise with Post Office to ensure that they provided this to us in
advance of the title being laid.

Hannah — Parly have advised that if were to lay a WMS we will need a grid slot — are you able to take this forward
please?

Thanks,
Claire

As discussed (and with thanks for the extension to the box deadline) please see attached submission for Jo Swinson on
the Post Office mediation scheme. I’d be grateful if this can go in the Minister’s box today flagged for her urgent
attention — in particular, we would welcome her early steer on whether she agrees with the decision not to table a WMS.
for the day of this announcement.

Hannah in Comms has agreed our recommendation of a reactive, BIS-spokesperson line only.

Georgie — I'll be in touch separately about the WMS point.

Thanks
