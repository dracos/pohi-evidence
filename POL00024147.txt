Jane:
1. lattach the first draft of the risk assessment table, which I’m reviewing now.

2. Witness training has begun for POL and Fujitsu witnesses with oversight from Angela (cc’ed}. It is being done in
tranches to cater for the half-term holiday, with the first tranche having been completed and feedback
received.

The trainers have been briefed on “lessons learned” from the Common Issues trial (e.g. Patrick Green’s scattered
and confusing cross-examination style) so that this could be fed into the training.

2 questions:
e When will get the risk assessment re Horizon (I’d like to get it to the Board tomorrow), and
e Are we putting our witnesses through witness training again (I hope so ...)?

Thanks,
