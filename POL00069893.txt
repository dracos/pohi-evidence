Stephen

In answer to your questions we have managed to determine the following from audit data:

Counter 1 was used for balancing the stock unit during the morning. It froze at 12:30 because of a message
store lock problem. User phoned up the help desk (call logged 12:45) and was advised to reboot, which they
did at 12:53. Counter used successfully during the afternoon.

A user started to log on to Counter 2 at 8:40am but this was not successful, and it is not clear what state it was
in. This counter was also rebooted at 12:53, although not reported to the helpdesk. It was used successfully
from 13:20 onwards.

There is no indication whatsoever of a software upgrade on 1/4. Upgrades are done overnight, not during the
working day.

Hope this is helpful

Regards Brian

Dear Brian,

1. We have just received Mr Castleton’s witness statements. One of them states that the
computer system went down on Thursday 1 April 2004 and it was 3 hours before it came back
up again. They speculate that this might be a download (the implication being that such
download repaired the problems with the system that Mr Castleton alleges he experienced).
From the software updates you previously sent me (copies attached) this does not appear to be
the case. I suspect there is nothing in what they are saying but wonder if you are able to say
what went wrong with the computers that day, so that we can head off any wrong assumptions
they may make.

2. Please could you let me have you telephone number in case there are any questions which
crop up during trial?

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.
Stephen Dilley
