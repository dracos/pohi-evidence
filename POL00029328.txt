[this is due to a single SC line written for $1000 (£484) with no settlement in the middle of two RISP transactions.

on call PC0151718 the harvester exception was corrected and now the transaction for the day don't zero, hence this issue with the
incomplete summaries report.

m currently retrieving the messagestore for this branch, we will then be inserting a new message on the counter to remove
leffects of this. OCP 17510 has been raised.

jorth noting that the branch did not have any issues with the mismatched transactions because this was fixed before they did the
roll. The branch is not aware of this and it's best that the branch is not advised.

las detailed above, the two POLFS incomplete summaries issues have been resolved.

3:37 User:Anne Chambers

the counter problem which caused the first issue has been corrected by inserting a message into the messagestore, for equal but
opposite values/quantities, as agreed with POL (OCP 17510).

s a result of this

corrective action, the net effect on POLFS is zero, and POLFS figures are in line with the branch. POLMIS
received both the original message and the corrective message.

once the problem was corrected, there should have been no impact on the branch. However it has been noted that the stock unit BDC
nad a loss of $1000, which was generated after the correction was made. We have already notified Gary Blackburn at POL (email
jattached). This appears to be a genuine loss at the branch, not a consequence of the problem or correction.

nen reconciliation is complete, please return the call to SSC so we can pass it on to development.

Summary for development:

lA single SC line was written for $1000 (£484), with no settlement, in the middle of two RISP transactions.

POL00029328
POL00029328

the line was missing some AdditionalData so it wasn't harvested properly, but the main problem was the lack of settlement. POL
Juthorised us to insert an equal but opposite message, to prevent a discrepancy (in theory anyway) and to avoid problems on
IPOLFS. Please note that this is exceptional and must not be seen as a convenient avoidance in place of a fix.

subsequent investigations showed that a second packed pouch barcode had been scanned, before the receipt for the first had
finished processing. See the audit log / messages on counter 7 26th Nov at 12:43 / 12:44.

leco147357 is already with development for what I think is a similar problem - Mode reverts to what it was prior to RISP. Please
laiso see update on that call.

Rouitng to EPOSS-Dev via QFP.
