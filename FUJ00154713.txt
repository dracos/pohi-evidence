This is the response I intend to send to Graham re your question if thats OK

Comments from Gareth Jenkins:

If there have been human errors in recording the transactions, could an explanation be that:
(a) There was nothing wrong with Horizon, because it simply reflected the information entered on to
it; but
This is certainly True (ie Horizon simply reflects the information entered into it).
(b) If staff entered the wrong numbers into Horizon there may have been no real loss
(even though Horizon would show a loss), because there could be a human error in
accurately recording transactions.
Again, this could be True. However if there is some sort of miss-entering of data into Horizon, then there
would be another corresponding error which should be picked up eg as a Stock Error or some AP Client being
credited with an incorrect amount. Also, any such error should show up as part of the Balancing Process.
If so, would that be a likely explanation?
Not able to comment on this.

Brian,

I have been asked by the Fraud Investigation Team to answer several questions, to assist an enquiry
regarding a PO employee (sub postmaster) alleging that the Horizon System my have lost his money. I can
manage 5 of the 6 questions but wonder if you could explain or provide an answer or opinion to the following
question, the answers are being directed back to Graham to formalise our response.

If there have been human errors in recording the transactions, could an explanation be that:

(a) There was nothing wrong with Horizon, because it simply reflected the information
entered on to it; but

This is certainly True (ie Horizon simply reflects the information entered into it).
(b) If staff entered the wrong numbers into Horizon there may have been no real loss
(even though Horizon would show a loss), because there could be a human error in
accurately recording transactions.

It is a possible explanation, but without doing a detailed analysis of everything that has gone on in the Branch
it is difficult to speculate as to what has happened. Certainly the most likely explanation is miss-operation or
Fraud. However I appreciate that that is not sufficient for a prosecution. Without understanding what exactly
is being alleged, (by POL and the sub-postmaster), I don’t feel I can add anything further.

I have spoken with Dave Baldwin on this and he recommended I speak with you, I will also be liasing with him
on my final response as we are fundamentally of the opinion that Horizon does not "eat money" merely
accounts for it placement.

This is obviously urgent and a quick response would be appreciated.
Hope this helps. Happy to discuss further if you want to look at some more specific areas of Horizon.
Regards

Gareth
