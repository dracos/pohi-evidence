What Is Horizon?

Post Offi Branch computer system

Horizon can be described as @ st of technologies which allow POL branches to sell POL. products and services to consumers, reconcile branch accounting

postions and pass information to thd partes including dents of POL and external service providers, It consists oftwo primary functions: The range or products

‘sold a the POL branches consist of Postal Orders items which are provided only through @ POL branch end products such as stemps, mall, foreign currencies

\which can be purchased elsewhere,

1. Branch. Technology which is presentin the Branches such as computer terminals and peripherals (0.9. key pads, printers) which allow users to sell products
{0 consumers, allow Postmastors to set up branch users ofthe systom and perform basic accounting and reporting functions. The hardware present in the

branch is managed and supported by Computacenter.

Network infrastructure. The branch access network's provided by Computacenire whilst the dstbution network providing connectivity between branches

{and the Horizon back end is provided by crcuts operated by Verizon. Distribution to cient and extemal third partis is provided by a combination of Verizon

tnd Fujtsu managed cuits. The Core network operating in and between datacentres s provided and managed by Fujitsu

Back end. Technology which llows the branches to connect to the main Horizon back end functions and thase back end functions thamsclves which provide

1ccess fo reerence data, and the main accounting reconciation processes and the inlerfaces between third parties. These elements of te platform are

managed and supported by Fujitsu

I. Bxtract Transform and Load (ETL) services which provide batch output services between the Horizon platform snd third party cons (e.g. Britsh Gas
tc):

I Extract Transform and Load (ETL) services which mave data within the Horizon Patform itself for reconciliation purposes;

li, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) services which take data from third partes (such as reference data and paystation data) and push tis into the
Horizon Platform,

Iv. Goneric Web Serices which allow interrogation of third party services (such as bank authorisation services) and post data to third partes such as actual
‘Payment transaction dala; and

¥. _Alltomated Payments Advance Data Capture (AP-ADC) A facity which allows the Post Offce to make configuration changes, add products, change
‘customer joumey's and orchestrate cals to Generic Web Services without having to involve Fujtsuin the change and testing cycles. This facity uses a
proprietary programming and configuration structure.

Gase for change

Context

POLis going trough @ major program of work to adress historical falings in their core Branch
computer systom, Horizon. Horizon is used for transactions between the POL andits Postmastor
branch network, and is owned, maintained and managed by Fuiisu Services Limited (.).
Postmaster claimed there were issues with Horizon and these were inked fo prosecutions and
convtions of Postmasters for offences such as theft and false accounting,

In December 2019 the Post Office settled with a group of claimants who established legal action
‘against the Post Offic in response to their convictions. Fallowing this settlement, the High Court ruled
in the claimants favour. In February 2020 a public inquiry (inquiry) was announced int the mater,
ith torms of reference and the appointment ofa chair boing announced in Soptomber 2020

The torms of reference ofthe Inquiry include “whether lessons have been leamed and concrete
changes have taken place or are underway at Post Office Lc, with respect to Judgment (No3)
“Common issues” and Judgment (No 6) “Horizon issues”

Subsequent actions

Inresponse tothe Judgomentin October 2020 POL engaged KPMG to holp them design TOM fora
newly formed GLO / Horizon IT tam.

Desired outcome

‘The desired outcome ofthis activity isan exceptionable blueprint from which change could enacted to
rebuild trust with Postmasters,

ible!

the diferent ers of investigations teams within POL, based on their risk and prio tothe business,

Case triage

+ Explains at what stage case triage should take place, what would involve, who would be involved,
\what eiteria would be used fo assess cases, and when cases would be escalated to the Horizon
Investigation Support Tea.

Case triage process

+ lustrates how the case triage stops ft into the wider Investigations process, showing the sources
for cases, and the Investigations teams that cases could be assigned to

Case triage eriteria
+ Sets out criteria which may lead to cases being immediately escalated beyond BSC Tier 2, for
priotty investigation by either the Contract investigation and Resolution Team (CIRT), orby

Horizon Investigation Support Team,

De minimis ~ current application and suggested changes

Recommended requirement jons for the Data Platform

Data import
+ Serve as the single source of truth for ll transactions for case investigations,

+The Data Platform may take data feeds from sources other than Horizon, e.9,
Dynamics, ServiceNow, Vocalink, Camelot, ATM dat.

Key Logging data shouldbe stored in the Data Platform,

‘There shouldbe robust import and validation processes for pulling data from,

Horizon end third party sources to ensure the data integrity onthe Data

Platform,

+ Data should be retained forthe statutory period (0.9.6 yoars ~ 1).

+ As part of the setup for data import, data sources should be categorised to
identity what typeof information should be immutable or editable, e.g
‘transaction data should be immutable, whereas pricing reference data could be
editable,

+ Aus logging should be in place for editable data to track the creation and
masificaon details of each transaction record, e.g. usemames and
‘imostomps.

+ The Data Platform may cary two layers of data. The first layer (0.9. Businoss
Logie Layer) provides near real-time data to teams such as Ter 1 that require
instant visibly. The second layer (og. Data Consolidation Layer) carios
delayed (¢.g. available next day) but complete and enriched data geared
towards foams such as Tior 2 and investigation toams, as casesissuos would
‘generally reach these teams hours or deys afer the transaction in question

Security

+ Data Platform needs to be designed with security in ming, including usor
‘access and administration, data storage and redundancy.

+ A secure data store (with clovatod access requirements) and special handing
procedures should be in place to account for sensive data that may be
racoived ftom third parties, to ensure thatthe Data Platform is compliant with

+ Acc9ss to Data Platform should be restricted, monitored and reviewed

Visualisation

+ Data Piatform should have foods from Dynamics and ServiceNow to pull in key
case and ticket information

+ By analysing the key information from the cases and tickets (0.9, FAD code,
Postmaster, issue type, monetary value), Data Platform performs automated

fields that are moro rolevant and usablo than reports generated by Credence

‘The Judgement of December 2019 found
failings in POL’s process for
Investigating stock and cash
discrepancies

‘The engagement was established in Oct
2020 to help POL report into the public
Inguiry and specifically on the points
‘concerning ‘lessons learnt’ and whether
progress has been made to prevent
failings happening again. This report
summarises our findings on the
processes of investigating transactional
Issues within Horizon and captures.
recommendations for improvement.

‘The KPMG review suggests that fallings
in the Horizon investigation proces:
stil persist

+ The processes for investigating stock
‘and cash discrepancies and transaction
corrections is at relatively low levels of
maturity with mostly manual processes
for collecting and collating data making
those processes prone to manual errors,
and delay

+The governance around processes is
weak with limited of Management
Information to track performance of
investigation team

+ Tools used by investigation teams are
not fit for purpose and data is not readily
avaliable

In the future, POL aspires to have lower

volume of Horizon transaction issues

requiring Investigations, more robust
and evidenced outcomes of investigation
activities, and prompt, fair and
communicative process for resolving
disputes.

DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

The Horizon & GLO IT function has been
set up to improve and ensure the use of
data and evidence driven investigation
processes in investigating transactional
Issues within Horizon to drive to more
robust Investigation outcomes for both
Postmasters and POL supported by
appropriate technology

To deliver the vision Horizon & GLO IT

team wil:

+ “Foc undamentals’: Design a repeatable and
auditable process for investigating Fansactonal
issues which is driven by data and ensures
evidential integrity of data received from
Horizon to Posimasters

+ “Strengthen investigative processes": Build
