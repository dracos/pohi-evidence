Due to a system fault, the branch did a Transfer Out of £4000 and a corresponding Transfer In of £8000
Justification: Correct a loss of £4000 at the branch due to a system fault
When: Planned for 10/03/2010 16:00 with a duration of 30 minutes

Extra detail: The Transfer In details were incorrectly doubled up when they were written to the BRDB. This needs to be
