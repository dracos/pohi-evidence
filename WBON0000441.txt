Sorry I couldn't dial in - I think Tom will have given my apologies.
Mark/Andy. Please can you set out the timeline for approving this text (eg Deloitte, FJ) if this is necessary.

Completely agree that making sure we are not contradicting previous statements is vital.

I am stuck with a live issue at present. My uneasiness on this issue is why we can't give a firmer position
on the super user point before we reply?

I suspect I know the answer but the current wording leaves us vulnerable and we would need to look at
what we have said publicly (select committee, panorama etc...) before we commit the position.

Mark

In response to your question in the other email thread about seeing everything we have said about "remote
access", we don't have a central log of everything POL has said on remote access. However, the language used in
the email referenced below (attached again) is reflective of the language used by POL towards the end of the
Scheme.

We have also previously compiled POL's comments on this topic that were made in individual case reports (see
attached), which gives a flavour of the responses given. This should however be treated with caution as these
responses span a two year period and POL's understanding of the situation changed over time.

One of the tasks we could do (albeit this will need to be after the LOR has been sent) is to compile a complete
chronology of what POL was told and what POL has said on this topic. One to discuss on our call later.

Kind regards
Andy

Quote from SS' Report:

"This ability to directly amend branch records is something that Post Office has consistently denied was
possible. This recently discovered evidence appears to confirm, that in 2010 at least, it was possible for Fujitsu /

WBD_00031 1.000002
WBONO0000441
WBON0000441

Post Office to directly amend branch data without the knowledge of the relevant Subpostmaster.

14.16. In commenting on a draft of this report Post of Office told us that the references to “amend” and
“correct” in the documents mentioned above, are not strictly correct as neither Post Office nor Fujitsu have the
ability to directly change or delete existing records. All that can be done is that additional records can be added
by Post Office / Fujitsu without the consent (and possibly the knowledge) of the relevant Subpostmaster. This
will, however, have the effect of altering balances at the branch, as both debit and credit entries can be made.

14.17. Post Office also told us:

“All of the above processes for correcting / updating a branch's accounts have similar features. All of them
involve inputting a new transaction into the branch's records (not editing or removing any previous
transactions) and all are shown transparently in the branch transaction records available to Subpostmasters (as
well as in the master ARQ data).

The language used in the documents produced by Post Office / Fujitsu and to which you refer is unfortunate
colloquial shorthand used by those working on the Horizon system. I can see how it could be read to suggest
that Post Office was "altering" branch data but the above explains why this is not the case.”

14.18. This is not something that we have been able to test or validate.

14.19. Clearly, the fact that such an ability exists, is not necessarily evidence that such ‘amendments’ were
actually made. This is not something that we have been able to investigate.

This section of the Report was based on the attached email sent to Second Sight.

Kind regards
Andy

Thanks Andy

Would you please circulate the extract “The use of balancing transactions was explained to Second Sight and
is referenced in its Part Two Report at paragraph 14.16.” so that we can see what was referenced at the time.

Thanks

Subject: Remote Access wording - subject to litigation privilege [BD-4A.FID26859284]

All
Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion on our call at 6pm today.
Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

1. In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to hopefully present this
issue in a better light.

2. Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing with this point candidly,
even if that does cause some short-term pain.

3. We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation issues on this topic. We
therefore need to be careful not to overstate our case. This draft wording will also need to be run past
Deloitte / FJ.

Kind regards
Andy
