Jonny,

I’ve added in the open and close dates of each of the Peaks in the email below; R Roll was employed 05-Mar-2001 to
17-Sep-2004, therefore only the first Peak (highlighted) has any overlap with his period of employment. From what I
can understand of that Peak however, it looks like the actual change being referred to was done on 11-Jan-2001, the
rest of the call is about trying to obtain an events report, but in the end it appears that they give up as the issue has
been fixed.

Subject: FW: Roll 2 [WBDUK-AC.FID123822914]
Matthew,

An urgent question has arisen in relation to paragraph 30 of Steve's second statement. In that paragraph Steve states
that transactions were only injected into the counter "in the following circumstances while Mr Roll was employed by
Fujitsu (emphasis added):-

29.1 fixing a Riposte Index at the counter;

29.2 removing a historic message that was influencing the balancing process on a replaced counter;

29.3 correcting configuration data after a PinPad change;

29.4 removing redundant configuration items;

29.5 the example given above involving five corrupted bureau transactions; and

29.6 removing historic recovery information."

This is based on the content of row 6 in the table below. Steve's statement goes on to say that this only happened on
14 occasions and only one of those involved transaction data. The 14 occasions were:

PC0112293 {POL-0283845}, [Lenton, Matthew] 09-Dec-2004 - 14-Dec-2004
PC0112293 {POL-0283845}, [Lenton, Matthew] Duplicate of above

PC0112397 {POL-0283948}, [Lenton, Matthew] 13-Dec-2004 - 13-Dec-2004
PC0112650 {POL-0284204}, [Lenton, Matthew] 17-Dec-2004 - 20-Dec-2004
PC0112659 {POL-0284213}, [Lenton, Matthew] 17-Dec-2004 - 20-Dec-2004
PC0118037 {POL-0289559},/Lenton, Matthew] 24-Mar-2005 - 24-Mar-2005

FUJ00163098
FUJ00163098

PC0175821 {POL-0345994}, [Lenton, Matthew] 19-Feb-2009 - 20-Mar-2009
PC0182141 {POL-0352240}, [Lenton, Matthew] 02-Jun-2009 - 04-Jun-2009
PC0198266 {POL-0368128}, [Lenton, Matthew] 28-Apr-2010 - 16-Jul-2010
PC0201613 {POL-0371420}, [Lenton, Matthew] 15-Jul-2010 - 29-Jul-2010
PC0203896 {POL-0373686}. [Lenton, Matthew] 03-Sep-2010 - 07-Sep-2010

It appears that the 14 occasions actually span the life of Legacy Horizon, rather than the period during which Roll was
employed. Is that right?

Please would you get back to me ASAP?

Did: (1) Belfast team; and (2) privileged users have the ability to inject
transaction data between 2001 and 2004? Do they have that ability
now?

Gareth Jenkins: With Horizon Online, there is the Transaction
Correction Tool which can inject transactions and this is controlled by
SSC. It is audited when it runs and we have only used it once in March
2010. The DBAs in Belfast can in theory do anything to the BRDB. In
practice they will run scripts tested by dev as part of a systems
upgrade if DB changes are required. Any such access is audited and
since 2015 the actual commands run are also audited.

With old Horizon, control was weaker. SSC could inject into
Correspondence Servers and also at the counter.

[Response

2019.

FUJ00163098
FUJ00163098

Belfast team: Belfast had administrative access to the
correspondence servers and had a theoretical ability to inject data
into the messagestores, but don’t believe that they had the technical
understanding to do so.

Belfast had no access to counters, UNIX/NT team having no users and
no knowledge of administrative user accounts/passwords.

They would not have injected any data unless it happened to be done
by scripts that they were asked to run and which were provided under
change control. Direct manipulation of the messagestore wasn’t
something that they knew how to do and would not have attempted
to do lest it break the running applications which harvested/inserted
data. Their understanding of the actual messages was very low/non-
existent so would have had no confidence in making any insertion.

Review a sample of OCPs to give an indication as to how frequently
transaction data was injected.

[Matthew Lenton] This is proving difficult to provide. The original
plan was to examine sample months of change control data and
produce rough figures. As Pete Newsome already discussed with you,
this lead to it becoming apparent that support did not use formal
change control in the earlier years for BAU support actions. We relied
on the audit trail within the incidents (Peaks) to document support
actions. We had auditability of the work done but no change control
entries. We assume that the reasoning behind this was to allow
implementation of support actions ASAP, and the audit trail being
good enough where there was no financial impact.

Therefore we are still looking at how / if we can provide an accurate
answer to this question for the earlier years.

Dear all,

Thank you for your time earlier. Here's a list of the actions that | captured from today's calls. Please let me know if
there's anything you'd like to add or change:-

The Peaks referenced below lof Peaks provided at left.

PC0100174 March 1st 2004 to 5th March 2004
FAD317309 reporting: Horizon Kit rebooting itself for
no apparent reason.

Helpdesk user: "Over the past 2-3 weeks engineers
have been to site and have replaced 2xBU's and
2xPSU's but the problem persists."

BU = base units = PC itself. PSU = Power supply units
within the base units

RR "Evidence (from event logs) shows that the power
is being switched off every morning shortly (ie 5 or 6
minutes) before the PM logs on"

RR: "After carrying out tests on our rigs, | have been
able to duplicate the problem here on ONE of our
rigs but not on others. It seems that the Screen
Power Button is incorrectly connected to the
motherboard."

RR: "We have now identified two instances of this,
one in live. This is a hardware build quality issue."

This was followed by:

PC0100899 18th March 2004 to 24th March 2004.
Hardware returned from site to Bracknell for
examination.

RR: "Tests carried out on screen power switch -
working correctly, no further action required."

Your questions 2d,e,f,g

d) Is his example true, or could it have been true:
Yes. Can find no data on the origin for the statement:
"This is a hardware build quality issue". Could be a
discussion with engineering which was not recorded
on the incident progress. Information we have only
describes the hardware issue being seen internally to
FJ on one instance of test rig hardware. No hardware

FUJ00163098
FUJ00163098

error proved on the site.

If so, how often did that sort of problem occur: Very
rare. Only one other found using keywords
"standby", "laptop", "luggable". PCO055550 which
was a problem on prototype hardware going into
standby mode.

What would have caused it: Inconclusive. No
information on root cause of issue reported by the
Post Master onsite. Could be a hardware problem,
could be user miss-operation of hardware.

Could it have affected/did it affect branch accounts:
No. Once powered on the unit would function as
normal.

If so, might its effect on branch accounts never have
been detected with the result that some SPMs might
have been wrongly held liable for false deficits: No

e) Would Rolls have disassembled laptops and done
the other things he describes in para 8: Have to
assume he did as per the incident updates. | expect
he had some assistance (especially with kit on test
rigs - different team totally) but unable to
substantiate.

Would he have had/did he have the conversation
with his manager he describes in para 8: Just can’t
answer this. My analysis of the issue would suggest
that it turned out to be unimportant because there
was no proof that this ever happened in the live
estate and that his comment of "This is a hardware
build quality issue" is simply conjecture. However, he
may have discussed with engineering and truly
discovered a batch of faulty hardware. | would have
expected an update in the incident reading
"Discussed with xxxxxxxx in engineering and we
determined that........ Bad batch...... etc" No such
updates are present.

f) Was the problem referred to in para kept secret,
as claimed at the end of para 8: No evidence either
way. | would not expect that to be the case. It is not
in Fujitsu's interest to have faulty equipment that is
not corrected damaging reputation.

g) Would Fujitsu management have known/did it
know about this problem? Would/did Post Office?
If not, why not: No way of knowing. Information no
longer exists
