Hi Richard
Sorry for delay. It may be easier if we have a chat about this — I think you are over today so if you want to grab a word in
advance of the Board I would be happy to do so.

However to address your first point, we are subject to the same confidentiality restrictions relating to working group
documents as Alan. He knows this, so I am not sure why he has suggested we could provide a copy of the report. The
fact that he appears to be content would not lift those restrictions. We would need to seek the permission of the
working group, especially as we are maintaining a very strong line in relation to other members and what they may or
may not be disclosing outside of the working group.

If we were to ask the permission of the working group to share the report with Jo then this opens the gate to Alan being
able to write to Jo about the contents of the report and PO's response. In addition Alan could use this as a way of
getting other scheme information to Jo and therefore engaging her in correspondence about other matters relating to
the Scheme which would not be helpful or appropriate.

On your second point, the matter of how the Scheme is going, especially in the run up to the election is something we
are considering. Chris and I have a slot at the Board today and this may be something usefully addressed then. I have
discussed with Chris and one way to approach the matter of updating the Minister might be for Chris to prepare a note
to Paula, copied to you on the back of the recent media attention setting out where we are without going into detail
about the operation of the Scheme itself. We can discuss what would be the appropriate content and level of detail.

Please let me know when it would be good to chat through.

Best wishes
Belinda

Subject: JFSA Letter

Belinda

The JFSA have written to Jo to highlight the fact that the thematic report by second sight is now out there, and they have
also shared their email to subpostmasters.

In the letter, Alan Bates states “Regrettably under the agreement with which JFSA attends the working group I am not at
liberty to send you the 23 page report, yet I am sure Post Office would be able to supply a copy to our Department”. So,
a couple of questions:
Given it would seem AB is happy that the report is shared, do you want to share it?
e In doing so (and given that he has shared his email to SPMs which gives his views of the report), POL would be in
its rights to share its views of the report, which would give you an opportunity to set out concerns about SS and
the effectiveness of their findings.

I have discussed recently with Paula and Gavin whether we should provide Jo with an update on Sparrow with a view to
expressing our concerns about the process (i.e. its not ideal, we are living with SS) such that Jo is warmed up to the fact
that it is not going as well as it could be. My worry is that as we approach the election and more cases go to mediation
(and perhaps fail to reach agreement), JFSA will start throwing their weight around more, and we should consider the
extent to which we counterbalance that in advance.

Kind regards

Richard
