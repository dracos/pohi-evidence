You have asked for a contribution to briefing for the Secretary of State’s meeting

The Secretary of State may wish to use this opportunity to convey some messages to
Fujitsu concerning the Horizon post office counters automation project. I therefore
attach at Annex A contributions to your steering brief, lines to take and background
note covering the discussion of the impact of Horizon on Fujitsu at the 13 June
meeting and current progress with the project. I assume you will cover the detail of
the impact of Horizon on Fujitsu’s finances.
