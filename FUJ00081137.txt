Emma, Re our discussion, please read the attached word doc which summerises the issue we have discovered, we can report that
since May this issue has occurred 45 times at 42 branches and looks like it may well continue to happen at a rate of 5 a week.

We are working on a fix and is hopefully due to complete and get released to Live in REL2.20 which is scheduled in about 5 weeks
time.

As discussed, if you can please read and then decide who is best to deal with this issue within P&BA and if we can then arrange a Conf
Call to discuss how we handle these offices that have this issue, Gareth, Mark, Steve and myself should all be available at sometime
during Thursday and Friday to discuss.

If you need anymore please let me know.

Regards Mike
