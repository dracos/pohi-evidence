Summary

Detail

TC Andy Parsons; MJS explaining position. Issues re disclosure; clearly unhelpful
if POL proceeds with draft CRR responses without regard to disclosure issues;
May damage POL's integrity - disclosure may give Misra ticket to C of A. Need
meeting. Possibility of Thursday?

Any chance can keep moving with CRR's watered down. MJS would not advise
that. Problem will arise if need to make dislcosure and did not set the record
straight when had opportunity to. Also there is the CCRC in the background.
