Martin,

How could the Interim Report be used by those who had been prosecuted, whether found guilty or not (i.e. those who
complain about being subjected to the stress etc of prosecution)?

RE: Advanced Draft of Report

Sensitivity: Confidential

Dear Hugh,

Thanks for letting us have a copy of this.

Our advice overall with regard to disclosure has not changed. The disclosure of a partial report
would not meet with our duties or help the current situation. I think the disclosure of a partial report
would provide partial information and give rise to adverse publicity and speculation. It would be far
better to advise once we have seen the entire report. Having said that the Second Sight report would
not need to be disclosed in every case - that decision would be taken on a case-by-case basis. In many
cases it will not be disclosable.

When do you think we will get to see all of the Spot Reports. We will undoubtedly have a list of
questions thereafter. At the present time we have some concerns arising out of the draft, for example
in relation to paras 5.6, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 6.10, 6.11 and 7.2.

Although we cannot properly advise until we have seen all of the relevant material, this will not
prevent the review process from proceeding with expedition. We propose to draft paramaters which

will work on a worst case scenario.

Kind regards,

Martin.
