Our defence barrister has asked for all of Gareth's replies in relation to

the Defences 2nd Interim Report (see attachment below) to be produced as a
witness statement. I would suggest that the question from the defence is
reproduced and then Gareth's replies are recorded immediately after for
clarity purposes.

A pre court hearing has been set for the 1st February and ideally if
possible it would be helpful if the statement could be received by Friday
of this week. Could you let me know if this is going to be possible.

Here is the answer from Fujitsu to the points that you asked about.

Penny is keen to know that this is all that is required from them, can you

let me know?

Regarding the other ponts, Mark emailed Rob Wilson for some clarity/advice
and I am still awaiting the information.

Hi Jane

I hope all is well with you.
Our expert, Gareth Jenkins, has made comments on the 2nd Interim
Technical expert's report, which I attach for review by Prosecution
Counsel. Please note that where POL is required to respond he has
stated so in the text. We agreed that in the New Year we would discuss.
how this would be presented.

As for Question 3 of your note dated 2 December, the simple answer is
that the system will behave very differently in that all the data will

be held in a central database and the UI will be very different.
However the basic principles for accounting will be the same, though
much of the detail in terms of error handling etc will change. If more
detail is required then that really requires a full discussion on how
HNG-X works and will get very lengthy and involved.

Andy has responded to Jon Longman's note of 16 November. That leaves
questions 1 and 2 of your note dated 2 December outstanding and Andy is
waiting for a response from Jon Longman before he can proceed.

I believe all questions are covered - do you agree?

Kind regards
Penny

Hi Penny

Spoken to the investigator and he has asked is there any chance of us
having the information by Christmas?

I've said that I will let him know in due course.

Jane

I attach a report from the defence expert where he has highlighted a
number

of problems with the Horizon system. Our barrister, Warwick Tatford has
asked that the problemswith Horizon that he has raised in his report are
replied to in a witness statement form. I presume that an employee of
fujitsu would have to produce the witness statement.

(See attached file: misra - 2nd interim technical expert's report
19.11.09.doc)(See attached file: misra -electronic Funds Tranfer PCI
sched.doc)

In addition to this the defence have also requested the following
information with regard the hardware equipment installed at West
Byfleet.

1) Please provide details of any business testing carried out by the

Post

Office on the system before it went live.

2) Please provide the service logs for the system at West Byfleet PO
fora

period commencing six months prior to the defendant taking over as sub
postmistress (30/06/2005) to the present day.

3) Please confirm when and why the hardware in the system at West
Byfleet

PO has been changed.

4) By whom have these changes been made.

5) When new hardware was installed at West Byfleet was it brand new or
reconditioned

6) If it is the latter please confirm the identity of the PO from which

the

reconditioned hardware came and why the hardware has been removed from

that
Po.
