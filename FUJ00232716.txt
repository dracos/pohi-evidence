THE BED CURRENT PROCESS REPORT

Re)
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

1 Executive Summary

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-X services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that
Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

This report explains how BEDs are managed in the HNG-X services that Fujitsu provides. It follows the
“Expanded Table of Contents for the BED Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4164) which was shared with POL
on 01 December 2020. It was subsequently agreed that the sections proposed in COM/MGT/REP/4164.
which were to deal with “Current Processes, Procedures & Controls” would be the subject of this
separate report, “The BED Current Process Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4184). The “BED Report” would
cover the sections listed in COM/MGT/REP/4164 under the heading “Historical - Response to the ‘29
Bugs”.

“Bugs, Errors and Defects” has a very broad meaning and can apply to a wide range of possible
Incidents. In this report, Fujitsu explains how they are managed under the POA Incident Management
process, and how Incidents that require a software fix are managed through the Management of
Software Fixes process (see Section 5.2).

Accompilation of recommendations for improvement is contained in Appendix A. The list in Appendix A
collates the various action items into a single list so that POL and Fujitsu can work jointly to act on these
recommendations.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcomes the opportunity to provide this report.

THE BED CURRENT PROCESS REPORT

Re)
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

2 Purpose & Scope

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain the current processes in place for the management of
Bugs, Errors and Defects (BEDs) in the HNG-X services that Fujitsu provides. This report provides POL
with information to understand how Fujitsu currently provides this capability for the live environment.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcomes the opportunity to provide this report and looks forward to a constructive dialogue with
POL.

3 Background & Introduction

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-X services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that
Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu in relation to these reports was to share content
that would allow both organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and
to identify ways to make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working relationships and
experience for the POL branches and their postmasters. Fujitsu believes in collaboration and welcomes
constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains how BEDs are managed in the HNG-X services that Fujitsu provides. It follows the
“Expanded Table of Contents for the BED Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4164) which was shared with POL
on 01 December 2020. It was subsequently agreed that the sections proposed in COM/MGT/REP/4164
which were to deal with “Current Processes, Procedures & Controls” would be the subject of this
separate report, “The BED Current Process Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4184). The “BED Report” would
cover the sections listed in COM/MGT/REP/4164 under the heading “Historical - Response to the ‘29
Bugs”.

Fujitsu operates the HNG-X services to the service standards contractually required by POL. No
complex IT system, such as HNG-X, will ever be completely free of Bugs, Errors and Defects. Fujitsu's
monitoring systems and processes seek to proactively identify faults, log them as Incidents, and then
work to resolve them promptly following the agreed Incident management processes. Fujitsu also relies
on Incidents being reported to them by POL. These reported Incidents are also logged and worked on to
identify their cause and resolution options. Thousands of Incidents have been logged — as would be
expected of a system of this complexity and size.

As a general comment, it should be noted that Fujitsu is only one supplier involved in the overall delivery
of end-to-end services to POL in relation to HNG-X. The HNG-X application also relies on the working
partnership between POL and its chosen partners — such as Verizon, Computacenter and Atos — as well
as external service providers such as banks and affiliated organisations. This applies to both the IT
systems and the operational processes in HNG-X.

Although every effort has been made to avoid confusing technical jargon in this document, the very
nature of this aspect of the service delivered to POL necessitates the use of many acronyms and
phrases that may need expanding upon to ensure the correct understanding. Fujitsu accepts that further
explanation may be necessary and encourages POL to seek these clarifications.

The topic of Bugs, Errors and Defects is a current open and active topic that results in continued
communications between POL and Fujitsu. This report aims to collate those interactions and
communications in order to provide a common baseline for any future discussions. POL manages all
communications relating to BEDs with the subpostmasters.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. This
report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any statements
made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors have collectively

THE BED CURRENT PROCESS REPORT

Re)
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have also described processes
and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be in written form. Many of
the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are continuously updated and Fujitsu
reserves the right to make changes to the way it works in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this document. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this document in the future, as well as bearing in mind the
requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section 10 below.

4 Terminology

Fujitsu have adopted the term Knowledge Base article (KB) to describe the contents of its POA
knowledge base. The term KEL is no longer seen as an accurate reference.

AKB is raised when a member of Fujitsu support staff identifies information that may be beneficial to
share with other Fujitsu support staff. KBs are stored in a database, so that when an issue is identified,
support staff can crosscheck the database to see if a similar issue has been seen before and how such
issues have previously been handled. KBs record information on many types of issues related to HNG-X
and can include, but are not limited to, information regarding an event, failure, fault, user error or
potential bug. The purpose of KBs is to create helpful information for future reference.

The following are some examples of topics recorded in KBs:

. Explanation of why a button is greyed out (perhaps as the user does not have appropriate
permissions to perform the function).

. Actions to take when a printer shows offline.

. Causes and actions relating to specific error messages or error screens.

. Actions to take when barcodes don’t scan or printed labels are incorrect.

. Workarounds to known issues.

5 Incident Management

An Incident is defined in the HNG-X contract as “any perceived abnormal or undesirable occurrence
relating to the Services”. Incidents are logged in the Fujitsu and POL service management toolsets.
Incidents can then be “bonded” which causes them to be replicated between the respective toolsets so
progress can be seen by both Fujitsu and POL.

5.1 Management of Incidents

The POA Incident Management process is regularly used by both Fujitsu and POL. It is documented in
the POA Incident Management Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 v14.0 dated 21-Jan-2021) and a high-
level overview is provided below.

There are 4 levels of support within the support model for POL: 1* Line; 2™ Line; 3 Line; and 4" Line.

4 Line 24 Line 31Line 4° Line
- POL IT Digital - Fujitsu MAC (First point - Fujitsu specialist - Fujitsu Dev
Service Desk (First I» I of contact for POL with teams (Developers and
point of contact for Fujitsu. Fujitsu may assign Architects of the
subpostmasters) or transfer Incidents to HNG-X solution)
other third parties such as - Fujitsu Vendors
Fujitsu vendor suppliers (eg. Oracle,
and other HNG-X entities) Microsoft)

When a new Incident is reported relating to the live system by POL or a subpostmaster, it will be logged
by the POL IT Digital Service Desk (POL ITDSD) in the POL ServiceNow platform. POL ITDSD can
decide to raise their Incident with Fujitsu 2" Line by recording it as a ServiceNow Incident which causes
it to appear automatically in the Fujitsu TfSNow platform for the attention of Fujitsu’s 2° Line MAC team.

o THE BED CURRENT PROCESS REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

Incidents are passed through the chain of support until they are closed, either by being resolved or if no
further action is deemed appropriate. This chain of support defines and logs the Incident, gives an initial
response; evaluates priority; applies relevant skills to seek a resolution; records progress and relevant
metrics.

When an Incident reaches 3" Line, a Peak is created. This is the Fujitsu system used for Incident
management at 3“ and 4" Line. The Peak and TfSNow platforms are integrated so that relevant updates
to Peaks by 3” or 4" Line can automatically be seen in TfSNow. For Incidents which have been “bonded”
the updates will also appear in the POL ServiceNow platform.

The cause of an Incident and the required resolution may be identified at any stage of the process. If the
cause is deemed to relate to a non-Fujitsu contracted 3° party (such as Atos, Computacenter or Verizon)
then the Incident is passed back to the POL ITDSD for POL to transfer it to the relevant 3” party. If a
new Incident has the potential to impact branch operations then it will be raised at the Horizon Known
Errors Review Forum to provide POL with early notification whilst the Incident is managed (see
Appendix B).

The following are some of the potential outcomes for an Incident that can be identified at any support
level:

1. No fault can be found/validated at this time.

2. Aworkaround is possible that prevents the Incident that is being investigated from (reoccurring

3. Acchange is needed to a Fujitsu platform (such as to a configuration setting, a script, or a
hardware fix) that will require a change to be raised by Fujitsu and progressed through the POL
Change Control process.

4. Achange is believed to be needed to a service component provided by a POL 3” party such as
Atos, Computacenter or Verizon. The updated Incident is passed back to POL ITDSD for POL to
invite the 3° party to carry out their own investigation and resolution.

5. The Incident is recurrent and is associated with a Problem that is also being actioned following
the agreed Problem Management processes.

6. An Incident has been transferred to the Fujitsu 4" Line Developers for further investigation, for
example to look at the actual source code, and their solution is that a software fix is required.
The Peak is then tagged accordingly and progressed through the Management of Software Fixes
process described below.

5.2.1 Business Impact Forum — Fujitsu (BIF)

BIF is a weekly meeting attended by Fujitsu personnel. An Emergency BIF on the other hand, can be
scheduled at any time if Peaks need urgent review. BIF is attended by a broad representation of SMEs
from many teams and areas of expertise.

The Developers first document the impact and proposed solution for each of the Peaks that have been
marked as requiring a software fix following the Incident Management process above. They may also
identify any workarounds that could be implemented whilst the software fix is progressed. Once this
information is ready, it is brought to the BIF for review.

Additionally, Peaks can also be brought to the BIF by Fujitsu that are not related to Incidents. For
example:

e if, during the course of any other unrelated work a Developer is doing, the Developer identifies a
requirement for a software improvement in any part of the live HNG-X solution, then a Peak will
be raised and tagged accordingly and brought to the BIF

e if, during the testing of a Release, a defect is identified, Fujitsu and POL may agree to defer that
defect for a later Release, so as not to impact the deployment of the current Release. In such

circumstances, the relevant Peak(s) relating to that defect will be tagged accordingly and
brought to the BIF.

¢ if a requirement for a software improvement to a part of the live HNG-X solution is identified
during testing activity, and that requirement is not related to the scope of the applicable Release,
then a Peak may be raised and tagged accordingly and brought to the BIF.

The purpose of BIF is to ensure that a viable software fix has been identified, including any temporary
workarounds if possible, so that the software fix can be passed along to the next part of the process: the
Peak Targeting Forum (PTF).

If there are further questions, additional information is required, or the proposed solution is not agreed,
then the Developer will be tasked to provide further information and the Peak will be discussed at the
next BIF meeting.

The BIF meeting determines which Peaks will be taken to the Customer BIF (CBIF). The criteria for what
is to be taken to Customer BIF has evolved over time (see Recommendation 1). The main criteria
Fujitsu use is based on the following non-exhaustive list:

«The software fix can be done in more than one way and POL would need to guide Fujitsu on
choosing the preferred option.

e The software fix may change the functionality of the system and consequently POL will be
required to provide appropriate communication, and potentially training, to the subpostmasters.

«The software fix may need to be done in conjunction with changes performed by some of POL's
other suppliers and POL will need to manage and synchronise that activity.

« The software fix may need to be done concurrently with a separate future planned change, due
to the two fixes being logically related, and POL would need to confirm their willingness to
accept any potential delays in deploying the fix.

« The software fix may relate to active discussions between Fujitsu and POL on a specific and
separate topic and hence should be discussed within that context.

e The software fix may address an important issue that is affecting the subpostmaster experience
when using the system or may be affecting branch balances (these are usually discussed at the
Horizon Known Errors Forum — see Recommendations).

e The software fix may be something that Fujitsu wishes to bring to the attention of POL for any
reason.

e The additional information requested at CBIF has been reviewed and agreed by BIF and can be
taken back to CBIF for POL’s decision on next steps.

Minutes of the BIF meetings are prepared and the output of the BIF review then feeds in to the PTF.

5.2.2 Business Impact Forum — Customer (CBIF)

The CBIF is a joint weekly meeting between Fujitsu and POL to discuss items that have been identified
at BIF for discussion. CBIF only takes place if items have been raised.

POL decides which POL representatives attend CBIF. The purpose of CBIF is to seek a decision from
POL on next steps. If POL decides to progress with a proposed software fix, then the Peak will be
passed along to the next part of the process: the Peak Targeting Forum (PTF).

If there are further questions, additional information is required, or the proposed solution is not agreed,
the item will be taken back through the BIF process and then be brought back to CBIF.

Minutes of the CBIF meeting are prepared and the output of the CBIF review then feeds in to the Peak

5.2.3. Peak Targeting Forum (PTF)

PTF is a weekly meeting attended by Fujitsu personnel, but an Emergency PTF can be scheduled at any
time if Peaks need urgent review. PTF is attended by a broad representation of SMEs from many Fujitsu
teams and areas of expertise.

PTF will review Peaks that have gone through BIF, and, if required, CBIF, and need to be targeted at a
Release.

The agreed solutions are reviewed along with other development activity to identify the most appropriate
Release in which to incorporate them. This is usually a maintenance Release for the relevant area of
code to which the fix will need to be applied. POL and Fujitsu may agree to incorporate a fix with a major
Release in respect of specific projects. If the fix relates to the Counter Business Application then this
needs to align with the POL and Fujitsu agreed counter release deployment schedules.

Maintenance Releases occur on a regular basis. Fujitsu identifies a space in the Forward Schedule of
Change (the live release calendar) and then raises a change. The change then goes through the POL
Change Control process for POL’s approval to proceed with the maintenance Release. The Peaks are
listed on a Release Note and references added in the change (see Recommendation 5).

In summary, the outcome of the PTF can be one of the following:

41. The fix is incorporated into the next maintenance Release for the code to be fixed (e.g.
Horizon Business Server (HBS), Estate Management, Branch Access Layer (BAL)). This is
the most likely path a fix will take; or

2. The fix is incorporated into an existing scheduled project major Release. This is an
infrequent outcome; or

3. The fix, and other fixes in the functionally related area, is included in a new project major

Release if the scope of that Release, and timescales, are agreed between Fujitsu and POL.
This does happen, although infrequently; or

For counter releases only, the fix could be marked as “Next Counter Release”. Counter
releases have their own schedule for deployment and in some cases the next Release has
not been scheduled. The “Next Counter Release” is used for situations in which POL decides
that a fix should be ‘parked’ for the next scheduled Release (which may not yet be
determined).

Minutes of the PTF are prepared and the decisions are fed into the SDLC process.

SDLC, Testing & QA

The required fix then follows the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC) and Testing & QA processes.

These processes are described in the “SDLC Report” COM/MGT/REP/4168 and the “Testing & QA
Report” COM/MGT/REP/4166.

The process ends when the fix is deployed into the live environment and relevant Peaks and KBs are

updated.

Urgent/Emergency Software Fixes

Urgent/Emergency software fixes can be reviewed at an Emergency BIF/PTF. Any required action would
then follow the POL Change Control process.

6 Systems, Tools and Reporting
6.1 Systems and Tools

The following key systems and tools are used:

TfSNow -— Fujitsu service management toolset for recording and tracking Incidents and changes.

ServiceNow — POL service management toolset for recording and tracking Incidents and
Changes.

Peak — Fujitsu toolset for recording 3° & 4" Line Incidents and tracking software fixes.

Knowledge Base — Fujitsu support database containing KBs containing support guidance.

6.2 Notification and Reporting to POL
POL is aware of status via the following methods and processes:

e Incidents — these are managed within the Fujitsu and POL service management toolsets. POL
ITDSD log calls from subpostmasters and then notify the Fujitsu MAC team — typically via the
integration of the mutual service management toolsets. It is assumed that the POL ServiceNow
toolset provides reporting for POL review.

e Change Control — this is managed within the Fujitsu and POL service management toolsets.
POL own the Change Control process and provide approval for, and have visibility of, Releases
and operational changes.

« Customer Business Impact Forum (CBIF) — a joint minuted meeting to seek POL’s decisions
on next steps relating to software fixes. See Section 5.2.2.

e Known Errors Review Forum — a joint POL-Fujitsu forum to provide POL with early notification
of any new Incident with the potential to impact branch operations. See Appendix B.

POL manages all communications relating to BEDs with the subpostmasters.

7 Formal Audit Reports

POL has commissioned an ISAE3402 audit as well as quarterly PCI Prioritised Approach audits on POA.
Both audits examine the Incident Management topic from slightly different perspectives and to varying
degrees of detail. Furthermore, POA are periodically requested to contribute to internal Fujitsu corporate
audits to support Fujitsu UK in attaining and maintaining a variety of certifications such as 15027001,
1$09001 and 1SO22301.

8 Conclusions

“Bugs, Errors and Defects” has a very broad meaning and can apply to a wide range of possible
Incidents. In this report, Fujitsu explained how they are managed under the POA Incident Management
process, and how Incidents that require a software fix are managed through the Management of
Software Fixes process (see Section 5.2).

Appendix B — Horizon Known Errors Review Forum

The Horizon Known Errors Review Forum is a weekly Fujitsu and POL forum. Its purpose is to provide
POL with early notification of new Incidents with the potential to impact branch operations. POL are
notified of such Incidents as soon as they are identified and ahead of the weekly meetings.

The forum looks at Incidents (for which KBs will have been raised) which have the following high-level
classifications (see Recommendation 4):

e SPM Financial Impact - entries which contain information that has the potential to cause
financial impact to subpostmasters; and

e SPM Experience - entries which contain information that impacts the subpostmasters’ user
experience.

A description of the Incident is provided to Post Office, along with an impact statement and the proposed
resolution or resolution options, when they are known.

The Incidents discussed at the forum do not necessarily require software fixes. The resolution may also
relate to changes that need to be made by POL or one of POL’s suppliers — such as Verizon,
Computacenter or Atos.

Investigation and resolutions for the Incidents raised will follow the established processes.
Any POL decisions made at this forum on the required actions are taken to the Customer Business
Impact Forum (CBIF) for review as per the relevant processes.

Note: Ownership and chair of the Horizon Known Errors Review Forum transferred from Fujitsu to POL
from January 2021. The release of a new Terms of Reference for the Forum is expected from POL in
February 2021. A change of scope is also anticipated.
