Subject:
Attachment: BIS select committee Qs and As.doc

Attach the internal draft briefing document with all the Qs so far that I will draft answers for. Please let me know if there
are any main areas of questioning you think I have missed.

T will start working on the all answers now and I will refresh and check this against all the public documents, including
FOI, when we have completed that package.

This document does not currently contain wider PO questions - such as NT - and Mike will be contributing a section on
that.

Many thanks
Mel
