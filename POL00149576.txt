Please find attached a selection of slides for possible use at ExCo tomorrow.

I am not sure how Paula will want to play this so this pack can be cut any which way. The only slides missing are costs

and Scheme facts and figures which I will add in tomorrow.

I did not plan to hand all these out to everyone — just have them as a prompt for Me/Mark/Chris depending how the

meeting goes. That is whether we discuss options or handling.
V'Il look over them again first thing and tidy up but this should give you the gist.

Best wishes
