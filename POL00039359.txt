Hi

There is a handout that we give to new starters ,this has questions that the advisors should be asking when dealing with
these and what they should be checking. I have attached the doc for you to have a look at.

Many Thanks

Hi Guys

With regards to section 2 - maybe not on the KBA but have we as part of our NBSC training material devised a

Alison,

As discussed yesterday, following on from the 2™ Balancing Simplification workshop next week we will
then be moving forward to a go/no go decision meeting on 23" January and I am keen to have as much
information as possible to inform that decision. I would therefore like to get your view on the best way to
get the following:

e A lower level understanding on NBSC - At the moment I have some call stats by call categorisation
related to balancing, but this does not give me a very good understanding of what the calls are
actually about and what the root cause is that is driving them. Equally, we do not have any solid
information on average call lengths. Is it possible to sample some balancing calls

« NBSC Knowledge Base content - Is there any KB content that NBSC have on balancing, especially
discrepancy diagnostics, that the branch would not have access to?

Regards

Shaun
