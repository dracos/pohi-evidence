lege - Tomorrow's GLO Update and Planning Call is cancelled

Subject: Private & Con’

Importance: High
Dear all,
GLO Update & Planning Call tomorrow

Given there have been no material updates since the Board on Tuesday, the call tomorrow is cancelled. Please contact
Mark Underwood in the first instance with any queries or requests for further information.

Common Issues Trial (CIT)

Since the GLO Update & Planning call last Friday and the Board on Tuesday this week, there have been no material
updates or changes. POL has now completed its preparations for the Common Issues Trial (CIT), which begins on
Monday (5* Nov) and it is now really over to the legal team and, principally, David Cavender QC (DCQC) to ensure that
he is fully prepared ahead of opening submissions on Wednesday 7 November 2018.

Aside for a telephone con with DCQC tomorrow at 9am, our attentions will focus on making sure POL’s 14 witnesses are
fully supported and have everything they need ahead of giving evidence, which for them, will begin on Thursday 15
November 2018.

Horizon Issues Trial (HIT)

The only material update since the call between Paula and DCCQ on Monday (which took place ahead of the Board on
Tuesday) is that Fujitsu’s employee Steve Parker has now agreed to be witness and provide evidence. Paula is already
aware but this is welcome news.

Otherwise, we are continuing to pull together responses to the witness statements received from Freeths, ahead of the

current 13 November 2018 deadline and Robert, our Expert, is working on his response to Jason Coyne’s report. This is
due on 30 November 2018.

Thanks,
Angela
