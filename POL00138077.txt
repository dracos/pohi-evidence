Delivery & likelihood of success RV Trajectory

Overall the scheme is stabalising with a firmer grip on facts and data, however
there is still a lot of work to be done to mitigate the risk the Scheme poses to
Post Office’s reputation and business (through the quality of our administration,
investigations and delivery).

« Administration — a full review of the Scheme’s administration is almost complete.
This has brought to light issues with purchase orders, payments, correspondence
dispatch and logging and the approval of advisors

* Governance — first programme board meeting today, resources for programme not
yet confirmed, revised risks and issues management in place, process mapping
and documentation ongoing

* Stakeholders — relationship with JFSA and Second Sight in a challenging phase
as we seek to agree engagement terms with Second Sight

* Legal — revised support model with Bond Dickinson in place

* Risk — programme is very high risk - including a high risk of delivery failure

Second Sight (SS) lack
resources to progress the
investigation of cases

Second Sight and JFSA
consider the scope of Second
Sight’s work to extend beyond
the Scheme and in any event,
have taken a very wide view of
Second’s Sight’s investigatory
role within the Scheme

Delays in getting all the Fujitsu
data requests returned in the
timeframes expected by WG —
technically we are limited to the
number of queries we can run
(about 30 months of data per
week, e.g. 1 x 30 month
request or 30 x 1 month

—— requests).

SS have been relieved of Scheme administration activities .
Their contract is being revised and resource requirements
are being monitored through the WG. Although they have
provided a CV for an additional resource to CA, this will be
insufficient to manage the workload soon to commence;
should we be seeking alternative resourcing arrangements?

4. Continuing discussions with Second Sight about their
engagement

2. Conversations with AH about the role within the
Scheme

3. Clarification with PV and AP about scope

1. Arrange a meeting with Fujitsu to explore the possibility of
improving the number of queries which can be processed at
any one time

2. Investigations team to schedule and prioritise requests in
a weekly meeting with Fujitsu.

3. Investigations team to look at how we focus cases to
more specific data ranges rather than broad requests.
Accept and manage impacts of the schedule back to the
WG via Angela.

6.1 Financial Outlook i)

ii Terms of Success Performance \ Key Risks Financial \ Early
: jl : Reference Criteria Dashboard & Issues Outlook Settlement

¢ The Scheme is currently assumed to be all exceptional next year in the
budget process

* Compensation paid to agents in relation to the Scheme could be treated as
exceptional on the basis that the total amount paid out is significant in the
context of a specific financial year (spend >c£5m) however the
compensation could not be linked to Network Transformation as it is in
relation to past events

« Review and set up of new internal processes can be treated as exceptional
as, for accounting purposes, it can be seen as part of Network
Transformation as this relates to the establishment processes required for
the future models

* However it is unlikely to be possible to treat the project costs of mediation as
exceptional because it will not be significant in amount. This element relates
to a past event (the dismissal of the subpostmaster concerned)

* Therefore we need as much of the mediation spend to be incurred this
financial year.

* Detail on the early settlement policy is set out in the paper
circulated with these slides
« In summary:
¢ Early settlement will reduce costs for the Programme
* The policy can be applied at every stage of a case as it
progresses through the Scheme
¢ Bond Dickinson will lead on identifying suitable cases
* Senior managers at POL will engage with Applicants
¢ Awide range of different cases could be settled early:
¢ Low value claims — under £15k
¢ Where POL is clearly at fault
« Where a case is too old to investigate mediation could be
unproductive
* Follows the process in settlement policy for scoping and
approving settlements so that governance controls are in
place
