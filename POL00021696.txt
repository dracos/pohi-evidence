Michael ... THANKS !!! We are also looking into why that email didn't come out in our searches of the POL-supplied
emails. lan is pretty certain THEY DIDN'T DISCLOSE IT TO US. That's serious.

Ron.

Well... my pressure on Rudkin has paid off. He eventually found the attached doc which shows that the person he met
at Bracknell was Martin ROLFE.

POL needs to get Martin's side of the story straight way. Also, please let's find out why he did not come forward earlier
(you told us you'd contacted all the Basement team to ask if they'd met Rudkin, yes?).

Best regards, Ron.
