Key points and actions

* CC introduced the meeting explaining that the purpose of the meeting was to talk through advice on the
settlement offer for the Post Office litigation, and seek KT’s agreement in principle

© KT agreed that a way forward is needed and after reviewing the advice sent across on Friday, KT agreed with
the advice and recommendations

© UKGI colleagues confirmed that the first of two judgements will be made on Friday at midday, with the
second expected to be roughly within the next week or so

© For the second judgement, we will be given 24 hours-notice

* ACTION — Private Office to set up a call between KT and officials as soon as we have notice of the
judgements

© KT stressed that a steer on communications is needed, to ensure KT and SofS are clear what they can say
publicly

* Clearance now needs to be sought from the Perm Sec and no10 need to be updated on the current position —
ACTION — UKGI to draft a note on this for no10 as soon as possible, to be circulated to SofS office
