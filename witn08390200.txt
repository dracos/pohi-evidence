Statement No. WITN08390200

Dated: 11 October 2023

POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

ADDENDUM TO WITNESS STATEMENT DATED 12 MAY 2023

1. This is an addendum to the witness statement | submitted to the Post Office Horizon
IT Inquiry (“Inquiry”) on 12 May 2012. In that statement, | addressed 81 questions put
to me by the Inquiry in respect of my employment at Royal Mail Group (RMG) and,
subsequently, at the Post Office Limited (POL), pursuant to a Rule 9 Request dated
12 April 2023.

2. The Rule 9 Request enclosed 77 supporting documents, which | considered in
preparing that statement. Since then | have been provided with a large number of
additional documents provided in several batches, details of which | set out in an index
to this statement. A number of those documents are relevant to things said by me in
my first statement and the purpose of this statement is therefore to capture my

additional comments having reviewed that material.

3. Ido not comment on every additional document that has been disclosed to me. | have
not received any additional questions from the Inquiry and it is not clear to me in
respect of every document why it has been provided to me.

Prosecutions and issues with the Horizon system

4. First, | wish to elaborate on my role and responsibility in signing off cases for
prosecution. | stated at paragraph 19 of my statement that | began signing off on new

Page 1 of 20
WITN08390200

WITN08390200

prosecutions at POL between mid to late 2013, after being asked by my line manager
(Susan Crichton — POL General Counsel) to do so. | have since noted that some of
the documents provided by the Inquiry indicate that | took on this responsibility sooner.
For example, POL00104929 - which is not dated, but is thought by the Inquiry to have
been produced in October 2012 - contains a flow chart which assigns responsibility
for “sign off’ to the Head of Security (i.e. me) or Head of Legal. Additionally,
POL00066639 appears to be a request for my approval on a prosecution decision in
October 2012, while POL0O0113109_020 appears to include a reference to me
authorising a prosecution in November 2012. | do not recall these documents or these
cases, but they suggest that | began signing off on prosecutions in 2012 rather than
in 2013, as | initially thought. It is therefore possible that the conversation | recall with
my manager, Susan Crichton, was in 2012, possibly around the time POL separated
from RMG. | would speculate that the separation may even have been the catalyst for
the change in process, but | cannot recall.

In practice, my role in signing off new cases for prosecution entailed me reviewing
files that had already been reviewed by the Legal team, and | am not aware of any
occasion on which | did not follow their recommendation. | am also unaware as to
whether any of the cases that | approved for prosecution resulted in prosecution;
around this time a decision was taken (not by me) to pause all prosecutions. As
mentioned in my statement at paragraph 19, | know that prosecutions were not
proceeding in 2013 after it became necessary to identify a new subject matter expert.
| believe this related to the Second Sight report that | refer to at paragraph 116 of my
first statement, and which produced its report in around July 2013. If it is correct that |
was authorising prosecutions from 2012 then it may be that some of the prosecutions
that | authorised did proceed though whether they were then paused as a result of the
Second Sight report | do not know. | had thought that | continued to perform this role
until | left POL in 2016, however, a document | have seen (POL00030686 at paragraph

3.3) suggests that possibly this responsibility was reassigned from November 2013.

Secondly, | would like to clarify, and add additional context to, my awareness and
understanding of issues within the Horizon system. One of the original documents
provided with the Rule 9 Request was POL00107129, a memo from Rod Ismay on
challenges to the Horizon system dated 2010. As mentioned at paragraph 114 of my
statement, | am unable to comment on this report. | do not recall that | contributed to
it, and POL00120479 - which | have received as additional disclosure - suggests that

Page 2 of 20
WITNO08390200
WITN08390200

| did not. | also do not recall reading it though | expect | almost certainly would have
done.

7. | have now recalled, subsequent to completing my first statement, that around this
time | asked Mike Young, the Operations Director responsible for Security, IT and
Service Delivery (who managed Fujitsu and Horizon service management), and who
was my line manager between 2008 and 2011 — about what was happening with the
Horizon system, as | was aware of some concerns around the system by external
stakeholders. Although | have no detailed recollection | was left with the impression
that the matter was being dealt with to the extent necessary by Senior Executives.

8. Similarly, after the Second Sight report was published, my recollection is that the
messaging from the business was that the Horizon system had some bugs but that it

was fit for purpose (as explained at paragraph 116 of my first statement).

9. | note that Second Sight’s report was provided to me in a batch of documents |
received from the Inquiry on 7 July, as POL00002228. | do not recall whether | have
seen or read the report before but | may have. However, | was broadly aware of the
findings of the report (again, as mentioned at paragraph 116 of my statement), and
various work streams were set up as a result of these findings which | was either
involved in at some point or aware of. For example, weekly Horizon meetings were
set up to consider issues holistically which various stakeholders attended, including
POL’s external lawyers. | have already mentioned these meetings at paragraph 120
of my statement, and will comment further on them below. Additionally, | was involved
in setting up a monthly call on the investigations and prosecutions and Cartwright King
attended these. | mentioned these meetings at paragraph 117 of my first statement.
Separately, a network support project was set up and led by Gayle Peacock around
training for the network and other work streams. | note that the terms of reference for
this programme- the Branch Support Programme - were provided as part of the
additional disclosure | have received as POL00039158 and POL00004399. | do not
recall this paper but | do recall the programme, as | have described. | note that | am
listed as a key stakeholder but | do not recall that | was heavily involved in the process
in practice.

Disclosure allegations

10. At paragraphs 119 to 121 of my original statement, | laid out my memory of the weekly
Horizon meetings. In addition, | laid out what | understand has been alleged in relation
Page 3 of 20
11,

WITNO08390200

to my behaviour in respect of those meetings since, namely the “shredding” allegation
in July 2013.

The following documents — which formed part of the additional disclosure | have

received - are relevant to this period (please note that where | have listed more than

one document it is because the same document has been disclosed more than once

12. As | explained in paragraph 119 of my first statement | became aware of the
“shredding” allegation in 2021, following the Court of Appeal hearings in Hamilton and
Others. In the course of those hearings | was identified as the individual who had
allegedly given an instruction to “shred” minutes of a meeting / meetings where
Horizon issues escalated from the Network had been discussed.

Page 5 of 20
WITN08390200

WITN08390200

13. It remains the case that despite being provided with additional documents, my actual
recollection is very limited. In fact the documents have demonstrated some areas in
which my recollection is clearly unreliable. A good example of this is that | had
assumed, partly based on what had been said in the Court of Appeal proceedings
about me, and as is reflected at paragraph 120 of my first statement, that | had
attended the first meetings convened to discuss the Horizon issues that appear to
have taken place on 19, 24, 31 July and 7 August, whereas it now appears most likely

that the first meeting | attended was on 14 August.

14. Of all the documents disclosed to me the one that provides the best insight into my
state of mind at the time is my email to Susan Crichton on 14 August (POL00139690).
| do not recall this exchange and did not know it existed until it was disclosed by the
Inquiry. It largely speaks for itself and | am unable to add much in terms of the specific
matters referred to. What | can add is my impression as its author that it appears | was
frustrated when | wrote it. Susan Crichton’s email to me on the evening of 13 August
had been critical of the way | was managing the Wednesday meetings (“/t sounds like
this is not being chaired, the participants are unclear as to its purpose and no minutes
are being kept — or there is confusion. Can we discuss?”). In writing this email | think
| am saying to her that | believed that | was managing the meetings in the way that
she had asked me to. | do not recall what if any response | received to my email and

no response has been disclosed to me.

15. From my email to Susan Crichton and from the other documents that have been
disclosed | believe it may be possible to draw various conclusions about what probably

happened.

16. It would appear that | initially delegated the task of chairing the Wednesday meetings
to Head of Security Operations, Rob King. According to the minute of the first meeting
held on 19 July 2013 (POL00139730) he appears to be in the role of chair.

17. According to those minutes it appears some kind of instruction was given regarding
note-taking. The minute reads, “No minutes circulated, but we will be taking notes. In
scope were issues and problems the group were made aware of.” | note that a number

of lawyers were present at that meeting.

18. Attributed to Martin Smith from Cartwright King is the comment, “Clarification on

WITN08390200

WITN08390200

disclosure and email correspondence. Emphasised need to ensure that any document
produced would be potentially disclosable.”

Attributed to Andrew Parsons from Bond Dickinson is the comment, “Spoke about
emails, written comms, etc ... if it's produced it's then available for disclosure, if it's not
then technically it isn't.” This is very close to the wording in an email from Jarnail Singh
(POL Criminal Lawyer) to Martin Smith dated 1 August 2013 (POL00139746) in which
he says, “/ know Simon [Clarke] is advising on disclosure. As discussed can he look
into the common myth that emails, written communications etc. meetings. If its
produced its then available for disclosure. If it?s (sic) not then technically it isn?t? (sic)
Possible true of civil cases NOT CRIMINAL CASES?”. Similar wording is also
referenced in the advice from Simon Clarke at POL00006799 (“Advice had been given
to POL which | report as relayed to me verbatim: ... “If it’s produced its available for
disclosure — if not minuted then technically its not.””).

There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 24 July
(POL00139731). Again, | do not appear to have been present and it appears that Rob
King chaired. | note identical wording, “No minutes circulated, but we will be taking
notes. In scope were issues and problems the group were made aware of.” Again, |
notice the attendance of internal and external lawyers at this meeting.

. There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 31 July.

(POL00139732). Again, | do not appear to have been present but internal and external
lawyers were. | do not see anything in these minutes that appears to be relevant to

issue of recording minutes or disclosure.

There is a telephone note that appears to be of a call on 31 July between Martin Smith
(Cartwright King) and Jarnail Singh (POL Criminal Lawyer) (POL00139745). The note
reads, “Discussing disclosure issues: JScott has instructed that typed minutes be
scrapped.” | do not recall speaking with Jarnail Singh. | do not know what is meant by
the word, “scrapped” in this context. It appears from my email to Susan Crichton dated
14 August that the notes of the meetings were still in existence as at the date of that

email and that it had never been any intention of mine that they should not be retained.

The next morning, 1 August, Jarnail Singh emailed Martin Smith (POLO00139746)
saying, “! know Simon [Clarke] is advising on disclosure. As discussed can he look

into the common myth that emails, written communications etc.. meetings. If its

produced its then available for disclosure. If it?s (sic) not then technically it isn?t? (sic)
Possible true of civil cases NOT CRIMINAL CASES?”. As | comment at paragraph 19
above, this appears to have been based verbatim on something recorded as being
said by Andrew Parsons from Bond Dickinson at the meeting on 19 July.

In the Clarke Advice circulated on 2 August, it is said, “The minutes of a previous
conference call had been typed and emailed to a number of persons. An instruction
was then given that those emails and minutes should be, and have been, destroyed:
the word "shredded" was conveyed to me.” It is not clear to me from the documents
disclosed to me how, why or by whom the word “shredded” was conveyed to Simon
Clarke. In any event, as | have already noted, it is clear from my email to Susan

Crichton dated 14 August, that the notes of the meetings were still in existence.

| do not recall that this advice was shared with me at the time.

There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 7 August
(POL00139729). Again, | do not appear to have been present but internal and external
lawyers were, including Martin Smith, Simon Clarke’s colleague from Cartwright King.
| see nothing in these minutes suggesting any kind of change of approach, and indeed

there is no express reference to the minuting of the meetings.

On the 13 and 14 August was the exchange of emails between Susan Crichton and
me referred to previously (POL139690).

There are two separate and slightly inconsistent references to a suggestion that | sent
an email on 13 August “admitting” to some kind of instruction to “shred”. These are
POL00139749 and UKGI00013223. They are inconsistent in that the first suggests
the email was sent to Susan Crichton while the second suggests it was to someone
else. No such email has been disclosed to me and | do not remember sending such
an email. Nothing in the exchange between Susan Crichton and me on 13 and 14

August (POL139690) is consistent with me making any such admission.

There is a further note untimed but dated 14 August between Jarnail Singh and Martin
Smith. It says, “John Scott will be in conf call> MJS said not appropriate.”

There are minutes of a meeting on 14 August (POL139725). Notwithstanding the
above | do in fact appear to have been at this meeting, as were both Martin Smith and
Page 8 of 20
WITN08390200

WITN08390200

Jarnail Singh. | have no recollection of the meeting but | do not see any reference in
the minutes to the issue of keeping and retaining minutes. My assumption is that my
attendance reflects my email to Susan Crichton of the same date (POL00139690) in
which | stated:

“Clearly | will now attend the conference calls as Chair and following on from the
previous discussions and the steer below, unless otherwise directed, this will become
a formal meeting with terms of reference, electronic notes, actions and appropriate

governance within such approach.”

3

. In the period following 14 August there were various emails agreeing the appropriate
form in which to capture the information regarding Horizon issues (see POL00139691,
POL00139692, and POL00139693). | do not recall this but can see that | was in copy
at some points of this email discussion.

32. There are minutes of meetings on 21 and 28 August (POLO0139725 and

POL00139726) from which it appears | was present. | do not recall these meetings.

33. From POL00139695 and POL00139696 it appears that a “Protocol” was developed in
October 2013 described as being, “for the conduct of Wednesday morning Telephone
Conferences held for the purpose of the Identification, Recording and Retention of
Material which may be subject to Duties of Disclosure.” It appears to have been drafted
by POL’s external lawyers. | do not recall this protocol or discussions around it.

34. By 25 September 2013, according to the minutes of these meetings that have been

disclosed, | was no longer attending these meetings.

35. In summary, while | have very little recollection of this episode, the documents
disclosed by the Inquiry suggest that | was tasked by my line manager, POL General
Counsel Susan Crichton in respect of meetings to be held to consider Horizon issues,
that my understanding of this tasking included a requirement to limit the manner and
circulation of notes of these meetings, that this related in some way to disclosure
obligations, that there was an understanding by POL’s internal and external lawyers
at the time that this was the approach being adopted, and that when it transpired that
this was considered not to be the appropriate course, corrections were quickly made.

36. If the Inquiry wishes me to consider other documents relevant to this issue | will be

happy to do so.
