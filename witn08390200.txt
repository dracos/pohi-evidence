                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          ADDENDUM TO WITNESS STATEMENT DATED 12 MAY 2023




   1. This is an addendum to the witness statement I submitted to the Post Office Horizon
      IT Inquiry ("Inquiry") on 12 May 2012. In that statement, I addressed 81 questions put
      to me by the Inquiry in respect of my employment at Royal Mail Group (RMG) and,
      subsequently, at the Post Office Limited (POL), pursuant to a Rule 9 Request dated
      12 April 2023.


   2. The Rule 9 Request enclosed 77 supporting documents, which I considered in
      preparing that statement. Since then I have been provided with a large number of
      additional documents provided in several batches, details of which I set out in an index
      to this statement. A number of those documents are relevant to things said by me in
      my first statement and the purpose of this statement is therefore to capture my
      additional comments having reviewed that material.



   3. I do not comment on every additional document that has been disclosed to me. I have
      not received any additional questions from the Inquiry and it is not clear to me in
      respect of every document why it has been provided to me.



Prosecutions and issues with the Horizon system


   4. First, I wish to elaborate on my role and responsibility in signing off cases for
      prosecution. I stated at paragraph 19 of my statement that I began signing off on new

                                          Page 1 of 20
                                                                                                W ITN08390200
                                                                                              WITNO8390200




   prosecutions at POL between mid to late 2013, after being asked by my line manager
   (Susan Crichton — POL General Counsel) to do so. I have since noted that some of
   the documents provided by the Inquiry indicate that I took on this responsibility sooner.
   For example, POL00104929 - which is not dated, but is thought by the Inquiry to have
   been produced in October 2012 - contains a flow chart which assigns responsibility
   for "sign off' to the Head of Security (i.e. me) or Head of Legal. Additionally,
   POL00066639 appears to be a request for my approval on a prosecution decision in
   October 2012, while POL00113109_020 appears to include a reference to me
   authorising a prosecution in November 2012. I do not recall these documents or these
   cases, but they suggest that I began signing off on prosecutions in 2012 rather than
   in 2013, as I initially thought. It is therefore possible that the conversation I recall with
   my manager, Susan Crichton, was in 2012, possibly around the time POL separated
   from RMG. I would speculate that the separation may even have been the catalyst for
   the change in process, but I cannot recall.

5. In practice, my role in signing off new cases for prosecution entailed me reviewing
   files that had already been reviewed by the Legal team, and I am not aware of any
   occasion on which I did not follow their recommendation. I am also unaware as to
   whether any of the cases that I approved for prosecution resulted in prosecution;
   around this time a decision was taken (not by me) to pause all prosecutions. As
   mentioned in my statement at paragraph 19, I know that prosecutions were not
   proceeding in 2013 after it became necessary to identify a new subject matter expert.
   I believe this related to the Second Sight report that I refer to at paragraph 116 of my
   first statement, and which produced its report in around July 2013. If it is correct that I
   was authorising prosecutions from 2012 then it may be that some of the prosecutions
   that I authorised did proceed though whether they were then paused as a result of the
   Second Sight report I do not know. I had thought that I continued to perform this role
   until I left POL in 2016, however, a document I have seen (POL00030686 at paragraph
   3.3) suggests that possibly this responsibility was reassigned from November 2013.


6. Secondly, I would like to clarify, and add additional context to, my awareness and
   understanding of issues within the Horizon system. One of the original documents
   provided with the Rule 9 Request was POL00107129, a memo from Rod Ismay on
   challenges to the Horizon system dated 2010. As mentioned at paragraph 114 of my
   statement, I am unable to comment on this report. I do not recall that I contributed to
   it, and POL00120479 - which I have received as additional disclosure - suggests that



                                         Page 2 of 20
                                                                                                W ITNO8390200
                                                                                              WITNO8390200




      I did not. I also do not recall reading it though I expect I almost certainly would have
      done.

   7. I have now recalled, subsequent to completing my first statement, that around this
      time I asked Mike Young, the Operations Director responsible for Security, IT and
      Service Delivery (who managed Fujitsu and Horizon service management), and who
      was my line manager between 2008 and 2011 — about what was happening with the
      Horizon system, as I was aware of some concerns around the system by external
      stakeholders. Although I have no detailed recollection I was left with the impression
      that the matter was being dealt with to the extent necessary by Senior Executives.

   8. Similarly, after the Second Sight report was published, my recollection is that the
      messaging from the business was that the Horizon system had some bugs but that it
      was fit for purpose (as explained at paragraph 116 of my first statement).

   9. I note that Second Sight's report was provided to me in a batch of documents I
      received from the Inquiry on 7 July, as POL00002228. I do not recall whether I have
      seen or read the report before but I may have. However, I was broadly aware of the
      findings of the report (again, as mentioned at paragraph 116 of my statement), and
      various work streams were set up as a result of these findings which I was either
      involved in at some point or aware of. For example, weekly Horizon meetings were
      set up to consider issues holistically which various stakeholders attended, including
      POL's external lawyers. I have already mentioned these meetings at paragraph 120
      of my statement, and will comment further on them below. Additionally, I was involved
      in setting up a monthly call on the investigations and prosecutions and Cartwright King
      attended these. I mentioned these meetings at paragraph 117 of my first statement.
      Separately, a network support project was set up and led by Gayle Peacock around
      training for the network and other work streams. I note that the terms of reference for
      this programme- the Branch Support Programme - were provided as part of the
      additional disclosure I have received as POL00039158 and POL00004399. I do not
      recall this paper but I do recall the programme, as I have described. I note that I am
      listed as a key stakeholder but I do not recall that I was heavily involved in the process
      in practice.


Disclosure allegations


   10. At paragraphs 119 to 121 of my original statement, I laid out my memory of the weekly
      Horizon meetings. In addition, I laid out what I understand has been alleged in relation
                                           Page 3 of 20

                                                                                       WITN08390200




   to my behaviour in respect of those meetings since, namely the "shredding" allegation
   in July 2013.


11. The following documents — which formed part of the additional disclosure I have
   received - are relevant to this period (please note that where I have listed more than
   one document it is because the same document has been disclosed more than once

12. As I explained in paragraph 119 of my first statement I became aware of the
   "shredding" allegation in 2021, following the Court of Appeal hearings in Hamilton and
   Others. In the course of those hearings I was identified as the individual who had
   allegedly given an instruction to "shred" minutes of a meeting / meetings where
   Horizon issues escalated from the Network had been discussed.

                                      Page 5 of 20
                                                                                             W ITNO8390200
                                                                                           WITN08390200




13. It remains the case that despite being provided with additional documents, my actual
   recollection is very limited. In fact the documents have demonstrated some areas in
   which my recollection is clearly unreliable. A good example of this is that I had
   assumed, partly based on what had been said in the Court of Appeal proceedings
   about me, and as is reflected at paragraph 120 of my first statement, that I had
   attended the first meetings convened to discuss the Horizon issues that appear to
   have taken place on 19, 24, 31 July and 7 August, whereas it now appears most likely
   that the first meeting I attended was on 14 August.


14. Of all the documents disclosed to me the one that provides the best insight into my
   state of mind at the time is my email to Susan Crichton on 14 August (POL00139690).
   I do not recall this exchange and did not know it existed until it was disclosed by the
   Inquiry. It largely speaks for itself and I am unable to add much in terms of the specific
   matters referred to. What I can add is my impression as its author that it appears I was
   frustrated when I wrote it. Susan Crichton's email to me on the evening of 13 August
   had been critical of the way I was managing the Wednesday meetings (" It sounds like
   this is not being chaired, the participants are unclear as to its purpose and no minutes
   are being kept — or there is confusion. Can we discuss?"). In writing this email I think
   I am saying to her that I believed that I was managing the meetings in the way that
   she had asked me to. I do not recall what if any response I received to my email and
   no response has been disclosed to me.


15. From my email to Susan Crichton and from the other documents that have been
   disclosed I believe it may be possible to draw various conclusions about what probably
   happened.


16. It would appear that I initially delegated the task of chairing the Wednesday meetings
   to Head of Security Operations, Rob King. According to the minute of the first meeting
   held on 19 July 2013 (POL00139730) he appears to be in the role of chair.


17. According to those minutes it appears some kind of instruction was given regarding
   note-taking. The minute reads, "No minutes circulated, but we will be taking notes. In
   scope were issues and problems the group were made aware of." I note that a number
   of lawyers were present at that meeting.


18. Attributed to Martin Smith from Cartwright King is the comment, " Clarification on

   disclosure and email correspondence. Emphasised need to ensure that any document
   produced would be potentially disclosable. "


19. Attributed to Andrew Parsons from Bond Dickinson is the comment, " Spoke about
   emails, written comms, etc ... if it's produced it's then available for disclosure, if it's not
   then technically it isn't." This is very close to the wording in an email from Jarnail Singh
   (POL Criminal Lawyer) to Martin Smith dated 1 August 2013 (POL00139746) in which
   he says, "I know Simon [Clarke] is advising on disclosure. As discussed can he look
   into the common myth that emails, written communications etc. meetings. If its
   produced its then available for disclosure. If it?s (sic) not then technically it isn?t? (sic)
   Possible true of civil cases NOT CRIMINAL CASES?". Similar wording is also
   referenced in the advice from Simon Clarke at POL00006799 ("Advice had been given
   to POL which I report as relayed to me verbatim: ... "If it's produced its available for
   disclosure — if not minuted then technically its not. ").


20. There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 24 July
   (POL00139731). Again, I do not appear to have been present and it appears that Rob
   King chaired. I note identical wording, "No minutes circulated, but we will be taking
   notes. In scope were issues and problems the group were made aware of." Again, I
   notice the attendance of internal and external lawyers at this meeting.


21. There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 31 July.
   (POL00139732). Again, I do not appear to have been present but internal and external
   lawyers were. I do not see anything in these minutes that appears to be relevant to
   issue of recording minutes or disclosure.


22. There is a telephone note that appears to be of a call on 31 July between Martin Smith
   (Cartwright King) and Jarnail Singh (POL Criminal Lawyer) (POL00139745). The note
   reads, "Discussing disclosure issues: JScott has instructed that typed minutes be
   scrapped." I do not recall speaking with Jarnail Singh. I do not know what is meant by
   the word, "scrapped" in this context. It appears from my email to Susan Crichton dated
   14 August that the notes of the meetings were still in existence as at the date of that
   email and that it had never been any intention of mine that they should not be retained.



23. The next morning, 1 August, Jarnail Singh emailed Martin Smith (POL00139746)
   saying, "I know Simon [Clarke] is advising on disclosure. As discussed can he look
   into the common myth that emails, written communications etc.. meetings. if its
                                 Page 7 of 20

   produced its then available for disclosure. If it?s (sic) not then technically it isn?t? (sic)
   Possible true of civil cases NOT CRIMINAL CASES?". As I comment at paragraph 19
   above, this appears to have been based verbatim on something recorded as being
   said by Andrew Parsons from Bond Dickinson at the meeting on 19 July.


24. In the Clarke Advice circulated on 2 August, it is said, "The minutes of a previous
   conference call had been typed and emailed to a number of persons. An instruction
    was then given that those emails and minutes should be, and have been, destroyed:
   the word "shredded" was conveyed to me." It is not clear to me from the documents
   disclosed to me how, why or by whom the word "shredded" was conveyed to Simon
   Clarke. In any event, as I have already noted, it is clear from my email to Susan
   Crichton dated 14 August, that the notes of the meetings were still in existence.


25. I do not recall that this advice was shared with me at the time.


26. There are minutes of a further meeting that appears to have taken place on 7 August
   (POLOO 139729). Again, I do not appear to have been present but internal and external
   lawyers were, including Martin Smith, Simon Clarke's colleague from Cartwright King.
   I see nothing in these minutes suggesting any kind of change of approach, and indeed
   there is no express reference to the minuting of the meetings.


27. On the 13 and 14 August was the exchange of emails between Susan Crichton and
   me referred to previously (POL139690).


28. There are two separate and slightly inconsistent references to a suggestion that I sent
   an email on 13 August "admitting" to some kind of instruction to "shred". These are
   POL00139749 and UKG100013223. They are inconsistent in that the first suggests
   the email was sent to Susan Crichton while the second suggests it was to someone
   else. No such email has been disclosed to me and I do not remember sending such
   an email. Nothing in the exchange between Susan Crichton and me on 13 and 14
   August (POL139690) is consistent with me making any such admission.



29. There is a further note untimed but dated 14 August between Jarnail Singh and Martin
   Smith. It says, "John Scott will be in conf call> MJS said not appropriate."


30. There are minutes of a meeting on 14 August (POL139725). Notwithstanding the
   above I do in fact appear to have been at this meeting, as were both Martin Smith and
                                          Page 8 of 20

   Jarnail Singh. I have no recollection of the meeting but I do not see any reference in
   the minutes to the issue of keeping and retaining minutes. My assumption is that my
   attendance reflects my email to Susan Crichton of the same date (POL00139690) in
   which I stated:


   "Clearly / will now attend the conference calls as Chair and following on from the
   previous discussions and the steer below, unless otherwise directed, this will become
   a formal meeting with terms of reference, electronic notes, actions and appropriate
   governance within such approach."


31. In the period following 14 August there were various emails agreeing the appropriate
   form in which to capture the information regarding Horizon issues (see POL00139691,
   POL00139692, and POL00139693). I do not recall this but can see that I was in copy
   at some points of this email discussion.



32. There are minutes of meetings on 21 and 28 August (POL00139725 and
   POL00139726) from which it appears I was present. I do not recall these meetings.


33. From POL00139695 and POL00139696 it appears that a "Protocol" was developed in
   October 2013 described as being, "for the conduct of Wednesday morning Telephone
   Conferences held for the purpose of the Identification, Recording and Retention of
   Material which may be subject to Duties of Disclosure." It appears to have been drafted
   by POL's external lawyers. I do not recall this protocol or discussions around it.


34. By 25 September 2013, according to the minutes of these meetings that have been
