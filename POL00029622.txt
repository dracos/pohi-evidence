Subject: RE: Anomaly in 14 Branches - Strictly Private &' Céiitidential - Subject to Privilege - Do Not Forward

Attachments: Draft Letter to J Mistry - 27 06 13 v2RI.doc; Sequence.doc

Please find attached two documents to include in the 3pm update.

Firstly a proposed revision of the 14 branch letter. Edited in terms of Willen PO. Would need values and dates etc
updating for other branches, all of which have different situations of whether loss / gain / net etc.

Secondly a short paper to bring an overview of the 64 branch issue and the 14 branch issue.
Various matters are still out for clarification with colleagues.
Speak shortly

Thanks, Rod

Re the “14 bug”
Please find attached two draft letters to subpostmasters concerning the Horizon anomaly generated in 2010 which
manifested itself in financial years 2011 & 2012. The drafts principally differ depending on whether or not the

subpostmaster is aware of the anomaly (some are, some aren’t).

Can I please have any comments on these asap by midday tomorrow so that they can be sent to the 10 affected
branches tomorrow (10 as we are not writing to the 4 Crowns also affected).

Once we have your comments, Andy Parsons from Bond Dickinson will liaise with Andy Winn to tailor each letter to the
specific circumstances of the individual branch.

Before they are sent, Legal need to do a final cross check of the intended recipients to make sure they are not the
subject of any prosecutions / investigations. Can someone please let me have the list of intended recipients asap.

Kind regards, Rodric
