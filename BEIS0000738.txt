Subject: RE: OC 95

The policy position regarding the £600k was announced by the Minister last year. Last week’s
announcement doesn’t change that policy. You asked yesterday whether you should focus on
maximising payments or maximising settlements yesterday. We were very clear that we would like
you to focus on ensuring that claimants are able to settle their claims as quickly as possible, as
this is what Ministers and other politicians are keen to achieve, we need to ensure that victims can
complete the claims process. The proposal that you have made does not speed up the overall
claims process, and indeed may actually further lengthen it, that is not fair to those who are still
waiting to achieve full and final compensation — many of whom are coming up to their 3°
anniversary of their conviction being overturned this spring.

Kind regards
Beth

lL. re GRO en

So we hold funds back that we could pay to pressurise sorry ‘encourage’ F&F?
No need to respond (but grateful for your two responses!).

Last word — promise — what is the right thing to do?

ve moved on.

Simon,

You asked yesterday whether the aim was to get money as quickly to claimants, or to get F&F
settlements to claimants. Our focus is on achieving the latter. This proposal doesn’t encourage
any pace or movement to full and final settlements does it? Ministers and politicians as shown in
the Select Committee are keen to take steps to encourage victims getting their full and final
settlement as quickly as possible. I don’t believe that this moves the dial on that.

Thanks
Beth

OK — last go I promise!
I do understand the initiative but it is not logical.

We do not have an expiry date on the £600k F&F offer — we await to hear on this. So currently there is no expiry on
this offer.

If a victim decides to push their claim through full evaluation and their offer is less than £600k they will be advised to
take the £600k in F&F. If their offer is above £600k they clearly will settle above £600k.

So whatever happens they get £600k — as per the ‘mass exoneration’ scenario. Nicely aligned.

So what ever happens they get £600k.

So alleviate postmaster stress and media outrage by being proactive and top all 60 up to £600k because they are all
going to get this anyway.

Just say no (again!) and I'll go away!
Regards

Simon

The £600k is a fixed offer sum that Postmasters can choose to take, or they can seek to make a
fully assessed claim. It is not a minimum payment sum, and therefore not suitable for an interim

payment amount. There is a £163k interim payment to relieve any immediate financial pressures
for those making a full claim whilst that claim is developed and considered, additionally, specific
further interim/hardship payments are also considered if requested by a claimant.

Thanks

I know we are going through interesting times but further to previous mails does not the government link below
translate to the current £600k being a minimum payment?

If so we could pay c60 cases up to £600k with immediate effect.
Please advise/confirm.

Gov announcement re overturned convictions:

Once this legislation is passed and convictions have been quashed, individuals will
be entitled to at least £600,000 in compensation to rebuild their lives.

Govt. have always been very clear previously that there is no minimum amount, although in reality the £600k upfront
offer set that floor. If they are saying publicly that individuals are entitled to at least £660k it feels uncomfortable to
me that we cannot make interim payments up to that amount.
