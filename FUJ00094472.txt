25/02 C/fwd. DR continuing to assess the short
term requirements and how best the Test team can
meet these. It was re-iterated that the long term
proposal would be to introduce a new rig to retain
the SV&I functionality...

LF and PS to review and assure any short term
proposals

Note: Migration issues can only be tested on the
LST rig.
04/03 C/fwd. Fujitsu are currently looking at 3
options, the first 2 are tactical:

« Provide a CIT equivalent in BRAO1

¢ Create an SV&l clone in IRE19
The third option is more strategic and involves
providing a new SV&l environment either by
enhancing the SV&I clone created for the tactical
solution of using the Vol rig once it has been
released.

A meeting has been scheduled for 10" March to
discuss, but it is essential to understand the current
issues before a decision can be made. Additionally
an agreement on how future releases will be
implemented is a significant contributing factor to
any decision.

NOTE ; It was confirmed that the HNG SV& rig has
now been handed over to Release 2, leaving only
the LST rig to test defect fixes on HNG.

11/03 C/fwd. This is becoming urgent; POL
and Fujitsu have differing views as to status
of the Als, with POL believing they remain
open and “High”. This may stop progression
through AG4, and therefore stop the move
into full rollout from pilot.

IT will articulate what is needed from POL’s
perspective to reduce the severity or resolve
the Als.

AD will discuss as a matter of urgency with
Dave Cooke as to how this can be
progressed and why the two organisations
have different understandings.

Note that a meeting is arranged with the
respective security teams on 12" March

this was reviewed for
understanding in the meeting.
Fujitsu will provide as much
supporting data/evidence by
11:30 on 12" March to enable a
decision to be made if pilot can
restart, (and if so, when).

It was agreed this data would
not be perfect or complete, but
needs to provide sufficient
relevant information if a re-start
decision can be made.

The evidence should ideally be
in Powerpoint or similar
presentational format

147.03

Gw

Set up a ‘Tech Bridge’ to manage the
latest Live Issue (as at morning of 4"
March). Invitees to include DH, JW ,

GW

Ensure that all necessary parties in
Fujitsu and their counterparts in POL
are aware that there will be an OCP

achieved and the upgrade was
successful

on 24" Feb, with “K” references as
embedded below).

Some of these are covered by the
current activities in gathering MI, but
an assessment of each is required as
we must not ignore previously
identified concerns before we resume
pilot.
