Discovery of loss £52392.33 14Sep 2001 Includes three previous authorised

shortages

During an examination of the file i i ere
wer i of authority to carry shortages in the suspense

“be found within the file. This may have led to the failure to follow y action whic!
“would have prevented such a large Toss fo the business. Indeed had such follow up

action been taken then the loss would have been reduced by the sum of ET8165.10.—

An examination of the Cash accounts for the period Weeks 25 2000/2001 to Week 27
2001/2002 indicate that weekly shortages and overages were simply carried over to
the next accounting week. The Cash Account weeks in which the three large
shortages occurred were examined and compared to other accounting weeks. There
were no apparent reasons for the losses identified.

During the time that the office was being defunded a document was discovered within
the office which is believed to be in Miss Saleem’s handwriting. This document would
appear to be a response to the recovery of the shortages due to the Post Office. In
this document Miss Saleem indicates that the problem would appear to be “gletches in
the system” she indicates that she was told this by the helpdesk. It has not been
possible to identify who, from the helpdesk is giving out this information. It does
however give-concern to Post Office Security that the operators are being advised that
the Horizon system is faulty and produces inaccurate results. This document is being
held by Lothian and Borders Police as a production of evidence.

There have been procedural failures within this incident which have contributed to
loss of Post Office funds. It is recommended that these matters be addressed and that
the individual concerned be notified of the consequence of their actions or inaction’s.
It may be that consideration should be given for these matters to be dealt with under
the Conduct Code.

On at least two occasions Kundan Athwal Retail Network Manager for Raeburn Place

SPSO failed to ensuré that authorised shortages were dealt with within the timescales

allowed within the Losses and Gains Policy which indicates that the Toss should be

held in the Suspense account for a maximum of 8 weeks. The concern for this matter”

is ampiitied knowing that the Subpostmaster had indicated that she wanted to resign
“and that there had been séveral unsatisfactory audit reports.

such matters. Authority for these shortages would have been the responsibility of the
Retail Network Manager Kundan Athwal.

It is also_contrary to the Losses and Gains Policy Section 3.2 to allow several large
“shortages to-be-held in the Suspense Account for an office. Indeed the guidelines
state that all subsequent losses shouid be made good immediately. This policy should
‘have been enforced by the Retail Network Manager Kundan Athwal. A copy of the
relevant sections of the Losses and gains Policy are enclosed at pages to of
this report.

This interim report is submitted in order that the facts be noted and that the above
recommendations are copied to the appropriate manager within the Retail Line.
