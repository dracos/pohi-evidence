See below, and perhaps as a supplementary brief to Duncan. When Mike Young went away AEI was high on his
priority list, with the prospect of significant penalties being levied and having no contract with FJ to meet the required
timescales.

We have achieved the implementation of the data centre network element and are on the road to supporting the
aggressive deployment timescales Post Office are under. We haven't contractually committed FJ, but we are
delivering to these demanding timescales (and I have pulled in every favour from all regions of the company to make
this happen!).

As Marc stated in his e-mail below, he has been "making very positive comments on Fujitsu's response to POL's
Executive Team".

Much still to do but despite the issues in HNGX we are helping POL in getting this monkey off their back.

Alan,

That is excellent news. I know the guys are delivering and putting in the
time to achieve the timeline. I do have a growing concem though

regarding the agreed list of branches for the first tranche of branches for
POL's first milestone dependency with the DVLA. We still appear to have no
PSTN / DSL / Router confirmed date for approx 15 branches in the first
tranch. Appreciate there are replacement branch alternatives, but
unfortunately POL are being micro managed with regard the installation list
that all suppliers are working to. Any help in expediting the outstanding
branches in this first tranche would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure

Julian would concur.

Thanks again Alan, this did not seem possible a month ago and I have been
making very positive comments on Fujitsu's response to POL's Executive
Team. If we can crack the initial tranche of branches, I think we will be

in a very good position.

Regards,

Marc

For visibility of the network implementation progress for the AEI interim
solution, with initial PLP 1 testing complete to prove the availability of
the end to end core network before testing connectivity between branch
router & the router connectivity within the Phoenix Data Centres,

Pre Live Proving phase 1 of the AEI solution has tonight been successfully
completed proving end to end connectivity and management/monitoring traffic
across the network. The updated test plan (v0.3) is attached.

Thank you to those involved and your great efforts to date.

Please see attached the updated version of the AE! Pre Live Proving Test
plan to include Firewall tests and NOC monitoring tests. The testing is
scheduled to start from Wednesday 7th April at 18:00.

All

Following input from the various teams (thank you), please see attached the
draft AEI Test plan to be used as the basis for Pre Live Proving. Timings
are indicative and the Test ID’s against tasks bear no significance other
than reference at the

moment.

We do not yet have the Firewall rulebase and Crossbeam routing elements in
place until the required changes have been implemented based on the latest
version of the LLD (0.D). These changes are key to Pre Live Proving
therefore it will make sense to move Pre Live Proving to Wednesday 7th from
18:00/19:00 and subsequent evenings up to and including 10/04/10.

My thinking is that the Firewall changes need to be implemented under
emergency change control either Tuesday 6th (from 18:00) or Wednesday 7th
(am — 06:00 to 08:00). This will then allow the testing to proceed

including management and monitoring traffic. I am open to suggestions on
this approach.

Also, in the meantime, please provide any feedback on the attached Test
plan or advise on amendments where you see fit.

Regards

Craig

In readiness for AEI Pre Live Proving next week, your input is needed for
the draft Test plan and to attend the first Testing session scheduled for
Tuesday 6th April from 18:00 prior to Model Office testing.

I am aware that work is still in progress to establish routing via the UMI
but we need to move forward on preparing for next week’s testing in the
meantime to route prove the solution. The Testing session will run as a

conference call with all teams onboard using the Test plan as a guide and
under change control, issues to be fixed forward.

From each team, the input I am looking for to draft the Test plan would be:

Step by step tasks/tests to achieve end to end connectivity
The device names involved

Protocols/Ports to be used

Expected outcome of the test

These are rough guidelines but I hope you get the idea. Please call me if
you wish to discuss.

I would be grateful if you could supply this information by COP Friday 2nd
Aprilin order for the Test plan to be ready for the first session on
Tuesday evening.

Regards

Craig
