There are four work streams which fall within the scope of the project:
  • The Mediation Process and Working Group. Including:

           o Administration of the Scheme (maintaining records, issuing letters etc.)
           o Investigation of applications - providing reports to the Working Group (responsibility
               for the resourcing and operation of the team to remain with Angela with
               responsibility for investigations policy moving to Belinda)
           o Determining settlements and mediation arrangements
           o Managing workflows through the mediation scheme
           o Communications, media and stakeholder management
           o Policy issues arising from the Working Group and the Scheme

           o review of old RMG files
           o ongoing disclosure in relation to cases arising under the scheme
  • Development and implementation of intervention/prosecutions policy, including potential
     permanent `complaints handling' arrangements
  • Final report for closure of the Project and the issue to enable return to BAU
  • Targeted business improvement, strictly limited to those parts of the processes which are
     specifically linked to the Scheme (to be defined).

Outside scope
  • The Business Improvement Programme, led by Angela Van Den Bogerd, Business User
     Forum. There should be close links between this Programme and Sparrow, specifically in
     relation to:
            o Suggestions for improvements/themes arising out of Sparrow to be fed into the
                Programme
            o Changes to the interventions/prosecution arrangements
  • Any structural reorganisation issues within Post Office which arise as a consequence of
     recommendations made to the Board relating to Project Sparrow or the Business
     Improvements Programme. Responsibility for this will fall to the appropriate business
     Director.


Success criteria
By end April:
   • The majority of applications wil l be through the scheme
  • Individual outcomes of cases will have remained confidential
  • We will have produced a final report' (whether Post Office/Working Group or combination to
     draw a line under the Scheme)
  •  Second   Sight involvement will have ended with:
        o PO re-established as credible investigators of complaints (endorsed by SS)
        o Political support for completion of SS involvement
        o JFSA neutral position on SS involvement
   • Media/political/stakeholder response to completion of the Scheme will be broadly positive
   • JFSA defining the scheme as successful
   • New investigation/intervention/enforcement/ prosecutions arrangements in place, announced
     (possibly in the final report') and operating fully. Potentially includes:
        o Investigation arrangements

        o Prosecutions policy
                                                                                               POL00030694
                                                                                             POL00030694

Resources required for project Sparrow
Full time
  • Programme Director (Belinda Crowe) includes:
          o WG secretariat
          o Scheme policy
          o Management of project Sparrow (scope as defined above)
   • Project/admin manager (Bel inda to source -- in discussion with Fay)

   • Policy/comms/ stakeholder relations manager (Sophie currently assisting)
  • Executive support —Suzie (already in post and already providing admin support)
  • Scheme operations, providing Post Office investigation of applications (Responsibility will

Additional resources
As well as the management of the project Angela has already scoped out the resources required
for increasing the size of the investigations team to deal with the anticipated number of cases
within the required timescale.
Angela is assessing the number of PO `mediation' resources required and has produced a job
specification. Belinda to pursue with Angela.


Governance
At present, the Steering Group makes strategic decisions and provides challenge for the project
and there are two weekly meetings of the `project team' to go through what needs to be done.
Looking at the emerging scope of the project, we should now clarify and tighten the governance
and accountabil ities based on the scope of the project as we now understand it and the more
detailed project planning underway. This will enable us to move from reactive to proactive.
