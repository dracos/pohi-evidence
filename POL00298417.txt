Sorry —I hit send too early.

I am looking at Susan’s diary for a call on this. How are you at Bond Dickinson placed for a call on Thursday?

All,

I would like the ToR to include that BAQC consider and advise on how we satisfy the prosecutor’s continuing duty of
disclosure when “issues” with Horizon will continually be raised.

Horizon is a big, complex IT system with lots of moving parts. Users constantly raise questions about how to use it
and what it produces. How then do we identify what will be relevant for a prosecution (past or present)? This may be
too specific for the ToR, but things to consider include:

- how far do we need to go to investigate and document user enquiries to determine whether or not it is a
disclosable issue?

- are there any triggers or red flags at which a user enquiry becomes something which requires disclosure?

- is there anything we can do to limit the need to review all past prosecutions each time a disclosale issues
arises?

- what processes could we have in place so that if the adequacy of disclosure is raised, we can demonstrate
that we have acted prudently?

Kind regards, Rodric

1am conscious that we need to have this agreed by the time that Brian Altman gets back from holiday. Can we have a
quick call to finalise our approach?

Subject: Brian Altman QC - terms of Reference [BD-4A.FID20472253]

Dear All

Please find attached two separate terms of reference for Brian Altman QC as amended in response to his observations
document which I also attach for ease of reference.

Please note that POL needs to decide on the issue of whether he is to be asked to report to the Board on the efficacy
or safety of past prosecutions — see footnote 4 on page 3 of Brian's observations.
Simon's and my view is that he shouldn't report on the safety of past convictions for two reasons:

- this is likely to involve a more significant analysis of lots of cases, thereby delaying his report
- and potentially blurs the boundary between BA and CK's respective roles.

The terms of reference need to be finalised in time for Brian's return from holiday.
I am now away on holiday until Tuesday 27 August. Both Simon and Andy will be in during this period.
Kind regards
