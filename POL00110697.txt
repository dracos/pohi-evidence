> Dear All

> Paula has asked me to update you on the following media issue.

>
>We have been contacted today by the Financial Times requesting information and comment on the legal
case being brought against us in relation to long-standing claims around branch losses.

>
> We believe the issue has been highlighted to the paper by the law firm representing those taking
forward the Group Litigation Order.

>

> We have confirmed that we are defending the case and made clear we welcome the opportunity to do so in
the courts. We have highlighted how many people - 500,000 - have used the Horizon system since its
introduction, and the number of transactions it handles. we are not commenting further.

>

> The paper is likely to feature allegations against us and details of the claims. We expect some will be
based on long standing allegations: others may be new to us. We will of course assess the article very
carefully.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you would like more details.
