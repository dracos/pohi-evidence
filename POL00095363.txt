Tina

With regards to your request for background information and an “official* version of events conceming the closure of
Cleaveleys MSPO & the subsequent newspaper article, I have spoken with Andy Wright of Network Transformation
Manchester, who has given me the following details,

The sub postmaster was suspended last November & finally dimissed in January as the article states, but there were issues
other than her refusal to use the Horizon system involved.

{Initially they had hoped to put an interim postmaster into the premises to keep the office open but this created too many
problems in respect of costs. The postmaster & her father own the premises & the rent they required for the post office was
exorbitant . In addition they would only allow access to the premises during post office opening hours . Also the utility bills of
the residential quarters above & the retail unit, could or would not be isolated from the bills of the post office ,so in effect
the interim postmaster would have had to meet the whole cost of utilities for the premises.

Because of these problems it was decided to find an altemative site for the post office which has now been found in Victoria
Road West the main shopping area in the town. The unit has yet to be filled with the necessary equipment but it is hoped it

will be ready to open in May to early June,(Date being aimed for is 17/05/01 ,but there may be some slippage). They have an
applicant for the position of postmaster , which is being processed ,but is not complete at this stage. -
