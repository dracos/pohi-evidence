1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding management of the
live environment and the effects of Horizon on individual business units. The report
aims to provide comprehensive and detailed statistics of issues affecting the live
environment. This report is not targeted at any one particular audience but rather it
is intended as a reference guide for people who work within the Live Environment.

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT - Business Service Management

Problem Management enables us to keep up to date with any problems or concerns
regarding the Horizon System. A problem is formed by a regular occurrence of a
similar incident which is then transferred to Problem Management from the Incident
Management team. Not all problems are included in this summary however details
are available on request.

Whilst these graphs show a far higher incidence of non-polling on Monday , it is pleasing to
note that the number of non-polled outlets has not grown in relation to rollout

NB. The 24" July shows a high level of non polled offices. This was solely due to a problem
with the Pathway Correspondence server within that week. A report on this problem was
issued by Deidre Coniss (ICLP). It covers the July incident but not the August one shown
above. (ICLP have confirmed that a separate report will cover this). Root cause of the
problem is still under investigation by ICLP.

Non Polled Offices (Problem No. 10000073)

ICL Pathway are working on draft CCN’s around the following issues :

1. Harvesting marooned transactions from non-polling offices : target for CCN
15/09/00

2. Alerting offices when one or more counters are not logged on : target for CCN
22/09/00

These changes if agreed would be unlikely to be implemented before January 2001. This being
the case , BSM are looking at some form of manual intervention which could be implemented
in the meantime.

Additionally, ICL Pathway are working on a process to indicate when an outlet’s
communication links have failed without reliance on the non-polled office report. Scripts have
been agreed with ICL Pathway to allow them to contact an office when remote health checks
still indicate a non-polling problem after two days. Outlets will be asked to be asked to
perform certain actions which will enable Pathway to identify the cause of the problem more
accurately. The inconvenience caused by asking an office to reboot to solve an ISDN link
problem has been recognised and action is in progress to identify a method of only rebooting,
the ISDN card and thus making the process quicker.

ICL Pathway are still investigating the impact of continued polling failures on the ability of
outlets to take the Siemens SPM card.

Non conformance Issues
1. Girobank Postmaster’s Daily Record ( PDRs )

ISSUE: Girobank have agreed to accept printed versions of the daily report forms for Deposits
(G4631 ) and Withdrawals ( G4632 ) from all Horizon offices. However, the continued
acceptance of these forms is dependent on the level of errors received at Girobank being
reduced. The errors largely relate to factors that prevent the forms being read by Optical
Character Recognition equipment.

The latest data received from Girobank shows a significant deterioration. This is due to a
combination of more offices presenting PDRs which fail and an increase in the number of
forms rejected from these offices. Unfortunately, the data is now being provided monthly,
without a weekly breakdown, so it is not possible to ascertain if there was a general
deterioration or a weekly blip. Girobank have not been able to provide any more information.
They will be concentrating on monitoring the effect that the introduction of the new forms
(linked to the roll out of CSR+) has on the failure rate.

The table below shows performance to date recalculated to a four week format.

2. Passwords

ISSUE: Monitoring of requests for One Shot Passwords ( OSP ) identified a significant level
of non conformance which if maintained will impact on resources in both POCL and ICLP.

The fall from June to July in the extrapolated full network rate of requests for OSPs was

maintained in August. There was also a fall in the percentage of these calls attributable to
non conformance.

1, First tranche of staff up to May 2000 appointed from an internal panel. These staff were allocated to individual
teams for clearing the increased number of errors from Horizon offices. Additional staff being picked in June 2000
onwards from the external recruitment exercise.

2. Although the length of the learning curve used has increased to week 30 after conversion, the latest forecast of
extra staff required this year are stil in line with the original forecast. This is due to applying the improved average
error clearance rates achieved in TP.

3, The latest forecast is based on the error rate for Horizon offices returning to the manual baseline by 30 weeks after

conversion. 2nd forecasts for extra staff required if learning curve extended to 40 weeks before returning to the
baseline removed.

Comments

= This is a revised learning curve based on errors produced in the last 15 weeks at Horizon offices. The height of this curve is not as severe during the early stages
after conversion as that originally used in Janary 2000. Errors produced per office in the 1st weeks after conversion, based on the last offices to go live, are shown in
the table below.

- The length of the current learning curve is 20 to 30 weeks. The mid period figures for weeks 7 to 15 remain well above the baseline. Figures for weeks 15 to 30 at
the tail of the learning curve, now increasingly based on the results of offices rolled out since Xmas, show an improvement on earlier offices.

- From the latest information available for converted offices, the learning curve is assumed to return to the manual baseline after 30 weeks.

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are realising

this once the account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

m Extra resource needed to input data into the system.
™ Client Information distorted if not completed.
 Postmasters pay impacted - knock on effect could be more challenges on remuneration to TP

The sample size for time to prepare a cash account is too low for NRO2 and so
this has not been included.

The outlet coping, curves show that offices are now ‘coping’ at a similar level
to NRO and NRO1, and better than the live trial offices.

The charts overleaf show the individual attributes which make up the outlet

Mystery Shopper - Horizon Learning Curve - July 2000
Kjetil Fuglesta : Post Office Consulting

In order to ensure that the effect of Horizon is more fully understood, leaning curve analysis has been
carried out including all NRO offices by contract type. This analysis was based on Mystery Shopper
data for the last 12 months up to and including July, but excluding November and December.

QofS learning for BOs

“Time since gove

ofS learning curve for SPSOs

QofS learning curve for MSPO / FPO

It can be seen from the diagrams that performance in all offices types is adversely affected in the first 2-
3 months after going live with Horizon. There is some evidence to suggest that the long term impact on

Qof S may be positive in BOs, MSPOs and FPOs. However, it should be pointed out that sample sizes
are small so the extent of this effect remains uncertain,

Please note : The results quoted in this report for SPSOs are not directly comparable to those
in the official Mystery Shopper reports, due to the complex weightings that are applied in the
official results.

either consult the documentation first or call the HSH , showing most people
know the correct helpline to call with system failures. The figures regarding,
help on post office business however show that 28.6% of people either consult

:

The graph above shows that the level of Sub Postmaster resignations has
remained relatively stable despite the continuing rollout of Horizon. At the
beginning of September 1999 there were only 323 offices on Horizon by
August 1999 this figure had risen to 11,000 offices yet there does not appear to
be any sharp increases in the levels of Sub Postmaster resignations, While
some Sub Postmasters have stated the introduction of Horizon as reason for
their resignation ; it appears that overall levels of resignations are not out of
the ordinary.

Summary

Five out of the six main SLA’s were achieved and this is a marked
improvement from previous months (the only exception being the 95% for
calls answered in less than 60 seconds and this only missed by 0.2%). Work
continues with progressing the issue of quality measures and the first
quarterly customer satisfaction report for May to July is due in Mid

Average calls now seem to be levelling off around 1.5 calls per office per week. (The troughs in the graph 17-23
April & 29 May - 4 June are caused by Bank Holidays when a lower number of calls were received).

The level of calls to Regional helplines has continued to fall as offices become automated and therefore phone the
NBSC instead of their regional helplines. The average level of calls to the Regional Helpdesk is around 1.5 calls per

office per week. This is comparable to the average calls to the NBSC. (shown on the previous page).

Asa result improvement opportunities including the introduction of Interactive Voice
Response system at HSH have been identified and implemented and have resulted in a
general steadying off of complaints.

The number of complaints being investigated by the NBSC Customer Relations Team has
increased, ensuring, outlets receive a timely and efficient response. A series of articles
highlighting the NBSC Customer Relations team is planned to allow outlets to have a
channel to forward complaints to for investigation and resolution.

The graph shows that the main area for concern is the rising number of people who had
increasing difficulty during April and May. The reason for the increase in people failing to
get through to HSH was due to the surge in calls at the end of April and beginning of May
regarding revaluation. This issue had been resolved by June hence the fall in complaints in
this category. The introduction of IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) by HSH at the
beginning of June may also have helped to reduce complaints in this category.

during June should help to combat this problem.

Business Impact
Sue Siowart and Adele Kileoyne: Business Service Management

The business impact model is a tool which will enable the ICL Pathway Service
Level Agreements (SLA’s) to be assessed from a business wide perspective by
PON. The business impact scores will show how any SLA failures are affecting
the Network and where the most pain is felt.

The model is derived from matrices which contain scores based on the
percentage failure of the SLA against the number of offices affected. The model
will allow comparison between the SLA results on an even scale rather than
identifying which SLA’s have failed by the biggest margin.

The matrices are divided into four key areas of the business which are impacted
by ICL Pathway’s performance (customer, support, client and outlet) and from
these an overall score is produced for each SLA.

The scores are as follows:

* 100% shows that the SLA was achieved to the agreed minimum acceptance
threshold.

* Scores above 100% shows that the SLA target has been exceeded by ICL
Pathway therefore having, a positive impact on the business

* Scores below 100% show the extent to which the SLA has failed based on the

impact on the business. The historical data will enable decisions to be taken

based on sustained failure rather than reacting to ‘blips’

A score of 0% show that the failure of the SLA is totally unacceptable to PON

and should be the focus for immediate action to improve the SLA results.

© N/A means that ICL Pathway are not currently reporting on these SLA’s.

Although the matrices scores have been agreed across the business it should be
noted that this is currently a learning model. As such the scores may be subject
to change if the impact is considered to have a greater or lesser impact than the
results suggest.

The table below shows the business impact for the past 6 months. The key
impacts on the business are the Service Level Agreement failures for file and
data deliveries by Day D and Business Incidents

Traffic Light System

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in
blocks and each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are
equally important in the block the 100% is divided across the block of
measures. This system works well in areas like OSG where there are
distinct differences in the importance of each measure. The traffic lights
are then used to show the total of the weighting. For example if a CSF
has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones are all
on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF
and therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green.
However in Transaction Processing all the CSF’s are equally important
which means that if any of the measures are adversely affected the
impact is high on TP.
