Royal Mail Group Policy Royal Mail Group

Crime and Investigation (S2) @ Bl

1. Purpose

1.1. Royal Mail Group handles millions of items of mail entrusted to us by our customers every day. We
handle large volumes of cash and valuable items. We conduct huge numbers of financial transactions
and we gain and maintain information in the course of our business that is personal and confidential. It
follows that we must deserve and maintain the absolute trust of our customers, staff, suppliers and
others with whom we come in contact.

1.2. Royal Mail Group requires all of its employees to act honestly and with integrity at all times, and to
safeguard the mail and business and customer assets for which they are responsible.

1.3. The risk of crime against Royal Mail Group and its businesses is managed through a range of policy
and procedure-based controls, designed to prevent, deter or disrupt potential targeted or opportunistic
criminal activity. These controls are embedded at appropriate levels and are defined to optimise the
level of risk Royal Mail Group faces. However, these controls cannot and are not designed to be
absolute and Royal Mail Group will always expect a level of crime actually to occur.

1.4. This Crime and Investigation policy has been developed to detail the principal criminal risks to Royal
Mail Group and to define the response that Royal Mail Group commits to taking in the event of
suspected or detected crime. It will also support and promote our code of business standards and
facilitate the effective design and review of mail integrity controls, business systems and internal
financial controls that prevent, deter, identify and minimise or eradicate crime

investigation teams, staffed by personnel trained to conduct investigations in accordance with the
different judicial systems and legislative requirements of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern

compliance with Royal Mail Group's additional rules for the management of criminal investigations and
to strict standards of evidential admissibility.

4.5. Where the level or volume of crime affecting a business unit exceeds its capacity to investigate, the

investigations. These principles will ensure that the investigation of individual offences or series of

through Royal Mail Group, upon society generally. The principles must be applied consistently and
without any influence from personal or commercial interests, within or external to Royal Mail Group.

Where the level or volume of crime affecting one Royal Mail Group business unit exceeds its capacity
effectively to investigate, the Group Security Director may assess and prioritise the allocation of
resource across the business units.

Where an investigation in England and Wales led by Royal Mail Security investigators is judged by the
relevant casework management function to have gathered sufficient evidence to warrant obtaining legal
advice, the case will be submitted to the Royal Mail Legal Services Criminal Law Team where it will be
assessed in accordance with the Royal Mail Group Prosecution Policy and a decision made on whether
to prosecute

For investigations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and those led by other agencies prosecution
decisions will be made as detailed in the Royal Mail Group Prosecution Policy.

7. Consequences (Penalties)

7.1. Where a business leader, manager or employee is the subject of a criminal investigation and grounds

version):

POL00030786

Royal Mail Group Policy Royal Mail Group

Crime and Investigation (S2) @ el

As a result of a recent matter within Royal Mail Group Limited, it is considered necessary to
reinforce the message that theft and all other acts of dishonesty are viewed by the business as acts
of gross misconduct (as clearly set out in both the Conduct Code and the Making Things Clear
booklet) and if proved, are likely to result in dismissal without notice (summary dismissal). Where
there is an allegation of theft against an employee, it is often the case that the criminal
investigation/criminal prosecution team within the business are also progressing an investigation
into the matter. In those circumstances the manager handling the Conduct Code investigation must
liaise with those handling any criminal investigation/prosecution before making a decision on the
conduct code case.
