ETHICAL CULTURE ASSESSMENT

Preamble

* Fujitsu (“the organization” or “the Company”) retained Ethisphere, LLC (“Ethisphere”) to evaluate
and report on employees’ perceptions of ethical culture inside the organization. Ethisphere
conducted this evaluation using its proprietary Ethical Culture Assessment (“survey’”,
“assessment”, or “Ethical Culture Assessment”) and associated methodology.

* Ethisphere’s findings set forth in this report (“Report”) are owned by Fujitsu except that Ethisphere
retains exclusive proprietary ownership rights to the Ethical Culture and Perceptions Assessment
and related methodologies (“Proprietary Rights”). By using this Report, Fujitsu agrees not to take
action to interfere with such Proprietary Rights.

* In addition, Ethisphere retains the right to use the numerical information and supporting data from
which the Report was derived for future benchmarking and other analyses done for other
Ethisphere clients. Ethisphere will ONLY use this supporting data in an aggregated and
anonymized format with information from other Ethisphere clients such that the information cannot
be identified as Fujitsu information.

ETHICAL CULTURE ASSESSMENT

Top Recommendations & Resources

Provide resources to
facilitate manager
discussions.

MANAGERS

MATTER
Only 18.9% of managers are having discussions about
E&C topics/issues at least monthly. This is 14.8%
below benchmark. 43.3% of managers are have
discussions Occasionally (once per quarter, on
average). This also lags benchmark by 2.6%.
There is a strong correlation between frequency of ETHICS TOOLKIT
manager discussions on E&C topics and the overall
favorability in other topic areas (Knowledge of the
Code and Policies, Speak Up, non-retaliation,
pressure, organizational justice, and perceptions of
leadership).

FOR MANAGERS

ETHISPHERE

ETHICAL CULTURE ASSESSMENT

Top Recommendations & Resources

Layer survey results with
other inputs to determine
effectiveness of
communications.

Among respondents, only 73.3% agreed they know
where to find the Code of Conduct. This was 20.4%
below benchmark. Fujitsu lagged benchmark across
Pillar 1: Awareness of Program & Resources and Pillar
2: Perception of the Function.

Consider incorporating engagement or click metrics
surrounding key E&C communications to determine if
employees are reading and engaging with them. Also
look into training completion data.

ETHICAL CULTURE ASSESSMENT

Top Recommendations & Resources

Educate employees on
the full spectrum of
available disciplinary
actions and reporting

Fujitsu lagged benchmark most significantly in Pillar 5:
Organizational Justice. 50.6% of respondents believe
disciplinary actions are taken when misconduct occurs,
28.3% below benchmark. Additionally, only 52.4% of
respondents believe disciplinary action is the same for
every employee, 25.8% below benchmark.
Respondents showed a general distrust in the reporting

and investigations process. 39.3% of respondents
reported misconduct they observed siting “Fear of
retaliation’ and “I did not believe that corrective action

would be taken” as the most common reasons for not
reporting.

How to Interpret the Scores

Defining the

SELES. a proportion of positive or favorable
responses to all responses collected for a given
question. Favorable responses vary but are generally
“agree” and “strongly agree.”

A higher score always represents more favorable
perceptions

How Pillar Scores Are Calculated

The Pillar scores are a weighted average of the
questions scores within a Pillar.

Questions are given a lower weight if skip logic is used.

This prevents a low response question from having an
oversized impact on the score.

BUSINESS ETHICS

Benchmark

BSQKERSirks are an average of the selected companies’
favorability scores for a question. Similarly, Benchmark
Pillar scores represent an average of other companies’
Pillar scores, and the Overall Survey Benchmark score
represents the average score of all other companies’
Overall Survey scores.

Ethisphere uses only those questions selected by the
organization for use in this survey when calculating
Benchmark question, Pillar, and Overall Survey scores.
