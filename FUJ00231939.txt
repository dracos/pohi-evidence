Subject: Draft CP for ARQ RWP from POL

Attachment: HNG-X CP RI Change to Security Quotas inc ARQs.rtf

Donna, Penny,

I have had another look at your draft CP and in an effort to move this forward, have made some amendments
(indicated by red font in the attached).

There is also one discrepancy in the charges — see yellow highlight — which we will need to discuss.

Can you review and advise regarding the proposed changes and can we discuss the charging aspects next week — at
which point we will need to get Marc involved for the contractual aspects.

regards
