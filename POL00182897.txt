Subject: Horizon Investigation - MPs case review - notes from Friday's phone meeting
Attachment: MP Cases CD 1 23rd October 2012.xIsx
All

Please find attached my notes/actions from Friday’s phone conference.

Notes
1. It was noted that lan/Ron may need to cull cases if they don’t have enough information for an investigation.
We agreed not to define the process for this or how we would manage the MPs if this situation arose as it is
still hypothetical. We would review next meeting once the content of the CD had been reviewed by Ron/lan.

Actions

1. Simon to send out the spread sheet of cases and status of documentation for each case (attached)

2. Ronan to draft a holding message for circulation to be used if we received any inquiries

3. Hugh /Rodric to complete the rewording of the “immunity agreement”, ideally by Wednesday, and send out
to this group for review

4. Alwen to call Kay Linnell and 1. Confirm that we will pay for her fees (up to £5K), 2. Confirm our approval of
the reworded immunity agreement 3. Seek to agree a submission deadline to enable the investigation to
understand the scope so it can at some point come to a conclusion

5. Alwen to talk to Janet to provide and general update and see if JA is agreeable to a submission deadline.

6. Ronan / Alana to draft wording for subspace or appropriate communications channel to inform sub-

postmasters of the immunity agreement. Note: a meeting has been scheduled for 7 November to review the
wording.

Regards, Simon
