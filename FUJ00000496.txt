A new paragraph 3.6 shall be added to Schedule G1 to the Codified Agreement as follows:

Data Errors

Subject to sub paragraph 3.6.3 below, if the Contractor discovers any error occurring in
transaction records or cash account stream records other than the errors described in sub
paragraph 3.6.1.2 below ("Data Errors") prior to the relevant record being transmitted by the
Contractor to POCL over the TIP Interface, the Contractor shall not transmit the relevant
record but shall retain it and promptly issue to POCL a manual error report complying with

sub-paragraph 3.6.2 below (a "Manual Error Report").

The following errors shall not be Data Errors:-

3.6.1.2.1 errors which are caused by invalid data input by Users in Outlets and are not

detected by the process introduced by the Accounting Integrity Control Release;

3.6.1.2.2 errors caused by Reference Data (correctly applied by Pathway) which preclude
transactions from being correctly taken into account in the subsequent cash

account;

3.6.1.2.3 Cash accounts which are incomplete by reason of erroneous Reference Data
provided by POCL.

Each Manual Error Report shall include a full specification of the relevant record following
correction of the Data Error (the "Repaired Data"), in a format suitable for POCL to key into

a POCL Data input facility.

Electronic Submission of Repaired Data

3.6.3

Ifin any cash account week the number of Data Errors exceeds 50 the provisions of
paragraph 3.6.1.1 above shall not apply in respect of Data Errors occurring in that cash
account week (except to the extent that Manual Error Reports shall already have been
submitted to POCL). In that event the Contractor shall, unless otherwise agreed by POCL:
a) withhold the relevant record;

b) correct the relevant Data Error; and

c) submit the relevant record containing the Repaired Data for electronic transmission over

the Data Interface.

3.6.4 Where a Data Error shall not have been discovered prior to transmission of the relevant
transaction record but is subsequently discovered by the application of a weekly checking
process (such Data Error being hereafter referred to as a "Weekly Data Error") the provision
of paragraph 3.6.3 above shall not apply to such Weekly Data Error. Instead such Weekly
Data Error shall (subject to paragraph 3.6.6 below) be dealt with by the issue of a Manual
Error Report as specified in paragraph 3.6.1.1 above notwithstanding that the total number

of Data Errors in the relevant week may have exceeded 50.

3.6.5 If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds twenty in any week the Contractor shall, in
consultation with POCL, review the process introduced by the Accounting Integrity Control
Release with a view to enhancing such process in order to detect the relevant Data Errors
prior to transmission of the relevant data and to identify and correct root causes of such Data

Errors.

3.6.6 If the number of Weekly Data Errors exceeds fifty in any week POCL shall be entitled to
require the Repaired Data relating to such Weekly Data Errors to be dealt with in accordance

with sub paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 3.6.3 and not paragraph 3.6.4.

3.6.7 The Contractor undertakes that it will apply on a daily basis those checks required by the TIP
Control CCD to be so carried out and that all Data Errors discovered thereby will then be
dealt with in accordance with sub-paragraph 3.6.1.1. or 3.6.3 as appropriate.

3.6.8 The Contractor undertakes that the delay between the occurrence of a Data Error (or in the
case of a Weekly Data Error, its detection) and the notification of the Repaired Data to POCL
(either by manual error report or electronically pursuant to paragraph 3.6.3 above) shall not

exceed five working days.

3.6.9 Where the Contractor is required to make an assumption in order to correct a Data Error
and/or present Repaired Data, the Contractor shall make such assumption and promptly
inform POCL of the assumption made.

3.6.10 The Contractor shall pay to POCL 30 days afier the end of each month a sum to compensate
POCL for its costs in dealing with Manual Error Reports equal to £150 per Data Error
discovered after transmission of the relevant data and £100 per other Data Error occurring in

the cash account weeks ending during that month.

Other Discrepancies

3.6.11 The Contractor shall, following discovery of any discrepancy of the nature described in

paragraph 3.6.1.2.2 or 3.6.1.2.3 above, promptly issue a report to POCL containing a brief

description of the discrepancy and shall co-operate with POCL to investigate and resolve

such discrepancy.

This CCN 562 also modifies Acceptance Resolution Plan 376 (Reference CR/ACD/376
Version 0.9 Dated 23rd September 1999): paragraph 5.3.3 thereof shall be amended as
appropriate to be consistent with the provision of Clause 1 of this CCN 562 to the intent that
the procedures and obligations set out in Clause 1 of this CCN 562 shall take precedence

over, and replace, the procedures and obligations set out in numbered paragraphs I to 5
