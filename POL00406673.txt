Peter,

I've sought to check — and it doesn’t look as though Mr Ward's case is currently in the grouping of cases that Mr
Arbuthnot has and which would form the basis for reviews.

Therefore, can I suggest that the response to Priti Patel MP explains that the appropriate process with respect to Mr
Wards request that his case be lodged with the review processes- is for Priti Patel to contact James Arbuthnot MP

explaining that this is a case that he may wish to consider be included within the review process that he has
established.

On your more general query about the current number / names of cases that are potentially going into that review
process — please can I ask if we can provide that information next Monday 13 August. Simon Baker who holds the
relevant information is on leave at present — and there is a risk of misinterpretation if I seek to give you the information
now based on my looking at his paers. However — Mr Ward's name is not on any of the spreadsheets — so we can be
confident that his case is not yet within the process — hence the line back to Priti Patel MP above.

Hope this helps

Thanks

Mike

Martin/Mike

Grateful for advice on whether Mr Ward's case is one that has been proposed for Second
Sight assessment and if not advice on whether cases should be channelled through James
Arbuthnot in the first instance or whether MPs can submit cases direct to POL. Also helpful
to know whether we are talking in terms of ‘around 10 cases being examined by Second
Sight in the first instance or whether we are talking about a sample range of cases proposed
by MPs being examined? Reply due 8 August.

Regards
Mike
