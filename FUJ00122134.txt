Neneh / Penny,

I've added in some comments.

Not really sure how to progress this any further. I suggest we wait until we have a case that actually requires
analysis of Network Banking etc and worry about it then rather than trying to put together something generic
now.

Hi, Gareth,

As per our discussion.

PSA copy of our current WS. Penny Thomas has marked up some areas that need attention for us to
be able to provide further WS to the PO. It has only come to our notice that quite a few things have
changed eg OBCS, TMS since June 05 and we would like the WS to reflect these.

Please could you look at this when you've got some time and let me know when it's convenient for
you to discuss.

Kind regards,

Neneh,

I've updated the Witness Statement as discussed.

I'm left some of the Networking bit highlighted in Blue, since I can’t say that I know it is true
(but it probably is). It may be OK just to delete that bit. What is left in that section may be
sufficient (I guess it depends upon what the issue is!) I've removed the blue highlighting from
the rest of the document.

I've used “Revisions” so that you can see what I've changed. I've highlighted the Date etc in
yellow to remind us to update it for the final version.

Happy to discuss further.

Regards

Gareth

You asked for my comments on this witness statement — here they are. Anything
highlighted means:-

have read this, but { have no firsthand or background knowledgd
I have made some comment in the text

Also, OBCS is now dead and network banking has taken its place. I believe that any
witness statement relating to data since network banking started to replace OBCS (date
unknown) should have.a narrative explaining that process. Any statement relating to data
after OBCS ceased (I believe end May 05) should not contain OBCS statements.

Network Banking was introduced on 1* April 2003. From that point onward, DWP went
through an exercise of moving Benefits Claimants to receiving money directly into a Bank
Account. Post Office then supported Cash Withdrawal from certain Bank Accounts
(through Network Banking). This process took about 2 years and eventually the OBCS
application stopped being used operationally in May / June 2005 and the desktop buttons
that allowed staff access to it were removed. The underlying databases are being
removed in January 2006.

Continuation of statement of Penelope Anne Thomas.

since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
obtain information regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.
B

Horizon’s documented processes relate to each Post Office outlet. They state that at each
Post Office, there are counter positions which each have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all transactions input by the
counter clerk working at that counter position. Each clerk logs on to the system by using their
own unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash and
stock level information are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged on,
any transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the computer and
are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.

c

[The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input intd
[t_Tt enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Post
Office Limited e.g. National Savings Bank, Girobank, Driving Vehicle Licence Agency and thd

Pepartment of Working Pensions (DWP). The Horizon system also enables the clerk td
produce a woetbe periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the othed
fransactions performed in that accounting period] (Balancing is now done monthly rather than
weekly as a result of changes introduced by Impact for S80._ The change over varied from
branch to branch but was between September and November 2005.)

Where local reports are required these are accessed from an icon on the desktop menu. thd

[user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised td

Hatabase and is printed out on the tally roll printer. The system also allows for information to bd

Continuation of statement of Penelope Anne Thomas

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :_I can’t really comment on any of this.

1. Extractions can only be made through the AWs, which exist at Fujitsu Services, Forest Road,
Feltham, Middlesex, Fujitsu Services, Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire
Fujitsu Services Data Centres. These are all subject to rigorous physical security controlg

ropriate to that location] Specifically, the Feltham and Bracknell AWs — where most

extractions take place — are located in a secure room subject to proximity pass access within

a secured Fujitsu Services site. I who has access to the AWs at the datacentres?

Checks whether they have been used? Also, I assume the FELO1 room will soon close!

2. Eegical_access to the AW and its functionality is managed in aceordance with the Fujitsd
Bervices, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of [SQ 17799] This includes

dedicated Logins, password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT security features.

3. All extraction’s are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record Queries
(ARQ's), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can be scrutinised
on the AW.

4. Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.

5. Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The details
are checked and the printed request filed.

6. The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.

My immediate concerns are that I am not convinced that the statement is factually correct. I know about the
demise of OBCS, but I dont know when it was rolled out to the estate, did it happen overnight or was there are
phasing out period? I don't understand how network banking works (I did look at the procedures you
suggested but I was unable to put the picture together) let alone provide the narrative. Is this something you
could help us with?

Someone mentioned to me that reporting to the accounts department was no longer happening as we state -
do you know if this is the case?

If you could highlight anything in the statement which is not factually correct you would be doing us a great
service.

Kind regards and many thanks
Penny

Neneh,

I've updated the Witness Statement as discussed.

I'm left some of the Networking bit highlighted in Blue, since I can't say that I know it is true (but it probably
is). It may be OK just to delete that bit. What is.left in that section may be sufficient (I guess it depends upon
what the issue is!) I’ve removed the blue highlighting from the rest of the document.

I've used “Revisions” so that you can see what I've changed. I've highlighted the Date etc in yellow to remind
us to update it for the final version.

Happy to discuss further.

a computer terminal, a visual display unit and a keyboard and printer. This

individual system records all transactions input by the counter clerk working

at that counter position. Each clerk logs on to the system by using their
own unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the
associated cash and stock level information are recorded by the computer
system in a stock unit. Once logged on, any transactions performed by the
clerk must be recorded and entered on the computer and are accounted for

within the user's allocated stock unit.

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series
of counter applications: the Order Book Control Service (OBCS)is-was one
of these applications and it ascertaineds the validity of DWP order books
before payment is-was made. The counter desktop service and the office *
platform service on which it ¢uas-ran provides various common functions for
transaction recording and settlement as well as user access control and

session management.

Note that the Order Book Control Service was withdrawn from Live use in
June 2005.

Information from counter transactions is-was written into a local database
and then replicated automatically to databases on all other counters within
a Post Office outlet. The information is-was then forwarded over Internet
Services Digital Network (ISDN) (or other communication service) to

databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu

Services data centres. This is-was undertaken by a messaging transport

system within the Transaction Management Service (TMS). Various
systems then transfered information to Central Servers that controled the
flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet
transactions are-were normally sent at least daily via the system. Details
relating to the outlet's stock holding and cash account are—were_ sent
weekly. Details are-were then forwarded daily via a file transfer service to

the Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield and also, where

appropriate, to other Post Office Clients. In this respect DWPis-was a Post
Office Client.

The Order Book Control System (OBCS) software, linked to the Horizon
system was developed in conjunction with the DWP. OBCS provideds
details of DWP order books on the national stop payment list, and,
enableds data regarding the movement of order books, and, encashments
to be captured on their behalf. Each Horizon terminal at a Post Office
counter hads access to the national stop list through OBCS, when a
barcoded DWP order book is-was scanned at the Post Office counter, or
the order book details are-were manually keyed into Horizon at the Post
Office counter. Each night, the national stop payment list is-was updated
from information supplied electronically from the DWP computer centre.

National stop payment list data is-was held centrally within the Horizon

system, and is—was available to all Post Offices. However, certain

information from the national stop payment list is-was also downloaded to I
individual Post Offices for faster access; this download process is called
polling. The polling of individual Post Offices also involveds receiving I
details of order book movements and encashments at Post Offices,

centrally within Horizon, for onward transmission to the DWP.

All OBCS transactions are—were normally initiated by scanning in the
barcode from the Order Book. Each Order Book is-was associated with a
National Insurance Number (NINO) which identifies the person to whom the
Order Book hads been (or is-was about to be) issued. The Horizon Central
database maintaineds a list of every Post Office outlet at which that NINO
hads been used by the OBCS application. This information is-was also
held in the local outlet database. All information received from DWP
associated with withdrawn or stopped Order Books is-was passed to all
branches at which the associated NINO hasd-been used (if any). If an
OBCS transaction is-was carried out in an outlet and the NINO associated
with the Order Book is-was not found in the local database, an enquiry is
was _ made to the Central database as to the state of all Order Books
associated with the NINO. That outlet is-was then registered as being
associated with that NINO for all future Order Book control information.

Thus over a period of time a number of branches becaeme associated with

each NINO. If the NINO is-was not found in the local system the enquiry for

OBCS information associated with that NINO is-was carried out in real time.
Such an enquiry wit-would only happen once for any NINO in a given

outlet. All other OBCS transactions are-were batch.

Post Office outlets are identified by Post Office Ltd with a FAD Code.
These identifiers are passed from Post Office Ltd to Horizon when a Branch
is first Opened (or migrated to Horizon in many cases). When a Branch is
first opened (or migrated to Horizon), Post Office defines the number of
Counter Positions required (including any Back Office positions). These
are then allocated Counter positions from 1 (which is the gateway counter
used to communicate to the Data Centre) up to the number of counters.
The Counter position is fixed and is associated with a Physical terminal

when it is installed in an outlet.

Post Office branches are mainly connected to the BT public wide area
network using either the Analog Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) or Internet
Services Digital Network (ISDN) technologies. In addition there aret4Za
number of branches connected to the Hughes satellite dish network using
Virtual Satellite (VSAT) technology. The ADSL, ISDN and VSAT traffic is
then transported across the Energis network-which-is-sharedumith-their

associated with that day’s trading. The Horizon Central systems will only
process data from Post Office outlets for which an End of Day record has
been successfully replicated to the datacentre. Missing End of Day records

can occur for one of two reasons:

1/ The End of Day record was not produced in the outlet — usually due to
the gateway being unable to communicate with one of the other counters —
for example it has failed or been switched off.

2/ The end of Day record has not been successfully replicated from the
Post Office outlet to the datacentre — usually due to a communications

problem.

End of Day Records will eventually be generated and communicated to the
I datacentre when the initial problems are resolved and the transactions
associated with these “late End of Day” records will be communicated to
other systems when they are available. In such cases the data transmitted
to clients (such as DWP) will be more than 24 hours old. Such transactions

will have the original timestamps from when they took place.

Apologies I seem to have missed you from this one, please note for your awareness of my views on the way ahead
with prosecution support / ARQ's / witness statements etc.

It is basically in response to Neneh's email to you re her comment to "cover for your absences and nothing more." and
in view of this comment I may need to fine tune the role however (see below) although I will add I do not envisage
anything major here or contentious arising from this, as we must cater for all eventuallities.

I note your concerns and agree we do need to review our liabilities particularly regarding submission of these
statements, but as per the Org Chart which Bill Mitchell produced to all some months ago, most roles are geared to
overlap to Cater for leave and sickness and any increased workload.

However in both yours & Penny's areas (which are of particular importance) I do envisage some job sharing as the . -
workload dictates, it is only prudent to be multitasking in areas of such importance and visability to the customer and
obviously this will be made easier once we are all based at Bracknell.

Hope this is helpful and beneficial but happy to discuss.

! have made some comment in the text

Also, OBCS is now dead and network banking has taken its place. I believe that any
witness statement relating to data since network banking started to replace OBCS (date
unknown) should have a narrative explaining that process. Any statement relating to
data after OBCS ceased (I believe end May 05) should not contain OBCS statements.

You asked for my comments on this witness statement — here they are. Anything
highlighted means:-

I have read this, but I have no firsthant ckground knowledge

I have made some comment in the text

Also, OBCS is now dead and network banking has taken its place. I believe that any
witness statement relating to data since network banking started to replace OBCS (date
unknown) should have a narrative explaining that process. Any statement relating to
data after OBCS ceased (I believe end May 05) should not contain OBCS statements.
