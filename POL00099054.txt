Mark is going to draft this into a statement to share with AB as clearly it needs to be closely aligned with
(if not the same as) our core media statement.

I'll defer to Susan's views, but my instinct would be to keep the review by external lawyers as a parallel
workstream which we don't refer to in proactive written statements, and which doesn't report to the
working party. Otherwise we risk raising expectations and also making this the media story tomorrow.

Hi, thank you for the inputs today. Susan I need your thoughts on the note below
especially 1) and 2) please and the questions at the end of the mail.

I think we have the following which is a variant:

1) a working party over the next three/four months. This comprises PO working
collaboratively with the JFSA and does three things:

*. Firstly explores the SS (8) themes for improvement (can we get less than 8?) and
agrees how they can be implemented.

* Secondly, looks at the remaining past cases with JFSA (and MPs if they wish) to see if
either further themes or new evidence emerge.

°. Thirdly, our external lawyers review all prosecutions in the past 12/18 months since
PO has been independent of RM, in the light of the SS findings. The JFSA/PO working
group reviews the findings.

[Why would they not review all cases of false accounting, eg., over the last 5-10 years,
especially where the amounts have been 'small'? I assume ‘large’ amounts would be less
likely to get away with saying they were muddle-headed and not helped? But could we
review all? It is the false accounting charge JA was most concerned about.]

¢ Does the working party update JA in the autumn?

2) setting up of a review (chaired by PB/MO'C type) again via joint working between PO
and JFSA, to determine how an independent safety net might be introduced ie., a
commitment to an independent adjudicator or (non-statutory) ombudsman and the
clear intention to agree scope and ToR.

POL-0098637
POLO0099054
POL00099054

3) the future introduction of an ongoing branch user group, once the working party has
completed it's task. This will ensure ongoing independent involvement of Spmrs/(inc
JFSA if they would like) to ensure the business listens to and acts upon issues as they
arise; and as importantly, consults users on future systems planning and changes.

[4) a statement that although the system has been proved to have no systemic issues,
and our training, support processes and helplines have worked for most of the 50-60000
colleagues over the past decade, we are nonetheless genuinely sorry that some of our
Spmrs, who were struggling did not feel we offered them sufficient help and support
when they needed it. And that we are grateful to JFSA and JA for highlighting the issues.
Many are historic and already improved but we are always open to new ways to
improve how we do business to ensure the PO stays as trusted and effective in its
communities as it ever was.]

Last thought: if we can draft this into something I could send to Alan Bates 'in
confidence’, it would get us to a better place in agreeing the press statement and way
through with JA on Monday. Could Martin try and corral views into a draft by Sunday
early pm? The more I speak with him the better I feel it will be.

Susan, would we ever ask the lawyers to consider reviewing past prosecutions? Is that
what we are talking about in 1) above but simply not using the terms? If not, why would
it be different? Of our 500 prosecutions, how many are false accounting? (For clarity
these are open questions - just want to know the answers, not an indication that I want
us to do so.)

Thanks, Paula

Hmm, the boundaries between these groups are getting quite blurred
and confusing (at least in my mind!).

I thought the focus of the working group involving the JFSA would be
primarily thematic (i.e. the 8 or so themes which emerged from the SS
process) - rather than focussing on resolving specific cases, which we
would pick up through the seperate 1:1 briefings with MPs. The
description below appears to shift it more towards the latter. Perhaps
this is an academic distinction which we can't sustain in practice, but it
certainly feels like safer territory to have the JFSA focussing on themes
to do with training and support (which would then morph into the
branch user forum) rather than individual cases...

Or have I misunderstood?

We also need to think about how the review of past cases by our
external lawyers plays into the messaging (if at all). Certainly not
something we would put in our proactive media statement I would have
thought, but would we refer to this in meetings as an avenue if pushed
by MPs or the JFSA?

Subject: Re: Proposed way forward

Hi Paula

I think this points to the need for our
package of measures to include two
and possibly three new initiatives:

1. A Branch User Forum - for existing
users to share views, discuss issues,
examine processes etc.. Chaired by Exco
and reporting to Exco. But this doesn't
cover historic issues (ie the JFSA and
MP cases) so we could also have (2)

2. Aworking party, to use Alan's
phrase, to complete the MP and JFSA

POL-0098637
cases. This could "take over" the Second
Sight review (perhaps involving them
but perhaps not as they have effectively
"cleared" Horizon, the remit of their
inquiry).This would involve the JFSA and
us working collaboratively on the
remaining cases. We might wish to
include an external party in this too (a
PWC?). This is the area of greatest risk -
looking back at historic cases which
have gone through the courts. But it is
also completing the job we asked SS to
do.

3. Areview by a Mike o Connor or
Patrick Burns figure to consider
potential independent levers which
could be developed to give SPMRs a
means of independent adjudication or
(non statutory) ombudsman.

This package, it feels to me, covers all
bases. It looks ahead to fix internal
issues and create independent
balancing view, but it also completes
the review and has the potential for
doing so with SS playing a different, or
no, role.

It is also a compelling package for
media, which handled carefully, could
contain the story.

Grateful for views.

Mark
