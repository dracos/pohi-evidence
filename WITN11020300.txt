(e) Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Employment Relations and Postal
Services);

(f) Minister of State for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs;

(g) Minister for Postal Affairs and Employment Relations;

(h) Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations,
Consumer and Postal Affairs;

(i) I Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills and Minister for Intellectual Property;

(j) I Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Small Business,
Consumers and Corporate Responsibility;

(k) Any other ministerial role not listed in paragraphs (a) - (j) above, which
had responsibility for Post Office Limited (and its relevant
predecessors).

All private secretaries who acted for Secretaries of State in the following

roles from 2000 onwards:

(a) Secretary of State for Trade and Industry;

(b) Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform;

(c) Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills;

(d) Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy;

WITN11020300
WITN11020300

(3) All Permanent Secretaries and Principal Accounting Officers within the
departments headed by the Secretaries of State identified above from

2000.

3. In respect of all of these officials, the Inquiry has requested that I identify the
period of time when they were in post. In respect of private secretaries, I am
asked to identify the ministers or Secretaries of State in whose private offices
they worked. I understand that the request relates only to those private
secretaries who were involved in postal affairs or matters related to the Post

Office.

4. I make this statement on behalf of DBT. I have been assisted in its preparation
by officials within my department, as well as the Government Legal Department
and counsel. The majority of the information set out in this statement is not known
to me personally, and I have therefore drawn and relied upon extensive input
from colleagues. It is in that sense a ‘corporate statement’. Its contents are true

to the best of my knowledge and belief.

5. I am authorised by the Secretary of State for Business and Trade to make this

statement.

PRIVATE SECRETARIES

6. Aminister’s private secretary (often referred to as a PS) is a civil servant who
works in a minister's private office. The essential objective of a private secretary
is to assist the minister in managing their demanding workload on a day-to-day
basis, so the minister can focus on decision-making. They do not hold any policy

or decision-making responsibilities themselves, but instead act as a principal

Page 3 of 15
WITN11020300
WITN11020300

liaison between a department's policy officials and its ministers. Private
secretaries are responsible for providing administrative support to the minister to
facilitate them in their ministerial role (that is, not in their position as a Member

of Parliament).

Key parts of the private secretary's role include: managing the minister's diary
(in conjunction with a specific diary manager), liaising with relevant policy teams,
deciding the papers that should be put before a minister on a given day
(principally through the ministerial box) and ensuring deadlines are met,

preparing and managing meetings, note taking and record keeping, and logistics.

Within a particular private office, there is usually a ‘Senior Private Secretary’ or
‘SPS’ who acts as head of the minister's private office, and then more junior
private secretaries who hold responsibility within the private office for a particular
brief (or briefs) held by the minister. The particular brief which is managed by a
particular private secretary will depend on the number of private secretaries
within the office, as well as the nature of the minister's role and their overall
portfolio. A minister may have multiple private secretaries working with them at
a given point in time, and a number of these private secretaries will have had no

involvement in the Post Office brief.

Due to the nature of their roles as political appointees, ministers can lose or have
their position in Government changed when the governing party changes or
when a ministerial reshuffle takes place. However, as civil servants, private
secretaries generally remain in their role when their minister moves on, and often
continue to work with replacement ministers, even if they represent a different

political party to the one that came previously.

WITN11020300
WITN11020300

10. In light of this, it is extremely likely that a given minister and their private
secretaries will have commenced and ended their roles at different times,

including in circumstances where:

(a) asingle private secretary will have been in post for a period covering the
term of several ministers; and
(b) various private secretaries will have commenced and ended employment
throughout the term of a single minister.
11. DBT does not hold a list of private secretaries over the period of time requested
by the Inquiry. Therefore, DBT officials have sought to identify the relevant

private secretaries by:

(i) reviewing civil service yearbooks, which were published annually until
2017, and which provide a snapshot of the private secretaries in post at

the point when information was collated for publication;

(ii) conducting searches within emails and documents held by DBT for the

purposes of this Inquiry; and

(iii) I asking relevant DBT officials to identify relevant PSs.

12. I set out in Appendices 1 and 2 the details of relevant private secretaries as

identified by DBT officials in response to the Rule 9 request.

13. There is a possibility that not all relevant private secretaries over the period

covered by the Rule 9 request have been identified, for reasons including:

(i) that the civil service yearbooks provide a snapshot only and in some

cases only mention the Senior Private Secretary; and

Page 5 of 15
WITN11020300
WITN11020300

(ii) that relevant private secretaries may not be identified in the emails and
other documents which the department has on file as a result of

departmental document retention policies.

14. Individuals in post temporarily to cover periods of temporary absence are not

identified in the appendices.

15. I understand that departmental officials are reasonably confident that they have
identified the vast majority of the relevant private secretaries identifiable from

departmental records.

PERMANENT SECRETARIES AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICERS

16. A Permanent Secretary is the most senior civil servant in a government
department. They are responsible and accountable for day-to-day management
of all the work of their department, as well as the departmental budget.
Permanent Secretaries are normally also Principal Accounting Officers (“AOs”)
for their departments, which entails their being responsible and accountable to
Parliament for the use of public money; as relevant to the Rule 9 request, all
departmental Permanent Secretaries were also AOs. The duties and
expectations of AOs are determined and monitored by HM Treasury through the

‘Managing Public Money’ guidance published by the Government.

17. Like private secretaries, Permanent Secretaries are civil servants. Therefore,
Permanent Secretaries are likely to be in post throughout the period of more than
one minister or Secretary of State, and their time in office does not generally

correspond with the time that a minister holds their post.

WITN11020300

18. I set out in Appendix 3 the relevant departmental Permanent Secretaries (not
including any ‘acting’ Permanent Secretaries covering temporary absences of
established Permanent Secretaries). Officials have compiled this information
from departmental records and other publicly available government information.
Due to multiple machinery of government changes, the relevant department with
responsibility for Post Office Limited (and its predecessors) has changed
throughout the years. Therefore, the relevant Permanent Secretary, for the

department with responsibility for the Post Office, has also changed

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
