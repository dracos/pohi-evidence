Settlement policy — why?

to terminate on 3 months’ notice.

Difficult to claim because POL could
always terminate on 3 months’ notice and
so loss of branch and subsequent loss of

irrecoverable at law for most claims.

2. Compensation principles

Limitation — claims over 6 years old are generally irrecoverable at law.
Should settlements be offered on old claims?

Causation — At law, SPMRs need to show that their complaints have

actually caused, or at least materially contributed to, the losses claimed.

This is more difficult for claims relating to, say, a lack of training and
support. Should Post Office insist on evidence of causation?

Remoteness - Peculiar or excessive losses that are unforeseeable to
POL may not recoverable at law. Should POL compensate these types
of losses?

Mitigation — At law, SPMRs are obliged to take reasonable steps to
reduce their losses. Should POL be looking for evidence of mitigation
before offering a settlement?
