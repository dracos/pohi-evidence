Please see the attached. Apart from their general conclusion there are a few questions raised by CK that I think we
could discuss with Rodric and John Scott in the first instance. Let me know if you agree.
Many thanks

Jessica,

Please find attached Simon Clarke’s Note of 27" March 2015; It would not be possible for POL to

Kind regards,

Martin.

Could you send me through again anything you have provided to us on this? I think it was sent to you with the
question as to whether POL could rely on this as expert evidence .
Many thanks
