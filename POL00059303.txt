Dear Vince,

Mr Chirag Patel,

Mr Patel was employed as a subpostmaster of the Post Office at Littleton Road in
Salford, however he was terminated following a review of the Post Office in light of
the accusation that money had gone missing. Mr Patel entirely disputes this.

He took over the Post Office in December 2010 and it was in February 2011
problems began.

Atter the first audit of Littleton Road in May 2011 the Post Office had trouble
balancing the books and they wanted him to make up the difference.

He was a newly appointed postmaster and was supposed to have received training
and support which included a monthly phone call and a visit after 3 months - he had
none of these.

He had problems when he tried to balance out the books himself and despite asking
for assistance from the Post Office he wasn't given any help and was ignored.

After 6 months he had his review and audit and they found the books were £9k short
- he was immediately suspended. After further investigation they discovered that it
was £12.5k short.

The person who did the audit even said there was a problem with the computer
because all the money in the Post Office was accounted for and that it was not Mr
Patel.

He had to pay the Post Office £12.5k in June 2011 otherwise they threatened to
close it. So he had to pay it.

The suspension was lifted in August 2011 following an interview which they decided
not to dismiss him.

POL00059303

He took back Littleton Road in August and was told after one month that there was a
Short fall of £6k - but this was for during the time he was not the postmaster. It was
during the time he was Suspended and someone else was there.

The Post Office demanded that he Pay the £6k even though he wasn't there and
wasn't responsible for it. He said that he couldn't afford to Pay it so they deducted his

wages for 3 months. He had no Opportunity to contest this. If he did they threatened
to close the Post Office.

contract. This was in June 2012.

He believes that he has lost approx £40k from the Post Office from various fines and
reduction in Pay.

Please find enclosed all documentation in regards to Mr Patel's case for your
information.

Please can I ask you to undertake a complete and thorough review of Mr Patel's
case and how it has been handled by the Post Office?

Furthermore, please can you Clarify whether the contract with Postmasters sign
does waiver their rights to legal redress? Is this legal?

I would be grateful if you could fully investigate Mr Patel’s situation and look to
resolve this matter as Soon as possible. I look forward to receiving your reply.

Yours sincerely,

Yasmin Qureshi

Investigators to check Post Office computers

By Matt Prodger
Home affairs correspondent

The Post Office has appointed external investigators to examine allegations of deficiencies in the computer system used
in all its outlets.

It comes after many sub-postmasters said they had been wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting

‘Around 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have registered an interest in suing Post Office Ltd over its Horizon
computer system.

Horizon records financial transactions in branches across the UK.

Sub-postmasters say they have been forced to pay back many thousands of pounds’ worth of money which they did not take.
Many of them them were stripped of their post office contracts and bankrupted, and a handful have served prison sentences
Forensic accountants

rie Post Office has instructed a firm of forensic accountants, and Sight Limited, to conduct an independent review of 10 existing

cases raised by a number of MPs and the law firm Shoosmiths.

Aconfidential Post Office internal memo in September 2008 said that in its crown offices alone - those operated by the Post
Office itself rather than by sub-postmasters - there had been £2.2m of losses in ‘one year, which was having @ serious effect on its
ability to achieve profitability.

It has refused to publish figures on apparent losses at sub-post offices.

Seema Misra, a former sub-postmistress from West Byfieet, Surrey, who was convicted in 2010 of stealing nearly £75,000 and
jailed for four months, said she hoped the investigation would help clear her name

She was pregnant with her second child when convicted and lost the contract to run the post office.

she told the BBC: "My life is completely shattered. I want to get the investigation done - it was the system. of whatever it was, it
wasn't my fault- and get my name cleared

sym no thief, I never was. I haven't taken a single penny from the Post Office. I put money in the Post Office. I haven't taken any
of their money."

“The Post Office backs the conviction, saying a jury found her guilty of theft
‘absolute confidence’
‘The Post Office has repeatedly denied there is @ problem with the system, saying the claims have been made by a very small

number of people who had contracts with it.

‘A spokesman said: "The Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its branch
accounting processes.

“over the past 10 years, many millions of branch reconeliations have been carried out with transactions and balances accurately
recorded by more than 25,000 different sub-postmasters.

The Post Office has no hesitation in agreeing to an external review of these few individual cases that have been raised with us
by a number of MPs."

But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said the external investigators should have been appointed independently

Mr Bridgen, who has such a case in his own North West Leicestershire constituency, said: "I would far rather they be appointed
by another body. ! would prefer itif they were paid by the Cabinet Office.

“It is important that this whole review should be beyond reproach and conducted at arm's length from the Post Office.”

A/O: Post Oftice Standards Team

Dear Sir,

1am writing with reterence to the following Post Ottice;

1 was previously the vost Mistress Tor this particular branch detore Mr. Chirag Patel who is the
current Post Master.

1 would ike to verity that since the new communications ink nad been Implemented onto the
system we had several problems communicating and rolling over. Numerous phone calls had been
made to try and rectify this problem which frequently occurred. The matter had also been discussed
with Paul Williams however very little support was given to resolve the difficulties with the new
communications system.

When the Post Ottice was transterred over to Mr Chirag Patel he had phoned me on several
occasions having similar problems with the rollover and I tried to advise him on how to resolve the
matter. These incidents were also reported to the helpline with no response from them. Personally I
tee! that the helpline did not respond to these queries as there was a tault with the Post Uttice
telephone line which still persists. Mr. Patel has discussed this with me and made contact with the
responsible parties to resolve this however he has been told that the fault cannot be traced. There is
still difficulties with this line; it is not possible to make call from it, the line does not ring and ifa
connection can be made then the entire system is affected. -

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further assistance in this matter.

Many Thanks

GRO
