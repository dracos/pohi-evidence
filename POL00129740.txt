Re Branch Discrepancies

As a result of central data reviews in the Post Office Finance Service
Centre, we have identified a small number of branches whereby a system
error in data archiving processes has led to an error in the calculation of
losses and gains at branch level. Your branch is one of that small number
affected.

We apologise for any confusion this matter may have caused and we want
to assure that we have subsequently worked with our suppliers to
understand the root cause of the issue and to take action to resolve it. You
may, however, not have been aware of this matter at the time but we
nevertheless felt it important to make you aware of the incident and of its
resolution.

The purpose of this letter is to summarise the outcomes of this review and
to confirm the remaining steps which we will be taking to conclude this
incident.

been confirmed as relating to a specific and unusual set of circumstances
which are certainly not due to any mistake by yourself.

Our investigations have determined that there was an isolated error in the
data archiving process in Horizon. In very rare situations of a branch
deleting a stock unit at a particular point in time in the month, this
conflicted with the archiving process. It led to genuine loss or gain values
in the deleted stock unit, in an earlier year, reappearing on their
anniversary date in subsequent years.

This has impacted only 14 branches and we are issuing similar
correspondence to all parties concerned to confirm that the issue is
understood and that proper remedial action has been taken.

dDue to the system error and its impact when a branch deletes a stock unit,
the value of reappeared in in the two following years — but
this time as a gain. Where there were other true losses and gains at that
time, it appeared as part of the net total.

Both TP9 gains recorded at your branch were made good by you removing

cash from the branch. Post Office Ltd will not be looking to recover these
sums from you and you may keep the gains.

In conclusion, we apologise for this incident and for any confusion and
concern it may have caused you.

We are pleased to confirm that the technical issue has been resolved and
the erroneous gain for your branch has been dealt with.
