Post Office

Post Office results for the six months ended 23 September 2012

Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement
“An encouraging six months - and optimism for the rest of the year.”

On 1 April 2012 the Post Office separated from the Royal Mail Group and became an independent business. This Trading Statement
is the first that the Post Office has issued to update on progress made. The Government Funding Agreement reached in October
2010 provided investment for thousands of Post Office branches across the Post Office Network to be modernised to provide service
improvements and longer opening hours to make them more accessible for customers. As well as developing the financial services,
telephony and mails business, the Post Office is building on a long history of delivering essential Government services and becoming
established as an effective Front Office for local and national Government.

The first six months have seen the Post Office take its first steps towards the longer term goal of becoming financially sustainable in
a challenging environment. The financial results and achievements are encouraging though the scale of change ahead remains
significant. The first tranche of Government funding was received on 2 April 2012 and expenditure has commenced to implement
the transformational changes required towards the goals of Growth, Customer Excellence and Modernisation.

Financial Performance

Turnover increased from £485 million in the first 6 months of the prior year to £501 million this year with growth in the Mails,
Retail, Financial Services and Telephony businesses. There has been continued strong performance in the mails area particularly in
packets and premium mails products including Special Delivery. Government Services income has seen a small decline. In addition
the Network Subsidy Payment from Government has increased by £13 million to £103 milion consistent with the Government
funding agreement. Other operating costs have increased by £19 million to £437 million driven by investment in activity to drive
future revenue growth and build the brand as well as establishing the framework for longer term efficiencies and improving the
supporting infrastructure across the network. Operating profit before exceptional items was £61 million, against a comparable
performance of £56 million last year.

Note that the Royal Mail Holdings plc Interim Report for the half year ended 25 September 2011 reported operating profit after modernisation costs but before other
exceptional items of £55m. The prior year result has been presented to exclude modernisation costs consistent with 2012 where results are reported before alt
exceptional items.

Post Office Network

This year has seen the Post Office network at its most stable for over a quarter of a century with 11.818 branches currently open
and trading, Our network is visited by nearly 20 million customers a week as well as by over half of all the nation’s small businesses
99.7% of the UK population is within 3 miles of their nearest Post Office outlet and the Post Office network remains a key part of the

1
POL00158012

Post Office

UK's infrastructure. Currently, 80% of UK bank personal customers can access their current accounts at Post Office branches and in
the first six months an agreement was signed that will see this figure rise to 95% next spring,

Following the launch of the £1.34 billion branch investment and support programme in March this year to modernise and sustain the
Post Office network, 269 new local and main-style branches were open or converted at the end of the half year. The transformation
of the network represents part of a wider Post Office strategy to win new customers and revenue streams for our business to ensure
its long-term viability. Extended opening hours, modern retail environments, and the unrivalled access and trust that our
subpostmasters hold in communities mean we can better serve the needs of our existing and future customers. Independent
research consistently shows that over 90% of customers are satisfied with the new style branch formats and the new formats are
having a positive effect on the income subpostmasters generate from their retail businesses

Post Office has extensively piloted the new style local and main branch formats and in doing so has benefitted from feedback from a
variety of sources including Consumer Focus. This has helped to further develop, improve and finesse our new operating models and
we will continue to roll out these new-style branches in the coming months, using the funding the Government has made available
up to 2015 to support this important programme of investment. The Post Office modernisation programme remains a voluntary
process and is conducted in close liaison with individual subpostmasters. It forms part of the Government's commitment to no
further programme of branch closures and our continued focus on making our network accessible and convenient to ensure we
maintain it at its current size and thereby increase both our customer base and our income.

Financial Services

The Post Office and Bank of Ireland have built a very successful partnership and business since 2004 providing accessible financial
services across the Post Office network in the UK. At the beginning of August this year, we announced a three-year extension to this
relationship with Bank of Ireland until 2023. Together, we are committed to investing in the capability and capacity of our financial
services operation to deliver benefits to our customers and drive the next phase of business growth and long-term value

The Post Office already has almost 3 million financial services customers as well as a savings book of over £17 billion. We provide a
wide range of services and products including mortgages, savings accounts, foreign exchange, credit cards and insurance for both
consumers and small businesses. Since March, the Post Office has introduced mortgage specialists into branches for the first time
and the second stage of this programme will take place later this year. We continue to top best-buy tables and win accolades for the
transparency, competitiveness and ease of use of our products and services. Post Office's overriding ambition continues to be to
build on these strong foundations, and establish itself as a recognised and trusted financial services alternative to the major UK
banks,

Front Office of Government

Post Office's goal is to build strong and lasting partnerships with key stakeholders to drive sales of existing and new Post Office
services to build towards becoming a financially sustainable business. We see this as our public service responsibility and it builds on
a long history of successfully delivering essential government services. In the first six months of this financial year, Post Office won a
4-year contract with Hammersmith and Fulham Council to provide government services to customers in the local area through the
Post Office network of branches including payments for council tax, business rates, housing rents and service charges. The service
will go live in early 2013 and can also be extended in the future to include more services and as this is a framework agreement, it
can be readily taken up by other councils.

In the period under review, we also announced that the Post Office's Application Enrolment and Identification (AEI) programme had
processed the biometric information of more than one and a half million applicants. The service captures applicant information such
as fingerprints, photographs, and digital signatures within branch for efficient transmission to the relevant authority. The service is
designed to serve multiple clients and is currently being used by the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) and the UK Border
Agency.

Building on this success, Post Office was delighted to be informed in (October 2012) that it had won the DVLA contract to provide a
wide range of licence services as well as the majority of tax disc services. This x year contract is a key stepping stone to Post Office
realising its vision to become a Front Office of Government and positions us as the key service provider for customer facing
government departments.

Olympics

The Olympics and Paralympics captured the hearts and minds of millions of people across the UK this summer, particularly so with
our colleagues here in the Post Office. Branches across our network were very much at the heart of these two great sporting
occasions helping the public celebrate these historic events. We sold £8 million worth of Team GB Gold Medal stamps during both
the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Over 500 branches opened on Sundays, many for the first time, to ensure customers could
purchase the stamps the day after a Team GB Gold Medal win, with a further 4,700 branches selling the stamps within days of each
win

POL00158012

Post Office

The Post Office Board is complete

We are delighted to welcome Virginia Holmes, Susannah Storey, Alasdair Marnoch and Tim Franklin to the Board as Non-executive
Directors in the first six months of the financial year. The Board looks forward with great anticipation to the opportunities ahead of
us to grow and modernise the business.

Overview and the future

Pes
é

The results for the first 6 months have been encouraging with strong mails revenue performance. The plans for growth,
modernisation and excellence in customer service are underway but are challenging and there is a significant task ahead. However,
the customer satisfaction results from the new style branch formats demonstrate that good progress is being made against these
ambitions. The Post Office took a step forward in its aim to establish itself as a recognised and trusted financial services alternative
to the major UK banks with the extension of its agreement with the Bank of Ireland [and the recent DVLA contract win underlines
our strength in delivering Government Services]. The Post Office is changing, stil at the heart of communities across the UK, but
growing and modernising its products and services.

2. Introduction

This Briefing Book has been prepared to explain the Post Office Limited results for the half
year ended 23 September 2012. It is a summary of the key data, trends and analyses to be
read in conjunction with the Trading Statement, which readers may find useful to further their
own understanding of the results for 2012-13. Post Office Limited has opted not to take
advantage of the Companies Act exemption from the preparation of consolidated accounts as
it is a wholly owned subsidiary within the Royal Mail Holdings plc group which prepares group
accounts. The Trading Statement therefore reports consolidated results.

Most of the analyses are based on the comparison of the half year’s actual results to prior
year.

Comparison against budget is discussed in the Monthly Performance Report presented to the
Post Office Limited Board on a monthly basis.

3. Accounting policies

There have been no changes to the accounting policies in the current year that have had a
material impact on the financial information reported in the Annual Report and Financial
Statements.

2011 Revenue Staff Costs Agents Costs Non People 2012
Costs

5.2. Explanations for some of the movements above are as follows:

e Revenue explanation is in section 6.1.

e The £4.6m increase in Staff costs was mainly due to:
o Pay awards, and higher Productivity & Bonus costs
o Higher temporary resource costs driven by recruitment to support various
projects and higher agency labour in Network. Year on year the headcount
figure has increased by 213.

e Agents’ cost are £3.5m lower than last year due to a one off payment of £400 made
in June 2011 to all agents to maintain stability in the network.

© Non people costs (including project one off costs) were higher by £22.6 mainly due to:
£16.6m higher project one off costs (POOC),
Last year’s costs included a £2.4m release relating to WHS TUPE transfers,
£0.5m increase in compensation which includes a reassessment of the personal
injury provision,
£1.8m increase in marketing expenditure,
£1.7m increase in property costs,
higher cost of sales by £1.8m mainly due higher UKBA volumes as a result of
rolling out more ID Services terminals and also due to higher Retail costs due
to the Olympic and Jubilee collectables, partially offset by;

o £1.9m lower Interbusiness costs as a result of Separation.

Services Lottery Services Subsidy
Payment

XN

The increase in year on year external revenue of £26.8m (7%) to £432.3m (2011 £405.5m)
is driven by the £13m increase in the Network Subsidy payment and an increase of £13.8m
in like for like income.

The following commentary gives further detail on the external revenue variances by category:

6.1.1 Government Services
The £0.8m (1%) decrease in Government Services revenue is principally due to:

. £2.2m lower DVLA revenues as volumes are below the minimum guaranteed income
levels and a one-off Service Level Agreement payment last year, and

. £1.0m adverse from falling numbers of POCA accounts through natural attrition and
migration of customers to bank accounts.

This was offset by
POL00158012
POL00158012

° £1.9m higher revenues from the new UKBA contact.

6.1.2 Retail & Lottery
Retail and Lottery revenues have increased by £1.9m:
« Lottery is flat with last year, with both periods seeing high levels of rollovers,

« Retail up £1.9m benefiting from collectibles for the Olympic and Paralympic
games as well as the Jubilee.

6.1.3 Telephony
Year on year increase in Telephony of £2.1m (3.5%) has resulted from:
. 22k more customers, following last year’s Q4 marketing campaign, offset by;

. A decrease in E Top Up revenues of £0.8m is due to volume reduction.

6.1.4 — Financial Services

Financial Services income has increased by £3.3m (2.5%) year on year. This continues the
trend of increases in new products offsetting the decline of traditional products. The main
variances are:

. a £7.7m increase in POFS products particularly savings related products (Growth
Bonds, Instant Saver and Reward Saver - £2.6m, £1.8m and £1.4m favourable
respectively). This includes the benefit of the renegotiated commission rates
following the ‘Eagle’ deal, and

. a £0.2m increase in ATM revenue, driven by increased volumes as machines reach
maturity.

This was offset by

. a £1.7m decline in NS& revenues as NS&I look to provide some of their products,
particularly savings, through their own direct channel,

. a £1.5m decrease in Banking revenue from:

o a £1.6m fall from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) as volumes
continue to fall as the Government is migrating customers to other payment
methods, and

o a £0.4m fall in Santander business revenues due to rate reduction from
renegotiated contract, offset by

o an increase of £0.5m in personal banking.

. flat revenues from Payment Services due to:

o a £0.7m decline from bill payments, as utilities and other bill payment clients
continue to migrate customers to other payment methods such as direct debit
and online, and

o a £0.7m increase in Postal Order income (including write back of uncashed
Postal orders over 2 years old).

10
POL00158012
POL00158012

6.1.5 Other
Year on Year increase of £7.3m was due to:

. a £6.5m movement due to the MDA (agreement post Separation) excluding Mailwork
income from internal revenue (see 6.2.2). This will be corrected for year end, and

. an increase in Gamma income of £1.2m due to a change in the way the payments
are structured.

This was offset by

. a £0.4m reduction from marketing services, primarily Photo Booth income where
volumes and rates have reduced.

2014 Mails Other 2012

The following commentary gives further detail on the £2.4m internal revenue variances:

6.2.1 Mails

The £7.7m (4.7%) increase in Mails Revenue is driven by strong volumes accounting for
£6.4m of the increase and £1.3m driven by price.

° Approximately £3.4m of the £6.4m volume variance was driven by stamp sales
ahead of the price rise in April.

. The new Mails Distribution Agreement resulted in a reduction in fixed fee of £15.7m
which is more than offset by increases in variable commissions of £17.0m resulting
in a net price variance of £1.3m.

11
POL00158012
POL00158012

6.2.2 Other
The £5.3m decrease in other is due to:

. a £6.5m movement due to the MDA (agreement post Separation) excluding Mailwork
income from internal revenue. This will be corrected for year-end (see 6.1.5) offset
by £1.5m increase in Swindon Stores income as a result of Olympic stamp storage.

Staff costs have increased in total by £5m to £128m, representing 25% (2011 25%) of the
cost base. The number of people employed increased by 213 to 7,912 at 23 Sept 2012
(2011 7,699) primarily due to the Network Transformation Programme. NTP staff costs are

The staff cost movement comprises:

e A total increase of £2m (2%) in Wages and Salaries an increase reflecting impact of
the agreed pay awards.

e Employers NI has increased marginally.

e Pension costs have increased by £1m (10%) as a result of a change in the FRS 17
rate for the RMPP service cost to 18.2% (2011 17.1%) driven by market conditions at
25 March 2012 and due to the increase in staff.

¢ Productivity costs have decreased by £1m (13%) driven by the reduced LTIP costs.

e Temporary resource costs have increased by £1m (67%) driven by recruitment to
support various projects and higher agency labour in Network.

Total Agents number 8,061 8,207

There were 8,061 Agents at the half year-end 23 September 2012 (2011 8,207). The 146
(2%) reduction in Agents is mainly due to natural attrition in the Post Office network.

The average annual cost per Agency branch (excluding VAT and NI) is £42,283 (2011
£43,394), a 3% decrease which is mainly due to a move away from fixed pay.

Total agents costs have decreased by £4m (1%) due to the one off payment made in 2011 of
£400.

7.3.2 Collection, Delivery & Conveyance charges have generally remained flat year on year.

7.3.3 Compensation costs have increased by £3m mainly due to a one off provision release
relating to the CWU TUPE claim for the WHS transfers in 2011-12 of £2m.

7.3.4 Property Facilities costs have increased by £1m due to external venue costs relating to
Post Office Vision events and cross company electricity charges.

7.3.5 Property Maintenance costs have increased by less than £1m due to the increased
number of Post & Go machines requiring annual maintenance.

7.3.6 Vehicles costs have remained flat.
7.3.7 Computers and Telephones costs have generally remained flat year on year.

7.3.8 Consultancy, Marketing & Legal Fees have increased by £8m mainly due to the higher
number of IT Programmes in 2011/12 requiring contractor/ consultancy individuals
and spend for ‘point of sale’ and rebranding. Note that the increase is charged to
projects through the Staff and Agent Related line below.

7.3.9 Staff and Agent related Costs & Consumables have decreased by £5m due to
increased number of programmes which has resulted to higher recharges to projects.

7.3.10 Finance costs have increased by £2m due to a one off purchase order benefit last year
of £0.5m and increased Bureau and ATM losses.

10. ‘Interest, cash, debt, funding, hedging and going concern

10.1 Going concern

Post Office Ltd has net cash and cash equivalents of some £771m (March 2012 £443m) and
a borrowing facility of some £1,150m of which £127m (March 2012 £377m) was drawn
down. The improvement is driven by the receipt of £200m Government grant in addition to
the upfront receipt of the full year NSP of £210m.

The going concern position has been reviewed and the year-end assessment (below) is still
applicable.

10.2 Background

On 24 March 2010 a further funding agreement was agreed that provided up to £180m for
compensation for losses sustained in parts of the network in 2011-12 as well as providing
access to the working capital facility to 31 March 2016. These arrangements received State
Aid approval on 23 March 2011 though the working capital facility was limited until 31 March
2012.

A further funding agreement with Government was announced on 27 October 2010 which
provided for:

e Funding of £410m for 2012-13 (recieved 2 April 2012)

e Funding of £415m for 2013-14

e Funding of £330m for 2014-15

e Extension of the existing working capital facility of £1.15bn up to 31 March 2016.

State Aid approval for the funding for 2012-13 to 2014-15 was received on 28 March 2012
and it was also recognised that the working capital facility was no longer deemed State Aid.

The going concern analysis is based on the latest strategic plan refresh prepared and noted by
the Post Office Limited Board and Royal Mail Holdings plc Board in October 2010. This was
updated to reflect the 2012-13 budget process and an updated view of the later years as at
March 2012. The Post Office Board approved the 2012-13 budget on 15 March 2012 and
has undertaken an initial review of the later years.

10.3. Assessment for POL

POL has finished implementing its 2005-11 strategic plan and has completed its closure
programme. It posted an operating profit before exceptional items for the first time for a
number of years in 2008-09 and has continued to do so but still operates with a cash
outflow. The 2011-15 plan is intended to reverse the trend of an increasing Network
Subsidy Payment (NSP).

The 2011-15 strategic plan, updated for latest views, has been shown in section 11 and

shows that POL has sufficient cash headroom to continue to trade. The available facility has

been defined to include network cash, ATM cash, ATM debtor, POCA debtor and SGEI

cheques. Headroom was increased as the result of a more widely defined criterion for use of

the Working Capital Facility (WCF). In the EC’s decision of 23 March 2011 they noted that
20
POL00158012
POL00158012

“_.the WCF is provided on condition that it is used for financing the cash and near-cash
requirements involved in delivering the SGEls...” and not limited it to cash for cash-withdrawal
Services of General Economic Interest (SGEl) as previously. Therefore the WCF can now be
used to finance all SGEI working capital requirements in particular those associated with
HMRC cheques in January and July. This will mean the peak funding requirement from non-
WCF sources will no longer be required for those months. This change has had a positive
effect on all months of c£E40m.

Other changes introduced in the one year funding deal for 2011-12 included the ability to
borrow up to £50m from other sources as well as the up to £50m in finance leases
previously allowed which would improve the headroom capacity if required.

10.4 Summary conclusion

Based on the analysis there is available borrowing headroom remaining until March 2015.
Royal Mail Group Limited is a key trading partner with POL and, in arriving at the conclusion
that POL is a going concern, the assumption is made that Royal Mail Group Limited is a going
concern or that an alternative mails provider would work similarly with POL providing a
similar level of income.

It is believed that POL will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable
future. It is therefore expected that the POL directors will consider it appropriate to continue
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.

Notes:
2011-12 shows the year end outturn and last years are the latest view of the strategic
plan.

Available facilities are defined as network cash, ATM cash, ATM debtor, POCA debtor and SGEI cheques.

Table 1
This table shows the October 2010 strategic plan cashflow updated for the 2012-13 budget and latest
reviews of subsequent years. It demonstrates positive headroom throughout the plan period.

Table 2
This table sets out the impact of theoretical downside scenarios if the plan does not generate
the income streams anticipated and if the pension scheme costs increase.

Clearly mitigating management actions could be initiated but there remains sufficient
headroom even if they are not taken. There are a range of management actions including
implementing non-staff cost saving initiatives and closing non NSP offices without
compensation, and the overriding principle is that management will take whatever action is
required to mitigate any risk that materialises.

14. Litigation and Claims- Potential Claims regarding Horizon.

14.1 Post Office Ltd has received notification of five potential claims from former
subpostmasters. Each of these subpostmasters had their appointments terminated
following the discovery at audit of significant cash losses at their respective branches.
Two of the subpostmasters were subsequently prosecuted and pleaded guilty to false
accounting.

14.2 Each has claimed wrongful termination of contract on the basis that the losses are
alleged to have arisen due to the unfairness of the system devised by Post Office Ltd
and/or have been generated by a computer error in the Horizon system. More
specifically, it is alleged that (a) the accounting procedures in place are unfair in that
they do not permit subpostmasters to properly verify losses which are alleged to have
been incurred, (b) the Horizon system itself contains inherent defects and/or (c) the
training and support for subpostmasters using the system is inadequate,

14.3 Each subpostmaster is claiming circa £150,000 by way of damages.

14.4 Four of the claims remain at the pre-action stage (i.e. there are no live court
proceedings). Post Office Ltd has strongly denied liability and rebutted the allegations
made. The fifth claim was struck out by the Court and cannot be pursued further.

14.5 The last correspondence received on these matters was in December 2011. Post
Office Ltd is not aware of any further substantive steps having been taken to advance
these claims through the Courts since that date.

14.6 Post Office Ltd continues to receive challenges to the integrity of the Horizon system
and it is possible that further claims may be received. Reports in the press have
previously suggested that solicitors Shoosmiths may have consulted on between 85
and 150 potential cases in total.

14.7 Several subpostmasters have also made complaints about Horizon to Members of
Parliament. Post Office Ltd has commissioned an independent third party, Second
Sight Support Services Ltd, to investigate an initial sample of sixteen cases where
allegations have been made that the Horizon system is the source of unresolved
accounting shortages. That investigation is ongoing.

14.8 Post Office Ltd is also actively considering proposals from Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance, an organisation “established to raise awareness of the issues within the Post
Office Horizon system”, to develop a system by which individual subpostmasters can
raise concerns with Horizon within a “no blame” framework.

14.9 On the basis of the evidence to date, no provision has been made and it is not
considered appropriate to make any disclosure on this matter. This position is being
actively monitored.

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD AUDIT RISK AND COMPLIANCE SUB-COMMITTEE

Format and Content of Annual Report and
Financial Statements for 2012-13

Purpose
1. The purpose of this paper is to:

e Invite the Post Office Limited Board Audit Risk and Compliance Sub-Committee to
consider the format and content for the 2012-13 Post Office Limited Annual Report
and Financial Statements and agree the approach to be taken; and

e Update the Committee on the planned timetable for year end.
Background

2. In previous years the main focus of the audit and financial statements production and
approval has been on the Royal Mail Holdings plc Group consolidated financial statements
with the other legal entities within the Group structure simply meeting the statutory obligation
to produce audited financial statements.

3. Following the structure changes for separation with effect from 1 April 2012 the emphasis
will change and it is anticipated that the focus of attention will be on the two main
subsidiaries of Royal Mail Holdings plc (RMH) — Royal Mail Group Ltd (RMG) and Post
Office Limited (POL). It should be noted that, despite the structure changes, technically
POL is not required to provide anything additional to the standalone company financial
statements and disclosures made in the past therefore the recommendations made in this
paper are merely options for consideration.

4. RMH plc will still be required to prepare a full consolidated set of financial statements but it
is understood from Royal Mail that these will not be the main document for external
communication purposes. However, it should be noted that Post Office Limited will need to
liaise with Royal Mail to ensure a smooth and consistent approach to content and timing.

5. In preparation of the recommendations below, consideration has been given to the approach
taken by RMH plc, which is likely to be mirrored by RMG where possible for 2012-13. Other
approaches have been reviewed for comparison including:

e John Lewis Partnership plc (JLP) - JLP has similarities to POL in that it is high profile
but not listed. It is also perceived to be owned by its employees, but in fact has
preference share capital with the employees’ interests determined by constitution.

e British Airways plc (BA) - BA was listed until its merger with Iberia in January 2011 at
which point a new parent was created above BA. It has therefore moved from
producing full listed plc financial statements to a reduced disclosure while
maintaining many of the elements of listed financial statements.

e BP plc — meets full listing requirements for the group in IFRS and includes UK GAAP
parent company financial statements at the back of the group financial statements.

POL00158012
POL00158012

Strictly Confidential

e General Medical Clinics plc (GMC) — meets plc requirements and produces
consolidated and parent company financial statements in UK GAAP.

Decisions

6. POL has three initial decisions to make which are explained further below and summarised
in a decision tree diagram in Appendix 1.

7. Once these decisions are confirmed POL has a further option to consider what, if any,
additional disclosures it wishes to make towards meeting the requirements of being a listed
ple.

8. Decision 1 — POL has historically taken advantage of the exemptions from being a wholly
owned subsidiary of a UK plc that produces Group financial statements but could take the
decision not to take these exemptions. The main exemptions are:

¢ Not to prepare a cash flow
¢ Reduced financial instruments notes
e Reduced related parties disclosure

The decision to produce consolidated financial statements is linked to these exemptions.
POL was not required to produce consolidated financial statements as it was not a parent
company but, having taken the decision to incorporate a subsidiary undertaking, it will be a
parent undertaking by the year end. As such, a further exemption exists not to produce
consolidated financial statements.

The decision has already been taken to produce consolidated financial statements in
addition to the required standalone company financial statements. The additional disclosure
required for the other exemptions is not considered onerous and these disclosures are
standard content for plc financial statements. In addition, the decision not to take advantage
of the exemptions would be a clear signal of steps towards full independence.

The potential disadvantages are that this will be the first time that a Post Office cash flow will
have been in the public domain, which may be a sensitive issue, and there may be some
sensitivity with Royal Mail regarding the related party disclosures.

It is recommended that the exemptions are not taken and POL acts as fully
independent in production of its Report & Financial Statements but that the potential
sensitivities are noted and re ited at the year end prior to publication.

9. Decision 2 — The consolidated and company financial statements could be prepared under
UK accounting standards (UK GAAP) or International accounting standards (IFRS). There
is also an option to prepare the company financial statements under UK GAAP and the
consolidated financial statements under IFRS.

There are not material differences between IFRS and UK GAAP with the main difference
being the terminology. Generally large UK plc’s report using IFRS for their consolidated
financial statements and RMG is expected to use IFRS as it already uses this for RMH.
JLP, BA and BP all report under IFRS. It is therefore recommended to report the
consolidated financial statements under IFRS.

POL company financial statements are currently prepared under UK GAAP which is
consistent with the rest of the RMH group company financial statements. It is also not
uncommon for the parent company financial statements to be prepared in UK GAAP even in
large pics. This practice was more common when IFRS was first implemented due to
concerns relating to distributable reserves if IFRS was used for company financial
statements. Many companies have continued with this approach, for example, BP prepares
UK GAAP parent financial statements, although JLP and BA both prepare IFRS parent
financial statements. At this stage RMG has not indicated any plans to change its company
financial statements from UK GAAP. With effect from 2015 (POL’s March 2016 year end), it
will become mandatory to prepare company financial statements under IFRS.

It is recommended that POL continues to prepare its parent company financial
statements in UK GAAP at this stage but prepares the consolidated financial
statements under IFRS.

10. Decision 3 — The Report and Financial Statements could be prepared as one formal
document incorporating the consolidated results with the business review and other optional
disclosures at the front and the statutory parent company financial statements attached at
the back. The whole document would form POL’s formal submission to Companies House
and be retained on the record. Alternatively, as POL is not required to submit consolidated
financial statements to Companies House, the statutory parent company financial
statements could be prepared as a standalone document for submission to Companies
House and the consolidated Report and Financial Statements could be prepared separately
for external communications purposes. The consolidated Report and Financial Statements
would have no status and would not form part of the formal record at Companies House.

BP is required to prepare consolidated financial statements as well as parent company
financial statements and prepares these as one formal document. RMH has also historically
followed this approach but RMG has not yet confirmed if it will follow this approach .
However, this approach will result in more information than POL is required to prepare being
part of the formal Companies House record.

The alternative approach of two sets of financial statements results in considerable
duplication and potential confusion between the public document and the formal Report and
Financial Statements lodged at Companies House.

It is recommended that one formal document is produced forming both the formal
record at Companies House and being the document that is communicated
externally.

11. There is then a further option to report as if POL was a listed plc or to adopt some of the
requirements where they are considered appropriate. RMH has sought to do this for the last
few years and, with a few minor exceptions, has met this standard. The main features that
would be added for POL if it reported as if listed are an expanded Business Review, a
Corporate Governance section and a Directors’ Remuneration Report. At half year a full set
of interim financial statements under IAS 34 would be required to meet this level in full.

e The additional requirements for the Business Review include trends and factors
likely to affect the future development of the business as well as more information on
environmental matters, employees and social and community matters. It is
recommended that POL includes these additional requirements where appropriate.

e The Corporate Governance section is determined by the requirements of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
(DTR). RMH aims to comply with these requirements and RMG is expected to do
likewise for 2012-13. It is a requirement to report exceptions and RMH reports that it
complies as far as is appropriate for a public company with a single shareholder.
JLP also reports against the Code but notes that it has some exceptions and BA has
reported against certain elements of the requirements that it deems appropriate. It is
recommended that POL investigates the requirements and aims to meet the Code
and the DTR to the extent that it is appropriate. A draft of this content will be brought
to the Audit Committee for review in February.

e The Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) Regulations set out the requirements for
listed plc’s. RMH states that it complies as far as it can for a non-listed company and
it is expected that RMG will act similarly. This would involve full disclosure for each
named director of their pay broken into component parts, as well as the incentive
scheme details (long term and short term) and pension arrangements. JLP does not
comply with these regulations but includes the directors’ pay disclosure required for
the notes to the financial statements. This includes the highest paid, some
description of the bonuses and pension arrangements and the pay in £50,000
bandings without names. However, the directors’ pay arrangements do not appear
complex and their incentives amount to the same percentage bonus as all the other
employees. BA also does not comply with these regulations and includes the pay
disclosure within the notes to the financial statements. It is recommended that POL
does not comply with the regulations at this stage but will disclose a summary of the
directors’ pay within the notes to the financial statements.

e Half year reporting under IAS 34 would involve producing an abridged version of the
full year financial statements and notes. RMH did not comply with this standard until
its 2011-12 half year and may opt not to comply for 2012-13. It is understood that
RMG is likely to use [AS34 in future but has prepared pro-forma interim statements
for 2012-13 in the IAS34 style but not fully complying as it has chosen to exclude the
POL results from the whole period although POL was a subsidiary for 1 week to 1
April 2012. JLP prepares interims under IAS 34. It has already been decided that
POL will not comply with this standard for 2012-13, but instead will produce a short
half year trading statement. This decision could then be re-visited for the 2013-14
interims.

12. As in 2011-12 a full Audit Committee briefing book will be produced in 2012-13 to support
the financial statements. This provides a more detailed analysis of the results to aid
understanding.

Timetable

13. The additional reporting set out above will have a significant workload impact on the Finance
team as well as Communications, HR and Company Secretariat. An initial draft timetable is
attached at Appendix 2 with the assumption that all recommendations within this paper are
taken.

The Internal Audit team will liaise with other providers of assurance including second
line defence functions, external audit and Risk Governance Compliance.

4 Access and Authority

The Post Office Internal Audit team have unrestricted access to all functions,
records, property and personnel at all management levels including the external
auditors and contractors insofar as it applies to authorised audits, reviews and
investigations.

All members of the Internal Audit team will abide by company and professional
standards with regards to confidentiality. Audit files and evidence will be
appropriately secured.

Where information is of particular sensitivity, management may request that
access to the information be restricted to the Head of Internal Audit only.

If required access has not been forthcoming and following due process remains
as such and this has a significant restriction on the effective completion of an
audit, the limitation should be reported. Effort to resolve the situation should be
undertaken and only after these steps should such limitations be reported to the
Committee.

4.1 Reporting on activity

The findings on engagements shall be cleared upwards through line
management and to the appropriate Executive Committee member. Reports will
be summarised for the Committee, who may request access to the full reports.
Reports will also be provided to the CEO, CFO and Head of Risk Governance
Compliance as appropriate.

Formal reports will be classified as confidential. Access to final reports by
individuals not directly associated with the audit, shall be approved by the Head
of Internal Audit and the owning Executive Committee member.

5 Audit Plan

The Head of Internal Audit will submit an rolling risk based plan for approval by
the Committee, review progress with the audit committee quarterly and where
necessary amend the plan to reflect changing risk priorities.

Internal Audit Charter Malcolm Zack Page 3 of 6
For ARC 9 October 2012

POL00158012
POL00158012
¢ The plan will project a maximum of 6-12 months into the future although some
areas will require annual review.

e This plan will also be made available to the Board and the Executive Committee
and be flexible to requests from the business that arise during the year.

e Audits will generally be planned alongside management and announced but at
times visits, checks and investigations may be unannounced to the business area
concerned. This includes all aspects of the group including head office functions

e A follow up process will be implemented. The results of follow ups including the
implementation rate of recommendations will be reported to the Committee on
a periodic basis.

5.1 Management Requests
Management may make requests for audits or reviews through the year.

e Requests will be evaluated in terms of risks and effort will be made to address
these requests wherever possible.

e Other than short assignments, the Committee should be informed of proposed
changes to the plan especially where this will impact delivery or delay start of
currently planned work.

e The Chair of the Committee and the Head of Internal Audit will discuss significant
changes to the plan and agree steps with the business.

6. Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee Liaison

¢ The Head of Internal Audit should meet with the Chairman of the Committee
outside of regular audit meetings, without the presence of management at least
twice a year.

e The Head of Internal Audit may meet with any of the other members of the
Committee and with the external audit partner outside Committee meetings.

e All members of the Committee may request a meeting with the Head of Internal
Audit to discuss risk, control and audit matters.

e The Head of Internal Audit will ensure that all Committee members are confident
in fulfilling their responsibilities and provide support and guidance where
requested.

7. Staffing and Resource

e The Head of Audit shall ensure that the department is sufficiently resourced to
carry out its duties in terms of professional competency, business knowledge
and awareness and technical proficiency. Additional technical training needed to
ensure an audit can be effectively conducted should be arranged.

e Specific audit tools to improve efficiency and effectiveness of audits (such as for
extraction and analysis of large quantities of data) should be identified and
obtained.

e In accordance with international standards, the department should not
undertake audit work where it does not feel it is sufficiently skilled to do so. In
which case, specialised services or staff from either within the organisation or
external to it should be considered and sought.

8. Advice and support
Internal Audit should not be required to:

e Perform operational duties

e Operate controls, other than those within the department

e Approve accounting transactions outside of the department.

e Implement controls that are the responsibility of management.

It is within normal accepted practice and International Internal Auditing Standards for
Internal Audit to be requested to assist in a facilitative or consulting nature. Where this
falls within the general remit of advising on risk and control this will be considered part
of the service offering, with regard to resources available and time required.

Where it is agreed as appropriate for a member of the IA team to provide significant
input to an activity or project that is beyond the normal remit which means they should
be temporarily seconded to another department or team, then the following will take
place.

e The request will be approved jointly by the Head of Internal Audit and the
Chairman of the Committee.

e The resource impact on the approved audit plan should be approved by
the Committee who will either approve the reduction in scope to the

audit plan or request the Board to approve temporary resource to
address the shortfall.

e The work conducted by the seconded member will be the responsibility
of the receiving manager, not the Head of Internal Audit. The work will
not be defined as internal audit.

9. Standards of Audit Practice

The Head of Internal Audit will implement recognised international internal auditing
standards and techniques such as those developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors,
COBIT and COSO as appropriate to the Post Office.

POST OFFICE LTD AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Internal Audit Report

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

14 Summarise the initial activities of the newly established Post Office Internal Audit
department.

1.2 Explain the recruitment plan.

1.3. Summarise the status of the Internal audit plan currently run and managed by
the Royal Mail Internal Audit Team.

1.4 Highlight findings from recently completed reviews

1.5 Outline the proposed activity over the next quarter.

The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee is asked to note the above, the attached RMIA
internal audit plan and summary of the Supplier Contract Management audit.

2. Background

2.1 The Royal Mail Internal Audit team comprises over 30 managers and staff. As
part of the separation, an agreed audit programme for 2012/13 for 500 man days
work commenced in April 2012. A summary of the audit plan to date and current
status is shown in appendix 1. RMIA Resource is supplemented by co-sourcing
arrangements with Deloittes.

2.2 The programme is managed by Stephen Collins, Manager RMIA, with oversight
from the Royal Mail Director of Audit and Risk. The audit process from setting
terms of reference, through fieldwork, reporting and clearance follows the RMIA
protocols and processes.

2.3 Malcolm Zack, joined Post Office as Head of Internal Audit (HIA) on October 1%
to commence the transistion of internal audit activity to Post Office. The current
RMIA programme as agreed with Post Office management will continue to run,
with some involvement and management from the HIA.

24 In the intervening time the HIA will determine the actions necessary for the
transition.

4. IA Structure and Recruitment

4.1 The initial budget for the Internal Audit team is HIA, plus 3 Audit Mangers
supported by co-sourced arrangements. The team will be based at Old Street.

4.2 The calibre of the audit managers needs to be sufficient to enable effective
engagement at all levels of management including Executive Management. They
are therefore likely to be qualifieds (CIIA, ACA, CISA) with at least 5 or more years
PQE, with previous internal audit experience.

4.3 The focus will be on the higher more strategic risks facing the organisation rather
than lower operational risks, although these will not be excluded. Based upon
exposure to the business to date and the wide variety of risks facing the
organisation, the team will need to take a risk based/prioritised approach.

4.4 Following discussions with management the team is likely to be:

e IT Audit Manager - high level of IT infrastructure and systems change over the
next 3 years, complex head office and branch IT environment, extensive 3” party
support.

« Audit Manager - With particular focus on Projects and Programme Assurance.
Focus on key aspects of the change programme, transformation and key
initiatives

e Audit Manager - With particular focus on the retail branch network, supply chain
and liaison with the inhouse teams that work in these areas.

4.5 Recruitment processes are underway for the IT Audit Manager as this need was
determined early on in the process.

4.6 Whilst there may well be some activity in the Financial Services arena needed,
there is work conducted by the Internal Audit team of the Bank of Ireland.

4.7 \n order to maintain flexibility, remain up to date with new skills and requirements,
most modern internal audit departments set up co-source arrangements with
external firms. (For example, Royal Mail use Deloittes). An initial budget of 150
days external support is under consideration and a tender process will commence
once agreed.

5. Internal Audit Plan and recent results.

5.1 Please refer to the Royal Mail [A summary plan status in Appendix 1 and the Post
Office summary of the Supplier Contract Management Audit in Appendix 2.

5.2 At time of writing the Audit of the POLSAP system environment was at Executive
clearance with the ClO. A verbal summary will be provided at the Audit
Committee meeting.

Supplier Contract Management — summary of Royal Mail IA report

Audit Highlights and Opinion

—] Overview.

e POL has a Contract Management Function that manages
suppliers. The review was agreed between POL and
Royal Mail Internal Audit as part of the 2012/2013
internal audit plan.

° The review assessed controls to assess supplier contract
risk including:

¢ Changes to existing contracts including authorisation
controls,

° Case management, legal review, management of
supplier charges and supplier performance.

° General governance of the function and supplier risk
management.

POL00158012

POL00158012

Further improvement
needed

Overall Conclusions (from Royal Mail report)

e “The controls in place over existing supplier
management are largely derived from the Service
Delivery Framework,

° Contract Management provide varying levels of support.

e Ina stable environment with a low level of change, this
would suffice with some improvements.

e With the anticipated high level of change being
undertaken by the business, a more proactive
commercial approach to managing suppliers is

recommended. Management are aware of this and are
developing a Contract Management Framework.

Dear Members of the Audit and Risk Committee
Planning Board Report

We are pleased to attach our audit planning board report for the forthcoming meeting of the Audit and Risk
Committee. The purpose of this report is not only to provide the Audit and Risk Committee with a basis to
review our proposed audit approach and scope for the 2012/13 audit, in accordance with the requirements of
the auditing standards and other professional requirements, but to also ensure that our audit is aligned with
your service expectations.

This report summarises our assessment of the key issues which drive the development of an effective audit for
Post Office Limited, considering the relevant emerging market forces coupled with the operational, finance,
and business risks which drive POL's financial statement risks. We have aligned our audit approach and scope
with these.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Audit and Risk Committee, Board of Directors
and management, and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified
parties.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this report with you on 13 November 2012, as well as understand
whether there are other matters which you consider may influence our audit.

Yours faithfully

Executive Summary

Executive Summary

POL00158012

Less than a year from the official separation of Post Office Limited (‘POL') from Royal Mail Group (‘RMG'), we
continue to witness the time and efforts expended to make changes vital for success in this new chapter of

POL's history. We have also continued to challenge our audit strategy for the coming 2012-13 financial year,
working with management so that our approach focuses on the risks faced by POL in response to changes

within the industry, economic environment and internal

ly.

In order to identify the key drivers of audit risk, we analyse the risks inherent in the sector, the markets in
which POL operates, the key strategic, operational and finance risks for POL you have identified through your
risk assessments and our knowledge of other factors that may impact POL's financial statements.

By considering these inputs, we focus our audit on the areas that matter to POL, so that our feedback is more

relevant to your business.

“Significant risk as defined by auditing standards and

professional judgement

Our audit approach is designed to appropriately respond to these risks. We will continue to focus on the key
areas where we believe there is higher inherent risk to the financial statements due to the nature and level of
judgement involved. We will also consider changes in financial reporting standards and regulations and their

impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements.

Significant risks

Of the financial statement risks identified, we consider some of them to be significant to our audit. Auditing
standards define significant risks as those with a high likelihood of occurrence and, if they were to occur,
could result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.

Once identified we are required by Auditing Standards to perform specific procedures over significant risks,
including the identification and testing of the effectiveness of key controls designed to address the risks.

The identified financial statement risks for POL are as follows:

Revenue recognition across diverse > The incentive to deliver expected revenue targets
fangeot revenue streams » The accounting for deferred revenue and specific commissions within complex or new
legal agreements across a variety of revenue lines.
Counterparty Risk Perceived heightened risk since 2008 credit crisis over the credit risk exposure to
counterparties, particularly given the concentration of risk associated with the Bank of
Ireland.

Pension valuation and accounting [NEW] The accounting for the pension solution and subsequent valuation of the reported balance

classification of exceptional costs [NEW]

Risk of fraud/burglary arising from the There is a large quantity of cash in the cash centres, branches and in transit which is
logistics network and the branch network potentially subject to misappropriation or the focus of burglary attempts.

Fraud risks and risk of management override

The risk of fraud exists in any business. However, frauds involving the manipulation of results to achieve
performance targets are particularly harmful to stakeholder value and the current economic environment has
increased their likelihood of occurrence.

Our responsibility is to plan and perform audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements as a whole are free of material misstatements whether caused by error or fraud. To address the
increased potential risk arising from manipulation of results to achieve performance targets, we consider the
incentives and opportunities for individuals to override internal controls in our audit procedures.

Summary

In determining our approach to the 2012-13 audit, we consider how the risks faced by the Company might
impact the financial statements. From our experience of working with a number of companies in the
government and financial services sector, our understanding of the key risk areas focused upon by
management and from our prior knowledge of the Company, we identified a number of key financial
statement risks, outlined below. These do not represent all risks but do include those items that in our opinion
are the most significant for POL in 2012/13.

The risks are largely consistent with the prior year with additional emphasis surrounding the changes that the
separation of Post Office from Royal Mail and the Network Transformation programme will bring to the
business.

Accounts with significant risks

Significant risks are risks with both a higher likelihood of occurrence and a higher magnitude of effect that
require special audit considerations. The risks we have identified as significant risks are detailed below, along

with how we propose to address those risks.

Revenue recognition across diverse range of revenue streams

POL sells a large variety of products/services across a number of revenue
streams, from providing ATM services through the Bank of Ireland arrangements,
to providing telephony broadband services under POL's Homephone brand. Most
of these revenue streams will have their own specific rates, commissions and
calculations for allocating the amount of revenue owing to Post Office, which are
dependant on their underlying contracts.

Whilst we note that most of the revenue lines are not overly complex in their
revenue calculations, the main risk associated with the diverse range of revenue
streams is in the correct contractual terms being applied to the revenue lines.
We also note that reward and incentive schemes based on achieving profit
targets may also place undue pressure on management to achieve revenue
forecasts, which makes us identify revenue recognition as a fraud risk.

Counterparty risk

In light of the current economic environment, POL undertakes a review of all
counterparties to assess their level of exposure and relative risks. In particular,
given the concentration of risk associated with the Bank of Ireland (Bol), POL has
performed a more detailed assessment to determine if steps should be taken to
mitigate any risk exposure perceived excessive.

As part of their assessment, the appropriate detailed contingency plans have
been put in place, in particular focusing on Instant Saver and general banking
areas.

It is noted that the counterparty risks associated with the Bol mainly relate to the
daily trading balance which is owed from BO! to POL with the most significant
exposure in respect to the ATM debtor. On any given weekday the exposure is
approximately £20-30m; however on a Sunday, the exposure could be
approximately £80m, as it would include the full weekend's transactions.

Management will need to continue to regularly monitor and assess the level of
relative risk and exposure of their trading partners, in order to determine at any
point if steps should be taken to mitigate any perceived risk through collateral or
other arrangements.

We will perform detailed controls work on
revenue during interim, which will include
testing whether the revenue lines selected are
using the correct contractual rates and volumes
in their calculations.

We will perform a detailed analytical review to
analyze and evaluate the movements in the key
revenue lines across the business.

For significant new products or revenue
streams, we will review the accounting
treatment in line with the revenue recognition
accounting standard and relevant contractual
terms.

We will discuss the counterparty risk at year
end with the Head of Corporate Finance, and
understand management's assessment of the
counterparty risk the business is exposed to
and if this would have any related financial
statement impact.

We will keep abreast of the volatility in the
financial markets and any changes to POL's
key partners such as the Bank of Ireland's
credit rating.

We will consider the recoverability and
financial statement presentation of any
material counterparty receivables due to
POL, performing subsequent cash testing
where necessary.

We will perform detailed substantive tests on
all material vendor reconciliations at year
end.

Accounts with significant risks

Pension valuation and accounting

On 1 April 2012 - after the granting of State Aid by the European Commission to
the Governmenton 21 March 2012 - almost all of the pension liabilities and
pension assets of the Royal Mail Group pension scheme, RMPP, built up until 31
March 2012, were transferred to HM Government (‘HMG’). On this date the RMPP
was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Limited each
responsible for their own sections in future. This arrangement left the RMPP fully
funded on an actuarial basis in respect of historic liabilities at that date.

The accounting of the transfer of the RMPP and related disclosures is sensitive
due to the number of stakeholders involved, including HMG and the
Communications Workers Union.

At 23 September 2012, the Group recognised a net pension asset of £53m on
their balance sheet.

Management will satisfy themselves that the assumptions used in calculating the
pension obligation at the year end are reasonable and the appropriate disclosures
are made by consultation with actuaries.

We will audit the accounting treatment in line
with [AS 19 and IAS 1.

For the final Post Office RMPP year end
valuation we will review the key financial
assumptions supporting the valuation, with
input from Ernst & Young pension specialists
and ensure that the methodology and
application is consistent with IAS 19 and IAS
=

Benchmark POL assumptions against peers.
We will assess and provide insight into the
relevant position of the treatment adopted.
Obtain evidence and support for the valuation
of pension assets.

Review the pension disclosures provided in
the financial statements.

Other areas of audit emphasis
The other areas of audit emphasis are set out below:

Higher inherent risk of transitioned accounts impacted by POL separation

On 1 April 2012 Post Office Limited ceased to be a subsidiary of Royal Mail Group »
Limited, and became a directly owned subsidiary of Royal Mail Holdings plc.

‘AS a consequence of POL’s separation from Royal Mail Group during the current
year, the POL finance team will be directly responsible for all its finance

functions, some of which were previously accounted for at Royal Mail Group.

Such accounts/finance functions will include but are not limited to pension

valuation accounting and treasury management. >

Valuation of provisions including Network Transformation provision &
classification of exceptional costs

Following its separation, POL has been going through a Network Transformation»
all of its existing branches in order to modernise them as part of their overall
strategy to make the Post Office competitive for the future.

The financial implications of Network Transformation for FY2012-13 are

anticipated to be approximately in the region of £127m.

£24m of exceptional costs relating to Network Transformation had been incurred

as at September 2012.

Risks include:

>» Costs are provided for before or after they have been committed and are
recognised in the incorrect period; and

> Other costs, not associated with the Network Transformation are

inappropriately included within this category and reported outside of the
trading profit.

We will be performing detailed testing on the
new processes, acting in close concert with
management and build on the knowledge that
the Royal Mail Group team had when these
accounts were prepared and audited at RMG
level.

We will use the same specialist teams that were
used by Royal Mail Group wherever possible
such as the Pensions team to ensure a smooth
transition from the audit side.

We will review management’s monitoring
process for being able to differentiate between
Network Transformation costs and normal
operating costs, and assess whether it captures
the appropriate information and detail to track
these costs.

We will review the detail of the costs provided
and establish when the committed obligation
arose to assess whether the cost has been
recorded in the appropriate period.

The costs included will be reviewed to
understand whether they are directly linked to
the Network Transformation and appropriately
included within this category and reported
outside of the trading profit.

Other areas of audit emphasis

Risk of fraud/burglary arising from the logistics process and the branch network

POL holds large quantities of cash within its retail centres, cash centres and in
transit (£642m as at 23 September 2012), which is potentially subject to
misappropriation or under the threat of burglary attempts by organised crime.
Management has in the past created strong controls to prevent and detect any
risk of fraud and attempted burglary, and keep re-assessing whether they need to
increase their security measures.

Project Eagle/Gamma accounting

BOI sells a number of financial services products through the POL branch network
in the UK. Historically, the services were operated through Midasgrange Limited,
which traded as Post Office Financial Services (‘POFS’), a JV between POL and
Bol.

in April 2007 a deed of variation was signed between POL, BO! and POFS. This
deed of variation was intended to compensate POL for continuing to maintain a
network of 370 Crown offices rather than their plan of converting 50 of these
offices to franchise offices by 2015 (‘Gamma’).

We understand that subsequent to year-end, Gamma was terminated as POL sold
its investments in POFS to the BO! for proceeds of approximately £2.7m (Project
Eagle).

Going forward, we understand that the arrangement between POL and BO! will be
‘commissioned based’ whereby POL will directly receive a contractual commission
for each BO! product that it sells to customers through its branches.

We will visit both cash centre and branches to
attend cash counts by internal audit, and
observe controls around cash management.

We will also hold a meeting with head of
security at cash centres to gain insight into
their assessment of risks and events of fraud
in logistics process and branch network.

We will perform detailed substantive tests on
cash and bank reconciliations at year end.

We will perform detailed cash and bank cut
off testing at year end.

We will review the new contract between POL
and BOI to determine the accounting effects
on POL.

We will review management's accounting for
the sale of their investment in POFS and
treatment of cash proceeds and resulting
gain/(loss) on disposal.

We will review existing revenue deferral
under ‘old agreement’ for appropriateness
and any impact on current year financial
results.

We will review resulting disclosures in the
year-end consolidated financial statements.

POL's Control Processes

A key consideration in our audit planning process is the extent to which POL assesses risk and implements
controls in order to minimise risk.

We intend to continue to utilise a controls-based approach in respect of IT, which is discussed in detail on
pages 16 and 17.

We also intend to continue to utilise a controls based approach in respect of the identified significant
processes of revenue, purchasing, cash settlements and payroll. Our controls testing approach focuses on the
controls implemented across the entire POL business, including the London head office, Bolton (payroll) and
Chesterfield (shared services), branches and cash centres.

Weare also aware that the POL finance systems and control environment will continue to change in a post-
separation environment, as POL begins to undertake new accounting processes and activities that it had
hitherto not carried out, such as the consolidation of results at a POL level for statutory purposes and the
development of governance structure and accounting for treasury and pension facilities. We will consider if
any of these new separation related activities will have an impact on the control environment, modifying our
approach and conducting walkthroughs to understand the new environment where applicable.

Although our audit is not designed to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control, we are
required to communicate to you any significant deficiencies in internal control. We will also provide you a
detailed letter at the end of the audit incorporating certain recommendations for process improvements.

In adopting an efficient controls based approach we consider the controls built in to POL’s core IT applications, together with IT

IT Control Planning - Background

IT underpins a significant proportion of the Post Office's transactions. Our audit plan is designed around
reliance on certain IT applications and the use of electronic audit evidence. The following IT applications are in
scope for our POL audit: HNGX, POLSAP, SAPHR and SAP ESFS.

The IT audit process has historically, and continues to be, complex as a result of factors such as control
weaknesses in POL's IT environment, including the lack of oversight of service provider Fujitsu's control
environment. During the 2011-12 audit, the audit process improved as a result of remediating certain high
risk control weaknesses, the involvement of all parties (POL, Fujitsu and Ernst & Young) in planning activities
at an early stage of the financial year and the continued sponsorship of POL management and commitment
from Fujitsu.

2012-13 IT Audit Strategy - key considerations

> During this financial year, Fujitsu took steps to commission an ISAE 3402 report for 2012-13 on the
controls operated by Fujitsu over POL's business critical systems.

> In order to reduce our testing, we intend to place reliance on the report, with the extent of our reliance
being dependent on the opinion expressed in it.

> Inthe event that control exceptions are identified in the report, we will need to perform additional
procedures to address the risks.

» To support this approach, the POL, Fujitsu, Ernst & Young IT audit and Ernst & Young ISAE 3402 teams
have taken part in workshops to consider the control framework for POL based on the previous audit,
and the respective roles of the parties in providing an assessment on these controls for the 2012-13
financial year. During these workshops, key milestones and protocols have been agreed so that the
parties are kept up to date with the progress of the ISAE 3402 testing.

>» The remediation of prior year IT audit observations is also a key consideration in our planning for the IT
audit this year, as it impacts on the extent of our testing.
» From our discussions with POL, we understand that a process of formal risk acceptance has not yet
been undertaken for some of the risks relating to the findings identified by the previous audit.

» As we have previously highlighted, these areas will remain in scope for the upcoming IT audit and
therefore we will carry out additional procedures (substantive tests of the controls or tests of mitigating
controls) to gain comfort over the remaining risk relating to the financial statement audit.

» The remediation of open findings from last year's audit has been considered in the approach to the ISAE
3402 report as part of the workshops attended by POL, Fujitsu, Ernst & Young IT audit and Ernst &
Young ISAE 3402 teams.

2012-13 Audit Strategy - key considerations (cont'd)

> Other key considerations for the IT audit this year are POL's separation from Royal Mail Group and the
related IT transformation initiatives. We plan to work closely with POL to understand both the changes to
the organisation's risk landscape that these activities create, and the further development of POL's
governance and control frameworks. Of direct relevance to the 2012-13 audit are:

> The status of the transition plan and transitional services agreements with Royal Mail Group to maintain
and monitor the third party contractual obligations during the period of separation including ensuring
service levels are met

» How access to sensitive data, such as payroll information, is restricted during the transition period.

» Finally, a key consideration is the audit approach for two key systems that are operated by Royal Mail
Group and support POL's financially significant processes; to date these have been reviewed as part of the
Royal Mail Group IT audit. These systems are SAP ESFS, which supports the processing of branch returns,
fixed assets, purchasing and general ledger transactions, and SAP HR - HRP, which supports the payroll for
POL employees. The existing audit approach adopted for these two systems is based on the audit
efficiencies gained from assessing the controls managed by third party provider CSC, which are common
across Royal Mail Group's key financial systems. Whilst Royal Mail Group continues to provide these
services, we would anticipate requesting comfort over these systems from the Royal Mail Group audit
team. To the extent that POL migrates relevant data and applications to itself or implements new systems
to cover these requirements over time, they will fall within the scope of the POL IT audit.

We will continue to work together with POL to agree planning milestones and protocols at the early stage of
the financial year to continue to improve the audit process for the upcoming IT audit.

2012-13 Audit Strategy - looking forward

» Weintend to continue to place reliance on the ISAE 3402 report for future audits for the duration of POL's
current contract with Fujitsu. We anticipate that the extent of involvement of POL, Fujitsu, Ernst & Young
IT Audit and Ernst & Young ISAE3402 teams in planning for the audit will reduce over time as this process
matures.

> Our current understanding of the timescales for POL's IT separation and transformation is that whilst it will
have limited direct impact on our audit approach during 2012-13, it will potentially have a more significant
effect in 2013-14 and beyond as POL potentially implements new systems.

The following aspects of the transformation plan will become relevant to the audit at that stage, and we
plan to gain an insight into them during the 2012-13 audit so that we can highlight at an early stage any
potential concerns they raise for the organisation or risks to the audit approach:

> Plans and approaches to migrate or procure systems and software licences
» Plans for the segregation/separation of networks and email systems
» The planned supplier framework.

>» Wealso understand from management that as part of the separation plan between Royal Mail Group and
POL, there is a plan to migrate to a new core finance system for FY2014-15. With this in mind, we have
highlighted what we have learnt from our experience with IT programme risk management at Appendix C.

Materiality

For the purposes of determining whether the accounts are free from material error, we define materiality as
the magnitude of misstatement, which makes it probable that the judgement of a reasonable person, relying
on the accounts, would have been changed or influenced. Such misstatements can result from errors or
omissions and need to be considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances, both individually and in
aggregate. Our evaluation of it requires professional judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative
as well as quantitative considerations implicit in the definition.

We would be happy to discuss with you your expectations regarding our detection of misstatements in the
financial statements.

Consolidation considerations — Scope of audit procedures

This year will also see POL financial statements prepared for the first time at a consolidated level. When
performing audit procedures on consolidated financial statements, we are required to set audit scopes for
each reporting unit, based on size and risk factors, which when taken together, enable us to form an opinion
on the POL group accounts as a whole.

POL’s consolidation is expected to be made up of two reporting units; the Post Office Limited parent entity
(which contains the majority of transactions) and the POL joint venture First Rate Exchange Services (‘FRES')
which will also form part of the consolidated POL financial statements.

The vast majority of the audit work is carried out by the Ernst & Young team from London, except for the POL
joint venture First Rate Exchange Services (‘FRES') which is audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which will
also form part of the consolidated POL consolidated financial statements.

Given the relative contribution of FRES to POL consolidated operating profit (£E31.4m in 2011-12), we will
instruct PricewaterhouseCoopers to report the results of their audit to us, in line with our reporting timetable.
This was done by the Royal Mail Group team in previous years when results were directly consolidated at
Royal Mail Group level, and will be taken over by us during the current year.

Your POL audit team

The POL engagement team is led by Angus Grant from our London office, who as the Lead Engagement
Partner is ultimately responsible for all services provided to POL by Ernst & Young, the Post Office Limited
audit opinion and oversight of all other statutory and related work for POL.

Angus is supported by Jeremy Midkiff as Senior Manager and Darrell Martin as Manager. We have established
our engagement team with the principle of providing the right blend of industry, multinational and technical
experience to execute the audit and deliver on our commitments to you. This engagement team has been set
up to mirror your organisational structure. In addition, we recognise how important continuity of key Ernst &
Young team members is to your organisation.

Whilst our core team remains the same, the structure of our team has been carefully tailored to best mirror
your organisation in a post separation environment. Whilst until last year our audit team previously directly
reported to the Royal Mail Group team, during the current year, we will be directly accountable and the first
point of contact to the POL Audit & Risk Committee.

Specialists

As you are aware from experience in prior years, our audit strategy relies significantly on the leverage of IT
systems and controls. Denise Fabb (Executive IT Director) will continue to oversee delivery of the IT element
of the audit. In addition, we will also be looking to involve our Pension specialists at year end, as best suits the
auditing requirements at POL, this will be headed by Christopher Bown (Pensions Partner). Gillian Wild, who is
the tax audit partner for RMG, will also take responsibility for the audit of POL tax utilising her prior
experience in addressing the complexity of the POL tax structure, along with Julie Hadfield.

Half Year Review

A new chapter begins for the Post Office...

Introduction

Post Office Limited (‘POL’) will issue a half year trading statement in place of interim accounts for the half
year 2012/13. There is no formal requirement for Royal Mail Holdings to issue financial information for the
first half of the year, however, POL wish in their first year of separation from the Royal Mail Group to publisha
trading statement with selected disclosure information, as their pre-separation parent Royal Mail Group did in
prior years.

POL does not issue full IAS34 Interim financial statements and the trading statement is not in compliance with
IAS 34. We are therefore not required to, nor have we been engaged to perform a review under ISRE 2410,
the standard that covers interim reporting procedures.

Instead, at the request of management, we have accelerated certain elements of our 2012-13 year-end audit
work. This is intended to provide some level of comfort to Post Office Limited management and the Audit and
Risk Committee on the trading statement and the scope of work is broadly similar to those procedures we
would have performed on specific balances for a half year review. Management understands that these
procedures represent neither a half year review nor a full audit.

We also note that since management's trading statement will only disclose up to the point of the earnings
before interest, tax and exceptional costs, that our review will exclude these items.

We set out the full details of the Half Year procedures performed in the following pages.

Half Year Review (cont'd)

Half Year Review results

Review of primary statements numbers and support

» Perform analytical review for the current year
financial numbers included in the P&L (on profit
before interest, tax & exceptional items) and
Balance Sheet, which have been included in the
trading statement.

» Review financial numbers included in the trading
statement to ensure consistency with the financial
statements and our understanding of the
business.

Review of current material litigation & regulatory
fines, compensation and accruals.
> Review papers containing an update on (i) the
current material litigation and (ii) regulatory fines,
compensation and accruals.
> Hold a meeting with Susan Crichton to enquire of:
» Any changes in POL's legal position since our
last legal update, and to understand the status
of any legal/regulatory claims if applicable;
> Any issues with a potential material exposure
that have not been included in the above
papers.
> Review minutes to ensure completeness of legal
and regulatory accruals made by POL.

Review of GRNI Accrual

Review the GRNI accruals analysis and provide an
update on issues reported at the year end.

>

We performed an overall analytical review on both the Balance Sheet and
Profit & Loss account (on profit before interest, tax and exceptional items).

We noted that operating profit before exceptionals was £61.0m, up by 10% or
£5.5m on the same time last year. One of the main reasons for the increase
was better than expected performance of mails services, which benefited
from both a price increase and a volume increase in the month that preceded
the price rise.

We report one factual difference in relation to LTIPs, which was also reported
at year-end.

» This error is an overstatement of the LTIP Bonus accrual for the current
half year. The LTIP Bonus creditor was overstated by £1.9m as
management accrued for the full LTIP expense of the 2010/11 award and
2011/12 award by the end of the prior period. This is assessed by Ernst &
Young to be not in compliance with !AS19 which requires that the award
for such benefits be spread evenly over the lifetime of the bonus award
until vested/paid.

> The impact of unadjusted audit differences at 23 September 2012 would
be to increase profit before exceptionals by £1.4m.

» The unadjusted amounts are not material to the presentation and
disclosures in the trading statement for the period ended 23 September
2012.

Based on our discussions with management including financial controller, the
fluctuations and variances experienced during the period are consistent with
our understanding of the entity and of its financial position as of 23
September 2012. As a result of our procedures, we have not identified any
previously unidentified risks of material misstatement due to fraud.

The POL finance team provided us an update on all material provisions and
exceptional costs in the business incurred during the half-year. We noted that
no material provisions or exceptional costs were incurred or booked in relation
to litigation and regulatory fines.

We also made enquiries of Susan Crichton to gain an update of POL's litigation
and compliance with laws and regulations since year-end, with no issues
noted.

We also discussed the Horizon subpostmaster claim with Susan Crichton and
Sarah Hall, and noted that POL had contracted a firm of forensic accountants
to investigate the system in order to gain assurance over the integrity of the
system.

It was also noted that management had not made any reserve related to the
Horizon subpostmaster claim to date and have assessed they did not require
to make one. Based on our discussion with management, we agree that their
view appears to be reasonable. We will continue to revisit and gain updates
from management on the situation through the audit,

We also reviewed the minutes of Post Office Limited and noted there were no
other material litigation claims or regulatory claims that management should
consider providing for.

The GRNI accrual has increased by £6m (or 14%) to £49m at the end of the
half-year. This increase is mainly due to an increase in capital expenditure as a
result of the Network Transformation project increasing pace this period. We
also noted that 97% of GRNI balance is below six months old, compared to
‘99% of GRNI balance at the prior year end. We note that GRNI appears to be
fairly stated at the half year end,

Audit fees

A fair fee reflecting a changing business

Asummary of Ernst & Young's proposed fees for the 53-week period ending 31 March 2013 are set out
below.

The fees below have been discussed with management to understand our cost base and to continue to work
proactively with management to identify additional efficiencies.

Most notably, given the change to the business and the impact of separation, we have differentiated between
those costs which are considered to be ‘one-off’ and those which will form a part of our cost base going
forward. We have also considered the impact of the first-year SOCR/ISAE 3402 reporting.

It is important to note that the fee provided represents a ‘best case’ scenario, especially as it relates to the
result of the ISAE 3402 report. Given that this work is ongoing it is not possible to predict the level of, if any,
remediation work which will be required. In this respect, the following are the key assumptions underpinning
the IT cost element of the audit:

>» The cost assumes no significant exceptions require mitigation work. Any additional time required to
mitigate exceptions will be flagged and agreed in advance prior to carrying out the mitigating procedures.

» Whilst there are indications that last year’s IT issues are not fully remediated, we have not budgeted for
any remediation work until we are able to quantify the level of effort required.

» The budget has been prepared based on minimal project management time required to obtain required
information from Fujitsu. However, if we encounter difficulties similar to previous years, the project
management time currently anticipated will not be sufficient. Similarly, if additional mitigation work is
required, this will result in an increase in project management time.

The fee has been calculated on the assumption that the level of client assistance relative to the prior year is
consistent.

Insights on IT risk

Facilitating success in IT through program risk management

As discussed on page 18 of this report, we understand that POL may migrate to a new core finance system for
FY2014-15.

If and when POL plan to go through this process, consideration should be given in managing the risk
associated with such a major programme. We have seen that despite an increase in investment, some
organisations continue to fail to deliver on large IT programmes. They frequently go over budget, are
completed too late and/or do not deliver the expected benefits.

The following publication ‘Building Confidence in IT programs’ document outlines the principles of Program
Risk Management from our experience, including common IT programme pitfalls and the options of strategic
IT initiatives that teams can take. This is available at your request.

We also note that we have recently carried out an IT Risk Benchmarking survey with POL, which covers a
broader IT risk agenda. Once these results are available, we plan to discuss this with POL's IT management.
The result of the survey can help in forming a basis to track improvements of POL's IT risk management

Independence report

Introduction

In order to carry out our duties and responsibilities as auditor, we are required to consider our independence
and objectivity within the context of the regulatory and professional framework in which we operate.

UK APB Ethical Standards, International Standard on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 260, Communication of audit
matters to those charged with governance, and Rule 3526 Communication with Audit and Risk Committees
Concerning Independence of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) require us to
communicate on a timely basis and at least annually on all significant facts and matters that bear upon our
independence and objectivity since our last letter. The aim of these communications is to ensure full and fair
disclosure is made by us to you on matters in which you have an interest.

Relationships, services and related safeguards

We are not aware of any relationships between Ernst & Young and the Company that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence as of the date of this letter. As part of our considerations for any non-
audit engagement, we review potential threats in respect of self-interest, self-review, acting as management
and advocacy. We establish appropriate safeguards, which we communicate to the Audit and Risk Committee
in respect of any potential threat. Our next page details all the related services aside from the core audit for
POL.

Other required communications related to independence matters

The APB Ethical Standards require total fees you have paid us in the year ending 31 March 2013 to be
communicated to you. Details of all fees are provided to the Audit and Risk Committee with measurement
against pre-approved limits.

Listed on the following page are Ernst & Young's key firm-wide policies and processes to maintain
independence and objectivity which are required to be communicated to you by APB Ethical Standards.

Confirmations

We are not aware of any inconsistencies between the company’s policy for the supply of non-audit services
and APB Ethical Standards. We are not aware of any apparent breach of that policy.

We consider that our independence in this context is a matter that should be reviewed by both you and
ourselves. It is therefore important that you consider the facts of which you are aware and come to a view. We
look forward to discussing these matters with you at our upcoming meeting on 13 November 2012.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors, management, and others within the Company and should not be used for any other purpose.

Firmwide policies

Ernst & Young LLP (EY) has policies and procedures that instil professional values as part of firm culture and
ensure that the highest standards of objectivity, independence and integrity are maintained. Listed below are
some of the key policies and processes in place within Ernst & Young for maintaining objectivity and
independence:

Financial interests Our Partners and client facing (technical) staff are prohibited from investing in any audit client around the
World.

All partners and staff are required to confirm their compliance each year with the firm's independence
policies. Monitoring of compliance in respect of all partners and professional managers takes place through
a worldwide investment tracking system.

New starters are required to confirm their compliance with the firm's independence policies on
commencement of their employment.

Training All partners and professional staff are required to undergo regular mandatory training on our Independence
and Ethical policies and processes.

Partner rotation The firm has detailed policies on the rotation of the audit partner, and in the case of listed clients key audit
partners, the independent partner and ‘other partners and staff in senior positions’.

Consultation The firm requires consultation outside the audit team on complex accounting, auditing and ethical matters.
Major issues of principle arising on all audits are referred to a panel of independent experienced audit
partners.

Independent partner Before listed company audit opinions are issued, an audit partner independent of the audit team reviews the

reviews nature of the relationship with the client, aspects of the accounts that are subject to significant estimates

and judgements, and the adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts.

Quality reviews The firm operates a worldwide programme under the direction of senior partners that annually assesses the
quality of our work. Over a three year period, a proportion of the work of all audit partners is reviewed. The
results of the programme help us to evaluate the firm's quality controls and personnel performance and
identify areas for improvement.

As with other firms, Ernst & Young's audit practice is subject to annual review by the Audit Inspection Unit
(AIU) and the Quality Assurance Directorate (QAD) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales (ICAEW) for compliance with Audit Regulations. As part of its visits, the AIU/QAD evaluate the system
of quality contro! operated by the firm for its audit practice.

Business relationships Ernst & Young has implemented a centralised process for the review and pre-approval, by our quality and
risk management team, of all new business relationships. A submission must be made and approved for
each new business relationship before committing the firm.

In addition, all new business relationships must be notified and approved by the lead audit or client service
partner before committing the firm.

Ethics Our Global Code of Conduct provides an ethical framework on which we base our decisions and our actions~
as individuals and as members of our global organisation. Ernst & Young has also established the Ernst &
Young/Ethics hotline which will allow any person, inside or outside of Ernst & Young, to confidentially and
anonymously report an activity that they believe may involve conduct that is unethical, illegal, in breach of
professional standards, or is otherwise inconsistent with Ernst & Young's established policies and Code of
Conduct.

Non-audit services Our audit engagement partners must approve any non-audit services offered to their clients. This allows
them to:

» Ensure the objectives of the proposed engagement are not inconsistent with the objectives of the audit
of the financial statement;

» Identify and assess any related threats to our objectivity; and

» Assess the effectiveness of available safeguards to eliminate such threats or reduce them to an
acceptable level.

Where no satisfactory safeguards exist we do not carry out the non-audit service.

POST OFFICE LTD AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Governance for the Post Office - Bank of Ireland joint venture

1. Purpose

11 This paper provides an overview of the governance structures Post Office has
in place with the Bank of Ireland UK (plc) (Bol) following the conclusion of the
Eagle negotiations. It is tabled for noting.

2. Background

21 Prior to Eagle, the governance of the joint venture was managed through
Midasgrange, the jointly owned company established to build Post Office’s
financial services business.

2.2 The business model created too much complexity and did not deliver
sufficient income to Post Office; further, the Post Office became very
concerned at the financial position of Bol and the lack of termination rights.

2.3 The new joint venture agreement, which came into effect on 3° September
2012, created a bilateral relationship, supported by clear governance
structures, rights and obligations on both Parties and new termination rights to
Post Office. This paper sets out this governance framework.

3. Operational Governance

3.1 The governance of the relationship is formally managed through various
committees.

3.2 The overall relationship is managed through the Senior Executive Committee
(SEC), comprising the leading executives of each organisation’. The SEC
determines the strategic direction of the relationship and sets the wider
governance and operational requirements. It defines the strategy for the
relationship, approvers the annual business and sales plans and is
responsible for overall performance delivery. The SEC is quorate with two
representatives from each Party and voting (if required) is based on equal
votes aligned to the lower number of representatives. The Chair, which
rotates annually, does not have a deciding vote — the initial Chair is Bol.
Disputed matters within the wider relationship are escalated to the SEC; if
resolution is not achieved, the matter is escalated to the Chief Executive
Officers of both organisations.

3.3. There are five additional committees that manage day-to-day matters, viz:
a) Product & Pricing Forum (PPF);
b) Sales & Marketing Forum (SMF);
c) Service, Performance Management & IT Forum (SPMITF);
d) Joint Insurance Committee (JIC);
e) Regulatory Risk Committee (RRC).

Bol’s current representatives are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer and Directors of Distribution and
Product. Post Office’s representatives are the Chief Finance Officer and the Directors of Strategy, Financial Services
and Sales & Distribution.

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

3.4 The PPF defines and reviews the overall product propositions, including
confirming features, channel mix and competitive pricing (versus the
benchmark). It assesses recommendations from either Party and if
appropriate approves changes. As with the SEC, both Parties have equal
voting rights; Bol is the permanent Chair of the PPF:

« Bol has the ultimate control over pricing but has to meet agreed
benchmarks and pricing to achieve the agreed plans.

3.5 The SMF agrees the sales and marketing plans (including the allocation of the
£15 million annual marketing budget funded by Bol) and monitors their
effectiveness. It reviews sales literature, internal and external PR and
communications, sales training and sales compliance, in conjunction with the
PPF. Both parties have equal voting rights and the Post Office is the
permanent Chair:

¢ Post Office has the final say on the allocation of the marketing fund, with
the Parties having agreed the general allocation by category sector.

3.6 The SPMITF oversees the systems and contact centre service levels and
change management processes and performance. It has equal representation
from each party with a rotating Chair.

3.7 The JIC provides the governance and oversight for the Insurance business,
approving the strategy, plans and budget. It also gives direction to Bol’s
Insurance Product Team, giving Post Office greater com fort that the business
is meeting its requirements. The Chair rotates annually, with Post Office
initially holding the position’.

3.8 The RRC oversees and monitors the compliance to the standards for for the
production and distribution of products, minimising the reputational and
regulatory risks for Post Office and Bol. It is permanently chaired by Bol with
Bol’s Chief Risk Officer and Post Office’s Legal & Compliance Director
attending quarterly. The minutes of this meeting are tabled at the Bol Board
and are made available to the Financial Services Authority (FSA)’.

3.9 The new governance structures set out above are operational with all
committees formally constituted.

4. Operational Processes and Responsibilities

44 While the governance structure establishes the decision making processes,
the contract also sets out the roles and responsibilities of each Party, viz:

e The Parties will jointly agree the business strategy and set the direction of
the business.

e Bol will manufacture the products to specifications agreed with the Post
Office and supply the RGM, provide on-going product servicing (e.g.,
sending statements, paying interest) and establish the regulatory
requirements for product marketing and sales.

e The Post Office will deploy an effective sales network, create and deliver
the marketing and sales strategies as agreed by the SMF and ensure that

As previously discussed at the Board from September 2014 Post Office has a two year one-way option to

buy out Bol’s share of the insurance business.

5 This is a continuation of the pre-existing arrangements.

all products and services (including all customer interactions) meet the
Post Office’s brand and the Regulatory Guidance Manual (RGM)‘.

To ensure that the customer proposition remains competitive the contract
requires that:

¢ All products will be reviewed on a two-year rolling basis to ensure that
they remain competitive;

e Product pricing meets agreed benchmarks.

While either party can propose new/changes to products and services Bol
must deliver products (itself or through a third party) that Post Office
reasonably requests and that align to the business plan.

Bol can only refuse to deliver a product requested by Post Office if:
e It is prohibited by regulation;
¢ It is uneconomical for it to do so;

e It is technically incapable of providing the product.

If both parties agree to develop a product but cannot agree on the aspects of
the product (e.g., features and commissions) a formal dispute process occurs.
If it remains unresolved an Independent Expert (IE) is appointed. The IE’s
recommendations are non-binding, but if Bol does not agree with them and
Post Office does, Bol is obliged to use reasonable endeavours to deliver the
product to the IE’s proposed recommendation. If it cannot, the Post Office can
identify a 30 party for Bol to enter into an agreement to manufacture the
product. If this is not possible exclusivity falls away.

5. Bol Financial Stability

5.1 The final component of Eagle governance relates to Post Office’s termination
rights and the information that Bol must provide to support these rights.

5.2 As previously presented to the Board, Post Office has a termination right if:

e Bol’s minimum core tier one capital ratio falls below the threshold? °;

¢ Bol fails to maintain liquid assets required by the regulator;

e Bol breaches the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) (to the extent that
these rules apply to Bol when they become operational from 2018); or

¢ Bol, or its parent, becomes insolvent.

5.3 To support these rights, Bol must inform Post Office immediately of any
threshold breach; failure to do so is in itself a breach of the contract.

5.4 To provide the Post Office with some notice of the potential that Bol may
breach a termination benchmark, Bol must provide Post Office with regular
updates of its financial position, including:

4 The RGM sets out the actions and duties that Post Office must perform for each product to meet its
regulatory obligations as a financial services intermediary.

5 Bol has certain grace period to remediate the situation as previously tabled to the Board.

° The definition of core tier one ratio is article 87(1)(a) of the draft European Regulation plus 3.5 percent
until 2016. A new formula will be agreed in 2016.

ARC - Eagle Governance Nicholas Kennett Page of 5

POL00158012

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

¢ Formal update on its capital and liquidity status and immediate notice if it
becomes aware of any capital or liquidity issues that might give rise to a
termination event.

e 15 days after each public announcement of annual and half yearly results
and any interim management statement Bol must provide a certificate
stating’:

a) Its Minimum Core Tier One Ratio, the actual Core Tier One Ratio
and any Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital buffers or other
requirements applicable to Bol;

b) _Bol’s regulatory liquidity requirement and its position against the
benchmark;

c) Any NSFR requirement and Bol’s position;

d) That Bol is not in breach of the termination obligations, or of any
remediation plan agreed with the regulator.

e After each half year financial announcement a senior Bol executives must
provide a trading performance update.

e Bol must provide a presentation of its annual results, including a summary
of any Recovery and Resolution Plan (RRP)® submitted to the regulator
and summaries of any ARROW’ Letters received from the FSA as far as
they relate to the Post Office or Bol’s obligations to the Post Office.

6. Bol Compliance on Post Office

6.1 Post Office acts as the intermediary for Bol and is its “appointed
representative”. As such, Bol is accountable to its regulator’? to ensure that
Post Office is acting compliantly:

e The Compliance teams in both Parties monitor Post Office’s performance
to the RGM and the financial promotions rules set by the FSA. Bol assess
Post Office’s compliance through mystery shopping and other monitoring
(e.g., complaints reporting). It supports the product, marketing and sales
teams ensuring that both Bol and Post Office are meeting the applicable
Treating Customer Fairly standards. This is a continuation of the
established procedures.

6.2 Compliance performance and regulatory issues are reviewed by the joint
Regulatory Risk Committee.

7. Initial Issues

7 The governance processes with Bol are now operational and have already
thrown up issues that previously would have not been shared:

7.2 Savings pricing

The first presentation of these matters is due to Post Office in February 2013, following the presentation
of Bol’s 2012 full year results.

RRPs are FSA-required plans setting an institution’s plan for a stressed situation including orderly wind-
down.

Advanced Risk Response Operating Framework reviews are the existing FSA process to assess and
manage risk. With the establishment of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation
Authority the approach is changing with increased focus on prevention rather than post-event resolution.

¢ Following recent significant drops in both wholesale and retail liability
(deposit) pricing, Post Office’s deposits have grown substantially ahead of
plan, reaching almost £18 billion against a 2012/13 plan of £16.6 billion.
This is not only a material cost to Bol but also risks regulatory intervention
if Bol is perceived to be securing a disproportionately large market share.
As a result, over three “emergency” Product & Pricing Committee
meetings Bol and Post Office are working together to agree a sustainable
pricing position, consistent with Post Office’s brand and competitive
position, the benchmarks and Bol’s balance sheet requirements.

7.3. Securitisation

¢ Securitising assets is a standard process for banks. The Agreement
requires that Bol seeks Post Office’s consent to securitise any Post
Office’s customers’ assets. This is to protect customers and ensure that
Post Office is able to enforce the termination rights.

e Bol has requested Post Office consent to a series of “test” repo
transactions, which includes some Post Office assets. This would not
have occurred under the previous arrangements. Post Office has given
consent for one year, provided that the counterparty is rated by Standard
& Poors as a minimum of A- and that each tranche does not exceed £250
million.

8. Conclusion
8.1 The new arrangements are in place and operational, giving Post Office
greater insight, certainty and control over the operations and direction of the

joint venture.

8.2 The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee is asked to note the paper.

POST OFFICE LTD AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE
Approval of uncommitted loan facilities
1 Purpose

This paper seeks Committee endorsement to proceed to the Board with the following
recommendations:

e To approve entry into two uncommitted credit facilities of up to £50m each.

e To delegate authority to the CFO and Head of Corporate Finance to negotiate
and sign all related loan facility documentation.

e To approve a Board resolution in the form required by counterparties with
whom a loan facility may be agreed.

2 Introduction

At the October board meeting questions were raised regarding the counterparties that
provide operational financial and treasury banking services to Post Office Limited many
of which were inherited from Royal Mail. As a result, a review will be undertaken to
determine a strategic approach to the selection of financial counterparties. The outcome
of this review will be presented at the next Committee meeting in February for onward
ratification by the Board.

In the short term, to reduce external interest costs and improve operational efficiency
approval is requested to enter into two uncommitted credit facilities. The anticipated
interest saving resulting from this is approx. £200,000 pa as it reduces the funds that
need to be held on deposit as a contingency for unexpected working capital movements.

The banks were selected on their strength of their relationship with Post Office — though
currently no other banks have offered to provide any facility.

3 Funding Background

Under the funding agreement signed with BIS (Department of Business, Innovation and
Skills) Post Office Limited can borrow externally up to £50m, in addition to the £1.15bn
working capital loan facility from BIS. The drawdown of funds from the BIS facility
requires two days’ notice which could potentially generate a short term funding
requirement.

4 Rationale

Corporate Finance seeks approval to enter into two external facilities. These facilities
would enable the daily drawdown of funds from BIS to be managed more effectively. It
is anticipated that drawdown on these facilities will be infrequent but will provide the
flexibility to drawdown overnight to manage any shortfalls in daily cash flows. This
arrangement would replicate those previously in place with Royal Mail.

5 Operation of Facilities

Two facilities are recommended to ensure cost efficiency, flexibility, ease of access and
mitigate the financial risk of one facility being unavailable. Controls will be implemented
within Finance to ensure that the total drawdown on the two accounts does not exceed
£50m and that Post Office continues to operate within the terms of the BIS agreement.
Borrowing is limited to a term of 7 days.

6 Counterparties and negotiation

The Head of Corporate Finance is currently negotiating with two financial institutions;
RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland), a current Post Office banking partner, and Citibank, to
secure external facilities of up to £50m each. These counterparties were selected as
current Royal Mail service providers. If negotiations are not successful with these
counterparties, other counterparties will be considered. Approval is requested for the
CFO and Head of Corporate Finance to enter into negotiations with these or other
counterparties and to sign all relevant loan documentation.

7 Facility & Interest Costs

There are no arrangement or commitment fees associated with these facilities. The only
cost is the interest charge on drawn funds. The interest cost is likely to be in the region
of LIBOR + 50 to 200 basis points. It is anticipated that these facilities will be drawn
infrequently when there is a large unexpected working capital movement e.g. bad
weather reducing the amount of physical receipts over the counter.

8 Recommendation
The Committee is asked to endorse the following recommendation to the Board:

The Board is asked to:

8.1 Confirm its approval for Post Office to enter into external borrowing
facilities up to a maximum value of £100m, such that external borrowing
of up to £50m may be drawn down at any one time.

8.2 Confirm its approval for the CFO (Chris Day) and Head of Corporate
Finance (Charles Colquhoun) to conduct negotiations with counterparties
and sign and deliver the loan and related documentation.

8.3 Confirm its approval of the attached form of Board resolution required by
the Royal Bank of Scotland or any similar resolution required by Citibank
or another counterparty with whom a borrowing facility may be agreed by
the CFO and Head of Corporate Finance.
