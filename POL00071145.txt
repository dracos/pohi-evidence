Subject: Post Office -v- Castleton: disclosure

Attachments: LETTER_1177178.DOC; DOC_1176817.XLS

Dear Mandy,

1. Following helpful feedback from Vicky and Cath, I attach the reply which I will send to
Castleton's solicitors today, dealing with their disclosure requests, unless you have any
objections.

2. Iam concerned that they have still failed to deliver us their documents. I have chased them
repeatedly. We need them to help clarify the issues we need to deal with in witness
statements. My advice is that unless we get them very shortly, we should issue an application
to Court to compel them to do so. Do you agree?

3. Vicky - please could you update me on the P242 point?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
