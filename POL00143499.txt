Simon

As this message will most probably find its way into the media, we do need to get the message across form the start that
we continue to have full confidence in the robustness of the Horizon system and then reinforce it so I suggest the
following tweaking to the proposed wording from Jarnail:

After a number of meetings between Post Office Management and Members of Parliament in relation to the Court cases, it
was agreed that the Post Office would undertake an external review of the cases which had been raised by the Member's
constituents. As the Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system
and its branch accounting processes, it had no hesitation in agreeing to an external review of these few individual cases.

In order to provide assurance to the interested parties, it was proposed that the review be undertaken by independent
Auditors, 2 Sight. The review will be specifically restricted to the cases raised by the MPs as well as reviewing the
accounting procedures, processes and reconciliations undertaken in relation to the cases in question. Before formal
instructions are given to the Independent Auditors, agreements will be sought from all interested parties, namely the
Members of Parliament and Justice For Sub Postmasters. The Sub Postmasters have requested a Forensic Accountant
of their choice be appointed to oversee the Cases being reviewed by 2nd Sight.

All the above is accepted based on the terms of the Review being carried out, but this is in no way an acknowledgment by
the Post Office that there is an issue with Horizon. Over the past ten years, many millions of branch reconciliations have
been carried out with transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different subpostmasters and
the Horizon system continues to work properly in post offices across the length and breadth of the UK. When the system
has been challenged in criminal courts, it has been successfully defended.

Any questions, then do please let me know

Regards

Ronan

Alana

Please can help us craft our message around the Second Sight review. We need to combat the assertion that the review
is acknowledgement that there is a problem with Horizon.

Jarnail has drafted some words below. Do they strike the right tone?

All the above is accepted based on the terms of the Review being carried out, but it must be stressed that this is not an
acknowledgment by The Post Office LTD that there is an issue with Horizon. The Horizon system is working properly,
robust and is being used up and down the country, when the system has been challenged in criminal courts, it has been
successfully defended
