Lets run with the statement as it is. If the defence do want details of
the

107 calls then a further statement will be needed at a later stage.
Maybe you could add in your statement that the total calls only work
out at 3 -

4 a month over the time period and this is not a high amount for a PO.

John

“Subject” ~~” RE! WS for West Byfleet HSH calls
John,

107 calls may seem a lot but that only equates to approximately 3-4
calls a month over the time frame. To add the information you want is
going to take 1 to 2 days of uninterrupted work to complete. So to get
it completed by the 26th June is not impossible it would be cutting it
fine as we had not factored this in to the time scales of the original
request.

If you need the extra detail I will enquire about when we can get this
to you..

The statement is fine but the mention of 107 calls will no doubt
interest the defence barrister. If possible could you include in the
statement a breakdown of the calls to cover time/date/nature of call.
If we don't include it now the defence will only request this
information later.

Andy,

Statement looks fine to me, though I've copied Jon Longman (Officer In Case) for his info. My only

query would be that the log of 107 calls may need to be produced as evidence or be disclosed as
unused material. If produced as evidence then it could be incorporated in your statement now or

produced in a ‘further to’ statement later. I'll let John comment on this though, as the court may be

happy as it is.

John,
Can you give Andy the green light and/or comment on my thoughts above.
