9 Appendix A

This Appendix is divided into THREE sections:

e Section 1 reports those CCNs in the range I to 485 inclusive that were listed within
Addendum B of JCL Pathway Core System Release Plus, PA/STR/013, Version 1.0,
2/7/99 (the RCD) and that were:

© To be applied at or after CSR+
© Candidates to be applied at or after CSR+

Columns I to 5 inclusive, including the shading in column 3 applicable to
then unapproved items, are copied from the RCD. The Resolution/Status
Column records the current status and includes the SADD head reference.

e Section 2 reports those Future Changes Required to the SADD that were listed within
Addendum C of the RCD and that were not associated with the Benefit Payment Service.

Columns I to 6 inclusive are copied from the RCD. The Resolution/Status
Column records the current status.

e Section 3 reports those CCNs in the range 486 to the present that are comprehended
within CSR+. As yet unapproved CCNs are not comprehended in CSR+. Columns I to 4
are based on the corresponding columns and rows from SADD 5.4. Rows that are shaded
in columns I to 4 denote CCNs that are not comprehended in the functionality of CSR+
either because they are Rejected, Withdrawn, or Approved but having no effect on
functionality. In addition some rows that are generally towards the end of the table are
shaded because the CCN is not yet Approved. Where the resolution column states
“CSR+ dependency” the CCN needs to be Approved in a timely manner to facilitate the
orderly release of CSR+. Where the resolution column states “Required at CSR+” the
CCN, when Approved, will be applied to CSR+ only during its lifetime.
