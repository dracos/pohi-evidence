4.3.1

Horizon System Helpdesk service hours

The service hours of the Horizon System Helpdesk are:
Full Service 0800 - 2000 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0500 - 0800 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 2000 - 2400 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0700 - 2200 Sunday

Arrangements for Bank Holidays shall only vary from a normal POCL working
day where agreed with POCL, having regard to the applicability throughout
the United Kingdom. No POCL helpdesk service shall be provided on
Christmas day.

The full range of helpdesk services are provided during the POCL core day.
During these hours of operation, all calls will be handled by ICL Pathway
operators with the telephone equipment relaying messages to callers in
exceptional circumstances.

The skeleton service is provided outside of the POCL core day. The skeleton
service will respond to calls concerning operational incidents that are non-
outlet-related. Calls that are outlet-related will be logged. Advice and
guidance calls will be responded to within the skeleton service, but not
necessarily according to the Service Levels that are applicable to the normal
service. Other outlet-related calls will be dealt with at the beginning of the
next POCL core day.

The helpdesk is available to take and record calls outside the hours shown
above, but diagnosis and action on those calls will not occur until the next
defined period of cover.

Contacting the Horizon System Helpdesk

Call validation

The Horizon System Helpdesk is available to receive calls from any of its
authorised sources and will take calls that are described in the Horizon
System Helpdesk Call Enquiry Matrix.

All callers to the Horizon Helpdesk will be subject to initial validation, callers
failing validation will not gain access to the Horizon System Helpdesk and the
call will be recorded as inappropriate.

Outlet staff

erifies the identity of outlet staff by asking questions
lbased on the post office FAD code, post office address,
Iname and telephone number.

POCL non-outlet
staff

IPOCL non-outlet staff are normally filtered through the
IPOCL NBSC helpdesk. The NBSC helpdesk will
register a call with the Horizon System Helpdesk on
behalf of non-outlet staff.

(Circumstances surrounding when these callers request
la call to be logged on the Horizon System Helpdesk
lare described in Section 4.3.5.1 POCL.

POCL NBSC
Helplines

lIn cases of emergency closure POCL NBSC Helpline
staff are required to contact the Horizon System
[Helpdesk on behalf of an outlet. They are pre-
lauthorised by ICL Pathway Service Management to
contact the Horizon System Helpdesk. These groups
jare provided with a PATH code that is used to validate
ithe caller; further information such as name and
‘elephone number is also requested by Horizon System
Helpdesk staff to validate callers.

(Circumstances surrounding when these callers contact
ithe Horizon System Helpdesk are described in Section
4.3.5.2 Third party callers.

Password requests

Callers requesting the issue of one-shot passwords
must contact the NBSC helpdesk for verification

They will then be issued with a reference number and
lasked to contact the Horizon System Helpdesk. This

process is described more fully in Section 4.3.3 One-
\shot password access.

Callers contacting the Horizon System Helpdesk
ithout verification will be refused access to the one-
ishot password service.

ICL Pathway
Suppliers

These groups are provided with a PATH code and will
lbe subject to the same verification procedures as
IPOCL non-outlet staff.

(Circumstances surrounding when these callers contact
ithe Horizon System Helpdesk are described in Section
4.3.5.3 ICL Pathway.

Before calling the helpdesk, the caller should gather as much information as
possible to enable the helpdesk operator to swiftly diagnose the nature of the

problem.

4.3.2

4.3.3

4.3.4

Call logging

The operator will attempt to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone call. The information will be recorded as an incident onto a
helpdesk system and allocated a unique call reference number.

At the end of the call the operator will inform the caller of the call identity
number and what action to expect next. This identity number should be
recorded by the caller and quoted if the caller needs to ring the helpdesk
about this incident.

If the caller's query/problem is not resolved within the initial telephone call,
the helpdesk will advise the caller the date/time by which they will next
receive contact. (This contact will take the form of either a site visit by an
engineer or a telephone call from someone in the ICL Pathway support
chain.)

One-shot password access
There are two types of requirement for one-shot password access:

e Planned, i.e. from POCL Auditors in the case of an Audit visit, or Retail
Network Managers in the case of a planned outlet closure.

e Unplanned, i.e. when an outlet manager forgets his password or becomes
locked out of the system by repeated incorrect entry of his password.

The one-shot password is issued by the Horizon System Helpdesk once the
caller has been verified by the NBSC (Network Business Support Centre).

The caller requiring one-shot password access will call the NBSC and obtain
verificatiion and a unique reference number. The caller will then call the
Horizon System Helpdesk quoting this unique reference number and will be
asked to perform the one-shot password procedure sequence following
instructions from the Horizon System Helpdesk. This will allow access to the
system.

The one-shot is valid only for one session. When the caller logs out the one-
shot password can no longer be used. Where the caller has forgotten the

password it is a priority for him/her to set up a new password for normal use,
using the procedures described in the NR2 ACUA PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0025].

The system requires the one-shot procedure sequence to be completed
within five minutes of being started.

Non-outlet callers to the Horizon System Helpdesk

The Horizon System Helpdesk is available to take incident calls from sources
other than POCL outlets. These sources are NBSC (Network Business
Support Centre) for POCL operational calls and from within ICL Pathway.

These non-outlet callers will be pre-authorised by the allocation of a dummy
FAD code (PATH code). This PATH code is allocated by ICL Pathway who
will agree the incident types available to be registered via this route.

Non-outlet call sources

4.3.5.1 POCL

POCL incidents affecting the EPOSS, APS or reference data services that
arise in the POCL environment will also be reported to the Horizon System
Helpdesk via the NBSC in accordance to agreed procedures.

4.3.5.2 Third party callers

Third party callers call the Horizon System Helpdesk on behalf of an outlet. In
the event of an unplanned post office closure, the affected post office will
contact the POCL NBSC Helpdesk and inform them. The POCL NBSC will
then contact the Horizon System Helpdesk on behalf of the affected post
office to register an incident. The POCL NBSC Helpdesk operator will need to
quote the post office FAD code, their name and telephone number and the
nature of the problem (see the NR2 Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0024]. Additionally, NBSC Helpdesk staff will undergo the caller
authentication process which requires them to provide a pre-agreed pass
code before the Horizon System Helpdesk will activate an emergency
closure.

4.3.5.3 ICL Pathway

4.3.6

Incidents arising from within the ICL Pathway operation will result in a call to
the Horizon System Helpdesk. Callers from within the ICL Pathway operation
will also have to pass the same verification procedure as an outlet by
providing a dummy FAD code or PATH code and name to access the
helpdesk.

Call escalation

Call escalation can be interpreted in three separate ways:

e An incident passed through the support chain for resolution.

e SLA targets in jeopardy.

e Acustomer unhappy with the service.

4.3.6.1 Incident passed through the support chain

Once an incident is registered onto the Horizon System Helpdesk incident
management system, it is likely to be passed along the support chain to
different support groups who are responsible for different areas of the system,
e.g. Networks. The Horizon System Helpdesk staff have visibility of all
incidents and will track progress of the call throughout its life.

4.3.6.2 SLA targets in jeopardy

Should the SLA targets of a particular incident approach or pass minimum
SLA levels, the Horizon System Helpdesk staff will begin to escalate visibility
of this situation, using a manual escalation process to ensure timely

This escalation procedure may utilise a problem manager at a predetermined
point. The problem manager will be responsible for ensuring that the correct
management and resources are in place to resolve the problem and restore
the service levels. The problem manager will be supported by an agreed
cross-boundary escalation process that covers the Post Office Counters Ltd
and ICL Pathway organisations, should disputes of ownership and
responsibility arise.

4.3.6.3 Customer unhappy with service

4.3.7

4.3.8

The caller's view of escalation will arise should the caller be unhappy with the
service provided or disagree with the progress or actions taken to resolve a
particular incident. The caller will contact the Horizon System Helpdesk to
register his or her dissatisfaction. The Horizon System Helpdesk telephone
operator will log a complaint incident and then pass the caller onto a
supervisor. The supervisor will attempt to correct the situation. If the situation
cannot be corrected by the supervisor, the call will be terminated and the
caller will then be contacted by an ICL Pathway manager within two hours.

All complaint calls will be brought to the attention of ICL Pathway Service
Management and are available to the Service Management Forum if
requested.

Inappropriate calls

The Horizon System Helpdesk may be mistakenly contacted by persons not
authorised to use the Helpdesk. These callers will be unable to pass
verification and will be refused access, an incident call will be recorded on
the Horizon System Helpdesk incident management system as described in
the Horizon System Help Desk Call Enquiry Matrix.

Should the caller be authorised to contact the Horizon System Helpdesk and
pass verification the helpdesk operator will establish the nature of the caller
and if the issue is outside of the responsibility of the Horizon System
Helpdesk the caller will, where applicable, be re-directed to the correct
helpdesk. An incident will be recorded on the Horizon System Helpdesk
incident management system as described in the Horizon System Helpdesk
call enquiry matrix.

Callers requiring re-direction to another helpdesk will be supplied with the
phone number of the appropriate desk, if known.

Call redirecting

If the Horizon System Helpdesk receives a call that is not appropriate to the
Horizon System Helpdesk, where possible the helpdesk operator will advise
the caller to ring the appropriate number. Where applicable the helpdesk
operator will supply the phone number of the appropriate desk.

4.3.9 Contingency

5.1

In conventional circumstances the helpdesk service is provided from one site
with a second site being used to deal with overspill at peak times. These sites
are geographically separated, but linked by common computer and telephony
systems. Should the first site become unable to operate, the second site will
take over.

Depending on the nature and extent of the problem, there may be a period of
around two hours during which only a reduced service will be possible.

PO outlet incidents

This section gives descriptions of the calls that may be received by the
Horizon System Helpdesk from PO outlet staff.

PO hardware incidents

The calls that may be received from PO outlet staff about hardware incidents
are as follows:

Call ref Description

POHCO01_ Hardware incidents may be logged by the outlet manager or

to outlet staff if a problem arises in using the equipment installed
POHC12 at the outlet.

and ge an .
POHC15 Should such a situation occur, the caller will ring the Horizon

System Helpdesk to gain access to suitable support. The caller
will be required to make a note of the activity being performed
when the problem arose, before the helpdesk is called.

In the event of a outlet PC system failure or a peripheral failure,
the Horizon System Helpdesk will allocate an engineer to attend
the post office. The caller will be told when the engineer is
expected to arrive.

The engineer will normally carry spare parts with him; however
occasionally spare parts may need to be couriered to the post
office. In this instance the engineer will arrive shortly after the
spare part has been delivered. The post office will be informed
in advance to expect a spare part to be delivered. Once at the
post office the engineer will replace the faulty part, test its
operation and then check that the outlet manager is happy that
the system is now operational. The engineer will remove any
broken equipment when he leaves.

For more details see the NR2 Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0024].

contact the Horizon System Helpdesk who will deal with the call
in the same way as a hardware incident. If equipment is
damaged the engineer will complete a report on the
circumstances surrounding the damage which will be agreed
and signed by the outlet manager.

PO software incidents

The calls that may be received from PO outlet staff about software incidents
are as follows:

Call ref Description

POSCO1__ Software problems can arise in the form of an error message
to displayed on the screen or during the use of the system when
POSCO05 something fails to work as expected. Outlet staff should record

any messages appearing on the screen or details of what
activity was being undertaken at the time of the problem and
advise the helpdesk operator of these messages and actions.
Details of the incident will be captured by the Horizon System
Helpdesk operators who will determine the nature of the
problem, allocate a call identification number and inform the
caller of the next expected action. If the problem has occurred
before and has been previously resolved, the operator will issue
instructions to the caller to perform an authorised temporary
procedure or alternatively the helpdesk operator may attempt to
resolve the problem by repeating the process on the Horizon
System Helpdesk reference system.

If the problem requires a more technical solution the incident
will be passed into the ICL Pathway support organisation. The
incident will then be investigated and an authorised temporary
procedure or resolution may be applied. The support
technicians may contact the caller to understand the incident
circumstance more fully or to gather more evidence to assist the
investigation. If an outlet is contacted by a support technician,
the support technician will quote the call reference number.

The network is monitored centrally and any fault will most likely
be resolved before it becomes visible to the post office.
However should the post office encounter networking difficulties
the Horizon System Helpdesk should be contacted. These are
likely to show themselves as messages saying that the central
system cannot be contacted. If this occurs contact the Horizon
System Helpdesk who will take details of the network fault. The
fault will be investigated and corrected by support staff who will
inform the outlet manager when the network link has been
restored. If the fault necessitates a visit to the outlet by a BT
engineer the outlet staff will be informed in advance of the
engineer arriving.

PO operation incidents

The calls that may be received from PO outlet staff about operation incidents
are as follows:

Call ref Description

POOPO1 Should the post office outlet staff encounter operational

to difficulties whilst using the system or the equipment and the
POOP08 system is not performing as described in the counter

procedures, the Horizon System Helpdesk should be contacted.
The Horizon System Helpdesk will determine the nature of the
fault, the service affected, such as EPOSS, other service or
services involved and the function that is failing, such as report
printing. An incident will be recorded and passed onto ICL
Pathway support for investigation. The caller will be told what to
expect next and when they will be next contacted. Where a fault
in the services is established, it will be passed to ICL Pathway
Software Support for further action.

The Horizon System Helpdesk will not be able to offer advice or
report faults on Post Office procedures that do not relate to the
Horizon computer systems, equipment or operation only.

Description

SECO001

Post offices that have equipment stolen must follow existing
Post Office Counters Ltd procedures to report the theft (e.g.
contact the Police and Post Office Counters Ltd NBSC
Helpdesk). ICL Pathway will replace the stolen equipment once
the incident has been reported to the Horizon System Helpdesk
by the NBSC Helpdesk. Should the counter or the ICL Pathway
wiring be undamaged, ICL Pathway will arrange for the counter
system to be installed quickly to bring the post office back into
operation. However work may have to be scheduled to correct
any physical damage: this will be arranged at a suitable time
and agreed with the outlet manager. In some cases this may
result in a short-term closure.

SEC002

Each time a PC is powered on, the Post Office Log On (POLO)
procedure must be performed. The outlet manager is issued
with a PMMC card plus a spare and PIN when the equipment is
installed. This card and PIN must be kept in separate secure
locations and used when the equipment is powered on after
being switched off as described in the NR2 Access Control and
User Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0025].

If the card or PIN is lost, the Horizon System Helpdesk must be
contacted. The helpdesk operator will ask a series of questions
to verify the identity of the caller and then pass the caller on toa
supervisor. The supervisor will then assist the outlet manager to
generate a new PIN or allocate a PIN to the spare card. This
process involves the caller following verbal instructions from the
Horizon System Helpdesk Supervisor. In extreme cases, where
the system cannot generate the PIN number easily, the caller
will be taken through the underlying recovery process that
involves typing a series of letters and numbers into the Horizon
system and takes approximately twenty minutes to complete.

The new PIN must be stored securely as instructed in the NR2
Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0025]. In the case of a lost card, this procedure
invalidates the lost card and a replacement card is ordered for
issue to the post office to use as a spare.

If both cards are lost, stolen or damaged, then the system will
be declared down and an engineer dispatched to replace the
cards and bring the system back into operation. The outlet
manager when completing the Site Visit Reply Card, will declare
whether the cards were lost, stolen or damaged and will
surrender any damaged cards to the engineer.

SEC003

Passwords within an office are controlled by the manager and if
a member of staff forgets their password the manager can reset
it. If the manager forgets their password they should contact
their Regional Network Manager; an emergency password can
then be issued by the Horizon System Helpdesk using the One
Shot Password service (OSP) to allow them to reset their own
password. Audit staff will also need access to the system and
require use of the OSP service to gain access. Each person
authorised to use this service will be pre-registered and will
have to undergo a verification procedure before access to the
OSP service is permitted.

Once verified the caller will have to enter the OSP service on
the counter system and will be issued with a password which is
valid for only one session and cannot be used again. (Further
information on system access using one-shot passwords is
given in the NR2 Access Control and User Administration PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/0025].)

suspects a security breach, for example, passwords have
become known to an unauthorised person, the Horizon system
