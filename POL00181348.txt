update - mps cases

Had a conversation with Ron today. Quick summary of the conversation.

Vw Pwnr

»

8.

No new cases have been added to scope — we are still at 12.

No news from the JFSA

No evidence has surfaced that indicates there is a problem with Horizon

Initial CD of scanned documents (four cases only) sent to Second Sight.

We owe Second Sight a large amount of documentation. Chris Bhandari will be working with
Rod/Angela/Legal to compile and scan this.

Second Sight had a “very productive” meeting with Angela last week and feel that she and her team will be
an important source of information going forward

Ron feels that there are some cases that Angela has recently looked at that would be helpful to include in
scope to give a complete picture. However Ron is not sure of the process for doing this as the scope should be
defined by MPs and JFSA, but he has some suggestions.

We are looking at getting a kick off workshop arranged with Fujitsu and Second Sight for next week.

Regards, Simon
