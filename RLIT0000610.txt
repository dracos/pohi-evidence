2.1 Notes for table

In the ‘Claim data by scheme’ table:

e data regarding the HSS and OC are sourced from Post Office Ltd, which
retains full responsibility for the data published on its website

e the HCRS redress payments data reflect the current position at a point in
time - it should be noted that these totals can change slightly as time

goes on as payments are retrospectively confirmed as received by

claimants

3. Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting
their conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon
RLIT0000610
RLITO000610

evidence.

As of 31 October 2024, all 111 eligible claimants have either reached full
and final settlement or received a minimum of £200,000 through interim
payments.

A full and final claim is defined as:

e both non-pecuniary and pecuniary claims have been received and
sufficiently particularised to substantiate redress payments of £450,000 or
more

e or the claimant has requested the £600,000 fixed sum offer

Post Office Ltd has been progressing non-pecuniary settlements first to get
money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which means a number of
partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full and final
settlements published here. Post Office Ltd continues to work on finalising
these outstanding claims.

Any individual with a conviction overturned by the Post Office (Horizon
System) Offences Act 2024 or the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences
(Scotland) Act 2024 will be eligible to seek financial redress through the
HCRS.

3.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 31 January 2025, there are 111 claimants eligible for financial redress
through the OC scheme. From these 111, Post Office Ltd has received 82
full and final claims.

4. Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the GLO, 63 postmasters had
convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress once their
conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been overturned by
the courts, they are eligible under the OC scheme. If their conviction has
been overturned by the legislation, they are eligible for the HCRS.

As of 31 January 2025, the department had received 408 completed claims
from eligible GLO postmasters. Full and final redress has been agreed with
257 claimants, of whom 153 accepted the £75,000 fixed offer. A further 229
individuals have received partial or interim redress payments, including
people who have not yet submitted full claims.

4.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 492 claimants eligible for financial redress through
the GLO scheme. As of 31 January 2025, 408 full and final claims have
RLITO000610
RLIT0000610

been received. For full and final claims received, the number reported refers
to all claims assessed as complete.

Further claims may have been received recently but not yet assessed to
determine whether they are complete. A claim initially assessed as complete
may subsequently be found to require further information and therefore be
removed from counts of complete claims received while awaiting this
information.

offers from the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and the
remaining 24 are awaiting offers.

4.2 Scheme delivery target

DBT is committed to a target of making a first offer to 90% of claimants who
have submitted a full claim within 40 working days. A full claim is defined as
a claim which DBT considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not
need any further evidence in order to assess every element of the claim.

Should the department consider further evidence is needed in order to
make a full assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such
time that the required evidence is received from the claimant or any other
source.

Over the lifetime of the scheme to 31 January 2025, 89% of claimants
received their first offer within 40 working days of submitting a full claim.

DBT’s target is providing a substantive response within 40 working days to
90% of claimants who submit a complete challenge from 1 December 2024.
A challenge will be considered ‘complete’ if the department does not require
any more information from the claimant or their advisors in order to provide
a substantive response. A substantive response is defined as the claimant
receiving a revised offer or a decision to uphold the original offer.
RLIT0000610

RLITO000610

As at 31 January 2025, 100% of claimants (3 out of 3) who submitted
complete challenges after 1 December 2024 received their substantive
response within 40 working days of doing so. Claims are being assessed in
the date order in which they were submitted, so no challenge submitted
before 1 December 2024 will be left behind.

4.3 £75,000 fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total
fixed sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-
litigation-order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is
made.

As of 31 January 2025, 243 offers have been accepted, of which 153 are
offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.

5. Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)

Post Office Ltd received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
Ltd continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to
March 2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would
be provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress,
and the scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office Ltd has received 4,665 eligible late claims to date.

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants
receive an offer of redress.
RLIT0000610
RLITO000610

The £315 million paid out on the HSS includes £33.3 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £7.9 million in interim payments to late
applications.

On 13 March 2024, the government announced that all
eligible HSS claimants would be entitled to a fixed sum award of £75,000 to
settle their claim.

Post Office Ltd continues to make top-up payments to claimants who had
previously accepted a full and final offer below the value of £75,000, to bring
their total redress to £75,000.

Post Office Ltd has also started to make payments of the full £75,000 fixed
sum award to HSS applicants who have not previously received redress but
have now accepted this offer. The number and amount of offers and
payments made for the full fixed sum are now included in the HSS figures
below and in the HSS eligible late claims figures on the ‘Claim data by
scheme’ table.

As of 31 January 2025, approximately £171 million has been paid in award
top-ups and £75,000 awards.

5.1 Eligible claimant stages

As of 31 January 2025, 7,082 claims for financial redress have been
received through the HSS. This includes applications received before the
original deadline, and applications received since the scheme reopened in
October 2022.

Of the total 7,082 claims received, 3,350 have been paid and a further 50
have accepted offers and are awaiting payment. Another 819 claimants are
currently in receipt of offers that they have not yet accepted and the
remaining 2,863 claimants are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.

6. Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme
(HCRS)

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in
the acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by
DBT, to provide financial redress to postmasters across the UK who had
their convictions quashed by the acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is
working with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’
eligibility for the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress. They can either
accept a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
RLITO000610
RLIT0000610

application to a detailed assessment process.
All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.

The department is now publishing data on settlements, broken down by
initial interim payments and full and final settlements.

6.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 31 January 2025, 232 full and final claims for financial redress have
been received through the HCRS. Of these 232 claims, 208 have received
payments and the remaining 24 have accepted offers for redress and are
awaiting payment from DBT.
