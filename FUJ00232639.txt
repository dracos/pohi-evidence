4. BFPO

Since the last SMR another two BFPO branches have opened, Nepal and Brunei. Incident calls had been
logged during the roll out of the two branches. After discussions with support in the UK both branches
successfully opened.

The following CT's have been raised to reduce problems occurring during roll out.

Approved 30/06/2011
* CT0991 Fujitsu providing engineering support in BFPO Ireland branches

Approved 15/06/2011
* CT 0657 BFPO configuration of all BFPO kit on arrival at BFPO HQ Northolt

Submitted to POL approval 30/06/2011
* CT to be generated, Fujitsu to provide 1st line support during BFPO automation rollout

BFPO project updates

e Fujitsu require more budgets from Post Office so support can continue on the project; Dave
Ireland has submitted an additional 20K budget for approval within POL.

e Dave Ireland has reiterated to BFPO counters must not be switched off, if they do this will affect
reconciliation when Operator self funding rolls out. All BFPO live branches will be part of the pilot
list.

e BFPO live branches are highlighted in green in the roll out schedule below. The only BFPO
branch scheduled to open in July is Sierra Leone the others have been cancelled. OBC await
new installation dates.

* The CCN ongoing charges have been amended and is with POL for approval.

8. COUNTER PEAK SUMMARY

This section is a consolidated view of Peak fixes advised to Post Office Ltd via the Counter Release

Authorisation mechanism.

Counter Product Fault Peak

Summary

COUNTER_APP 63_1 PC0194525

Incorrect report event ids for recovery

PC0194989

FAD108033 error code 0998 has occurred

The cause of the problem is Textfield loses focus to
glasspane while dragging the mouse on it. This happens only
when the cash declaration screen displayed for the first time
in a day. The problem is associated with an editable table
having a custom cell editor.

PC0204878

Banking transactions requests are declined by Agent for
those branches having an ampersand in their address.

PC0206811

SV&I R4D1 - Existing Reversal original transaction date can
be greater than actual transaction date.

PC0206917

Under some circumstances RDM does not make an object
which has been created in one rule using ObjectVariation
visible to a subsequent rule. This therefore limits the way in
which rules can be used.

PC0206968

‘Tag not attribute of parent’ warnings in OSR logs

PC0207966

Branch 272611- Rem in apparently successful in failed
session

PC0208056

FAD244246 error message on screen msg90025 error0291.
Misleading error message from the counter results in
unnecessary calls through the support chain.

PC0208315

FAD209844 unable to contact data centre.

Urgent manual SSC action required to complete counter roll
out. Work around is to amend data in BRDB which delays
availability of counter for PM.

PC0208340

Slip printer handling errors. The waiting time for the response
from Slip Printer needs to be increased from presently 10
seconds to 15 seconds so that the counter application
receives a response from the printer confirming that the slip
has been printed completely.

COUNTER_APP 64_1 PC0194290

Critical read/write failures being ignored or not being handled
properly

PC0196012

We mark each Memo with details of Users who have viewed
them. However this update is not audited for visibility in the
ARQ process.

POL may want to be able to confirm whether or not a Clerk
has seen some instructions, so this should be rectified

PC0200469

A new feature has been added to CBA that will detect any
fjvm_pidNNNNN.log files which may have been created from
previous crashes and log an NT event and an entry in the
PostOfficeCounter.log indicating this. This helps support to
correctly diagnose the cause.

PC0207578

Transaction prompt with frequency 'T' associated with a
product, fails to appear while trying to add the item to the
Basket.

PC0207634

When carrying out a Parcel Force (e.g. express24)
transaction if user enters a different postcode in the middle
of the transaction than the postcode entered in the beginning
of the transaction a SYSTEM ERROR message is displayed.

PC0208952

products and are therefore important to the customer.

This issue prevented Post Office from releasing SalePrompt
data setup for CP0510 Travel Money Card so the customer

is aware of the issue.

Post Office plan to use prompt data of this nature more and

more with new products so this issue may impact upon that.

CP0612 IT enhancements — Generic Web Server Design Stage
CT959

HNGX_QOS 61_2 PC0209157 Currently when QoS is activated more than once per day

event warning messages are generated highlighting missing
data files. These files are missing as they where processed
on the first QoS run so while accurate they are misleading as
to the state of the Counter. The event messages cannot be
removed as if they occur on the first daily run of QoS they
highlight potential problems with CNIM data generation.

The problem will occur every time a counter is rebooted after
the first daily run of QoS has been performed and is likely to
affect all branches in the estate.

At present too many misleading messages are being
produced which may be masking genuine problems.

The proposed fix is to only generate event warning
messages for the first run of QoS on any given day. This
would then enable counters with a potential problem to be
identified.

The benefit of making the fix would be to allow support to
detect any outlets that are not producing QoS data.

CP0612 IT enhancements — Generic Web Server Design Stage
CT959

COUNTER_APP 64_2 PC0209789 I As a result of a request from POL and subsequent
investigations by Development, it has been determined that

a Business Event that was expected to be generated
whenever Help is invoked from the HNG-X Counter is
missing.

Discussions with POL during the Help Design phase
identified the expectation that POL would be able to make ad-
hoc requests to FS Operations for a report on the usage of
Help. These requests will be via the standard BAU
chargeable route to SSC.
