Many thanks Lesley
Paula ~ see below, some additional points on the SS investigation for your meeting with Duncan tomorrow.
Hope you've both survived the day and the meetings have gone as well as could be expected.

Have a good evening,
Martin

I think that's simple:

Duncan's team have been fully engaged with POL and I've personally kept them up to date.
I believe Duncan has been kept up to date by his team.

First and foremost a thank you for their support as they have responded and worked with POL to provide the
information SS have been requesting.

We have the teams ready for Friday to respond to the interim report and Fujitsu understand the timescales we will be
working too.

I would assume that Duncan will want Paula's view on how this will move forward.

So in summary, a thank you and a request to continue with the support they have provided to date.
I would also single out James Davidson who has done a great job.

Hope this is enough and that you've had a little time with your family today.

Hi Lesley ~ just noticed that the brief doesn’t cover anything on the SS investigation. What should Paula

be saying to Duncan about this? When we discussed on Monday and Tuesday she was expecting to raise
it,

POL-0098523
POLO00098940
POL00098940

if you're able to respond this evening that would be appreciated as the meeting is first thing tomorrow
morning. Sorry to interrupt your evening.
Many thanks, Martin
