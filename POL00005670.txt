1 Introduction

1.4 Background

As part of the Network Transformation Programme there is a requirement to
transform the network through reducing costs by significantly improving
conformance and compliance in the network. One of the strands in the
Network Transformation Programme is the losses / fraud strand this review
will fall into that strand of activity.

Through recent analysis conducted by the Security team there is
overwhelming evidence to show that those agents who have between 0-5
years service within the business are more likely to commit fraud than their
longer serving counterparts. This end to end review of recruitment policies for
agents and employees will review the decision support processes within the
recruitment process.

1.2 High Level Objective

The high level objective of this piece of work is to reduce the risk of fraud by
new agents by recording and analysing the current agency recruitment
process from end to end to determine any gaps / weaknesses in that process
and then documenting all recommendations.

13 Terms of Reference

13.1 Scope

This report is concerned with the recruitment policies of sub post masters
(agents) from the point of application to the agent being successful in their
application.

It is also concerned with ongoing monitoring of agents within the first 0-5
years of their employment to ensure that any changes of circumstances
which can be statistically linked with an increased fraud risk are noted.

13.2 Objectives
This report will cover the following:
e Reason for change (an analysis which proves fraud risk is higher in
agents within the 0-5 year bracket)
Current process analysis
Proposed process, highlighting the additional areas of checking
Time scales and costs to implement these changes
An assessment of the requirements for ongoing monitoring including

« Potential benefits analysis

13.3 Critical Success Factors
The mitigation of loss via the improved vetting of potential agents.

14 Methodology

The different possible strategies/options are to be weighed against each
other by comparison of the differing cost effects they would have.

15 Evaluation Criteria

Potential options for mitigating fraud risk will be evaluated by their
implementation costs verses their potential savings estimate.

2 Executive Summary

2.1 Recommended Option

It is recommended that two new types of check are introduced (Option 1 —
See Section 4.1)

e Anenhanced credit check which will take place prior to the interview
stage. This will have a two-fold effect, namely that it will enable us to
set rejection criteria allowing us to reject out of hand applicants who
exceed a certain amount of personal credit, and secondly that it will
provide more information to the interviewers.

e Anon going monitoring of credit. This will monitor and flag any trends in
an agent's credit activity post appointment. Therefore it will alert us if an
agent of 12 months standing suddenly has multiple requests for credit.
This will potentially allow the fraud investigation team to investigate and
prevent fraud.

The enhanced checking recommended in the first part of this proposal is
currently done when investigating fraudulent activity which has been
discovered, so delivery of the enhanced check as a matter of course requires
only an alteration to the process guidelines.

The on going monitoring service can be provided by a number of commercial
organisations, and delivery would require only that the details of new agents
are passed on to the monitoring service as part of the post recruitment
process.

2.2 Overall Timescales for Recommended Option

These steps are taken from the Proposed New Sub postmaster Action Plan
found in Section 9.2.4 and as such represent work which is still in the
planning stage. This work will be undertaken by Agency Development, HR,
Agency Recruitment, Network Efficiency, National Field Support, National
Contracts Management, Network Coordination, Finance, Comms, and
Security as appropriate.

2.3 Summary of Costs and Benefits for Recommended Option

Costs:
e Enhanced Credit Check Costs: 3700 per year @ £8 per search =
£29.6k
¢ Ongoing monitoring of new agents up to 4000 accounts per quarter -
£10k per annum
¢ One off training / consultancy cost £2.5k
This gives a total cost of £42.1k in the first year and £39.6k per year
subsequently.

Benefits:

It is difficult to give exact estimates of savings by fraud mitigation, however
rudimentary case study investigation has bought to light 2 cases of agents
suspended in 2008 with a total amount of loss of > £200k. In both of these
cases enhanced checking and on going monitoring would have greatly
increased the chances of these applicants either being rejected out of hand,
or caught sooner.

24 Strategie Fit for Recommended Option

This option fits in with the Network Transformation Program, in the Fraud
Prevention strand.

2.8 Other Options Considered

OPTION Option 2 — Take No Action See Section 4.2

CAUSE OF This option was rejected because it fails to address the

REJECTION I objectives of the HLBP, namely to mitigate the risks of fraud
in new agents.

COST There would have been no extra costs involved in delivering
this option

BENEFIT This option would generate no benefits, but would keep the
spending on checks for recruitment at their current levels.

3. High-level Business Requirements and Scope
3.4 Current State

There is evidence to show that agents who have between 0-5 years service
within the business are more likely to commit fraud than their longer serving
counterparts. In 2007/08, 55% of Fraud Casework involved agents with this
length of service with accompanying losses of £2.71m. Indeed, of the most
recent 16 higher value fraud cases (>£50K) 14 of these cases involved
agents with 0-5 year’s service, which equated to a loss figure of £1.5m.

Additionally, the value of losses for each individually detected fraud case is
also dramatically increasing (the average audit loss uncovered is now in
excess of £40k).

Casework recoveries are currently out-turning at approx 70%, which if
running at the same rate would expect that of the £3.7m initial loss reported
April 07 to September 08 for agents with 0 — 5 years in the business,
recoveries would realise approx. £2.7m. This would still leave bottom-line
losses of approximately £1m to agents with O — 5 years of service.

The current process for potential agent checking is as follows (See 9.2.1
BAU Agent Recruitment for detailed flow diagrams):
1. Applicant applies online, and completes business plan, application form
and CV electronically, then sends in the hard copies

2. Credit and voter (i.e. Electoral Roll) check processes initiated (See
9.2.3 Credit & Voter Check Template)

3. Applicant provides references

4. Business plan analysed (including the creation of a Financial
Assessment - See 9.2.2 Financial Assessment)

5. An ‘interview file’ comprised of the application, CV, business plan,
financial assessment, vacancy report and evidence document is

created
6. Interview

This process is weak in the following areas:

e The Financial Assessment does not contain any detail of the
prospective agents’ credit history, and the credit and voter check
results only confirm that the applicant has no CCJs, has never been
bankrupt and is registered to vote at the home address given. Neither
contains details of the potential agents’ current level of debt or other
risk factors.

e There is no mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the agents credit
portfolio after they have been employed. This means that an agent
could increase in terms of risk (remortgage property, take out additional
credit cards etc) and POL would not know that their risk of fraud had
gone up. Any current ongoing checks on new agents focus on the sales
aspect of the role and pay little attention to fraud risk.

The specific objectives of this proposed change are that a more thorough
process is instigated which allows the business to mitigate internal fraud risk

3.2 Business Requirements and CSFs

The business need for this project is that the majority of internal fraud cases
are perpetrated by those agents within the 0 — 5 year service bracket, i.e. that
those agents are more likely to commit fraud than their longer serving
equivalents.

We need a more robust way of determining which agents are more likely
fraud risks both before we hire them and during their first 5 years. This would
allow us to minimise risk either by refusing appointment (in cases where
credit history revealed unacceptable risk) or providing early warning
indicators.

CFS

The introduction of new policies for agency recruitment which will mitigate
fraud risk from new agents by removing weaknesses in the current process.

4 Options Analysis and Recommendation

4.4 Option 4

44.1 Description and Context Diagram

This option proposes that we address the two weak links in the current
recruitment process as identified in Section 3.1, namely that:
¢ The current credit and voter checks only confirm that the applicant has
no CCJs, has never been bankrupt and has given a correct address

e There is no mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the agents credit
portfolio after they have been employed.

Extensive Credit Checks

The current credit and voter checks are the standard ones which would be
applied to anyone who wanted to apply for credit, and do not contain any
detail on the individual's credit state such as amount of personal debt.

We propose that under sections 29 & 35 of the Data Protection Act (Crime
and Taxation, and Disclosures required by law or made in connection with
legal proceedings etc.) we instigate Enhanced Credit Checks. This will be

done in addition to the checks currently in place.

The aim of the check is crime prevention. We currently perform this check
when we are investigating criminal activity, but we propose that we perform it

POL00005670

prior to interview at the stage in the process where the current checks are
carried out. This will mean that the results of this check will be fed into the
Financial Assessment, and therefore available to the interviewer to challenge
the applicant with.

This check requires consent from the subject of the check (unless its
purposes are for Crime Prevention where consent is not required and does
not leave a record on the subjects history). Therefore by requesting consent
to carry out enhanced checks it is considered that any suitable applicants will
not object (i.e. no reason to hide their financial status). The consent will be
drawn into the new application documents.

Where this checking is currently used (in fraud investigations) it is requested
from RMUK and falls within the RMUK HR Budget.

In Depth Post Appointment Checks

The current process has 1, 3 and 6 month reviews for new agents, but this is
sales driven and does not include any investigation of agents financial status.
An ongoing credit monitoring service can be purchased from a 3 party
supplier such as CallMonitor and Experian which will include alert flags of
increased risk, such as multiple credit card applications, amended mortgage
details, fresh payment defaults and exceptional credit activity. New agents
must agree to this before it can be enabled.

412 Use Case Narrative

If approved, the process for agency recruitment would be as follows:

1. Applicant applies online, and completes business plan, application form
and CV electronically, then sends in the hard copies. This includes a
signed declaration that we are authorised to investigate credit status
under sections 29 & 35 of the DPA.

2. Credit and voter (i.e. Electoral Roll) check processes initiated (See
9.2.3 Credit & Voter Check Template)

3. Enhanced Credit Check process instigated
4. Applicant provides references

5. Business plan and results from Enhanced Credit Check analysed

(including the creation of a Financial Assessment which contains the
outputs of the enhanced credit checking)

6. An ‘interview file’ comprised of the application, CV, business plan,
financial assessment, vacancy report and evidence document is
created

7. Interview
8. Criminal Records Check (CRC)

The remote ongoing credit monitoring would be in place for all agents within
the first 5 years of their tenure.

Note:

The CRC (point 8 above) is done after the interview for cost reasons, as the
check costs £20-00 per head. Given that it currently flags only 2% - 3% of
candidates as unsuitable for POL, applying this check to all candidates would
greatly increase the cost of recruitment for no extra benefit.

Casework recoveries are currently out-turning at approx 70%, which if
running at the same rate would mean that of the £3.7m initial loss reported
for agents with 0-5 years of service, recoveries would realise approx. £2.7m.
This would still leave bottom-line losses of approximately £1m.
It is extremely difficult to predict savings on the basis of reduction in fraud,
however the Fraud Risk Manager for the Security team and the Finance
Analyst (Andy Hayward and Martin Elmslie) have speculated that a 10%
(£100k) reduction in fraud losses is a conservative estimate of the potential

savings.

In terms of ‘provable’ benefits of the proposed changes, please see 9.2.5 —
Fraud Case Studies. The two case studies included there are summarised
below:

Study One

Service Period:
3 years 4 months

Amount of Loss:
£56,896.82

Personal Credit History of Agent:
£120k credit card debts. 11 active accounts, 7 credit applications prior to
suspension

Conclusion:

Several of the checks which are currently in place (business plan approval &
follow up on admission of personal debt) were not followed up and
completed. If there were an automatic process in situ which highlighted the
actual levels of personal debt of the agent they would either have been
rejected automatically (dependent of the actual predetermined appointment
criteria) or flagged to the interviewer.

Also an ongoing monitoring system would have tracked the unusual credit
application activity immediately prior to the fraud.

Study Two

Service Period:
2 years 11 months

Amount of Loss:
£168,000

Personal Credit History of Agent:
17 credit applications & 8 credit quotes post appointment, 12 active accounts
with total debt of £428,000 with payments in default.

Conclusion:

Poor personal credit and less than glowing references. Agent was classed as

Low Risk. Ongoing monitoring of credit would have flagged as a risk factor.

POL00005670

Overall Conclusions:

In both of these cases the on going monitoring or the enhanced credit
checking would certainly have given us a much better chance of spotting the
risk and mitigating it before fraud was committed, or before it had reached
the levels it did.

It is important to note that whilst it is possible for mistakes to be made and
issues to be overlooked (in the case of Study One approval was given as the
agent had owned the retail area for several years) by people, if this change is
approved these checks will be applied by default, and will therefore
significantly reduce the risk of potential problems / issues not being flagged.
Monitoring

To determine the actual level of saving if this option were implemented the
Fraud Risk team would monitor the levels of fraud in the 12 month period
after implementation and would then be able to report on the effectiveness of
this change. If the savings realised over this period did not appear to justify
the extra expense of these additional checks, then they could be removed
from the process.

Furthermore monitoring at infancy of appointment will show predictable
patterns of suspicious behaviour, which in turn will drive early intervention,
resulting in reduced exposure to loss.

Number 104 161 65%
Initial Losses £3.7m £5.6m 66%
Recoveries (approx.) I £2.7m £3.9m :
Net Loss: £1m £1.7m

Intervention benefits: I £100k £170k

(Based on 10% min.)

Note: The budget for the enhanced checks and the ongoing monitoring
would be held by RMUK Human Resources.

See Section 4.1.8 for risks which might impact agency recruitment volumes if
this change is implemented.

Security

This change is being driven by the Security Fraud prevention team. If
implemented this change should reduce the volume and amount of fraud in
agency branches across the network.

4.1.8 Risks and Issues

e This ‘enhanced’ checking process is not expected to create any major
delays to appointment and will be carried out as business as usual.
However, there may be a nominal impact on the admin teams that
manage the recruitment process in terms of the time it takes them to
process an applicant. However if there is such an impact it will be
minimal.

e The enhanced checks may mean that the number of rejected
applicants will increase, which may impact on maintaining the branch
network. This will have to be considered and monitored against existing
trends (i.e. periodic analysis of recruitment). Fraud savings will also
have to be tempered against maintaining operational continuity in the
Network. Current estimates are that an average of 800-1000 new
agents would be the expected level going forward. (Source: HR
Agency Recruitment)

2008 (to
Agents Recruited 2006/07 I 2007/08 Aug)
Total Number 979 612 279

¢ More robust credit checks prior to appointment may impact on existing
agents who apply for another branch, and who subsequently don’t pass
the checks. This potentially puts more than one branch at risk as a
decision will have to be made regarding whether the existing agent is fit
to remain at his/her current branch.

4.19 Customer and Colleague Experience

5 Recommended Option

5.1 Business and Technical Architecture

Option 1 is the recommended option.

The main components of the recommended option are two fold:

e The instigation of an enhanced credit check. This is designed to
provide the interviewers with more information about an applicant, to
enable them to identify potential fraud risks. It will also enable us to
reject some applicants prior to interview by comparing their results to a
set of pre determined criteria for rejection.

e An ongoing ‘post appointment assessment’ designed to pick up on
credit risks that become apparent after the agent has started. This
would be done with the agents consent in the form of an addition to the
existing contracts.

These proposals would fall within business and technical policies, strategies
and standards.

5.2 Security Assessment

Final formal input from Dave King is still outstanding however the results of
the Information Security Questionnaire are that the information currently held
both hard and soft copy on prospective agents and both failed and successful
applicants is not stored correctly according to POL and legal requirements.
There is a reasonable / high impact score for Business Criticality,
Confidentiality and Integrity.

This issue is a result of the personal information about agents, including
criminal records checks and financial details, being stored with insufficient
security precautions.

Security will raise a new Change Proposal for the improvement of the
physical and digital security of this data.

5.3 Required Business Change

What follows is a high level indication of the steps required to implement this
