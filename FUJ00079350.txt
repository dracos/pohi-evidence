1 INTRODUCTION
1.14 Scope
The Pathway Performance & Scalability Strategy [PerfScalStrat] describes
the process that ICL Pathway has implemented to manage and predict
the performance of the system.
One of the key components of the strategy is the measurement and
monitoring of the live system and comparing the performance of the live
system (workload processed and resources used) with the performance
predicted using:
+ Data derived from Technical Testing and
«Performance models.
The performance predictions are input into the scalability plans for each
component of the system that will:
+ Document the capability and scalability of each layer of the
architecture
+ Relax the stringent targets set out in the default scalability plan,
where applicable
+ Identify any shortfall in performance that will impact on the
scalability of the system.
The edition of the Live System Report documents, in summarised form,
the monitoring of the live system for January and February 2000.
The Live System Report has four main purposes:
+ To document the workload processed (no of messages, transactions,+—{ Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

etc) by the key components of the live system.

+ To document the resources used (e.g. processor, disk, time) by each
of the key components of the system.

«To compare the workload and resource usage with that predicted by
the performance models [Model].

@+To highlight any discrepancies, and any action taken or
recommended.

Overview

The live system report is divided into sections covering the following
services:

FUJ00079350
FUJ00079350

+ OBCS (see §2) + —[Formatted: Bullets and Numbering ]

2+ APS (see §3)

+ TPS (see §4)

Reference Data (see §5)
Riposte (see §6)

ISDN Network (see §7)

+ Issues (see §8)

In each section the key metrics are presented in graphical and/or tabular
form.

In each of the graphs the monitoring data is normally presented for

each individual day in the sample period. The predicted data is the
maximum value expected during a particular week. Where appropriate
the actual volume of transactions or resources used is compared against
the predicted value and any differences are identified and reviewed.

The current prediction models have been calibrated using data gathered
during Technical Testing for Pathway Release CSR (NR2). As the
workload volumes on the live system increase, the models will be re-
calibrated using data from the live system. The point in the rollout at
which the models will be re-calibrated will depend on the particular
component and the usage of that component.

1.3 Management Summary

This report covers the months of January and February 2000. Rollout of
Post Office Outlets recommenced on 24"" January and since then the
number of outlets has increased from 1860 to 3300.

The load on the hardware platforms has increased steadily and has
reached a level when the resources used on key platforms like the
Correspondence Servers can be monitored and the measurements used
to extrapolate future resource usage.

This issue of the Live System Report looks at both the workload being
processed and the resources being used.

The following summarises the current performance:

+ TPS — The EPOSS workload is growing in-line with predictions.

+ OBCE — The OBCS workload is growing more slowly than predicted
and the current projection is that the number of payments by book in
a full year with all outlets rolled out would be approx. 630M ie.
approx. 20% lower than the contractual volumes. The OBCS volumes
will be monitored closely and if, over the next two sampling periods
this trend continues, the capacity models for the platforms and the
network will be updated to reflect these changes.

The order book bar-code scanning ie has not been resolved so the
number of OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions being process is much lower
than predicted. Discussions are continuing between Pathway and
POCL about re-instating the barcode scanning of order books.

+ Reference Data — Procedural and application changes have been
made to the processing of reference data. The POCL generated peaks
experienced earlier in rollout have been significantly reduced. The
focus is now on eliminating the Pathway generated peaks that are
caused by e.g. reference data to support new releases.

+ Network - The issues identified with the ISDN network has
resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and length of

calls. The focus has now changed to identifying the source of calls
and trying to reduce the number of ISDN calls.

14 Performance Changey

* During January the number of PRIs in the routers was reduced to
protect the routers from peak on peak overload. This PRIs will be re-
installed during March in the new ISDN Routers that are planned.
The new router configuration will support full roll out volumes.

LS Iyuey

« TPS - The time to harvest TPS is under review. The TPS bulk
harvester agents are processing data input from the Correspondence
Server at, or above, the expected level, but because the number of
messages input is much greater than expected [*] the overall time to
process is longer than expected. This is not an issue with the current
volumes.

+ Performance Data from the Live System - The production
of this report relies on data feeds from the live system. The report
relies on manual data feeds and problems obtaining the feeds in time
caused the January LSR to be delayed and merged with the February
LSR.

Data feeds from:

+ NT& Riposte meters

+ Maestro Logs

+ Energis phone bills

+ Data Warehouse extracts

have been used in the production of this report.

‘A CP and briefing paper have been produced for the purchase of
Athene from Metron Technology a long-standing ICL partner.
Athene provides the tools to collect manage and report on
performance data collected from the live estate and will be used by
OSD, SSC, CS and the performance team.

+ The TPS Bulk Harvester ready all messages but does only proves EPOSS
menagex The large number of additional messages generated by cash
accounting trial balances are read but not processed.

OBCS

OBCS Summary

The 3 key components OBCS workload are:

@s Harvesting - the harvesting of the OBCS transactions that have be+—
done at the Post Offices (e.g. payment of benefit). These are then
processed by the host system (see §2.1).

+ Foreigny - The processing of OBCS foreign by the data centre (see
§2.2).

© Stops — The processing of OBCS stops from the benefit agency and
loading them into Riposte (see §2.3).

The volume of OBCS order book transactions (see Figure 2-2 - Number
of OBCS Messages Processed per Day) is lower than expected at this
point in the roll out. Extrapolating the current volumes to full rollout
would result in approx. 630M order book transactions being processed in
a full year. This is approx. 20% lower than the contractual volumes.

Currently only the original 300 live trial Post Offices are bar-code
scanning order book encashments. However most of the remaining Post
Offices are now registering new order books before they are issued. The
Pathway objective is to get all Post Offices registering all new order
books to minimise the learning effect when the bar-code scanning of
order books is re-instated. However, 319 of the remaining Post Offices
did not registered any books during February and a list of these Post
Offices has been provided to POCL who are investigating.

The average OBCS ‘foreign’ response time (see Figure 2-10 - OBCS
Foreign Response Times) is artificially low. The ‘foreign’ response time is
computed from the time to:

- Processing ‘foreign’ order book encashments ana
- Register new book receipts

New book receipts typically have a lower response time and as they
currently make up a higher proportion of all OBCS foreigns than would
be normal, this results in a lower than typical mean ‘foreign’ response
time. A new chart has been added to this report (see Figure 2-10) which

Re CS/PER/O

separates out the small number of OBCS ‘foreign’ encashments from the
bulk of ‘foreigns’ that are created by the registration of new order books.
The percentage of OBCS ‘foreigns’ that fail is artificially low since new-——( Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

book receipts must contact the data centre. The percentage of
transactions that fail (see Figure 2-9) has continued to decline as the
network problems are resolved.

2.2 OBCS Harvesting

This section looks at the harvesting and processing of OBCS messages.
OBCS messages include:

+ The payment of benefit by book (local & foreign)

+ The registering of new books upon receipt at a Post Office and

* The issue of new books at a Post Office.

Figure 2-2 shows the number of OBCS messages harvested per day. The
difference between the actual and predicted numbers should be because
of Northern Ireland (NI) Post Offices as they do not support OBCS (the
OBCS workload model assumes that all Post Offices process OBCS).
Even taking the NI effect into consideration the number of OBCS
messages is significantly lower than would be expected from the
contractual volumes:

Year Order Book
Tey
1999-2000 776M
2000-2001 I 750M

Figure 2-1 - Contractual Volume of OBCS Order Book Tramsactiony

Projecting the current volumes forward would result in the expected
number of OBCS order book transactions to be approx. 630M. The
growth in OBCS order book transactions will be carefully monitored as
the rollout progresses.

Figure 2-4 - Elapsed Time to- Harvest OBCS Tramsactiony,

Figure 2-4 is based on the workload being processed at all Post Offices
and includes both order books scanned and order books processed using
the non bar-coded order book function, The lapsed time is gathered
from metrics in the OBCS Bulk Harvester agent.

The workload peaks were caused by:

+ 1/2"4 February - The introduction into the system of TPS
reconciliation

+ 29" February - The APS bulk harvester agents at Wigan were not
available so all harvesting used the 8 bulk harvester agents on the
Bootle site.

The overheads of setting up the harvester jobs, and the short execution
times, mean that if the elapsed times are used to project future run-
times, the time will tend to be a over estimate. However, as the number
of messages processed grows the impact of the overheads will be reduced
and more accurate run-time estimates can be extrapolated from
measured run-times,

2.3 OBCS ‘Foreign Transactiony
There are two key performance measures for OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions:
«The volume of ‘foreigns’ (which effects the number of phone calls)
and
+ The average response time (which effects the SLAs).
The number of OBCS ‘foreigns’ is shown in Figure 2-6 below. The graph
shows all ‘foreigns’ initiated at the counters and splits them into:
+ ‘Foreigns’ those that failed ['] ie. did not receive a response within
the 20 second time-out time because:
— The phone call to the data centre failed or
— The response was longer than expected because e.g. the OBCS
Host system is unavailable
+ and those that succeeded.

The number of ‘foreigns’ being processed is far lower than expected
because the bar-code scanning of order book encashments are only
being processed the first 300 Post Offices rolled out.

The percentage of OBCS ‘foreign’ failures has steadily reduced as a result
of actions put in place to rectify ISDN network problems.

However, the percentage of OBCS ‘foreigns’ that fail is currently
artificially low as the figure is made up from:

+ The number of OBCS ‘foreign’ encashment failures, plus
+ The number of OBCS ‘foreign’ book receipt failures

and the vast majority of ‘foreigns’ in the sample period are OBCS
‘foreign’ book receipts which must contact the data centre.

Note: The failure of an OBCS ‘foreign’ encashment does not mean that
the transaction is lost. All OBCS ‘foreign’ transactions are
written to the counter message store but, for a variety of
reasons, some messages fail to contact the datacentre and in
such circumstances the counter clerk will operate the fall back
procedure which may include telephoning the Help Desk.

The average response time for OBCS ‘foreigns’ is shown in Figure 2-10
below.

that are harvested and stored in the Data Warehouse. This time is
currently artificially low because of the order book scanning problem.

Separating out the OBCS ‘foreign’ encashments from book receipts gives
a better indication of the current response times.

The response time that is currently being measured on the live system is
better than the response time measured in the OBCS ‘Foreign’
acceptance test benchmark i.e. 5.4 seconds,

Stopy Processing

Each night the Benefits Agency sends Pathway details of books that
should not be encashed. This list covers all OBCS beneficiaries

irrespective of whether they normally claim benefit from a Pathway
automated Post Office or not, This means that the number of changes to
the Stops List received by Pathway was at a maximum from day 1 and is
not expected to grow over time.

Within the OBCS Stops database on the Host system are details of all
Pathway automated Post Offices where the order book has been used.
When a stop is received by Pathway details of the stop are sent to
Riposte and replicated to each automated Post Office were that book has
been used.

The variation in the volumes of changes from the benefit agency is hard
to predict. Average volumes of approximately 40,000 stops per night are
expected with a contractual maximum in one night of 100,000. The dip
in volumes during December is within the normal limits expected.

(088 Stops Loaded into Riposte

See See pen OE se ome mange tantpset

Figure 2-12 - Number of OBCS Stopy Loaded into Riposte per day

The OBCS Stops model assumed that the proportion of Stops loaded into
Riposte would be proportional to the number of Post Offices rolled out.

The number of OBCS Stops being loaded into Riposte is not rising as
expected because order books are not being resistered at many Post
Offices and Stops can only be distributed to offices that know about a
particular order book.

As current order books expire, the new order books should be registered
when they are received and the number of OBCS Stops loaded into
Riposte should start to increase even before the order book scanning
service is re-started.

The time to process OBCS Stops by the host and the time to load them
into Riposte are shown in Figure 2-13 and Figure 2-14 below.

The elapsed time in Figure 2-14 is gathered from metrics in the OBCS
Stops Bulk Loader agent. The overheads of setting up the loader jobs and
the short execution times mean that the elapsed times do not give a true
picture of the elapsed time .v. number of OBCS Stops being processed.
The reduction in elapsed times in February resulted from the (partial)
resolution of a problem with LUC that had caused the time to connect to
LUC to be much longer than expected (up to 15 mins), thus increasing
the elapsed time for the job.

Post Offices and harvest the EPOSS messages when the end-of-day
marker is received.

The time that the harvesters run is not a function of the amount of data
harvested nor the number of automated Post Offices rolled out. There is
no meaningful data available at present about the performance of the
TPS Bulk Harvesters.

However, metrics from the TPS Bulk Harvester Agents indicate that the
rate at which EPOSS messages are being processed is lower than
expected from Cl2 Technical Testing.

Analysis of metrics from the TPS Bulk Harvesters indicate that the
problem may be associated with the number of EPOSS messages
scanned but not harvested, which is much higher than expected. The
analysis so far indicates that this is due to a much higher number of:

« Riposte system messages and
« Cash accounting messages.
See §6.1 - Number of Riposte Messages for further details.

Because most cash accounting is run after end-of-day on a Wednesday
this adds a significant load to the TPS Bulk Harvesters on a Thursday
evening. This is also being monitored but changes such as the reduction
in the number of ‘user lock requests’ (CP2253) will reduce the impact on
the TPS Bulk Harvester.

Currently there is no issue with the time taken by the TPS Bulk
Harvesters but the performance is being monitored carefully and
investigations are taking place with B&TC.

REFERENCE DATA

Reference Data Summary

Reference data processing is split into three main components:

+ The processing of reference data changes received from POCL. This
takes place on the Host system,

+ The loading of non-core reference data changes into Riposte and
+ The loading of core reference data changes into Riposte.

The issues discussed in the December LSR concerning the high volume
of messages being processed on a small number of nights is in the
process of being resolved by changes to operational practices combined
with updates to the reference data applications.

The stress points in the reference data system are increasingly due to
operational requirements within Pathway to download new reference
data before a change is made to the system. Smoothing this operation
over a number of nights is not normally possible as new POCL generated
changes cannot be applied until the download of Pathway reference data
is complete.

During January and February the number of POCL generated changes
remained below the level predicted ['].

Reference Data Processing

Before the bulk loader agents can load reference data into Riposte the
data has to be extracted from the RDDS.

A number of changes have been applied to the extraction process (inc.
P2298) to improve performance. The situation will continue to be
monitored.

There is no available information on the amount of data being extracted.
Metrics have been added to the version of the application that will be
delivered at C14.

+ The prediction of the rate of reference data change was probably the most
difficult to- predict ay there way no information against which to- text the
prediction.

Based on the data that is available, the actions that have been put in
place by Pathway to manage the variability in the amount of reference
data processed appears to be having the desired effect. This will continue
to be monitored.

The RDDS extract load on 3"! March was due to multiple changes (undo

stamps being applied following the decision to alter the date of the price

Now Core Reference Data Loading

Reference data loading is done in one of two ways depending on whether
the reference data is core or non-core,

For non-core reference data changes, the reference data is loaded
directly from the host system into the Riposte message store for a
particular Post Office.

Figure S-3 - Elapsed Time to load non-core reference data into-
Riposte

In Figure 5-3 the long loading time on the 31 January corresponds to the
failure of an agent that required manual intervention by operations to
resolve.

Actions have been put in place to smooth the number of reference data
changes per night. CS has implemented a number of changes in
association with POCL that appear to be having the desired effect.

5.4 Core Reference Data Loading

For core reference data changes, the reference data is first loaded into
the message store for a ‘dummy’ Post Office on the Correspondence
Server. Once this is done the changes are then replicated from the
‘dummy’ Post Office to all the automated Post Offices on the
Correspondence Server.

In addition, when a new Post Office is automated the complete reference
data required for that Post Office is also replicated.

The number of core reference data changes loaded into the ‘dummy’
Post Office and the elapsed time to execute this process are shown
Figure 5-4.

The number of changes to core reference data were small but the elapsed
time of the loading process is fairly consistent as this is the default time
to run the process even when no changes are required. At Cl4 changes
will be made to the reference data system to stop the jobs running if no
changes are to be made.

The growth in the number of messages generated per day is following
the prediction but the model is currently under predicting the maximum
number of Riposte messages generated per day. The biggest
discrepancies identified are in:

+ The large volumes of reference data changes (see Sections)
+ The number of messages generated by cash accounting
+ The number of Riposte system messages.

messages generated for the month of March follows a similar pattern
then the models will be updated to reflect the actual measurements from
the live system,

6.1.1 Cash Accounting

The cash accounting process was one of the most difficult to estimate as
the volume of data generated is based on:

* The number of stock units in a Post Office and
* The number of trial balances generated by the postmaster.

Based on CSR(NR2) Live Trial data, the expected number of cash
accounting messages was approximately 1300 per Post Office per week.
An analysis of the Riposte message store data indicates the number is
currently nearer 1900 per Post Office.

As well as creating more messages per Post Office, postmasters are
taking much longer than was expected to complete cash accounting on a
Wednesday evening. The messages generated by cash accounting after
approx. 18:00 on a Wednesday evening are not processed ['] by the TPS
Bulk Harvester Agent until Thursday evening adding significantly to the
time to harvest TPS messages on a Thursday.

Figure 6-2 - Load over the Day due to- Cash Accounting

The red line (Wed 26/o1/o0) in Figure 6-2 shows the number of
Persistent Object created in Riposte. The difference between the number
of Persistent Objects created on a Wednesday afternoon/evening
provides a good indication of the load created by cash accounting and
when when cash accounting/stock roll-over is performed on the Post
Offices i.e.

* 10:00 ~ 16:00 for outlets that close Wednesday lunchtime
* 1730 21:30 for outlets that close at 17:30 on Wednesday

* Cash accounting also adds to the load on Thursdays up to lunchtime.

6.1.2 Riposte System Messages

The number of messages generated by Riposte functions e,
+ Log on/log off

+ End of day reports

+ Session transfers

+ ete.

is significantly greater than the prediction which was based on the
CSR(NR2) Live Trial system. The prediction was that 200 messages per
counter per day would be generated. Data from the live system indicates
that the number currently exceeds 500 per counter per day.

These messages are a function of the way the counter terminals are used
and not a function of the number of OBCS, EPOSS, APS, etc transactions
processed by the counter.

6.1.3 User Lock Requesty

CPs to remove unnecessary messages are being raised starting with
CP2253 which significantly reduces the number of User_Lock_Requests
generated by the counter. This will both reduce the number of messgaes
in the message store and significantly reduce the load on the Persistant
Object Index in the Correspondence Server during the peak hour.

CP2253 will be introduced at Cl3.2R2 i.e. before Cl4.

6.2 Size of Riposte Data

Until Riposte archiving is enabled [']the amount of data being generated
in the message store of the Correspondence Servers has been carefully
monitored.

The initial sizing of the message store was very conservative, as it was
difficult to predict the variability between the amount of data generated
by outlets of the same size (number of counters). A significant amount of
data about the content of the message store has been collected which
has allowed the target date for the switch on of Riposte Archiving to be
relaxed to March 2000 when the Riposte Integrity Checker will become
available.

The peak on the 30" January was due to the introduction of TPS
Reconciliation into the system.

with which significantly reduces the number of User_Lock_Requests
generated by the counter. This will both reduce the number of messgaes

6.3 Archiving

This section looks at Riposte archiving.

Riposte archiving is currently switched off at the data centres. This
section is therefore not reported on.

Riposte Archiving was originally switched off because of operational
problems that resulted in the archiving process interacting with other
processes running on the Correspondence Servers resulting in Riposte
failures.

These problems have been resolved but Archiving will remain switched
off until the SMC Support Server is introduced into service and the
Riposte Integrity Checker has been run on all Correspondence Servers to
ensure that there are no inconsistencies in the message store.

This is split into three sections:
+ The number of calls per day. + (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )
+ The call duration per day.
+ The peak usage of the routers (calls per second and ISDN lines in
use).
The phone calls are divided into 4 types:
@ Core - Made during the core part of the day (7am to 8pm). + Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

2+ Non Core - Made outside the core part of the day.
+ In — Calls into the data centre from the Post Offices.

ISON calls

Figure 7-2 - Average Number of ISDN Cally per Day per Outlet

Note: No data for outbound calls (calls from the datacentre) is currently available for
the period 19" January to the end of February.

The number of ISDN calls per outlet per day has been reduced by the
elimination of most of the network problems that resulted in multiple
calls being made.

The average number of calls per day is currently higher than expected
even though OBCS ‘foreigns’ are not being processed at most offices.
During the normal working day - 09:00-17:30 - 35 calls would be made
by Riposte synchronising every 15 minutes. Figure 7-2 confirms that this
is approx. the number of calls being made (Core-In).

The default broadcast interval was increased from 15 to 20 minutes at the
end of February and this has made caused a further small reduction in
the number of calls.

The challenge is to reduce the number of calls made for other reasons
e.g, there should be a negligible number of calls out during the core day.

'SDN Total Call Duration per Day - Average per Outlet

Figure 7-3 - Total Time of Telephone Cally per oudlet per day

Note: No data for outbound calls (calls from the datacentre) is currently available for
the period 19" January to the end of February.

The two periods of very long calls have been traced to a bug in Riposte.
The problem occurs when the NT clock wraps after approx. 49 days. Ifan
ISDN call is open at the time the clock wraps the call is not torn down as
expected and the line can remain open for many hours.

The cost to Pathway of ISDN calls is a function of the number and length
of calls. Prior to Christmas, a number of issues were identified:

+ CP 2135 - ISDN Timeout value

« Eicon network driver in the gateway counter PC

which were causing the ISDN connection to be regularly kept open
Jonger that was necessary to transfer data, Many of these problems have
now been resolved and the time the telephone line is in use per outlet
per day has dropped significantly.

The usage of phone lines is under investigation and further changes are
anticipated to reduce the duration of calls further.

Note: No data for outbound calls (calls from the datacentre) is currently available for
the period 19" January to the end of February.
‘The peak load is the number of calls during the peak second during the core
day. On several days (e.g. 12/13 January) there was more traffic out in the peak
second which is not the normal model for a weekday.
The number of calls in during the core day is currently lower than
expected because calls associated with OBCS ‘foreigns’ are not taking
place at present.

The peak number of ISDN lines in use has reduced considerably as
actions have been put in place to resolve problems. The number of lines
is still higher than predicted by the network model but is well within the
capability of the system. Currently 720 lines are available and when the
ISDN Routers are upgraded in March this will rise to 1440.
However, the usage should be lower and the usage of the ISDN network
including:
+ The source of calls
+ Eliminating unnecessary calls
+ Reducing the elapsed time of calls
+ Specific scheduling of overnight calls
are under review to determine the best way of reducing the total cost of
calls,

8 ISSUES
This section briefly describes a number of areas of concern that are being
investigated.
Note: An entry on this list does not necessarily mean it is a performance
problem that will require changes to fix it. Changes will only be
required if there is insufficient spare capacity in the system to
absorb the problem,
8.1 Under Investigation
The following are under investigation:
+ The number and total size of Riposte messages are much higher than+——{ Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

expected. On a typically day 30% of messages generated each day are
not processed by TPS. This can rise to 60% on Wednesday and
Thursday. The majority of this data is generated by counter
applications e.g. trial cash account balances, log on/off, etc. This is
impacting the elapsed time of the TPS Bulk Harvester.

* Reference data changes in support of system changes. These can
create a very heavy load on one night. Methods to spread the load are
under investigation.

8.2 Solutions Identified
A number of problems have been identified and are being resolved.
These will be fully reported on in the March LSR.

* The cause of the long ISDN network connect times has been
identified. The change to Riposte is in production.

8.3 Closed

+ A number of changes in the area of the ISDN network have been
applied and these have significantly reduced the incidences of long
calls and repeated short calls.
