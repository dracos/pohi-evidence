Iam employed by Post Office Ltd. a part of the Royal Mail Group as an Auditor
working within the Security & Audit section and have been so employed for

approximately 4 years though have been employed by the Post Office for about 8 years.

The role of the audit team is to carry out routine audits of Post Office Branches in order
to carry out verification of cash and stock as well as conduct certain compliance checks.
At times audits are specifically requested by the Retail Line Manager or by members of

the Investigation section.

On Tuesday 14 January 2003, I was part of a team of four auditors who attended
Rugeley MSPO, 18 Anson Street, Rugeley WS15 2BF on the request of the Investigation

section, this team was lead by Mr Glyn Burrows the Audit Manager.

Part of my role was to carry out the verification of the ‘AM’ stock unit which I was
aware was the Manager's stock and I also verified the ‘PH’ stock unit (philatelic stock).
The AM stock unit was the cash and stock held in the two safes in the back office, one of

these safes held mainly the bulk coin whilst the other safe held the banknotes.

Continyation of statement of Kevin ORGILL

In order to carry out this verification I would interrogate the Horizon computer system
and print off a Balance Snapshot for AM stock unit. This I did at 0819 hours and I
produce this printout as item number KO/01. This printout illustrates the amount of
cash and stock which should be held by this stock unit and it can be seen that this
printout indicates that there was £ 72,159.03 in cash, £ 282,000.00 in Foreign Currency
and £ 1,449.00 in National Lottery instant game cards, giving a total of cash and stock
within AM stock unit of £ 355,608.03.

I would initially start with counting the cash on hand and as I count each denomination
Inote it down on a form called the Security & Audit - Cash Summary, I now produce
the form I used for the cash verification as item number KO/02. I initially reached a
total figure of £ 68,916.98 as shown in the 1st column, however, some further
amendments were required which lead to the figures shown in the 24 column equating
to £69,191.98. Subsequently this figure was further changed when a further £70.96 was
located bringing the final figure up to £ 69,262.94.

I At the time, I wrote on the Balance snapshot (item KO/01) -2967.05 next to the cash

declared figure of £ 72,159.03, however, the final cash difference to what was indicated
on the snap shot was £ 2,896.09.

I then looked for the £ 282,000.00 worth of foreign currency, however I could not locate
it within either of the two safes and the staff who were present at the officé were asked
if there was anywhere else that stock or cash for the AM stock unit was stored, they
were not aware of any other stock or cash in relation to the AM stock unit and therefore

I put a cross sign next to the figure of £ 282,000.00.

Continuation of statement of Kevin ORGILL

The figure for the National Lottery instants changed by £10 making a total of £1,459.00
which meant that the physical amount of cash and stock held by the AM stock unit as of
14" January 2003 was £ 70,721.94 as opposed to what the snap shot declared of
£355,608.03, giving a difference of £ 284,886.09 of which £ 282,000.00 was as a result of

no foreign currency being on hand within this stock unit.
I then passed these figures and paperwork to Mr Burrows and then proceeded to verify

snapshot but not to any great extent, the figures were within £ 50 of each other.
