Hi Jane,
Thanks for taking the initiative on this.

It is too much in my view also. A NED needs to understand the Post Offices quickly. They can pick up any of the
issues we deal with (the long list of exec responsibilities) as we go. They can request meetings any time.

So my suggestions:

I would remove entirely the NEDs as they will meet them at dinner, and at the board, and will arrange 121s if
they want to. We’re not trying to create a team of NEDs, the opposite in fact. Where there is committee
membership involved, I’d arrange 30-60 mins before the first meeting with the chair and/or exec. Eg., Remco,
Ken would be happy to have Natasha there; Carla maybe/maybe not - the chair to decide.

I'd remove Martin E on strategy and on Identity. Strategy should be part of Owen, Debbie, Rob H and Al’s
briefs; 3YP numbers is Al; 3YP delivery is Rob.

I'd add Mark D to your briefing on GLO, not a separate meeting. But if there is something big happening re
Govt then yes and with Patrick B. Otherwise, I can cover off.

Td leave off HR - I'll cover that until we have a new GHRD and even then, I’m not sure it’s a big enough deal
immediately. (If we ended up with a NED with HR passion like Alice Perkins had, then of course).

To be clear all areas are important - but using the North Star, I can cover most then send them to where they
seem to have most interest.

I'd remove all of the other execs - it is up to the GE directors above to bring in support - but not to be
encouraged to do so, the GE needs to show we know the business. I would not field Rob Clarkson, unless he’s
with Owen and that’s Owen’s call.

But... I would offer Johann. I found a session with internal audit really helpful at Morrisons. And I would insist
on at least 2 days in the field across a range of POs with eg., Martin Rouse, Donna Poulter, Tom Moran, Pam
Heap; plus as you say Cash Supply chain (possibly with Martin Kearsley and Russell as hosts).

You did ask:))

Leaving aside the branch visits and EY, it’s what Tom has done already, and what Tim, Carla and Ken did when they
started.

Look, I think that’s too much and we will fail to deliver it but that’s just my opinion so happy to let you take it
forward. Not a die in the ditch issue for me it’s just more than I would be able to do do as a new NE and I
suspect I am not unique. Al

Many thanks

I think the GE meetings, other directors, EY and external visits should be ‘mandatory’; other meetings are, as you say,
more optional. Any suggestions as to additional background reading materials would also be helpful.

Thanks Jane. If this is a menu from which to select from, I think it is fine. If it is an expectation of what every
NE should do then it feels excessive and too big a time commitment?

I would elevate the visits outside FD and spend half a day being shown around shops and definitely the SC
visit - these should be very strongly recommended.

I think the 3YP shifts to me from Martin as the Strategy Director changes as it is essentially a financial plan.

All
With Tom Cooper joining the Board at the end of March, and Virginia Holmes’ successor currently being recruited, we
are reviewing the generic director induction programme. I know a number of us have now met Tom, however I would

like your thoughts on what the generic programme should include.

Attached is the ‘starter for 10’ — all suggestions as to people, materials and content, and visits would be very
welcome.

Many thanks,

Jane
