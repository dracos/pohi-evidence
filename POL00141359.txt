Subject: RE: Uppal

Jamail, as per our face to face conversation of today.

Given the circumstances around the jproper to the defendant, the potential “loss” of interview two and the

general circumstances relating to this case then I concur that prosecution should cease. This action, as we agreed, must
be portrayed as to in no way be connected with allegations of system integrity (Horizon challenge) and rather simply
reflect the defendant's health issues and associated problems this brings.

As we also discussed we may wish to wait a day or two prior to communicating this decision in order that we can establish
the basis for an alleged Abuse of Process claim
