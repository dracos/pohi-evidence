I have done the same and reached the same conclusion. Let’s discuss how to pitch this tomorrow.

Patrick

I've quickly reviewed the cases up for mediation decision this week. Unfortunately, I think POL is going to have to say
"no" to mediation on ail of them.

M001 — civil judgment given and not shown to be incorrect.
M003 — criminal case (faise accounting)

M029 — criminal case (false accounting)

M035 — criminal case (false accounting)

M052 — criminal case (theft and false accounting)

M062 ~ criminal case (caution for false accounting)

Happy to run through this in more detail / discuss how to pitch our arguments on each one.

Kind regards
Andy

Hi Patrick

You now have ail of the case files, which have been updated to include the final CRRs and Applicant responses (where
applicable). You might find it useful to look at the attached briefing note, which I produced with Andy P’s input for the
last face-to-face. I think all that’s needed for tomorrow is the headline summary table (Belinda / David, please confirm).

Best wishes

Jess

Yes, happy to do that. I will need to print the CRRs off, read them and then Andy and I can have a chat when he’s
available to do so.

To see.

This addresses a couple of the issues relating to how to deal with the cases which are back with SS following last week's
face to face.

A few other points to note:

We have a number of final CRRs on which to make a mediation assessment and, where we agree to mediation, let the
Working group know tomorrow, otherwise defer for the next face to face. David will be doing a short speaking note for
Chris tomorrow and he will need a couple of lines on each case, limited to yes we'll mediate or we want to discuss at the
face to face. (Patrick/Andy, would you please liaise over that?)

Note that SS has revised its recommendation on the final CRR for M052 ~ do have a look. POL’s position will be not to
mediate the case so this will be a face to face discussion.

Best wishes
Belinda

Belinda,
This is just to confirm that since last week's meeting the following Draft and Final CRRs have been uploaded to Huddle:
DRAFT
M065
FINAL
Mo01
M003
M029
M035
M052 *
Mmo62 **

* I believe that Ron has alerted you to this, which is referred to as Version 2A.
Given additional input received from the Applicant's PA the Mediation recommendation has been changed
from that in the Draft CRR.

** This is the revised version, produced following the request at last week's face to face meeting and is referred to
as V2.
This answers one of the concerns that you raised with me yesterday.

I understand that by the end of this week (26 September) the following Draft CRRs should also have been completed and
uploaded:

Mo05

M007

Mo11

M013

M073

May I suggest that you leave M039 as is but mark that it may be revisited once the Part Two Report has been finalised?
I will respond to Lucy in more detail on the scheduling of all cases.
