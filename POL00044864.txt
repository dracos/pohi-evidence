Mr Williams was happy that his client fully understood
the meaning of the caution. It was explained that the
reason for the interview was surrounding the audit
shortage of £48,454.87, which had been completed on
the morning of 13 October 2005 at Gaerwen Post
Office. A recap of the days events was captured in my
notebook which was read out to Mr Thomas. Mr Thomas
agreed that this was an accurate account of events.

3.37 HT The only comment I will make is that I was prepared to

make an interview at home, but probably I
misunderstood but you may correct me, but you went
and phoned someone to ask that, and I wanted Jim
Evans, my Federation Representive and who has taken
over the office in my absence, and from what I
understood, and maybe you can correct me, that you
weren't happy to do that.

DM What happened was, like we explained to you when we
arrived at your office, there were several avenues open
to us. One was a voluntary taped interview, the other
one, because of the amount involved was to involve the
police. We had to take one of them options because we
would rather sort this out sooner rather than later

HT I agree with you.

SB Are you happy with the reason why we are in here today
and the reason we are in Holyhead Police Station?

HT I understand

5.07 DM Ok so the audit took place and it produced the shortage
as we said of just over £48,000. Do you want to give us
an explaination of why there is that much short in your

accounts
HT At the moment I am not commenting. No comment
SB Do you know when the account was first short

HT Without looking through the papers I don’t. I’m sorry
SB Without looking at what papers?
HT The accounting papers
SB I understand your right to no comment but we have some

cash accounts

HT Yeah not saying, I am finding it very difficult to remember
what really went on a fortnight ago, let alone, there are
29 weeks gone in this year and without having the
evidence in front of me and looking at it in bare figures. I
am an old fashioned chap, im used to figures on paper
not on a screen.

6.21 DM Did you keep any other paperwork at home to do with
these losses

HT No everything is there. Everything you got or within the
Office is in the office

DM Because all we have taken from the office at this point is
the cash accounts.

HT All the paperwork is there, everything is there with the
weeks on everything. I wrap them up and what I cant
keep in the office is in the shed.

DM That's the daily and weekly work
HT Yes
DM Right but with regard to this loss was this money if we

say it built up over a period of time

HT Yes
DM I understand that you cant say to us that 12 months ago

it was £200 short and I know there was £21,000 locked
up in the safe. I fully understand that you are not going to
remember that, but did you keep any records of your own
to say well this week I am £200

HT No

DM Right so the only records you have got are 1) in your
daily and weekly envelope and 2) the records which have
been made on your cash account.

HT Yes, I have got no hidden agenda

DM Right so when we look at your cash accounts do you
declare or do you show on your accounts accurately the
state of your office in any particular week.

HT Well I cant comment really on that.

SB Do you understand your obligations as a subpostmaster
regarding office surplus’s and shortages

8.04 HT Yes
SB Do you like to explain what that obligation is
HT To make good any loss and take out any extra.
SB Ok and when was that to be made good
HT Sorry is it this loss your talking about now
SB No no any loss
HT Within the week or on that day as far as I can think of

SB Ok so when you balance for the benefit of Mr Williams

now , the cash account week runs Thursday to a
Wednesday, with you balancing on a Wednesday. You
show a shortage of £10, you are obliged by the terms of
your contract to make good that shortage

HT Yes

SB When you have been doing these cash accounts
whether it be for the last 6 months, 18 months or 2 years,
are there any occasions when you haven’t made good
these shortages

HT No Comment

SB Do you know when you started having shortages within
the Post Office

HT Without looking back im not quite sure

SB Have you ever made any of these shortages good

HT I have tried to

SB What do you mean by I have tried to

HT Whenever possible yes

SB Do you know which losses you have made good

HT Without looking back at the papers no

SB Any losses that you haven't made good did you know it

was wrong to do that
HT No
SB Would you like to explain why you didn’t think it was

wrong not to make good the loss when I would like to
remind you already explained to me that you understood
the terms of your contract

HT Yes I know

SB You had to make good the loss for that week

HT No comment

SB So you are declining to comment on why you thought it

was ok not to make good the shortages

HT Yes

SB The loss is £48,000 in cash and if I just use your last
balance which would have been completed yesterday
Wednesday 12" October

HT Yes

SB There was a shortage of £48,000 in cash and a couple of
hundred pounds, the rest of the loss is made up with
discrepancies within the stock. When that shortage was
discovered, did you make good that shortage

HT No

SB What did you do with that cash figure for that week 29.
HT No comment

SB Did you inflate the cash for that week

HT No comment

SB If as is transpired from the audit today, you said there

was in excess of £69,000 in the safe when in fact there

was only £21,000. Do you have any explanation of why
there is £48,000 short

HT No Comment

SB The previous week is it £48,000 short

HT No Comment

SB If we go through weeks 1 to week 29 of the current cash

account year 05/06 are any of them cash accounts a true
record of the cash declared when you have balanced the
office accounts each and every week.

HT No comment

SB For cash account year 04/05 which is 52 cash accounts
on each and every Wednesday when you have balanced
the accounts is that a true record of the cash locked up.

HT No comment
SB Who is responsible for doing the cash accounts
HT lam
SB Who signs the cash accounts
HT Ido
SB So if the cash locked up is not a true record, will you be
responsible
HT No comment
12.22 SB Who else works in the post office

HT I haven't had a holiday for 12 years

DM So every Wednesday for the last 2 years you personally

DM So every document if we check for the last 2 years it will
be your signature on them

HT Yes
DM And nobody else has worked in your office
HT Only my wife

SB So if today was the transfer and not the audit, would the

auditors still have found it £48,000 short

HT No comment

SB Have you got a buyer for the office

HT Yes

SB So you have got a buyer so you would expect to hand

over in a relatively short period of time

HT Yes

SB What when you have checked and the £48,000 is
missing, what would you say to the buyer, what’s your
explaination about the account being short

HT No comment

DM Were you hoping to repay that money prior to the
transfer of the office to the new people

HT No comment

DM Are you aware that when an office transfers it will be

subjected to a full cash and stock verification audit in
order to transfer it over to the new people

HT Yes

DM So were you making provision to put that money back
prior to the transfer in order that that transaction, the sale
of your business would go ahead

DM So if you weren't aware it wouldn't go ahead, what do
you think would happen

HT No idea
DM Had you thought about that or had you not considered
that yet
HT No
17.09 SB You have already said to Diane that you have not stolen

the money, so therefore, losses have occurred for
whatever reason, we appreciate you cant tell me, we
know the finishing time was yesterday, you cant
remember when you first started having losses which
you didn’t make good or which ones you didn’t make
good, is there any reason why you think you were having
losses in the office

HT Basic mistakes on the Horizon and not understanding it
SB Ok you say basic mistakes on the Horizon
HT If you check my error notices you will find out, that’s all I

will say at the moment

The error notices received recently into the office were
discussed with the most recent one being in the last
couple of weeks

19.00 DM When you said you had a £1500 error notice which you
think

Could be a payment of £15 that you have entered
incorrectly, when you got that error notice, did you have a
corresponding loss or gain showing in your account for

that
HT No
DM Why wouldn't you have a corresponding loss or gain
HT No comment
DM Because if you have taken a premium bond of someone

for £1500, in order to get the error notice, you have put
the transaction through incorrectly, is that right

HT Yes

DM Therefore you are going to have a corresponding loss at
the time of £1485 so when you get the error notice back
for that amount back they match up is that have error
notices work

HT Hopefully yes

DM You have a loss or a gain and somewhere down the line
it is picked up and its brought to account and then you

balance
HT Hopefully
DM Do you agree that’s how the system is set up to work
HT Yes

HT No comment
A further discussion took place around error notices

22.06 SB When was Horizon put into your office
HT Cant remember
SB If I say 2001 is that about right
HT You could be right yes
SB Because it is round about that period that 2 year period

that it was implemented.

HT Yes without looking at the paperwork

SB So you’ve had 4 maybe 5 years of the Horizon system

now while you say whatever you put in never came out
the same way, did you ever in them days it was a retail
line manager. Did you ever make any complaints to the

retail line.
HT In the beginning yes
SB You say in the beginning but when was the beginning
HT When it first came in
SB So during 2001 you made some complaints about the

Horizon system

HT Yes
SB What was done do you remember
HT I had to pay of the top of my head a certain sum which

CSO1SA Version 3.0 11/02
POL00044864
POL00044864

was only half of the loss POLC took the view that it was
partly my fault and partly the Horizon fault. But there was
a line manager available to talk to then, there isn’t now.
SB So since then the teething problems with Horizon come
in changing from one system to another with ecco or
Richard Jackson.

HT I had my own, cant remember what it was called

DM Capture

HT Capture

SB So the old pen and paper was 20 years ago.

HT Yes

SB So while you are unsure of the horizon system did you

request or get any extra training

HT Very little

SB By very little can you explain

HT I got one extra account on a Wednesday

SB And was that when horizon was first put in

HT Yes

SB So since 2001 what other complaints have you made if
any

HT I rang the helpline on quite a few occasions regarding 2

or 3 small matters really. And that’s all really but I have
been rebooting ive got a list at home of the amount of
times I have had to reboot over the last 12 months

SB So if we check with the helpline they will have a list of

HT I hope so yes I hope so. I haven't got it, I haven’t
unlocked it myself

SB These cash accounts and these shortages each week for
whatever period it has gone on, which has accumulated

to £48,000
HT Yes
25.19 SB Are you saying that the horizon system has contributed
oris responsible for this discrepancy
HT All I am saying ive got very very doubts about it
SB While you have got your doubts about the Horizon

system would you not agreed then or can you have any
other explaination of why there is £48,000 short in the
accounts if its not the horizon system

HT No
SB Have you given £48,000 out over the counter
HT Without checking and just being a basic man, I don’t
know
SB If I use the example if I come in and get my pension book
26.36 HT When the pension books I had a docket, with horizon I

have nothing till Wednesday. I may be talking too much
now but when I have looked I have seen a lot of zeros
coming up on the card accounts and the auditor this

CSO1SA Version 3.0 11/02
POL00044864
POL00044864

Tape Person Text

morning couldn't explain it to me. I don’t know what the
zeros mean or if I have been paying out and it hasn't
gone through the system. That is all I am prepared to say
SB Again while you have brought it up about the zeros we
may offer 1 or 2 explanations now. If I come in with my
card, not a card account but the banks what’s the most I
can draw out

HT Im not sure it depends on the bank, some allow £200,
Barclays do £300 because ive done a few and Lloyds do
£250. Alliance & Leicester depends if that person has
rang the bank up first and asked for a special withdrawal
SB Specials has got a phone audit

HT When I looked today there are 5 transactions with Lloyds
that have a zero.

SB That wasn’t every transaction though was it
HT No. Some of them went through but 5 were zero
SB And again we will check that out with the people at

horizon. Get the equipment in the office checked.
However, the explanation we believe why the zeros
come up is that if I come and put my card into the pin
pad and incorrectly enter my pin number it will tell you on
the other side that I have incorrectly put my pin number
in and I have to remove the card and redo it and it ends
the transaction so that is actually a transaction at zero

CSO1SA Version 3.0 11/02

money. Ok, The other one may be if I come in and ask to
withdraw on a Post Office Card then I come in put my
card in the pin pad, enter my pin number correctly and
ask to take all the money out. I may not have any money
in so that will come back as a zero. Now it is my opinion,
and that’s what I believe what the zeros are. I do not
believe that the zeros contribute to the loss of the
£48,000; however, we will check that out to ensure that
what I am saying is correct.

HT I would be very grateful

SB So if you haven't give the money out over the counter to
the customers, do you not agree then that for money to
go missing from the Post Office it has to be someone
that has access to the counter

HT No Comment

SB And if the money has been stolen from the Post office
again its yourself, your wife who has the major access
and your son and daughter you are the only 4 people
who have access to the counter. Anybody else have any
access to the counter

HT No no

SB Your responsible for the cash figures and you’re the one
who locks the money away in the safe at a night and puts
the time locks on. And locks the stock away

the office
HT No one at all
SB You told nobody. Is there any reason you told nobody
HT I was too worried
SB Well if you are making mistakes why would you be too
worried
HT I was
SB So this shortage is it one large or is it an accumulation of
shortages over a period of time
HT I will say no comment to that at the moment
SB Cos what I am trying to get at is you said you told nobody
because you were too worried but if it’s a build of
shortages after 2 or 3, you’re an experienced
subpostmaster as well as previous experience as a
postman, you understand the workings of how the post
Office in all its guises of Consignia and post office of its
importance of keeping true and accurate records. So you
have other people there if you are experiencing difficulties
with having shortages because £100 becomes £200

SB I understand that but again going back to the terms of your
contract but ultimately all the shortages cost you.

HT Yes

SB Even genuine shortages cost you. The balance is there to
help you, It’s your safeguard. If your paying out too much
money it will show up as a shortage. If that happens too
much you should go and seek help. You are a member of
the federation and your rep is the one who is working
today as the interim. Did you not speak to him and say you
are having problems

HT Could be

SB Was it one large loss that somebody has stolen from the
Post Office

HT No

SB Do you suspect anybody else

HT No
