John,

Agreed, we may not want to do that, and I haven’t suggested to WBD that we might... but obviously they will now
realise.

At least we now know what the cut off was.

Matthew,

The last Peak provided was PC0273139, so they would not have access to this.

The latest Peak is PCO277487, so they are ‘missing’ 4,348 Peaks.

Do we really want to start sharing more Peaks unless they request them as I can only expect more requests to deep
dive investigations from them?

Regards
John

Steve,
In relation to Bug 28 it was suggested to WBD that PC0273234 was another example (originally with a typo as
PC0237234). It looks like WBD don’t have that one; it was raised on 21-Aug-2018, I think that’s almost to the day that

John did the extract which was provided to them.

Could you confirm that is the case that it wasn’t included? I can send a copy of that one to them for now, but just

wondering if we should clarify with them (and all round) which was the latest Peak we already provided, and how
many new Peaks there are since then, and whether we should update them?

Hi Matthew

Thank you for your responses to this summary and confirming the ARQ request has been passed onto the security
team. I can see that you've sent over the correct Peak reference for the 2018 Peak. Can I just check this is a Peak
that WBD have been given? We can't seem to locate PC0273234 on Relativity so wanted to make sure but apologies
if this is something wrong our end.

Kind regards

Katie

Matthew,

We have prepared our summary on the Drop and Go Bug, copy attached, and should be grateful for Fujitsu's input.
We have also reached out to Post Office with a request to put us in touch with ATOS to investigate the outcome
further and have also asked Post Office to confirm whether or not a TC was issued here.

Kind regards
