 Because I want to prove that there is FFFFiiinnn no "Case for the Justice Of Thieving Sub Postmasters" and
 that we were the best Investigators they ever had and they were all crooks !! Oh and we never hit our PO
 Profit targets anymore as we stopped getting LXX million in recoveries from bloody good financial recoveries
 through my good friends Ward, Harbinson, Posnett and the like!

 End of Rant ! ! Hence why Scott had to get rid of us cos we is right and spoke out ! ! ! Power To The People
 Wolfie Smith !!

 Alright my old Gunner Mate ? lol
