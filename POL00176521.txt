Because | want to prove that there is FFFFiiinnn no “Case for the Justice Of Thieving Sub Postmasters” and
that we were the best Investigators they ever had and they were all crooks !! Oh and we never hit our PO
Profit targets anymore as we stopped getting £XX million in recoveries from bloody good financial recoveries
through my good friends Ward, Harbinson, Posnett and the like !!

End of Rant !! Hence why Scott had to get rid of us cos we is right and spoke out !!! Power To The People
Wolfie Smith !!
