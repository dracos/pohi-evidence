Comments on Briefing Paper for CAPS....

1, Are all phases of testing being taken into account in judging the readiness for start
_ ofMOT (9g. all system tests, security and technical testing and Business
Integration Testing)? It would seem from the paper that they are not and I suggest
that they should.

2. Model Office is essentially designed to prove the integration of the system and the
procedures, however, no mention has been made of the status of the user
procedures. Experience would indicate that the critical path into MO is through the
‘user documentation not the system.

3. Given the comment on Pathway operational errors one must question the existence
or adherence of Pathway themselves to orderly behaviour.

4. Experience would indicate that the problems faced by Pathway are systemic ind
will not be solved by the fixing the faults which are currently identified. Does this
prognosis take account of the proven lack of capability in the Pathway domain and
the absence of appropriate documentation to support rapid fault fixes.

5. The general impression at this time is of a system lacking stability. Whilst
supporting the aim of achieving stability prior to the start of MOT the current level
of fault fix and design code change will not deliver the desired result. Finally all in
Horizon must understand that testing will not prove financial integrity. It may
increase confidence, however, given the approach to design and development that
has been adopted by Pathway we must expect many more problems.
