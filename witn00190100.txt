                               FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ALAN RONALD COOK




            I, Alan Ronald Cook, will say as follows:


            Introduction

                1. I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd ("POL") and held the position of Managing

                    Director ("MD") between 1 March 2006 and mid-February 2010. Prior to 1 March 2006, I

                    held the position of Independent Non-Executive Director ("NED") on the POL Board

                    between 23 February 2005 and 28 February 2006.



                2. This witness statement has been prepared in response to a request made by the Post

                    Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the "Inquiry") pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules, dated

                    21 September 2023 (the `Request") and a Letter from the Inquiry dated 5 December

                    2023 requesting further information (the "Second Request"). The facts in this witness

                    statement are true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.


                3. My recollection of the period in question is as one would expect, in that my memories are

                    not particularly clear. That said, I have studied the documents provided to me by the

                    Inquiry and they have prompted my memory to some degree. The Request identified 59

                    questions, and the Second Request identified a further 3 questions to be addressed and

                    I have done so to the best of my ability in this statement.



                4. I have been assisted in preparing this witness statement by my legal representatives,

                    Farrer & Co LLP.


            Background and early career

                5. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications until joining

                    Post Office Limited ("POL"). I have had a long and varied career working in both the

                    public and private sectors, mostly with a focus on financial services. Starting work after

                    school, I worked my way up to executive level and have held Chief Executive Officer

                    ("CEO") and Non-Executive Director ("NED") positions at a number of organisations.


                6. I joined Prudential Assurance Company ("the Prudential") on 7 September 1970 having

                    left school at the age of 16. I completed the Chartered Insurance Institute examinations

                    at the age of 21 and subsequently became a Chartered Insurer. In 2005 I was elected a

                    Fellow of the Chartered Management Institute. I was employed by the Prudential for 31

                    years and performed a range of roles of increasing seniority across all functions and

                    lines of business until September 2002. This included a 3-year assignment to the USA

                    as Senior Vice President of Jackson National Life, a Prudential subsidiary. My final role

                    at Prudential was Chief Operating Officer for UK and Europe. From September 2002 to

                    February 2006, I was Chief Executive Officer of National Savings and Investments

                    (NS&I).


                7. I have been asked to describe what experience I had in respect of managing or

                    overseeing (a) a large IT system such as the Horizon IT System ("Horizon") and (b) a

                    company involved in the prosecution of criminal offences prior to joining POL.


            8. During the latter part of my career, I held senior positions in organisations that had large

                 scale IT systems. For example, between October 1999 and September 2002, I had

                                                             Page 2 of 39

                                                                                                             WITNO0190100

                 responsibility for all operational matters in Prudential UK which included oversight of

                 `PruTech'. This was a joint venture company between Prudential and Accenture, who were

                 responsible for supplying and running much of the technology used for the business

                 undertaken by Prudential. The CEO of PruTech' was supplied by Accenture and reported

                 directly to me. As CEO of NS&I, I had ultimate responsibility for the technology support

                 supplied by Siemens Business Services who reported in to NS&I through one of my direct

                 reports. That said, whilst I had oversight of IT and was involved in technology to an extent, it

                 was always as a chief user, rather than as a technician. My involvement was, for the most

                 part, dealing with contractual and commercial issues, rather than technical issues.


            9. I had no previous experience working for an organisation that was involved in prosecuting

                 criminal offences.


             Joining POL as a NED


                10. I have been asked to set out the background to my appointment as NED of POL on

                    23 February 2005, including any application and interview process.



                11. My working relationship with POL began when I first joined NS&I, as POL was the

                    primary distribution channel for NS&I products. The relationship between the two

                    organisations, however, was poor. Each side felt that the other was not fully

                    committed to the relationship. NS&I products had historically been sold exclusively

                    through the Post Office but at that time, NS&I had also started to roll out its own

                    online sales, partly because it felt that the Post Office wasn't giving NS&I products

                    enough priority, but also because this was seen as meeting a developing customer

                    need.



                12. I made it a priority to establish a strong relationship with David Mills, the CEO of POL

                    at the time. The relationship strengthened quite quickly, and I always felt that it was


                                                             Page 3 of 39

                                                                                                            WITNO0190100

                    because of that improved relationship with Mr Mills that Sir Mike Hodgkinson, POL

                    Chairman, approached me and asked if I would be prepared to join the POL Board as

                    a NED. I understand that I was approached because the POL Board had decided that

                    further independence on the Board would be desirable.


                13. I have been asked to provide a summary of the roles I held at POL. I became a NED on

                    the POL Board in February 2005. I do not recall the exact date.


                14. As far as I am aware, I do not think POL ran a full recruitment process. I was initially

                    concerned that there might be a conflict of interest given that POL was a distributor for

                    NS&I, but POL were very keen to have me on the Board, as were the NS&I Executive

                    team who saw it as an opportunity to further strengthen the relationship between the

                    organisations. The CEO of Bank of Ireland ("BOI") was already on the Board and BOI

                    was partnering with POL to deliver products as part of the expanding POL financial

                    services proposition. On that basis, I accepted the invitation to join the POL Board,

                    conscious of the need to ensure that I would act as a NED of POL and not just as a

                    representative of NS&I. I received no remuneration from POL for being a NED and

                    there was no change to my NS&I remuneration. However, as set out above, the

                    position was beneficial for both POL and NS&I and enabled me to strengthen the

                    relationship between the two organisations.


                15. I have been asked to explain whether the possibility of me becoming MD of POL in

                    the future was discussed prior to me becoming a NED on its Board. At no stage

                    before, or during the process of joining the POL Board was the possibility of me

                    becoming Managing Director of POL in the future discussed.


                16. The time commitment sought from me during my time as NED was about 2 days per

                    month, although that was difficult to quantify because there was other contact as a

                    result of my role as the CEO of NS&I. There was undoubtedly a level of synergy

                    between the two roles. By today's corporate governance standards, 2 days per

                                                             Page 4 of 39
                                                                                                           WITNO0190100
                                                                                                         WITNO0190100

                    month is probably a little below average. The Bank of England guidelines in Financial

                    Services today will typically look for a base commitment of 3 days for a standard NED

                    role with no other Committee Chairmanship responsibilities.


                17. I have been asked to list all other directorships I held whilst a NED. I held no other

                    directorships while I was a NED on the POL Board.


                18. I have been asked to describe the nature of my role as NED of POL. POL was the first

                    time I had been a NED, but I was nevertheless very clear that I had statutory

                    responsibilities as a Director of POL and a duty to challenge management on any

                    aspect of the business and their proposed approach to both the running of the

                    business and the direction in which POL was being taken.


                19. Whilst I sought to engage myself across the business as a whole, it did, however,

                    strike me that the primary contribution the Board wanted me to make was centered on

                    my extensive experience in retail financial services and how POL could further

                    develop its own offering.


            POL Corporate Structure and the POL Board


                20. I have been asked to explain POL's corporate structure upon my appointment as

                    NED. POL was a legal entity in its own right but a wholly owned subsidiary of the

                    Royal Mail Group (RMG). At that time, RMG was solely owned by HM Government

                    and oversight was conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry at the time

                    (which then became the Department for Business Industrial Strategy, then the

                    Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform). RMG was made up of

                    four businesses, including POL. POL was the most politically sensitive as it was

                    rooted in the communities it served and had a social obligation, in a sense, to

                    maintain post offices in villages around the country. HM Government was very aware

                    of the importance of post offices to communities, to the extent that during my tenure


                                                             Page 5 of 39
                                                                                                           WITNO0190100
                                                                                                         WITNO0190100

                    as MD and in response to my proposals to close certain branches to cut costs, HM

                    Government introduced an annual "Social Network Payment" to keep open those

                    branches that were not financially viable.



                21. I have been asked to summarise the corporate structure of POL in relation to Royal

                    Mail and identify who was responsible for decision making. Ultimate accountability for

                    POL lay with the RMG Board. However, the RMG Board was keen to devolve as

                    much power and autonomy as was reasonable. POL did not have the "normal"

                    committees you might expect to see in an organisation, for example, an Audit

                    Committee or a Remuneration Committee. Those committees sat at RMG level. The

                    lack of a POL Audit Committee, did, in retrospect, create some ambiguity over how

                    certain monitoring activities were undertaken. Later in this statement I detail my

                    experience with the Horizon system at an executive level, how complaints about

                    Horizon were dealt with and my knowledge of prosecutions and proceedings.


                22. I have been asked to summarise how the POL Board operated when I joined POL as

                    NED. During my time as a NED on the POL Board, the Board met approximately

                    every two months, although I have not been provided with copies of minutes of Board

                    meetings held between 23 February 2005 and 17 August 2005, so I cannot say for

                    certain. Sir Mike Hodgkinson was Chairman of POL (and Deputy Chairman of RMG),

                    at the time and his leadership style was professional, friendly and open. It was

                    possible to challenge views expressed by other Board members without causing

                    offence. I understand that the agenda was determined by the POL CEO and the

                    Chairman. As a NED I had no input into agenda setting. Attendance at the Board

                    meetings comprised of the POL Chairman, POL CEO, RMG Chairman, HR Director,

                    Finance Director, Banking and Financial Services Director, Chief Operating Officer,

                    Marketing and Sales Director and two NEDs, including myself and the CEO of BOI.

                    There was a Risk and Compliance Committee (about which I detail more at


                                                             Page 6 of 39
                                                                                                           WITNO0190100
                                                                                                         WITNO0190100

                    paragraphs 58-67) that I understood met quarterly, however I do not recall attending

                    one of these meetings whilst I was NED. I did not, and do not have access to the

                    reports that were regularly submitted to the Risk and Compliance Committee when I

                    was a NED nor am I aware who submitted them.



                23. I have been asked to consider, with hindsight, whether the level of IT expertise

                    amongst the members of the Board was adequate to maintain appropriate

                    governance. No member of the Board was an IT professional, however I felt at the

                    time that the level of IT expertise amongst the members was adequate to maintain

                    appropriate governance. It is the case nowadays that the Bank of England insists that

                    new fintech bank Boards have a NED who is an IT professional. With hindsight I can

                    see how this could also be beneficial, from a governance perspective to other large

                    organisations (outside of regulated industries), particularly those organisations that

                    have a high dependency on IT systems, like POL and Horizon.


            POL Corporate Governance


                24. I have been asked whether I considered POL's corporate governance to be effective

                    when I joined the company. Initially, I found the operation of the POL Board to be

                    professional and efficient. However, over time, I came to realise that the Board's

                    scope was not as broad as I would have expected. As set out in paragraph 48, there

                    were aspects of governance that were overseen at RMG Board level that, as a POL

                    only' NED, I did not have sight of. For example, the financial year end audit

                    undertaken by the external auditors.




            Reporting lines

DocuSign Envelope ID: D83F6567-7EBO-455C-9442-BD5B0965889F




                25. I have been asked to summarise the nature and extent of any reporting lines between

                    the POL executive management team or the POL Board and Royal Mail and the

                    Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and/or Department for

                    Business, Innovation and Skills.



                26. During my time as a NED, I understood that the POL CEO reported directly to the

                    RMG Chairman. The POL Finance, Legal, HR and IT Directors reported to the POL

                    CEO but also had reporting responsibility to their counterpart Senior Executive in

                    RMG. As a NED, I was not well sighted as to the nature and formality of the links

                    between RMG and the sponsoring government department. I certainly received

                    updates at our Board meetings on the outcome of discussions with government

                    departments, but I cannot characterise the nature of, or attendance at those

                    conversations.


                 Knowledge of Horizon as NED


                27. I have been asked what knowledge I had of Horizon when I joined POL as a NED.

                    When I joined POL as a NED, I had no prior knowledge of Horizon. As part of my

                    NED induction, I visited a number of different types of Post Office branch and saw the

                    system in operation in a branch setting. I also met with, and received briefings from,

                    individuals in Head Office responsible for the running of the system. As a result, I felt

                    that I had gained a good understanding of the system on a broad scale, both in terms

                    of functionality and the high numbers of concurrent users. I recall asking about

                    reliability in terms of system availability and accuracy. Availability seemed to be good

                    and I was assured at the time that there no critical bugs or defects. I would consider a

                    critical bug to be a bug that has an adverse impact on customers, or system users

                    (i.e. Post Office staff), or that causes a loss of system availability. A critical bug, in my

                    view, would render a system unusable until it is fixed. One thing that did stand out to



                                                             Page 8 of 39
                                                                                                                          WITNO0190100
                                                                                                                        WITNO0190100

                    me, however, was the all-encompassing nature of the system and the very large

                    dependency the business had on it being constantly available and working reliably.



                28. I have been asked to set out the detail of any briefing I received on the contract

                    between POL and Fujitsu relating to Horizon. As part of my induction, I was also given

                    a briefing on the Horizon contract between POL and Fujitsu relating to Horizon.

                    Therefore, I had an awareness of the contract. The POL Board often discussed

                    specific contractual issues that were relevant to the Board, including those relating to

                    the Horizon contract with Fujitsu.


                29. I have been asked to consider page 22 of Annex to Second Supplement

                    Agreement [POL00090428], the contract between POL and ICL Pathway Limited

                    and can only assume that this is an agreement governing the provision of the Horizon

                    system to POL. Page 22 sets out "Part D — TIP Interface — Accounting Integrity" and

                    sets out three criteria to be met by 14 January 2000:


                     "(i) during the period from 3' October 1999 until 14t'' January 2000 the percentage of

                     Cash Accounts received by POCL across the TIP interface containing Cash Account

                     Discrepancies shall not exceed 0.6 per cent, of all such Cash Accounts;

                     (ii) during the period from 3' October 1999 until 141'' January 2000 no Cash Account

                     Discrepancy shall arise as a result of a cause previously reported to POCL as having
                     been




                             remedied;




                     (iii) all                 causes of Cash Account Discrepancies identified after the date of this
                                         new




                     Agreement shall have been properly analysed by the Contractor and suitable

                     rectification plans therefor submitted to POCL in reasonable detail within ten days of

                     the Contract becoming aware of such Cash Account Discrepancy."



                     I was not directly aware of this clause, or that POL had a contractual right to take

                     action if cash discrepancies went above a certain percentage or number. In any

                                                                     Page 9 of 39

                                                                                                            WITNO0190100

                     event, this clause relates to a period of time in late 1999 to early 2000, which was

                     long before I joined POL as a NED in 2005.


                     I have been asked to consider the POCL and ICL Pathway Third Supplemental

                     Agreement [FUJO0118186] between Post Office Counters Ltd and ICL Pathway

                     Limited and again assume that it is an agreement governing the provision of the

                     Horizon system to POL. I have considered Clause 5.3 in particular, which states that:


                     5.3 The Contractor shall from the date of this Agreement until the end of the TIP

                     Integrity Checking Period make available to POCL promptly upon request

                     appropriate experts to explain to POCL the Contractor's analysis of all root causes of

                     Cash Account Discrepancies and the measures which the Contractor shall have

                     implemented in order to prevent the recurrence of any Cash Account Discrepancies

                     which would not have been detected by the Accounting Integrity Control Release.



                     I can confirm that I was not directly aware of this clause, but I would have assumed,

                     at the time, that a clause like this was present in the contract. I cannot recall such a

                     situation being escalated to me during my time with POL.



                30. I have been asked to set out what steps I took, if any, to increase my knowledge of

                    Horizon. I consider that my NED induction training on both the operation of Horizon

                    and the contractual position with Fujitsu was sufficient to contribute adequately as a

                    NED on the POL Board. When I was appointed MD of POL then I undertook much

                    greater familiarisation that went as far as being `counter trained' which resulted in me

                    working at a counter in a Crown Post Office for a whole day.

                31. I have considered Post Office Limited Board Minutes of 23/02/2005 [POL00021487]

                    ("23 February 2005 Minutes"); POL Board Meeting Minutes [POL00032147] ("17

                    August 2005 Minutes"); Post Office Limited Board Meeting Minutes [POL00021489]

                    ("19 October 2005 Minutes); Meeting minutes: minutes of the Board meeting held at

                    Bank of Ireland [POL00021490] ("14 December 2005 Minutes") and Meeting

                    minutes: Boarding meeting minutes held at 148 Old Street in London [POL00021491]

                    ("9 February 2006 Minutes"). These minutes cover Board meetings held during the

                    period from 23 February 2005 to 9 February 2006 when I was a NED at POL. I do not

                    recall how often the Board met, however based on these minutes (if they are a full

                    set), the Board met roughly every two to three months.



                32. I have been asked to set out to what extent the POL Board, prior to my appointment

                    as MD, would discuss the Horizon system; actual or alleged integrity issues in Horizon

                    or the actual or possible existence of BEDs; SPMs difficulties in balancing their

                    branch accounts; RMG or POL's investigation of the cause of shortfalls in branch

                    accounts when POL or RMG prosecuted or brought proceedings against SPMs or

                    other staff; and RMG/POL's prosecutorial function and whether it fulfilled it

                    appropriately.



                33. As set out in those minutes [POL00021487], [POL00032147], [POL00021489],

                    [POL00021490] and [POL00021491] and based on my recollection, the Board

                    discussed Horizon substantively three times in these meetings. Two of those

                    conversations related to the business case for the proposed Horizon Next

                    Generation'. The third conversation, whilst not entirely related to Horizon, related to

                    the proposed IMPACT programme and authority was given to proceed. IMPACT was

                    an abbreviation for "Improved Accounting" and I set out further detail about this at

                    paragraph 37. I do not recall, nor do the minutes show that there were conversations



                                                             Page 11 of 39

                    or discussions about actual or alleged integrity issues in Horizon. Personally, I was

                    unaware that there was any actual or potential issue at that time.


                34. There was no report of, or discussion about, sub-postmasters' ("SPMs") difficulties in

                    balancing their accounts, nor was there discussion about RMG or POL's investigation

                    of the cause of shortfalls in branch accounts, prosecutions or proceedings against

                    SPMs or other staff, or RMG or POL's prosecutorial function.


                35. I have been asked to consider an entry in the 23 February 2005 Minutes

                    [POL00021487] at POLB05/08 which details the Board's discussion about "Horizon —

                    Next Generation" as set out earlier in paragraph 33. The minutes state that:


                     "Assurance was provided to the Board that the new system would have at least a

                     similar standard of current capability."


                36. This was the first POL Board meeting I had attended. It was clear to me during the

                    course of the meeting that an objective of the "Horizon — Next Generation" project was

                    to address the high cost of running the system and improve performance in terms of

                    speed and reliability. At the time, Horizon took so long to run overnight that

                    sometimes it would not be ready for post office staff, in some or all of the branches, to

                    use the following morning at opening time. These issues needed to be remedied and

                    they were the focus of this project. Any functional enhancements would have been

                    best tackled as separate projects, as when introducing performance improvements

                    into a system, it makes sense to minimise functional change at the same time. This is

                    because the testing of performance changes becomes much easier and therefore

                    more reliable, if new functionality is not being tested at the same time.



                37. I have been asked to consider the entries at POLB05/16 of the 23 February 2005

                    Minutes [POL00021487] and POLB05/79 of the 17 August 2005 Minutes

                    [POL00032147] in respect of the IMPACT programme. I have been asked about my

                                                             Page 12 of 39

                    knowledge of the IMPACT programme at this time. I recall that there was an update

                    on the IMPACT programme at that meeting, but I had no further knowledge of that

                    programme at the time, other than the information contained in that update. As set out

                    in the 17 August 2005 Minutes [POL00032147], the objective of the IMPACT

                    programme was to save costs, replace obsolete back-office systems, improve branch

                    and client accounting, improve debt recovery, save time in branches and improve

                    stock control.


                38. I have been asked to set out what Peter Corbett said about "concern regarding debt

                    recovery'. I understood this to mean that was a function of the system that was being

                    changed and upgraded. It was naturally a sensitive area and as detailed in the

                    minutes he went on to set out "measures to mitigate these risks..!...communication

                    to branches, and stakeholder management". I have been asked to what extent the

                    Board considered the consequences to SPMs of removing their ability to roll over into

                    a new trading period with a disputed discrepancy held in a suspense account. I do not

                    recall there being any reference to this, nor do the minutes show that was discussed. I

                    can see now, having studied the documents and with the benefit of hindsight, that this

                    functional change was significant, however I do not recall being aware of, or

                    discussing it.


                39. I have been asked to consider the entry at POLB 05/104 of the 19 October 2005

                    Minutes [POL00021489] and set out what the Board was told about legacy Horizon

                    and Horizon Online/Next Generation, in particular what was said about ""improved

                    availability" and "cost-effective service management". The minutes show that the

                    Board discussed the "Horizon Proposition" on 19 October 2005. Part of that

                    presentation set out key features of the proposal, including `improved availability" and

                    "cost-effective service management". My recollection is that those features would be a

                    consequence of the enhanced reliability of the "Next Generation" system i.e., system

                    availability in branches would be higher and less effort would be required in service

                    management to maintain that level of availability.


                40. I have been asked to consider the 9 February 2006 Minutes [POL00021491] at

                    POLB06/26(c) and explain what the Board was told, and what questions it asked,

                    about the perceived need to roll out software to enable network improvement. In that

                    Board meeting, there was a discussion about network resilience, including that

                    "Software to enable network improvements was now in [the] advanced stages of

                    testing and was on track for deployment in April". I recall this conversation as it was

                    the first occasion on which I was made aware that prolonged downtime, in certain

                    branches, had been a problem. My impression had previously been one of greater

                    reliability. The Board were assured that whilst there had been problems, they had

                    been limited to a relatively small number of branches and the number of affected

                    branches was continuing on a downward trend (As per the 9 February 2006 Minutes

                    [POL00021491], "Prolonged loss of network connectivity in individual branches

                    continued on a downward trend"). After that discussion, my view was that it was

                    important for these network improvements to be safely implemented in April 2006 as

                    planned.


             Views on responsibilities of Board whilst a NED


                41. I have been asked to summarise my views on the responsibilities of a Board of

                    directors in the operation of a company solely owned by HM Government, on respect

                    of oversight of criminal prosecutions; oversight of civil litigation; oversight of the

                    Company's IT; oversight of accounting systems and oversight of compliance with the

                    Race Relations Act 1978 and the Equality Act 2010, it is typical for a Board's Audit

                    Committee to receive regular management reports and internal and external audit

                    reports in order to satisfy itself that adequate controls are in place and that

                    performance is acceptable. As set out in paragraph 21, POL did not have a dedicated

                    Audit Committee as this was positioned at the RMG level and that Audit Committee

                    reported directly to the RMG Board. In that sense, the POL Board was not provided

                    with a complete view, but the RMG Board, as the parent, would, and should, have had

                    the opportunity to satisfy itself through the operation of both the POL Board and the

                    RMG Audit Committee. During my time as a NED, I was given limited visibility of

                    reporting to the RMG Audit Committee, but I was assured it was received and

                    monitored at Group level. It is the case that there was discussion about the Horizon

                    system at the POL Board, but that discussion was purely in the context of the

                    commercial and contractual relationships with suppliers of technology.



                42. I have been asked whether I was ever told that there were no systemic issues with

                    Horizon or problem with integrity prior to February 2009. I do not recall being told at

                    any time, whilst a NED, that there were or were not, systemic issues with Horizon or

                    problems with integrity.


            POL's role in prosecuting postmasters at the time ofjoining POL as NED


                43. I have been asked to set out what I knew of POL's role in prosecuting postmasters,

                    managers and counter assistants for theft and false accounting when I was appointed

                    as NED. At the time of my appointment as NED, I was unaware of POL's power to

                    prosecute SPMs, managers and counter assistants for theft and false accounting. It

                    therefore follows that while I was NED at POL, I had no knowledge that POL was

                    prosecuting SPMs and I did not consider what risks and/or compliance issues could

                    arise from POL engaging in these activities.



                44. I have been asked to explain to what extent the Board and/or its subcommittees

                    discussed POL's role in prosecuting or brining civil proceedings using data from

                    Horizon. I do not recall the Board or any of its sub-committees discussing POL's role

                    in prosecuting or bringing civil proceedings using data from Horizon.

            Appointment to MD



                45. I have been asked to describe the background to my appointment as MD, including

                    any application process I went through. During my time as a NED on the POL Board, I

                    was approached by Allan Leighton (Chairman) and subsequently Adam Crozier

                    (Group CEO of RMG) to discuss my interest in taking on the role of Managing Director

                    of POL. I would be replacing the current CEO of POL, David Mills. I do not believe

                    that anyone else had been approached for the position at that time, although I cannot

                    say that with complete certainty. I was initially unsure and, in particular, sought

                    clarification as to why the job title would change from CEO to MD. My concern was

                    that they envisaged a "less separate" existence for POL than had been the case in the

                    recent past, and therefore I wondered if I would be held accountable for the success,

                    or otherwise, of the business without having full control of the necessary levers. Over

                    time, this proved to be correct and I discuss this further at paragraph 99 in relation to

                    my departure from POL.



                46. In discussions over a number of weeks, I was persuaded that I would have sufficient

                    control of POL but the Chairman and CEO of RMG were keen for RMG to be run as a

                    more cohesive Group. I could see that this was not an unreasonable aspiration on the

                    part of RMG. I therefore accepted the role of MD with the understanding that I would

                    have full accountability and responsibility for the POL business but that I would be

                    dependent on RMG for delivery, or oversight, of certain central functions. For

                    example, HR, Legal, Finance and IT.


                47. I have also been asked what my responsibilities were in respect of Horizon and POL's

                    use of Horizon data to prosecute or bring proceedings against SPMs and employees.

                    In respect of Horizon, I understood that I had full accountability for the system even

                    though some aspects of that accountability were influenced, or even run, by RMG. For

                                                             Page 16 of 39

                                                                                                             WITNO0190100

                    example, the Group IT Director at RMG had ultimate accountability for the Horizon

                    system as parts of it were run on the RMG platform, through the RMG network and for

                    certain aspects, out of the same computer centre. The person in charge of Horizon at

                    POL also reported to that Group IT Director.


                48. I have been asked whether there had been any changes to POL's corporate structure,

                    or my knowledge of Horizon, from the time I joined POL until February 2009. During

                    my time as MD of POL, whilst there were no significant changes to the POL corporate

                    structure, Legal and Finance oversight, in particular, at the RMG level was increasing.

                    I took some comfort from that professional oversight in terms of the professional

                    standards that were being exercised in those functions, regardless of whether the

                    individuals were in POL or the central functions themselves. After my appointment to

                    MD, I received further Horizon briefings on a periodic basis and also had regular

                    meetings with the POL Operations Director, who reported to me.



                49. I have been asked why the POL Board minutes do not include reference to BEDs in

                    the Horizon system and why the Board did not discuss BEDs in the Horizon system.

                    During my time as NED (and MD), the Board did not discuss BEDs (bugs, errors and

                    defects) in the Horizon system. The Board were unaware of any BEDs in the Horizon

                    system that were contributing to or causing fraud losses at that time and therefore

                    they were not discussed at Board level.


                50. I have been asked why I think the Board failed to adequately oversee Horizon and/or

                    POL's use of its data to prosecute or bring civil proceedings. The level of oversight of

                    Horizon whilst I was NED and MD was broadly in line with my experience at other

                    organisations. I do believe with the benefit of hindsight, however, that there was a

                    potential failure in monitoring the key financial reconciliations, particularly in respect of

                    losses. This monitoring should have been happening both within POL and RMG's

                    Finance departments and also picked up in annual external audits. Based on my high-

                                                             Page 17 of 39

                    level knowledge of the system, I cannot understand why there weren't reconciliation

                    differences at a system level, if money was going missing. Perhaps the system was

                    not picking up the reconciliations correctly, but I cannot say for certain. This resulted

                    in a delay in recognising that there was in fact, a problem. Had the problem been

                    identified earlier, it would have prompted a detailed analysis of the Horizon system.


            Horizon oversight as MD


                51. I have been asked to set out how my paper on the Horizon Replacement project was

                    prepared and how I satisfied myself on the "Background" and "Benefits" section. The

                    Horizon Replacement project was well underway when I became MD of POL. The

                    Royal Mail Holdings PLC Board Report re: Replacement of Horizon (2006)

                    [RMG00000043] was prepared on my behalf, and signed off by me, within several

                    weeks of my taking office. The purpose of the paper was to seek approval for the next

                    phase of funding. My induction meetings had already demonstrated to me that POL

                    faced serious cost challenges and this project was set to make a significant

                    contribution to reducing those costs. As the focus of the business case was cost

                    reduction and there were limited functional enhancements, my primary focus was on

                    ensuring that the proposed cost savings were actually achievable.


                52. I have been asked to what extent I turned my mind to whether Horizon was robust

                    and/or reliable. Based on the information presented to me at my induction meetings, I

                    approached the paper with the presumption that the system was currently operating

                    effectively. I did, however, express a concern that there would be limited opportunity

                    to introduce functional changes to the system during the implementation. I was

                    assured that the system was sufficiently functionally robust and that there was time to

                    focus on the running cost of the system.


                53. I have been asked to set out to what extent the POL Board, following my appointment

                    as MD, would discuss the Horizon system; actual or alleged integrity issues in Horizon

                                                             Page 180139

                    or the actual or possible existence of BEDs; SPMs difficulties in balancing their

                    branch accounts; RMG or POL's investigation of the cause of shortfalls in branch

                    accounts when POL or RMG prosecuted or brought proceedings against SPMs or

                    other staff; and RMG/POL's prosecutorial function and whether it fulfilled it

                    appropriately.


                54. Based on the minutes provided to me, from the time of my appointment as MD until

                    February 2009, Horizon was discussed by the Board at every Board meeting,

                    however often briefly and always in relation to commercials and contracts. As set out

                    in paragraph 49, the Board did not discuss actual or alleged integrity issues in

                    Horizon, or the existence of BEDs, because it was the Board's understanding that

                    there were no BEDs in the Horizon system that were contributing to fraud losses at

                    that time. It follows that there was no discussion about RMG or POL's prosecution of

                    SPMs or RMG/POL's prosecutorial function more widely.



                55. I have been asked to what extend the Board considered the effect on SPMs of the

                    removal of the ability to post disputed discrepancies to a suspense account and roll

                    into a new trading period. As set out in paragraph 38, I do not recall, during my time

                    as MD, there being any reference to the consequences to SPMs of removing their

                    ability to roll over into a new trading period with a disputed discrepancy held in a

                    suspense account, nor do the minutes show that was discussed. I can see now,

                    having studied the documents and with the benefit of hindsight, that this functional

                    change was significant, however I do not recall being aware of, or discussing it.



                56. I have been asked whether, when formulating my strategic plan for POL, to what

                    extend I considered the Horizon system or POL's role in prosecuting SPMs or

                    employees. I attended my first POL Board meeting as MD on 20 April 2006 and in this

                    meeting, I set out my approach for developing a strategic plan for POL in POL —

                    Minutes of the Meeting of the Board — POLB06/41 [POL00032210]. This

                    discussion was focused on how we proposed to go about developing the plan for the

                    business over the coming five years. My ingoing presumption, as set out earlier in this

                    statement, was that given the level of investment in Horizon to date, it would continue

                    as the main counter-based system. That said, an annual financial allowance would

                    need to be made for ongoing system maintenance, running costs and enhancements

                    to improve efficiency and service levels. These demands would be driven by the

                    proposed future plans for the business, once they had been formulated and agreed. In

                    this Board meeting, there was no discussion of POL's role in prosecuting SPMs or

                    employees.


                57. I have been asked to what extent I considered the adequacy and/or integrity of

                    Horizon when advising the RMG Board on whether to contract for Horizon Online. I

                    prepared and presented a further paper to the Board about the replacement of

                    Horizon in August 2006 (Replacement of Horizon Report by Alan Cook August 2006

                    [RMG0000042]). This proposal was based on my firm belief at the time, that Horizon

                    was the preferred strategic platform for the business, provided we could establish a

                    lower cost base for the system. My proposal would achieve that lower cost base.

                    There was no suggestion or expectation to or from the POL Board that Horizon could

                    be unsuitable for that purpose and based on my knowledge at the time, it was

                    presumed that it was adequate and that there were no integrity issues.


            Risk and Compliance Committee


                58. I have been asked about my role as a member of the Risk and Compliance

                    Committee. I was a member of the Risk and Compliance Committee when I was

                    Managing Director of POL, and the documents reflect this. I may also have attended

                    when I was a NED, but I cannot recall exactly.

                59. I have been asked what oversight the Risk and Compliance Committee had over the

                    prosecution of SPMs. I have also been asked what steps I took, as a member of the

                    Risk and Compliance committee, to satisfy myself that POL acted in compliance with

                    its legal obligations in bringing prosecutions and civil proceedings against SPMs, and

                    whether I think these steps were adequate or effective. To the best of my knowledge,

                    the Risk and Compliance Committee was not given any information or reporting, nor

                    did it have any oversight of the prosecution of SPMs. As a result, I did not take any

                    steps, as a member of the Risk and Compliance Committee, to ensure that POL was

                    acting in compliance with its legal obligations in relation to those prosecutions and

                    civil proceedings against SPMs. I was not aware that they were taking place.



                60. The Committee met on 6 September 2006 and one of the agenda items was

                    "Investigation Activity", led by David Pardoe [POL00021421]. This activity related to

                    investigations into cash shortfalls and discrepancies. I have been asked to describe

                    the role and responsibilities of David Pardoe. I cannot remember David Pardoe

                    specifically, although I note that he is listed as Secretariat in the minutes. However, on

                    the basis that he also contributed to the meeting, I presume he was part of the

                    Investigations team.


                61. I have been asked to explain what the Committee discussed regarding "Fraud and

                    Control", and whether it related to alleged fraud by SPMs or POL staff when

                    balancing. There is a reference in the actions to "Fraud and control" [POL00021421],

                    which I believe was in relation to customer fraud. However, there was also discussion

                    about branch procedures designed to minimise potential customer fraud, although I

                    cannot recall what branch non-conformance was referenced.


                62. I have been asked to explain the nature of the "Investigation Activity" and "Branch

                    Audit Activity" reports, including the frequency of these updates. My recollection is

                    that the Investigation Activity and Branch Audit Activity [POL00021421]) reports were

                                                             Page 21 of 39
                                                                                                             WITNO0190100
                                                                                                           WITNO0190100

                    produced monthly for the Head of the Network and quarterly for the Risk and

                    Compliance Committee in line with the frequency of committee meetings. I have been

                    asked to expand on the following sentence in the Branch Audit Activity Period 4

                    Report [POL00021491] - "The key factor appeared to be the targeting of audit

                    resource on branches that had not responded to a request to return surplus cash" —

                    and whether anything was discussed about the extent of the surplus cash not

                    returned or whether the surplus was disputed. I believe that the point being made was

                    whilst it was desirable to audit a purely random selection of branches, that should also

                    be supplemented with a focus on branches that had not responded to a request to

                    return surplus cash. The discussion was simply about identifying branches that were

                    to be audited and there was no discussion of the extent of cash not returned, or

                    indeed whether any surplus was disputed.


                63. I have been asked about the discussion about the action identified in the minutes at

                    0905 [POL00021421] — `Arrange fora presentation re: IMPACT/POLFS to Risk &

                    Compliance Committee — what went well and what could have gone better". This was,

                    in my view, a `best-practice' routine request. Post implementation reviews should be

                    undertaken at the end of all significant projects as they are a key way of deriving

                    learning and improving performance on future projects. It was right that this should

                    have happened in respect of the IMPACT project.


                64. I have been asked to describe the discussion at 0909 [POL00021421] — "Confirm with

                    Head of Security that appropriate links exists with specialist Police Units on relevant

                    matters.". I do not remember the detail of this conversation, however in the early part

                    of my appointment I was constantly seeking reassurance as to how the business is

                    run and this is an example of my approach in that regard.


                65. I have considered the minutes of a Risk and Compliance Committee on 26 March

                    2008 [POL00021422], which was attended by John Scott. I have been asked to


                                                             Page 22 of 39

                                                                                                            WITNO0190100

                    describe Mr Scott's role and responsibilities and why he attended Risk and

                    Compliance Committee meetings. I cannot recall his precise responsibilities, but he

                    had detailed information on SPM losses and so was asked to attend the meeting to

                    present the Losses report.


                66. An action out of this meeting was "Scope the possibility of splitting the types of former

                    Subpostmaster losses to provide greater clarity between fraud losses and other".

                    have been asked what the purpose and outcome of this was. That was an important

                    point — fraud was only one potential reason for losses. Human error and insufficient

                    system training, for example, could be other potential reasons. Therefore, a

                    breakdown between fraud and other' was a sensible suggestion and would have

                    achieved a better understanding of the scope and scale of the challenge.


                67. As a general point, all organisations experience fraud to a degree. That said, not all

                    organisations have the ability to prosecute. To be frank, I never considered whether

                    POL had prosecutorial powers at this time. There was never any discussion about

                    what happened after fraud was discovered.


             Complaint re Hardwick Post Office


                68. I have been asked to consider an email chain relating to Hardwick Post Office in

                    September 2008 [POL00142293], and in particular whether I recall these complaints

                    and how they were resolved. I do not recall this complaint but I have studied

                    [POL00142293] and it is very clear to me that this complaint relates to a networking

                    and communications issue where a telephone line failure was seriously affecting

                    availability at this particular branch. The basis of this complaint is also, for the most

                    part, about the support service this SPM received from Fujitsu, which is of course

                    distinct from POL.

                                                                                                               WITNO0190100

                69. I have been asked to what extent I was concerned by the allegation that "Adam at

                    Fujitsu Services.. .advised that the Horizon system was very fragile and subject to

                    failure if there were frequent power cuts and storms in the area". It is clear that this

                    reference to fragility, taken alongside the reference to power cuts and adverse

                    weather relates to network connectivity (a physical hardware issue particular to that

                    Branch and its environment), rather than system integrity or accuracy. Of course,

                    what the SPM suffered was unacceptable. However, from what I can see, the

                    complaint appears to have been handled accordingly, with compensation being

                    offered in line with the agreement with the Federation of SPMs.


             Complaint of Mr Bilkhu (August 2008)


                70. I have been asked to consider the papers relating to the complaint of Mr Bilkhu

                    [POL0001304] and [POL00106935] and describe my knowledge of Mr Bilkhu's

                    allegations about the Horizon system. I note the letter from Phillipa Wright to Mr

                    Bilkhu dated 20 August 2008 in which she states that she is "the National

                    Consultation Manager with responsibilities for managing the correspondence for Alan

                    Cook".



                71. However, it is clear that Mr Bilkhu's earlier letter dated 9 June 2008 was in fact

                    addressed to Adam Crozier, CEO of RMG. At that time, complaints directed at Adam

                    Crozier and me were passed to the same team. That was the agreed procedure.

                    suspect that Ms Wright's introductory statement referring to me was included

                    inadvertently, as in the majority of cases, complaints were addressed to me.


                72. That said, as I explain later in paragraph 79, I worked closely with the Complaints

                    team, and it is entirely possible that they shared the contents of Mr Bilkhu's letter with

                    me. I have been asked if this complaint caused me to investigate the robustness of

                    the Horizon system. Unfortunately, I am unable to recollect if that was the case. If I did


                                                             Page 24 of 39

                    see this correspondence, it did not cause me to investigate the robustness of the

                    Horizon system.


            February 2009 onwards


                73. As a general point, I note that the Request identifies February 2009 as a significant

                    date, however I do not know, or recall why this is the case.


                Corporate Structure


                74. I have been asked to set out any changes to the POL corporate structure and/or the

                    executive decision-making structure following February 2009. During 2009, there was

                    a progressive move to make POL feel more like a business unit within RMG rather

                    than a separate company. I recall, although I have not been supplied with minutes to

                    confirm, that increasingly, decisions needed to go the RMG Board (of which

                    acknowledge I was also a member) however none of the POL Executive Leadership

                    team were Directors of RMG.



                75. I have been asked why Paula Vennells, Michael Young, David Glynn, Gary Hockey

                    Morley and Deborah Moore resigned as Executive Directors of POL on 31 October

                    2009. I do not recall them stepping down from the Board, nor do I recall this specific

                    date. As set out in paragraph 74, there was a move to make POL feel more like a

                    business unit with RMG, and the resignations of these executive directors effectively

                    rendered the POL Board disbanded. It was not a sudden event, rather part of a long-

                    running activity to re-structure. It is important to note that whilst they stepped down

                    from the POL Board, they did not leave POL and continued to be active members of

                    the POL Executive Management team.

            Allegations of BEDs the Porteous Letter and The Computer Weekly Article


                76. I have been asked when I first became aware of allegations of BEDs or a lack of

                    integrity in the Horizon system. I first became aware of such allegations in early May

                    2009. I received a letter from Robert Porteus [POL00027890] (the "Porteous Letter")

                    on 7 May 2009 (although the letter is dated 30 April 2009). The Porteous Letter

                    enclosed correspondence from Brian Binley MP, on behalf of a constituent Rebecca

                    Thomson and concerning the accounting system at POL.



                77. Ms Thomson was a reporter for Computer Weekly and as set out in the

                    correspondence enclosed with the Porteous Letter [POL00027890] she said she had

                    "spoken to several current and former sub-post masters, who say that random flaws in

                    the IT are causing deficits in their weekly accounts, sometimes of thousands of

                    pounds at a time. Their complaint is that, instead of listening to their problems and

                    investigating the software or equipment, the Post Office is making them pay back this

                    money without any investigation as to what is going wrong. Neither they, nor!, have

                    any way of proving that it is the IT that is causing the deficits."


                78. I have been asked to set out what my thoughts were when I read the Porteous Letter

                    [POL00027890], and if it was the first time I had heard of a collection of SPMs

                    complaining that the Horizon system caused discrepancies that led to shortfalls in

                    branch accounts. My initial reaction was naturally one of concern. This was the first

                    time I became aware of POL's power to prosecute SPMs, and the first time it was

                    highlighted to me that a number of SPMs were making a similar complaint. It did not,

                    however, occur to me that the Horizon system was performing incorrectly. If that was

                    the case, I feel like I would have been aware of corresponding unreconciled cash or

                    debtors on the IT system. My main concern was that POL could have contributed to

                    the issue of cash discrepancies and reconciliations because it had provided SPMs

                    with a system (Horizon) that was too complex or complicated, or that POL's

                    procedures for using the system or training guides were flawed in some way. I was

                    aware that some SPMs had commented on the system and its complexity.


                79. I have been asked to describe the steps I took in response to the Porteous Letter

                    [POL00027890]. I indicated to Michele Graves, Executive Correspondence Manager,

                    that I would like the matter thoroughly investigated. Ms Graves handled complaints on

                    my behalf and used to sit near my desk, because I liked to stay in touch with the MD

                    complaints addressed to me personally. I have been asked to what extent I

                    considered that the allegations about the robustness of the Horizon system ought to

                    be investigated. Whilst I requested that an investigation was undertaken, I must

                    however acknowledge that my request was still in relation to the contents of the

                    Porteous Letter and now with the benefit of hindsight, I think my request should have

                    been framed as an investigation of the system more widely. Andy McLean, Head of

                    Service Delivery, was involved in the investigation and I thought highly of him. I was

                    assured at that time that the Horizon system was functioning normally, although it was

                    concerning to me that the Porteous Letter [POL00027890] referenced a number of

                    separate cases. I do not recall the detailed outcome of Mr McLean's investigation, nor

                    have I been provided with any documents relating to the investigation by the Inquiry.



                80. On 7 May 2009, Michele Graves wrote to Andy McLean [POL00114930] and

                    indicated that she was "keen that we have a robust response". I have been asked to

                    consider this comment and whether it was necessary. I considered the term "robust"

                    to mean "thorough". In other words, a response that was supported by proper

                    investigation. I agreed with Ms Graves' approach in that regard and as set out in

                    paragraph 79, this was in line with my wish for there to be a proper investigation into

                    this matter, due to the nature of the concerns that had been raised.


                81. I have been asked to consider a comment made by Paul Inwood, Contracts

                    Development Adviser, in correspondence with Jessica Madron (Legal Services) on 8

                                                             Page 27 of 39

                    May 2009 [POL00114930], in which he stated: "In many respects, Horizon is a

                    sophisticated calculator, and operates on the principle of GIGO — garbage in, garbage

                    out. It is no more likely that, with 100% accurate input, Horizon produces inaccurate

                    outputs than a calculator would, which is extremely unlikely."



                82. Whilst Mr Inwood's response is not particularly well-worded, I believe that the

                    sentiment behind it reflected the view of POL at the time - that errors in Horizon were

                    unlikely to be the cause of any cash discrepancies.



                83. I did not formally raise the details of the complaints in the Porteous Letter with the

                    Board as a whole, but Paula Vennells (in her capacity as Network Director) and Mike

                    Young (Andy McLean's manager) were fully aware and supportive of POL's response.

                    Unfortunately, I do not recall exactly what POL's response to the complaint was, nor

                    have I been provided with any documents related to that response.


                84. Ms Thomson subsequently published an article — Bankruptcy, prosecution and

                    disrupted livelihoods — Postmasters tell their story; reported by Rebecca Thomson

                    [POL00041564] (the "Computer Weekly Article") - in Computer Weekly on 11 May

                    2009 on the subject.


                85. I was shocked and disappointed to read the Computer Weekly Article

                    [POL00041564]. However, I was also initially unsure of the article's accuracy. At that

                    time, POL had been receiving much negative press in relation to the Post Office

                    Closure Programme for some time. Much of that coverage was, in my opinion,

                    inaccurate and unfair but I had accepted that it was inevitably part of the job. The

                    Computer Weekly Article [POL00041564] at first sight, felt like more of the same.

                    Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, it was not. It is also important to note that at the

                    time, I did not connect the Computer Weekly Article to the complaint raised in the

                    Porteous Letter. I did not make that link until I studied the documents provided to me

                    by the Inquiry.


             The Jordan Letter


                86. I received a letter from Amy Jordan (Private Secretary to Stephen Ladyman MP)

                    [POL00027891] (the "Jordan Letter") on 18 August 2009, although the letter is dated

                    4 August 2009. The Jordan Letter enclosed correspondence from Dr Stephen

                    Ladyman MP, on behalf of a constituent "concerning the problems he has

                    experience(sic) with the post office accounting system".


                87. I have been asked what steps I took in response to the Jordan Letter. I do not recall

                    how this specific complaint was handled, however the standard procedure at the time

                    would have been that steps were taken to check the accounts for the Branch in

                    question. I am assuming that POL replied to this complaint however I have not seen a

                    copy of any reply. I do not recall discussing it with members of the POL Board or the

                    senior management team. I have been asked If I was concerned with the frequency of

                    complains regarding the Horizon system. Whilst I was concerned about the cases

                    raised in the Porteous Letter [POL00027890], the Jordan Letter [POL00027891] and

                    the Computer Weekly Article [POL00041564], at that stage, it did not feel like the

                    frequency of complaints in relation to Horizon was high, relative to the overall volume

                    of complaints POL was receiving.


                88. When I joined POL as MD, I committed to staying close to the SPM and Branch

                    community. In fulfilling this commitment, I undertook regular branch visits, typically

                    visiting branches three Fridays per month. Each of these day visits were undertaken

                    in different geographical areas. On each of those days, I would visit up to five

                    branches. During my time in office, I visited around 250 branches. My branch visits

                    were quite detailed, and I discussed things like the level of support POL was offering

                    to the SPMs and Branch staff. Around the time of the Computer Weekly Article

                                                             Page 29 of 39

                    [POL00041564], I specifically raised the issue of Horizon capability with many of them

                    and received no adverse comments. I also regularly attended NSFP regional annual

                    dinners and spent time socially with many SPMs. At no time during those visits, nor at

                    those dinners or social events, did any SPM or Branch Manager ever raise concerns

                    with me about their ability to reconcile their accounts on Horizon.


                89. There were limited allegations made about the Horizon system whilst I was MD of

                    POL. Only Ms Thomson's article (as set out in paragraphs 76-79) and two individual

                    MP complaints — the Jordan letter as set out in paragraphs 86-87 and the Newmark

                    Question as set out in paragraphs 93-95 - were received during my appointment.

                    Whilst I cannot put them in proportion, it is important to note that around this time,

                    POL was receiving a significant volume of complaints about branch closures. Of the

                    volume of complaints coming in, these were a very small proportion.


                90. Sometime after this complaint was brought to my attention, George Thomson (Head

                    of the National Federation of Sub Postmasters) mentioned during an informal

                    conversation that a group of SPMs had formed an `Action Group' about the accuracy

                    of the Horizon accounting system. This was the first time I had understood that SPMs

                    were raising a collective complaint. He told me that he did not agree with what they

                    were saying and felt that POL should `stand its ground'. I cannot remember exactly

                    when that was, but I do recall that it followed my decision to resign so it must have

                    been around October or November 2009.


                91. I have been asked to explain what POL's external and internal communication

                    strategy was in respect of allegations made against the Horizon system whist I was

                    MD. These events began in late April 2009, and I left POL in February 2010. As such,

                    no formal communications strategy was formulated before prior to my departure

                    because the situation facing the business was not fully apparent at that time. No

                    formal independent review of the Horizon IT system was arranged during my time in

                    office, because it was not yet apparent to POL that there was a potential systemic

                    issue.


                92. I have been asked whether I considered it appropriate to consider the safety of POL's

                    prosecutorial policies and/or past convictions in the face of repeated concerns raised

                    by SPMs and MPs. As set out in paragraph 78, whilst the Computer Weekly Article

                    made me aware of POL's ability to prosecute, I did not believe that POL was receiving

                    repeated concerns raised by SPMs and did not therefore consider it necessary to

                    consider POL's prosecution policies. In addition, I have since learned that the annual

                    rate of prosecutions brought by POL in the seven years prior to my appointment (i.e.

                    since 1999) had remained steady during that time, and continued to remain steady

                    during my time in office and thereafter. It did not feel, at the time, that POL had a

                    crisis on its hands.


             The Newmark Question


                93. On or around October 2009, I was asked to respond to Brooks Newmark MP in

                    relation to a Parliamentary Question that he had raised in a Parliamentary session. As

                    a general point, it was not uncommon for Parliamentary Questions to be directed at

                    POL. I do not recall this particular question, however, I have studied Letter from Alan

                    Cook to Brooks Newmark MP concerning PQ asked about errors in Horizon system

                    [UKG100000028] provided to me by the Inquiry.



                94. The question posed by Mr Newmark MP was as follows:



                    "To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, whether

                    he has received reports of errors in the Post Office Horizon system which have led to

                    Postmasters or Postmistresses being falsely accused of fraud; and if he will make a

                    statement".

                95. I have been asked what sources of information I relied on to draft this letter and how I

                    satisfied myself that it was accurate. As set out in paragraph 79, I worked closely with

                    the members of the Complaints team that handled complaints addressed to me. As

                    was standard process, this response would have been drafted by a member of that

                    team and shared with me for approval. I mainly reviewed draft responses for overall

                    tone and positioning, in the assumption that any specific facts or information set out

                    were accurate and that the author of the response had sourced that information from

                    the appropriate part of the business. I trusted the Complaints team members to do

                    that work and speak to the relevant people.


            Horizon Online rollout


                96. I have been asked about the extent of my involvement in the rollout of Horizon Online

                    and the reason the pilot was paused. I do not recall any detail about the Horizon

                    Online project, nor do I recognise its name. I have not been provided with any

                    documents to consider in relation to it.


             The Smith Letter


                97. I have been asked to consider a collection of correspondence between myself,

                    Richard Stephenson (Director of Commercial Public Relations), Michele Graves and

                    [POL00158368], in particular an email from me to Mary Fagan dated 15 October

                    2009 in which I say "My instincts tell that, in a recession, subbies with their hands in

                    the till choose to blame the technology when they are found to be short of cash."

                    have been asked to consider to what extent did these stated instincts affect my

                    approach to allegations made by SPMs about the integrity of Horizon or my belief that

                    those allegations were credible. Whilst in hindsight I can see that this is a regrettable

                    statement in this email chain I was informally conveying an instinctive impression to

                    colleagues. I can say wholeheartedly that the instinct expressed in this email at this

                    point did not, in fact, affect my approach to any allegations that I became aware of.

                    From my perspective any case, allegation, or complaint that was raised by SPMs

                    about the integrity of Horizon was to be dealt with as a legitimate complaint and

                    investigated thoroughly.


                Horizon Integrity


                98. I have been asked to consider a collection of correspondence between Dave Posnett,

                    Adam Martin and Michele Graves entitled "Horizon Integrity', in particular an email

                    from Dave Posnett to Sue Lowther and another dated 20 October 2009

                    [POL00141142]. In particular, I am asked to what extent I agree with the statement

                    that "Alan Cook [was] asking for more robust defence of Horizon" I have not seen this

                    correspondence prior to receiving a copy from the Inquiry and note that I was not

                    copied to these emails at the time, nor do I recognise all of the names in the recipient

                    list. At times, staff members would mention my name in order to instill a sense of

                    urgency and as a way of moving things forward. That did not necessarily mean I was

                    aware of the work they were doing or how they were representing my position. That is

                    what appears to be happening in this correspondence.


            Resignation from POL


                99. I have been asked to explain why I resigned from POL. My decision to resign from

                    POL was driven by two factors. Firstly, I was finding the role very demanding and

                    was spending a lot of time away from my family. I decided that ending my Executive

                    career and developing a non-Executive career would give me a better work life

                    balance.



                100. Secondly, I found that the relationship between RMG and POL created challenges for

                    me and over time I felt increasingly less empowered than I had originally expected or

                                                             Page 33 of 39
                                                                                                                 WITNO0190100
                                                                                                               WITNO0190100

                    hoped. As set out in paragraphs 74 and 75, under the control of RMG, POL was

                    effectively structured as one of four different business units, and I felt like more of a

                    "business unit head" rather than Managing Director in that regard. As a result, I was

                    not enjoying the role as much as I did when I first took office.


                101. 1 gave notice of my resignation to Adam Crozier around late October or early

                    November of 2009 and it was accepted. I was, however, asked to keep it confidential

                    until it was officially announced to my top team in early January 2010.


                102. 1 should stress, that when 'looking down' through POL, I found the role to be very

                    fulfilling. The Post Office is an amazing institution full of people at every level that

                    want to do right by their customers. I was proud to be the MD of POL. For the

                    avoidance of doubt, my resignation had nothing to do with the relatively few

                    complaints we had received or investigated with Horizon and at the time of leaving,

                    had no realisation or expectation of the problems that would later emerge.


            My professional career after POL


                103. 1 have been asked to summarise my professional career since leaving POL.

                    Following my departure from POL in February 2010, I joined the board of a series of

                    organisations in both the UK and Ireland as an Independent NED or Non-Executive

                    Chairman. I was engaged on part-time contracts in respect of each of these roles,

                    typically for a fixed term of between 3 to 6 years. The time commitment required was

                    variable, ranging from 30 to 100 days per annum. Most of these roles were paid, but I

                    was sometimes engaged pro bono.



                104.At times during this period, when I was holding a number of different positions, I was

                    effectively working full-time, although not working as many hours as I had been whilst

                    at POL. However, in recent years I have progressively scaled back on my time

                    commitment as those fixed-term engagements ended. On 31 August 2023, I retired

                                                             Page 34 of 39
                                                                                                              WITNO0190100
                                                                                                            WITN00190100

                    from my last paid role and now consider myself fully retired. I still sit on the Board of

                    my local Further Education College, Milton Keynes College, in a pro bono capacity.


                 Reflections


                105. 1 have been asked to reflect on my time at POL and consider if there was anything

                    would have handled differently, with hindsight, in relation to the Horizon system. As

                    set out earlier in my statement, I did not alert the Board or RMG to the issues with

                    Horizon because, plainly, it was not apparent to me that there was an issue to

                    escalate. Financial internal and external audits did not identify a systemic issue. Such

                    audits typically test the financial reconciliations performed in main operational

                    systems and, in my experience, this is where any discrepancies of the nature being

                    experienced in Horizon could have been picked up. In any event, and as set out in

                    paragraph 41, those audits were overseen at RMG Board level. As set out in

                    paragraph 89, until early 2010 there were, on balance, a small number of concerns

                    being brought to POL's attention which I immediately asked to be thoroughly

                    investigated and was satisfied with the investigation outcome. These issues were also

                    happening in a relatively small number of branches and not to the remainder of the

                    network of 14,300 branches that existed when I joined POL.



                106. It is a matter of deep regret to me that I did not recognise that the early issues raised

                    in 2009 were an indication of a systemic issue before I left POL in February 2010.

                    What is difficult to comprehend is how these issues did not become apparent earlier,

                    now that it is clear for just how long the errors had been occurring. If I had seen

                    symptoms of a systemic issue emerging, I would have immediately suspended all

                    debt recovery processes and instituted an independent review of Horizon. It will be

                    source of constant regret to me that I did not identify that it was a systemic issue.
