Paula Vennells, GRO.
Alwen Lyons}

Paula — thank for your voicemail, I am not sure if you wanted to chat this though but since then I have spoken (with
Alwen) to lan Henderson and Ron Warmington again so as to verify what has been said to James Arbuthnot.
So lan popped into the office and Ron and Alwen were on the phone, they confirmed

Their intention for the Monday meeting was that they would explain that they were at an early stage of the
investigation, that they have developed a process which they believe to be efficient and cost effective and to
explain that process including the fact that they did not intend to review most of the MP’s cases — JA has agreed
that approach

That there is no evidence of wide spread systemic failure of the Horizon system from the work that they have
already completed

That the themes which are coming out of the work they are doing are the eight which Simon included in his
update and which we discussed yesterday and those are the same issues which we have known about for some
considerable time here is the list.

e Transaction anomalies following communications or power failure

e Transactions not entered by SPMR or staff

¢ Missing or duplicated transactions associated with Postage Labels, Phone Cards, GIRO payments,
ATMs or Cheques

e¢ — Training and Support issues
e POL team at Bracknell (Michael Rudkin evidence)
¢ Loss of Audit Trail
e Accounting issues at end of trading period
* — Contract between POL and SPMRs
Second Sight were at a loss to know what “glitches” JA was referring to, other than those set out above

Second Sight confirmed that POL had not had a chance to respond and that they process was that SS were
gathering data/information and preparing spot reviews for POL to comment on.

We have arranged for Second Sight to come in tomorrow and meet with you at 3. I can be in that meeting if that is helpful.

Susan
