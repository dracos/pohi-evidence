oO RA REPORT -
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

1 Executive Summary

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain how Fujitsu currently implements and manages
Remote Access to the HNG-x environment. This report does not cover historic Remote Access
capabilities. Remote Access can have many meanings and can be interpreted differently. Section 4 sets
out Fujitsu's definition and explains how this report's content will be presented. This report provides POL
with information to understand how Fujitsu provides this capability for the Production environment.

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-x services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that
Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu in relation to these reports was to share content
that would allow both organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and
to identify ways to make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working relationships and
experience for the POL branches and their subpostmasters. Fujitsu believes in collaboration and
welcomes constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains Remote Access to the HNG-x environment (“RA Report’). It follows the “Expanded
Table of Contents for the RA Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4 160) which was shared with POL on 01
December 2020.

In this report, Fujitsu clarifies Remote Access and explains it in the context of Remote Connectivity and
Privileged Access. Both of these capabilities are necessary for Fujitsu to deliver its contracted
obligations.

Remote Connectivity enables specialist support staff to connect to the environment from remote
locations. It has been designed to include multiple layers of authentication and control to ensure it is both
effective and secure.

Privileged Access allows a restricted number of specialist support staff to make approved changes to the
Production environment. The use of these elevated levels of access are documented as part of Change
Control and require POL approval. In summary:

e the roles of Windows, Unix and Database Administrators are to keep the IT systems working as
required so the HNG-x environment can function as needed;

« The APPSUP temporary role is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock unit
associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). APPSUP is not
used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions made;

e The Transaction Correction Tool is the only way that Fujitsu can insert transactions.

It is important to note that the Transaction Correction Tool is not to be confused with the POL Transaction
Correction Process. As described above, the Transaction Correction Tool (explained in Section 7.5) is a
tool available exclusively to Fujitsu. The POL Transaction Correction Process refers to POL’s exclusive
ability to correct balance discrepancies.

Although there are no contractual requirements or processes in place with POL for Fujitsu to report on
Privileged Access activities, the monthly Security Report that is provided to POL for the ISMF meeting
includes information on all Privileged Access types mentioned in this report.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. This
report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any statements
made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors have collectively
characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have also described processes
and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be in written form. Many of
the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are continuously updated and Fujitsu
reserves the right to make changes to the way it works in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this document. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this document in the future, as well as bearing in mind the
requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section 11 below.

3 Background & Introduction

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-x services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that
Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu in relation to these reports was to share content
that would allow both organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and
to identify ways to make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working relationships and
experience for the POL branches and their subpostmasters. Fujitsu believes in collaboration and
welcomes constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains Remote Access to the HNG-x environment (“RA Report’). It follows the “Expanded
Table of Contents for the RA Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4 160) which was shared with POL on 01
December 2020.

Remote Access is a necessary part of an IT system. Remote Access is needed in a number of different
ways to manage the HNG-x environment, for example, for retrieving log files from the branch counter,
administering platforms and databases in the Data Centre and determining root causes of technical
errors and taking remedial actions.

Remote Access is a current open and active topic that results in continued communications between POL
and Fujitsu. This report aims to collate those interactions and communications in order to provide a
common baseline for any future discussions. As POL is aware, Fujitsu is able to access local branch
terminals, and is also able to access transactional data logs which are stored in central databases.

There are no contractual requirements or processes in place with POL for Fujitsu to report on Privileged
Access activities.

POL decide the communication messages and involvement actions with subpostmasters.

It is also important to note that the Fujitsu Transaction Correction Tool is not to be confused with the POL
Transaction Correction Process. The Transaction Correction Tool (explained in Section 7.5) is a tool
available exclusively to Fujitsu. The POL Transaction Correction Process refers to POL's exclusive
ability to correct balance discrepancies in POL Branches.

As a general comment, it should be noted that Fujitsu is one of many suppliers involved in the overall
delivery of end-to-end services to POL in relation to HNG-x. HNG-x also relies on the working partnership
between POL and its chosen partners — such as Verizon, Computacenter and Atos — as well as external
service providers such as banks and affiliated organisations. This applies to both the IT systems and the
operational processes in HNG-x.

Although every effort has been made to avoid confusing technical jargon in this document, the very
nature of this aspect of the service delivered to POL necessitates the use of many acronyms and phrases
that may need expanding upon to ensure the correct understanding. Fujitsu accepts that further
explanation may be necessary and encourages POL to seek clarifications if anything is unclear.

oO RA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. This
report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any statements
made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors have collectively
characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have also described processes
and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be in written form. Many of
the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are continuously updated and Fujitsu

business without obligation to update this document. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this document in the future, as well as bearing in mind the
requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section 11 below.

4 Terminology

The term “Remote Access” is used to describe a number of aspects of IT systems. The following section
provides clarity on terminology to allow further detail in this report to be provided in a structured manner.

Remote Access relates to the following areas:

Remote Connectivity — The ability for specialist support staff q

to connect to an environment to access and provide support 5 Rem

to a system from a location other than where it is physically L a ONE
located. q

Privileged Access — The ability for specialist support staff to = PrNGegen Bcc
Carry Out operations on the system that they have accessed — ¢

whether such access is from a remote location or from the cc

physical location where the system is located.

Remote Connectivity is a widely understood requirement in almost all IT systems to allow a service
provider and/or an operator to connect to systems that they are responsible for supporting.

Most Fujitsu specialist support staff work from a location other than where the systems they need to
support are located. They need Remote Connectivity in order to:

e Support the branch application on the branch counter

e View and retrieve logs held locally on the branch counters
e Administer platforms in the Data Centre

e Administer databases in the Data Centre

e Determine root causes and effect remediation actions

Remote Connectivity is further explained in Section 5 of this report.

Some specialist support staff also require Privileged Access to be able to perform some of their
responsibilities. Again, this is a standard requirement in all IT systems to allow a service provider and/or
an operator to keep systems working, investigate issues, and make necessary and required updates.
Such access relies on Privileged Access Management processes.

Important note: Other parties may have Privileged Access capabilities that Fujitsu is neither responsible
for nor aware of. For example, Computacenter, Verizon and Atos.

Privileged Access comprises three key elements:

A. The processes around Privileged Access user account creation, routine validation, and
revocation; and

B. The tools and processes implemented to enable Privileged Access user activity monitoring; and

C. The level of visibility and impact for POL and subpostmasters when Privileged Access activities
are undertaken.

Point A is explained in more detail in Section 6 of this report.
Points B and C are explained in more detail in Section 7 of this report.

5 Remote Connectivity to Systems

Remote Connectivity is a widely understood requirement in almost all IT systems to allow a service
provider and/or an operator to connect to systems that they are responsible for supporting.

Note: Other parties may have Remote Connectivity capabilities that Fujitsu is neither responsible for nor
aware of. For example, Computacenter, Verizon, and Atos.

5.1 Overview of Environment/Architecture

The HNG-x security architecture is risk-based and uses the Prevention, Containment, Detection,
Response model.

This strategy applies to both infrastructure and software development and provides defence in depth
protection through the application of layered security controls.

The HNG-x environment is required to connect with third parties on behalf of POL to satisfy business
requirements, such as: branch counter and kiosk online transactions; real time services; and
reconciliation. This is done over dedicated circuits (provided by Verizon and / or Fujitsu or other third
parties) or in a limited number of cases, the Internet.

Fujitsu personnel have limited, role-based, local and / or remote connectivity to the HNG-x environment.
Secure network protocols, authentication, anti-virus, anti-malware and logging contribute to assuring the
system access, data integrity, confidentiality and auditability.

HNG-x environment access requires that users satisfy physical and / or logical and procedural access
controls (see Section 6 later in this report). The controls include physical constraints (for example
barriers, CCTV, security guards, door access controls, building zone access and proximity passes),
logical controls (for example, user ID, password, multi factor tokens and Role Based Access Control
(RBAC)) and procedural controls (for example financial background checks and separation of duties).

(oe) RA REPORT ~
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

The diagram below depicts Fujitsu and branch user access to the HNG-x environment and the access
controls implemented.

Access to HNG-x environment for Fujitsu support users is via local workstations within IRE11, IRE19,
Bracknell or Stevenage (that require physical access) and / or via the Fujitsu Core Network (FCN) that
includes the Fujitsu corporate remote VPN solution (that requires a physical laptop, appropriately
configured access software with key material, an authorised user ID with active password, and a Multi
Factor Authentication physical device). The local workstations (ESET AV) and remote VPN devices
(Symantec Endpoint Protection) include active vulnerability monitoring. The local workstations are built to
a Fujitsu defined standard.

5.1.1 Systems & Tools
Remote Connectivity to HNG-x requires use of at least two of the following authentication systems:
¢ Local workstations
e Fujitsu corporate virtual private network (VPN)
e Active Directory (AD) + multi-factor authentication (MFA)
e Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)
¢ Console servers

In general, Fujitsu prefers to integrate HNG-x platforms into the centralised Active Directory (AD) solution.
Some third party devices (such as appliances) do not support AD integration and in these instances, local
accounts are used. Similar RBAC controls apply and individuals typically use their own accounts.

A separate Active Directory (AD) forest is deployed for each of the environments: Systems Validation &
Integration (SV&I); Live System Test (LST); and Production. The SV&I, LST (collectively described as
Test) and Production environments are deployed on common infrastructure but are logically separated by
virtual LANs, virtualised services, access controls and firewalls.

Fujitsu employees have a corporate laptop that includes VPN software and cryptographic keys. The
laptop permits access to the Fujitsu corporate network and authenticates the user with a corporate user
ID, password and VPN key tuple.

eo RA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

Each support user has a HNG-x AD user ID and password. The user is issued a Gemalto hardware
token by POA Security Operations. The token contains a client certificate used to identify and
authenticate the user to the HNG-x Production or Test environment. The client certificates are issued by
the HNG-x Production or Test certification authority (CA). The combination of local physical access or
remote VPN access, user ID, password and a multi-factor authentication (MFA) token provides the
support user access to the Windows Terminal Server within the HNG-x environment.

The Windows Terminal Servers provide a virtual desktop environment and support a limited number of
applications the user may execute. The applications may themselves require further authentication. The
support user's role (defined by AD groups and access permissions) restricts the user’s access to
platforms and applications. The Windows Terminal Servers do not run core business applications; they
only provide the ability to connect the support user to other servers.

User logins to Linux servers are unprivileged. To gain additional privileges, the user must, if authorised,
use the Sudo command. AD incorporates the permitted Sudo privileges and distributes them via the
System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) process. Sudo use is logged.

TACACS supports the authentication, authorisation and accounting for support access to network
(primarily Cisco) devices. TACACS is not integrated with AD so user accounts are stored locally within
the TACACS servers. A designated team manages the network equipment and in order to access a
network device, a user must have already authenticated to a Windows Terminal Server as described
above. The network devices are further restricted to accept interactive support connections from the
terminal and network management servers. TACACS also limits the commands users can run on the
network device according to their role.

Access (i.e. making a connection) to branch counters (not kiosks, to which Fujitsu have no Remote
Connectivity) requires the authorised support user to invoke the Remote Counter Access (RCA) client
tool on the Windows Terminal Server. The command parameters for the RCA client require the specialist
support staff to provide (at least) a FAD code, Node reference and Peak reference related to the reason
for access. The RCA client obtains the counter access SSH private key from the key management
service (see diagram 5.1.1.B below). The RCA client user accessing the SSH server on the branch
counter is restricted to a limited set of actions and the user is further restricted by Computacenter defined
Windows permissions. The branch counter SSH server only permits connections from the HNG-x Data
Centre Windows Terminal Server IP addresses and using the HNG-x authorised SSH key. The RCA
client logs the support activity to the Windows Terminal Server event log and the Tivoli agent harvests the
log entries and writes them to the Audit Archive. The RCA command that is executed, and the result of
the execution of the command, are stored in the Peak (see below). The data retrieved by the command
executing may be attached to the Peak call by the specialist support staff if this is needed. Fujitsu can
access branch counters, but it is not able to operate any of them.

5.4 Who has this type of Remote Connectivity

Remote Connectivity uses a role-based access model. Individual users are given the necessary
permissions based on their role. The roles themselves restrict access to particular platforms and within
platforms to particular functions (for example, read-write or read-only). Windows AD policy, groups and
file system permissions, and TACACS limit access. The SSSD integrates Linux servers into AD

authentication.

The user groups that may use certain levels of Remote Connectivity are:
e Software Support Centre (SSC)
e Systems Management Centre (SMC)

e Windows support

e UNIX support

e Network support

e Database support

e Security Operations

e Management System Support (MSS)

e Systems Management Group (SMG)

e Test teams

e« Development teams

¢ Architects

The levels of Remote Connectivity access for members of each of the above teams is dependent on their

6 Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Some specialist support staff require Privileged Access to be able to perform some of their support
responsibilities. Again, this is a standard requirement in all IT systems to allow a service provider and/or
an operator to keep systems working, investigate issues, and make necessary and required updates.
Such access relies on PAM processes which are described below.

Important note: Other parties may have Privileged Access capabilities that Fujitsu is neither responsible
for nor aware of. For example, Computacenter, Verizon, and Atos.

6.1 Overview of PAM

This section of the report will explain the PAM processes around Privileged Access user account
creation, routine validation, and revocation.

Phrases such as root access, domain administrator, account operator, power user, database
administrator, backup operator, super user, print operator or elevated access rights all fall within Fujitsu's
definition of a privileged account (although this may vary throughout the industry).

A privileged account has additional abilities to a “standard” user account. Privileged accounts may be
machine accounts or accounts allocated to individual development or support staff. Privileges may
include access rights to operating systems or to application software and databases.

System privileges and levels of access required to perform management functions are higher than those
assigned to standard users. Therefore, the allocation and use of privileges is restricted and controlled,
and the principle of least privilege is used. The principle of least privilege refers to the concept and
practice of restricting access rights to only those resources absolutely required to perform the authorised
activities. Individuals are not granted unnecessary privileges.

Privileged Access is reviewed on a monthly basis as explained in Section 6.2.3 of this report below.
6.2 Processes, Procedures & Controls

6.2.1 Overall Process

The Fujitsu EBMS outlines the processes to be followed to create, amend and revoke Privileged Access
for a given account. The following screenshots outline processes to be followed for each step in the PAM
account process. The Fujitsu EBMS provides additional supporting content behind these screens that
POA follows.

6.2.2 Access for Third Parties

The Fujitsu POA Security team also handle access requests for POL users accessing Fujitsu delivered
applications within the Fujitsu environment. The PAM processes and principle of least privilege still apply.

6.2.3. Access Requests, Approval, Routine Validation, Revocation

All Privileged Access requests are received into a group mailbox which can only be accessed by the POA
Security team. Requests for Privileged Access/change/revocation are received on a form, or by email for
access changes and revocation. Access requests, changes or revocations are not accepted verbally. All
access follows least privilege and role-based principles as outlined in Fujitsu EBMS. Privileged Access
requests must come from either a Fujitsu or POL email address.

All Privileged Access requests and changes must be approved by the user's designated manager on the
POA (their Assignment Manager) who must verify that the change is appropriate to the job role.

All access is routinely validated on a monthly basis to ensure that the access supplied is still required and
appropriate, including standard user access for all POA systems and privileged user access for the
Production environment. Access is revoked if verification is not possible, for instance:

e When requested, and within a short timeframe, or on a date specified

¢ When verification of the continued need for access is not received

e Where roles change and access is no longer appropriate or required

e Where a user account has not been used for more than 90 days
The local POA User Access Request work instruction (Fujitsu internal document) outlines the low-level
process to be followed to request access. This is aligned to Fujitsu EBMS.
6.2.3.1 Standard User Access Verification

Every month, emails are sent to all Assignment Managers asking them to verify that, for those people for
which they are Assignment Manager, the access held is still required and still appropriate.

6.2.3.3. POA Security Spot Checks

Over and above the Assignment Manager and PAM access monthly verifications, the POA Security team
conduct occasional spot checks of systems. The spot check is performed on a randomly selected system.
The current active user account list is obtained and then compared to the central records held.
Inconsistencies are investigated and appropriate action taken. A record is kept of which system has been
spot checked and when, and the outcome.

A number of ‘Break Glass’ or Generic accounts (such as Local Administrative Accounts) are held by the
Belfast admin support teams in a KeePass software safe. Access to the KeePass software safe to
retrieve a password for an account requires the Belfast admin support team to provide both their
allocated certificate and their password.

Some accounts which allow Privileged Access are also held by the POA Security team. These accounts
are for use in emergency scenarios (perhaps where a network device has hung and is not accessible
using standard access methods). The supply and use of the passwords for those accounts is
documented and passwords are changed after use, i.e. they are single use passwords.

6.4 Reporting

The POA Security team supply a monthly Security Report to the POL Security team which provides POL
with information on privileged accounts. The report is reviewed with POL Security at the monthly POL
Information Security Management Forum (ISMF), which is the main mechanism by which key security
points are discussed with POL.

The monthly Security Report contains tabs with the following PAM-related information:
e Number of New User, Change User and Revoke User requests
e Number of login failures
e« Number of Privileged Access Accounts per system location or environment
e Last Login date/time for Active Directory PAM accounts
« Log on/off for some non-AD integrated systems
« Access to secure locations, floors and rooms

7 Types of Privileged Access

There are different types of Privileged Access required to support and maintain the systems that
comprise the contracted responsibilities.

In this section of the report, each type of Privileged Access discussed will be presented in a consistent
format, which may result in the repetition of text where a response applies to multiple types of Privileged
Access.

In summary, this section will explain the following types of Fujitsu Privileged Access:
e Windows Domain (NT) Administrators —- who administer the Windows platforms
e Unix Domain Administrators — who administer the Unix platforms
¢ Database Administrators — who administer the Oracle and MSSQL databases

e APPSUP Role — used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock unit associations,
emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). APPSUP is not used to
correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions

¢ Transaction Correction Tool — used to insert transactions

The first three administrator types are used on a regular basis as required to keep the HNG-x systems
working as required.

APPSUP is used infrequently (on average twice a month throughout 2020) and is a temporary privilege
subject to multiple levels of authorisation from POL and Fujitsu.

The Transaction Correction Tool is subject to multiple levels of authorisation from POL and Fujitsu.

Privileged Access that affects branch transaction data is necessary in some circumstances. For example,
it may be required to help resolve Incidents raised by subpostmasters, or to complete actions that the
HNG-x service was unable to complete for some reason. This could be a bug, error or defect, or it may
be a specific scenario that HNG-x has not been designed to cater for.

Fujitsu can access branch counters, but it is not able to operate any of them.

The logs collected relating to Privileged Account activity are extremely large and interspersed with other
activity logging. Analysis of the logs would require specialist tools as to do so manually would be
practically unworkable. The deployment of Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tooling
(which would augment Privileged Account activity monitoring and analysis) has been discussed
numerous times over the years between Fujitsu and POL but has never been taken forward. The
absence of a SIEM tool limits Fujitsu's abilities in relation to some security events. This includes
Privileged Account activity monitoring and reporting.

7.4 APPSUP Role

The APPSUP role allows the Privileged Access user to make changes to data within Oracle databases.
The APPSUP role has to be granted to a specialist support user when needed. They do not have this role
by default.

7.4.1. Scope of Privileged Access

The APPSUP role provides the assigned user with full data read/write privileges on all Oracle databases.
The role is only granted to a specific member of the specialist support team for a specific period of time
as necessary to perform actions which have been specifically authorised by both POL and Fujitsu.

APPSUP is not used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions.
Corrections relating to branch balance discrepancies are performed by POL using the POL Transaction
Correction Process.

APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock unit associations, emergency branch
opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). Some APPSUP actions can indirectly lead to a balance
impact (such as deleting a corrupt recovery message that is causing a logon loop). Where an action
being taken by Fujitsu using APPSUP could lead to a balance impact, it is POL that decide if any balance
discrepancy correction is required with the branch and it is POL that take any corrective action required.

7.4.2 Assignment of the APPSUP role

Granting of the APPSUP privilege requires approval from three POL entities (POL Service, POL Security
and POL Financial Service Centre). POL selected these entities and POL is responsible for the internal
approval processes prior to Fujitsu receiving each of the 3 POL approvals. Further approval is then
needed from Fujitsu POA Service Operations after which the Fujitsu POA Security team additionally
verify that APPSUP is needed based on the defined action to be taken. Fujitsu POA Security then provide
the final approval and notify the Unix Administrator team to grant the specified user the temporary
elevated privilege. When the actions are complete, Fujitsu POA Security team notifies the Unix
Administrator team to revoke the privilege.

Approvals and actions are recorded in TfSNow, change tasks, and Peak.

7.4.3 Logging of APPSUP actions

Actions taken when using the APPSUP role are witnessed by a second member of the SSC support team
and this is documented in the Peak. Within the SSC, one member of the SSC will perform the data
correction while a second member of the SSC (with appropriate skills and expertise) will witness the
change being made. Both names must be recorded on the Peak and the change task.

Note: If the APPSUP role is used out of hours, this is less likely to be witnessed by a second member of
the SSC support team. There would be consultation with other working on-call support staff at the time
and the recorded actions are also likely to be checked by the SSC Duty Manager. Use of the APPSUP
role out of hours is extremely rare.

The applicable logging is as described in Section 7.3.2 on the logging of Database Administrator actions.

744 Vis ty for POL

POL have full visibility relating to the APPSUP role. POL see the Incidents and approve the granting of
the APPSUP role for the temporary period. For potentially balance impacting actions, POL decide
whether a balance discrepancy correction is required and, if so, enact the required corrective actions.

7.4.5 Reporting - internal & external

In addition to the explanations in the sections above, there are a number of ways in which the assignment
and use of the APPSUP role use can be monitored by both Fujitsu and POL:

7.5 Transaction Correction Tool

Important note: Please note that the Transaction Correction Tool is not to be confused with the POL
Transaction Correction Process. As described above, the Transaction Correction Tool is a tool available
exclusively to Fujitsu. The POL Transaction Correction Process refers to POL’s exclusive ability to
correct balance discrepancies.

The Transaction Correction Tool (also known as BRDBX015) provides a packaged and audited interface
to run defined data correction scripts. This tool allows the Fujitsu SSC to insert balancing records to
transactional, accounting, or stock tables in the BRDB. The tool was created as making data
amendments is highly complex, requiring many parts of the system to be amended concurrently to
ensure data integrity and avoid errors.

7.5.1 Scope of Privileged Access

This tool allows the Fujitsu SSC to insert balancing records to transactional, accounting, or stock tables in
the BRDB.

7.5.2 Assignment of permission to use the Transaction Correction
Tool

Use of the Transaction Correction Tool by Fujitsu requires granting of permission to use it following the
same process as is used for granting the APPSUP role. This would include multiple (both POL and
Fujitsu) approvals and permission being temporary. See APPSUP Section 7.4.2.

7.5.3 Logging of Transaction Correction Tool usage

Every correction that is completed using the Transaction Correction Tool generates an audit record in the
BRDB which is then extracted on a nightly basis via process BRDBC033 and made available to the Audit
Archive system.

In addition to the audit records in the BRDB and Audit Archive systems, logging would be the same as is
described for the APPSUP role. See APPSUP Section 7.4.3.

7.5.4 Visibility for POL
Visibility for POL would be the same as is described for the APPSUP role. See APPSUP Section 7.4.4.

7.5.5 Reporting — internal & external
Reporting would be the same as is described for the APPSUP role. See APPSUP Section 7.4.5.
Note — the monthly Security Report shows the uses of the Transaction Correction Tool.

8 Formal Audit Reports

POL has commissioned an ISAE3402 audit as well as quarterly PCI Prioritised Approach audits on POA.
Both audits examine PAM from slightly different perspectives and to varying degrees of detail. For
example, the ISAE3402 audit report for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 December 2019 has a specific
section on Remote Access in section 4.8.14 where all 3 required controls are reported as “No deviations
noted.” Furthermore, POA are periodically requested to contribute to internal Fujitsu corporate audits to
support Fujitsu UK in attaining and maintaining a variety of certifications such as IS027001, ISO9001 and
1$022301.

9 Conclusions

Remote Access is a term that can be used to describe a number of processes within HNG-x and the
usage of the term varies.

In this report, Fujitsu has provided clarity and explained Remote Access in the context of Remote
Connectivity and Privileged Access. Both of these capabilities are necessary for Fujitsu to deliver its
contracted obligations.

Remote Connectivity enables specialist support staff to connect to the environment from remote
locations. It has been designed to include multiple layers of authentication and control to ensure it is both
effective and secure.

Privileged Access allows a restricted number of specialist support staff to make approved changes to the
Production environment. The use of these elevated levels of access are documented as part of Change
Control and require POL approval. In summary:

e the roles of Windows, Unix and Database Administrators are to keep the IT systems working as
required so the HNG-x environment can function as needed;

e The APPSUP temporary role is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock unit
associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). APPSUP is not
used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions;

e¢ The Transaction Correction Tool is the only way that Fujitsu can insert transactions.

Important note: Please note that the Transaction Correction Tool is not to be confused with the POL
Transaction Correction Process. As described above, the Transaction Correction Tool is a tool available
exclusively to Fujitsu. The POL Transaction Correction Process refers to POL’s exclusive ability to
correct balance discrepancies.

Although there are no contractual requirements or processes in place with POL for Fujitsu to report on
Privileged Access activities, the monthly Security Report that is provided to POL for the ISMF meeting
includes information on all Privileged Access types mentioned in this report.

10 Recommendations

POL and Fujitsu have discussed the topics of Remote Access over the years and during recent meetings.
Acompilation of recommendations for improvement options arising out of these discussions is contained
in Appendix A. This list in Appendix A collates the various action items into a single list so that POL and
Fujitsu can work jointly to improve the Remote Access capabilities. The recommendations should be
prioritised and the most relevant ones actioned as promptly as possible.

Fujitsu strives for continual improvement and is committed to having an open dialogue with POL on
additional recommendations that could be further implemented where appropriate.
