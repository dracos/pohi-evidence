Current issues

I attended the office as they had received a request for payment for the
loss sustained in TP 09. Chesterfield have now put a temporary block on
this awaiting a transaction correction. I have checked all the office
documents, transaction logs and event logs for the week concerned and
there is no sign of what has caused this loss. I have contacted Girobank
who are looking to see if there are any errors that have come to light. I
have advised the manager that Chesterfield will only allow the block to
stand for so long unless they can discover were the error was made. If not
then the PM will have to make arrangements to settle with Chesterfield

Girobank have stated that there is no discrepancy showing.
