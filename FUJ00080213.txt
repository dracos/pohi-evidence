Transaction corruptions
HNG-X_Txn_Num Unique transaction number to be used in all messages between HNG-X and the Fis
relating to the transaction. Generated by HNG-X and provided in the request
message initiating the transaction.
‘New’ Transactions Transactions that have had a change of state since they were last reported, or have

never been reported except in NB102 section 6. Note that if a transaction appears in
NB102 section 6 it is future dated as is reported in that section for information only.
Once future dated transactions become current dated, they must be reported as
though they have not appeared on the reports before.

‘Old’ Transactions Transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they were last reported.

POL FS Transactions From a Branch / Post Office Ltd. perspective, a transaction that has been sent from
TPS to Post Office Ltd. POL FS. From a system perspective, a ‘C112’ transaction.

POLSAP: Post Office Ltd Consolidated SAP System

Receipt Date Receipt Date is the Date as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It

forms part of all transactions.

Receipt Time Receipt Time is the Time as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It
forms part of all transactions.

Reconciliation Date The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to allow Post Office
Ltd. to reconcile. It will be set the first available Bank Settlement date from the
transaction elements (C112, C12, C4, S & D) that make up a Network Banking
transaction. If no Bank Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be
set to the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first recorded any
element of the transaction being received. If a Settlement date subsequently
becomes available, the first available Bank Settlement date will replace the
processing date. However, once a transaction has been accounted for on the
reconciliation reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific transaction should be
sought.
Run Date This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, i.e. all transaction

components processed by the DRS on System Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are
accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial Institutions may
assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the following Monday may be set on
transactions processed on the preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify Fujitsu Services outputs from the Data Reconciliation
Service (DRS) Automated Payment Service (APS) and the Transaction Processing Service (TPS) so as
to enable a generic end to end reconciliation of

1. Banking and Related Services transactions, which includes DCS and ETS
2. Automated Payment System (APS)
3. Transaction Processing System (TPS)

2 Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for HNG-X, which satisfies the
DRS, APS and TPS reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define within the operating
systems how the transactions are processed.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within Fujitsu Services and
Post Office Ltd. with respect to the resolution of any exceptions which may arise, nor does it scope the

requirement for any systems that may be required to assist in this process. This information can be
found in the associated documents, reference:-

« SVM/SDM/PRO/0012: Reconciliation and Incident Management - Joint Working Document

3 Network Banking Reconciliation Reports
Specified

For Network banking services each of the Post Office Ltd. Clients, as dictated by Routing Gateway, will
require a separate reconciliation report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:-

Report Deposit Withdrawal
Number Transactions Transactions
NB101 Combined Report

NB102 Combined Report

NBOOO is a combined report for all Routing Gateways.

The format and content of each Client's report is considered to be identical when allowing for these
specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the specifications documented here are
applicable to each Client report set (specific Client requirements outside of this reporting specification
are not covered within this document).

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the Routing Gateway and/or
Transaction Type is not known.

Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the report set as ‘Not Required by Post
Office Ltd.”

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of reports are not of a
single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for each currency. All the amounts in a
single transaction will alwa $ use the same currenc

« NBOOO: DRS Summary
e NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement
e NB102: Exception Summary

Rows and columns are described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations required to
achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are described.

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘State’ definition is quoted, this takes precedence over any
narrative which has only been provided to help understand the business processes.

3.1. General Banking and Related Services Report
Specifications

A separate set of reports is produced for each Post Office Ltd. Client as identified by the Routing
Gateway (LINK being a single Client). The specification is general to all reports sets.

1. For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow settlement
totals to be correctly derived, will be:

Absolute volume

Net value

Where no value reported show “0.00”

Where no volume reported show 0

-ve values will be shown in brackets e.g. (nnn.nn)

2. Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the Client name (derived from Routing Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.e., the period for which the report refers

Production date and time

Fujitsu Services report number

Fujitsu Services reference

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

e ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since they were
last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section 6

e ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they
were last reported

4. Reports: NBOOO, NB101 and NB102 will be produced DAILY. They will be delivered by
08.00hrs the day following the Run Date to:

« Post Office Ltd. / POL FS gateway: The Host writes the reports to a directory. These are
picked up by FTMS and posted to the POL FS gateway (as per other Host to external
systems applications).

e Fujitsu Services CS, DRS Workstation

5. Within report NB 102 the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:

e Transaction corruptions

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and not within
the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files - one for each report. The report layout will be
fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This will allow for ‘Excel’ input,
using fixed field width facilities. The formatting (lines and shading referred to in this
document) will not be included within the file. Every line will have the character ‘newline’,
Hex 'OA', as the last character. Each report will have the text “End of Report” as the last line.

9. See also comments in Section 2: ‘Scope’

3.2 NBO000: Summary Report

This report summarises all reconciliation reports produced by the DRS. It also summarises all reports
that were not produced by the DRS because there was no data to report.

3.2.1 NBO000: Rules
1. Reports are listed by application type, Routing Gateway, and report number.
2. Where a report is produced, the filename will be shown.

3. Where for a routing gateway, there is some data to report, but for a specific report there is no data,
then the filename will be replaced by [NO DATA].

Where for a routing gateway there is no data at all, the application type cannot be shown and the file
name will be replaced by [NIL RETURN].

3.2.2 NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement

This report identifies ‘C4’ transactions received against each ‘C4 Settlement Date’ as reported to
the DRS for the most recent processing date. The report will be used by Post Office Ltd. as a
basis for settlement of Network Banking transactions with the Financial Institutions (Fis).

3.2.3 NB101: Rules

NB101 is run daily

NB101 is repeated for each Routing Gateway

NB101 will show ‘C4’ transactions received for ONE day only — breaking these down into

individual ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ There will be one line for each ‘C4 Settlement Date’

4. NB101 will show Deposit and Withdrawal transactions in separate columns, (headed
‘Receipts’ and ‘Payments’ respectively) derived from ‘Txn_Type’

5. NB101 will show a final settlement column derived in the following way:

e Volume: Volume of Deposits plus Volume of Withdrawals

e Value: Value of Deposits minus Value of Withdrawals

e« Where the net total is negative i.e. the Value of Withdrawals exceeds the Value of
Deposits, the total will be shown as (xxx.xx)

eNn>

6. Where the volume for a given ‘C4 Settlement Date’ is nil, the date will not be reported.

7. ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ are shown in reverse chronological order.

8. Where there is more than one institution with the same Routing Gateway, the values for the
institutions will be shown individually provided the transaction volume for that institution is
greater than zero.

19. Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be grouped
and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire section.
20. For reporting purposes:

¢ Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement date
allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same as the
reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

e Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a Reconciliation Date
ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most Clients will settle Friday,
Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following Monday. This means that each
transaction completed on these days will have a Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run
Date of the report. These transactions are expected to clear naturally once the
Reconciliation Date and the Run Date are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a
Reconciliation Date is considerably ahead of the Run Date, Post Office Ltd. may wish to
clear the exception manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services will set the transaction to
‘FQ’.

21. For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the column headed

‘Transaction Type’ will be populated by the following codes
e 03 - Withdrawal; Magstripe & PIN Verification (Banking and Related Services)

End of Day Daily summaries are calculated at the BRDB to ensure that reconciliation can be
performed between TPS and the Counter Estate.

Transaction data is transferred from the Branch Database to the APS Host, this includes an APS
Transaction Summary from each branch.

TPS passes a file of all TPS-Harvested APS transactions to the APS host for reconciliation.

The reconciliation procedure is run and produces a number of reports detailing the reconciliation
between the APS client payments and the corresponding transactions from TPS.

The APS Host system passes summaries of transactions that have been passed to APS Clients.

4.1 Reconciliation between Client Transmission files and
cTs

The end to end transaction flows are supported by validation processes which verify that the transactions
processed by the APS Host are consistent with the transactions included in each Client Transmission
File and with the CTS sub-file sent to Post Office Ltd.

This validation is carried out for the volume of normal transactions and the value of all transactions only
in each of these files. A Validation Status report (section 4.8) will be produced as part of this validation
process and the results of this notified to Post Office Ltd.

4.2 Accounting Sense

Reconciliation reporting operates on a seven day a week basis regardless of the Client file transmission
schedule (which may, for example, exclude weekends and bank holidays). In principle, reconciliation
reporting totals volume and value for transactions. It includes reversals by adding volume and
subtracting value.

Thus, for In-pay transactions:

e Volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Value is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal value is positive and subtracted (net result: subtract)
For Out-pay transactions:

« Volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Value is negative and added (net result: subtract)

e Reversal volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal value is negative and subtracted (net result: add)

Reporting has to be able to show a representation of negative value. To be consistent with other
reconciliation reporting, this will be done with the use of brackets rather than the use of a prefix sign, e.g.
(23.42) represents the value -23.42.

4.3 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Points

Four reconciliation points are identified.

The first Reconciliation Point is the main APS Host reconciliation and reporting point. It confirms the
APS accounts are balanced for the processing day and provides a balance statement, a Client delivery
summary report and a transaction exception report.

The second Reconciliation Point is transaction reconciliation between:

e the APS transactions at Branches;

« the APS transactions delivered by TPS to POLSAP;

e the APS transactions delivered by APS to Clients.
It provides a reconciliation summary report, transaction exception Client account and detailed reports.
The third Reconciliation Point reports on non-harvested branches.

The fourth Reconciliation Point is an intermediate point to help the operational management. It is not
necessary to meet requirements; it confirms consistency between:

«the APS transactions at branches;
« the APS transactions harvested by APS Clients.

4.4 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Point 1
4.4.1 Description

e At the beginning of a normal processing day (about 8am), the APS Host is expected to have
delivered all APS transactions for previous processing days to Clients. However, there may be
some transactions left over because they have failed an APS validation check.

During normal branch hours action is taken to resolve these transactions and, once resolved, the most
likely outcome is that the transaction is returned into normal processing mode. However, the APS Host
system does cater for instances where an APS transaction cannot be returned to normal processing and
needs to be processed manually. Therefore, during normal branch hours exception transactions may be
returned to normal processing or, possibly in very rare circumstances, put into manual processing.

During the evening of the processing day APS transactions from counters are harvested and delivered to
the APS Host. The transactions are validated by the APS Host and are put into an exception state if
validation fails.

The APS Host delivers all valid APS transactions to APS Clients within the operational schedule leaving
the system with just the transactions in an exception state.

This reconciliation point is at the end of the processing day when all these transaction flows are
reconciled and reported.

Objectives: To provide details of all transactions which have not been delivered by Fujitsu Services
because they have been delayed within the APS Host system. Initial Customer Support resolution will
cause the transactions to be returned for normal processing or sent to manual for manual processing. No
equivalent report is produced for APS transactions in TPS as there is no delaying mechanism in the TPS
Host System. All transactions are passed through to POLFS.

4.5 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Point 2

4.5.1 Description

Normally, APS transactions flow through the TPS Host to POLSAP and through the APS Host system to
Clients within the same working day. However, the rules associated with the processing of APS
transactions within the TPS Host and the APS Host systems are different. Consequently, transactions
may be placed in exception status by APS but be accepted as valid by TPS. This reconciliation point is
at the end of the processing day. It reconciles the:-

e APS transactions at Branches;
e APS transactions delivered by TPS to POLSAP;
« APS transactions delivered by APS to Clients.

It maintains a record of which transactions have passed through the TPS side and which transactions
have passed through the APS side and on a daily basis it reports transactions which have been
processed by one side and not the other.

4.5.2 APSS2136 - Daily TPS / APS Transaction Reconciliation
Summary Report

Objectives: To compare Branch APS transaction totals with the actual POLFS and Client delivered APS
transaction totals for the last N days. There may be some error conditions where some differences will
show for the most recent days; but all these differences will disappear in a very few days after the
processing date demonstrating that all APS transactions at Branches are delivered to POLFS and
Clients.

In addition to the marked fields, above, “Transaction Date” is a “K” field.

C=> Matching APS transactions from APS and TPS are compared on these fields. If any of these
fields are different, both transactions appear on this report with the appropriate error message.

S => Fields shown from the APS transaction only

TPS/POLFS Only: Unmatched TPS transactions are transactions that appear in TPS and are delivered
to POLFS but for which there are no matching APS transactions. Such transactions may occur, for
example, due to business processing rules for TPS and APS being different. For Dates 1 and 2 only,
unmatched TPS transactions will not be detailed individually, but a total count and value will be entered.
For Dates 3 to N, unmatched TPS transactions will be detailed individually.

APS/Client Only: Unmatched APS transactions are transactions that appear in APS and are delivered
to Clients but for which there are no matching TPS transactions. Such transactions are not expected
other than in error conditions. For Dates 1 and 2 only, unmatched APS transactions will not be detailed
individually, but a total count and value will be entered. For Dates 3 to N, unmatched APS transactions
will be detailed individually.

Error Message: The error message identifying the APS transaction discrepancy. This includes problems
concerning synchronisation between HNG-X and POLFS on Client accounts, HNG-X security checks,
and transaction validation checks. The message “Unmatched” will be used for unmatched TPS or APS
transactions.

Difference: The Value of the TPS/POLFS Transaction minus the Value of the APS/Client Transaction.
Note: Difference 3 is the Unmatched TPS Value minus the Unmatched APS Value.

Total Difference: The Count of the total Number of TPS Transactions minus the total Number of APS
Transactions, and the total Value of the Difference for all Transactions for the specified date.

Reconciliation Error: Total Difference minus Difference (2) from the Daily TPS / APS Transaction
Reconciliation Summary Report for the specified date (see section 5.2.2).

Value fields: If any value to be reported is negative, then it shall be enclosed in brackets. For example,
the value -£4.23 shall be shown as (4.23).

The APS measures the difference between what the BRDB passed to APS and what BRDB thought that
it passed to APS — the two may differ.

BRDB creates a summary of all transactions by branch and passes this to APS. APS adds up all the
transaction detail that was given to it and compares to the summary. Where there is a difference it is
reported.

4.7.2. APSS2140 - APS Harvester Transaction Totals Summary

Objectives: To provide Branch totals and harvested totals by transaction date for each of the last N
transaction days for the APS Harvester. When errors occur the differences will show for the most recent
days but all these differences will disappear within a very few days of the processing date.

4.9 APS Report Delivery

Reports for Post Office Ltd are delivered in accordance with security and audit requirements.
Reports for Fujitsu Services RMG Account are delivered to the MIS Client PC in BRAO1 via FTP.
The 5 APS reports shown below are then sent via email to Post Office Ltd:

1. APSS2133
2. APSS2133b
3. APSS2133c
4. APSS2136
5. APSS2139

4.10 External Transactions

Transactions that are performed on non-Horizon terminals are delivered to AP Clients via the Branch
Database and the APS Service. These transactions are loaded into the Branch Database and are
validated at this point to ensure that subsidiary Horizon systems can complete all necessary
processing. Transactions that fail validation are prevented from being loaded and are automatically
returned to the transaction supplier.

Due to this validation, there should be no further transaction processing failures within the Horizon
service.

However, there is a possibility that an external transaction is queried by an AP Client. This may occur
if the customer who performed an AP transaction queries or disputes the amount of the transaction. In
these instances, Fujitsu would receive the initial query but can only trace the transaction back to the
file in which the transaction was supplied. It is almost inevitable that this type of query will need to be
routed back to the transaction supplier for resolution.

This re-routing will be performed by raising a call with the Post Office Limited Service Desk.

5 TPS Reconciliation Reports Specified

The Transaction Processing System (TPS) Report Set has been designed to enable reconciliation of the
transactions carried out in Post Office branches using the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS)
which are sent to POLSAP and POLMIS.

The TPS exceptions report set identified herewith reports errors that have occurred within counter
transactions or during the harvesting process.

NB: For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal reconciliation produced between the POLSAP and
POLMIS transaction stream. The POLMIS stream should therefore not be used to verify financial
integrity and Post Office Ltd should ensure the TPS Report Set and POLSAP transaction stream are
used for this purpose.

IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT FUJITSU SERVICES WILL DELIVER ANY OF THE TPS
RECONCILIATION REPORT SET IDENTIFIED HEREWITH TO POST OFFICE LTD.

The reports specified below are Horizon based Reconciliation Report set.

5.1 TPSC250 - Host Detected Transaction Control Errors

This report is produced daily and shows detail for any Post Office branch where the control totals for the

Data Attribute

Description

Trading Date

‘The Calendar Date that the EOD Marker was written. EOD Marker defines the
end of a Trading Day. N.B. The time the EOD Marker is written varies from
Branch to Branch.

Group Id Group Id (Branch Code without the check sum) for the branch.
Article Id POL FS Article
All HNG-X Products will map to a POL FS Article. This may be a dummy article
to facilitate the consistent mapping of all Products.
Dummy articles will be for items such as Cash in hand, cheques etc that will not
map to an article in POL FS but actually map to a GL or Agent Account instead.
Transaction HNG-X Mode the product was transacted in, e.g. Sell, Rem In, Revaluation, etc.
Mode Id
Settlement Defines which data is used to settle with the Client
P = Post office data
C = Client Data
E = Estimated data
This is required as there will be a different indicator used within POL FS to
differentiate these data types. (Special GL indicator).
This is optional as it is only relevant to Client products and transactions that need
to feed the Client ledger.
Ledger Defines which Ledger the POL FS account belongs in
G = General Ledger
Client Ledger (AP)
A= Agents Ledger (AR)
POL FS uses three different ledgers and needs to know which ledger each
account number is part of.
This field is optional in the file because records that relate only to stock
movements with no financial impact will not map to an account in any ledger.
Account POL FS account number

This is the account number within the Ledger defined above. This field is optional
in the file because records that relate only to stock movements with no financial
impact will not map to an account in any ledger.

Movement Type

POL FS Movement type

This is only relevant for stocked products and allows different movement types
such as REM in, REM out, and adjustments to be shown differently in SAP.

There will be a consistent mapping between certain modes to movement types
but these will only be valid for particular Articles.

Account
Reference Id

Transaction Identifier (this field is needed if the information is being sent
unsummarised)

Controlled by reference data.

[DN: This is either the LFS Pouch Identifier or Transaction Correction ID. These
are mutually exclusive and can therefore be harvested into a single NEW
attribute in the TPS interface table called AccountReference .]

Client
Reference

Client Reference number (supplied by Client)

This will only be used for the actioned Transactions Correction being passed back
to POL FS against the Client products.

An “END OF REPORT” message will appear at the end of the report even if there are no errors reported.
