Dear all — please find attached the final report for the briefing with Dave Smith today.

Please bin the previous drafts which I have sent you. I have received several subsequent clarifications
and additions. I

Thank you for your input into this report.

Whilst this report continues to support our premise regarding the integrity of Horizon, there are a number
of associated improvement ideas arising and we need to work together on those.

Thanks, Rod

Dear all - Please find attached the final report.

Dave — please replace the draft version I sent for your meeting earlier today. There are 2 main additions since
then:

1 — section 4d — a page on the justiceforsubpostmasters.org website and specific comments it makes

2 section 5 — a new introductory paragraph to put it into context of the 230 million transactions per month across

our network

I shall liaise with the people cc’d regarding next steps on the improvement ideas noted.

Thanks, Rod
