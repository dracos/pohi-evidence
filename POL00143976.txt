Alan

| work for the Post Office and am involved in supporting the Second Sight investigation of Horizon.

Following on from your conversation with Paula Vennells and James Arbuthnot we have updated your draft immunity
agreement so that it both addresses your concerns about providing sub-postmasters protection and outlines a process

for them to follow.

Please note that it is a draft document, for discussion purposes only, and is to be kept confidential —i.e. it is not for
wider circulation.

Please give me a call once you have had a chance to review. My number is below. We will also send a copy to Kay
Linnell to ensure that she is kept in the picture.

Look forward to hearing from you later.
Regards, Simon
