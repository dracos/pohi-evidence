CASE NO: CRM/258932/JSX
DATE: 27" January 2010

Discussed with Counsel Warwick Tatford disclosure and the Mention at Guildford
Crown Court on the 1" February 2010.

Counsel said that we should disclose everything we can disclose at this stage so the
Defence will know where we are coming from. We should be seen to be willing.
Secondly Jon Longman has been chased on Horizon but this has not been in hand
at the moment. Also Counsel says as stated that he will deal with Section 8 of the
disclosure. Also that Warwick Tatford-was the only person who could deal with this
as he is the only one who had seen the case papers on this. I will write to the
Defence stating that Counsel is drafting a disclosure on Section 8 application and
this will be served on the Defence shortly.
