SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF STEPHEN PAUL
PARKER

I, STEPHEN PAUL PARKER of Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 8SN WILL
SAY as follows:

41. This is my second witness statement in relation to these proceedings. The facts
set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, or if they are outside my
knowledge, I have explained the source of my information or belief.

RICHARD ROLL'S SECOND STATEMENT

2. I have previously commented on the first witness statement of Richard Roll dated
11 July 2016. In his second statement dated 16 January 2019 (Roll 2), Mr Roll
has clarified some points and made some new points. I have been asked to
comment on these points and I do so below. Unless indicated otherwise, in this
statement I describe the position as it was when Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu
and references to paragraph numbers are references to paragraphs in Roll 2.

Hardware failures

3. Mr Roll suggests in paragraph 5 that he encountered a hardware failure on
average at least once a month. That seems plausible to me, although it is not
clear how Mr Roll defines a ‘hardware failure’. To put it into context, there were
around 28,000 counters in operation at any one time while Mr Roll was employed
by Fujitsu and it is inevitable that hardware failures would occur.

However, Mr Roll's statement that hardware failures "could and did affect branch
accounts" gives a misleading impression. It would be more accurate to say that
while a hardware issue could very occasionally do so, the vast majority of
hardware issues were not capable of having any impact on a branch's accounts in
terms of leading to a financial discrepancy.

At paragraph 6 Mr Roll states that the "most extreme case that he can recall was a
complete failure of a counter to communicate with the server...” These are the
stuck transactions that I referred to at paragraph 43 of my first witness statement
(they were also known as ‘marooned transactions’). These stuck transactions
could only result in a discrepancy in a branch's accounts in very limited
circumstances:-

In the event of a hardware issue preventing transactions conducted on one
counter from being replicated to the other counters in a branch, when a branch
reported the issue, Fujitsu engineering service would go to the site to attempt to
resolve it. As part of this engineering visit, actions would be taken to ensure that
transactions were replicated correctly. I am aware of a facility used by engineers
in these cases known as the “recovery laptop” but cannot describe the process.

It was only in the very rare circumstances where (1) Fujitsu could not locate or
import a replicated copy of the transactions; and (2) the branch was unable to
advise which transactions had been carried out on the counter after it stopped
communicating that there might be a discrepancy in the branch's accounts as a
consequence of the issue. In these cases Fujitsu would notify the Subpostmaster
and Post Office and provide any supporting information that Fujitsu was able to
gather. This will be evident from transfers by SSC to the Management Support
Unit to raise BIMS and an example of this is PC0049629 {POL-0224770}.

At paragraph 7 Mr Roll suggests that there were "P/N pad problems which caused
issues in branches and problems with other peripheral devices such as keyboards
which only occurred intermittently". I note that he does not explain if or how in his
view such issues might have led to discrepancies in a branch's accounts (indeed
he says that he cannot recall the specific detail of the issues). I am not aware of
circumstances in which they would have done so. I suppose it is theoretically
possible that there could be a problem where a Subpostmaster pressed one key
and another number appeared on the screen, but that would be obvious to the
Subpostmaster when looking at the screen. In relation to keyboards, it may also
be worth mentioning that if the physical keyboard did not work, there was an
onscreen keyboard available.

At paragraph 8 Mr Roll describes "one particular case where branch data was not
being replicated from a mobile post office correctly and it appeared that the
subpostmistress was tuming off the power mid transaction". He goes on to say that
"[l] discovered that the button which should have put the laptop into standby mode
was actually switching off the power, resulting in the disk crashing. I disassembled
the laptops to confirm this". At my request, my colleague John Simpkins, Senior
Consultant, carried out a search of the incident management system and found
two incidents (Peaks PC0100174 {POL-0271797} and PC0100899 {POL-
0272727}) that appear to relate to the work Mr Roll is describing. My colleague
undertook a keyword search for incidents containing the words "laptop" and/or
“luggable" and/or "outreach", all of which are likely to cover the events described
by Mr Roll in paragraph 8 of his statement and then added the word "switch" to
locate these Peaks. Whilst I have no personal recollection of this matter, based on
Mr Roll's narratives on the Peaks it appears that:

a hardware fault was identified from equipment on "ONE" (Mr Roll’s capitalised
emphasis from his narrative in the Peak) internal test rig {POL-0271797}. 1
assume from the context that this equates to one hardware item, although it could
conceivably relate to one test rig which comprises a number of counters;

when a hardware unit was retrieved from the site reporting the issue, Mr Roll found
the unit to be "working correctly, no further action required" {POL-0272727};

there is nothing in Mr Roll's incident narratives which record any discussion with
Mr Peach (Mr Roll's Manager at the time and whom I worked with for 17 years
before he retired in 2010), its outcome or the provenance of any information Mr
Roll may have had relating to a faulty batch of hardware, although I note that no
such information is referred to in either Peak;

if Fujitsu was aware of a batch of faulty laptops as Mr Roll suggests, it should and I
believe would have been investigated and the faulty batch been recalled. It was
not in Fujitsu's interests to have faulty equipment in circulation. I would also have
expected to have seen an update of the incident describing any conversation Mr
Roll had with engineering but no such update is present. Further, I do not believe
that Mr Peach would have kept an issue such as this quiet as Mr Roll seems to be
suggesting; and

again, I note that, Mr Roll does not explain whether or how such an issue could
have led to a discrepancy in a branch's accounts and I am not aware of any
circumstances in which that would happen. For completeness, I also note that
laptops were only used in mobile branches (also known as outreach branches) and
any potential impact would be limited to those branches. Although I don't have

exact figures, I understand from my colleague Matthew Lenton that mobile
counters represented around 1% of the total number of counters in use in the Post
Office network in 2006 (data is not available for the period that Mr Roll was
employed by Fujitsu).

Transactional Integrity

10.

11.

At paragraph 9 Mr Roll alleges that "[Djata corruption and glitches sometimes
meant that transactions were not zero sum". He recalls "[...] on more than one
occasion where subpostmasters had problems with a deficit showing in their
accounts, and then as a result of working through a process to try and resolve it,
the deficit doubled". Given the lack of detail I cannot be definite, but I understand
that Mr Roll may be referring to KEL PSteed2847N {POL-0033658}, which relates
to a situation where a user attempted to reverse a Rem In of cash to an incorrect
stock unit and, because of a software error, the value of the Rem In was doubled
instead. This KEL is referred to in my first witness statement.

If that is what Mr Roll is referring to, this KEL does not have anything to do with a
transaction not being a zero sum. It was first raised on 28 April 2003 and it was
agreed that any affected Subpostmaster would be contacted to say that the
problem was due to a software error and that they should ask NBSC for balancing
procedures {POL-0033658}. The NBSC was also told that the branch would need
an error notice for twice the amount of the Rem In. The issue was diagnosed on
28 April 2003 and solution FSTK_2_0_WP16353 was created and sent out as a
new software release on 7 May 2003 so that the problem did not recur {POL-
0262279}.

I am not aware of any case in which baskets were not zero sum (i.e. any case in
which a non-zero-sum basket was accepted into Horizon), although given the lack
of detail in Mr Roll’s statement on this point it is difficult for me to state definitively
that such an issue never arose. I would expect any such issue to result in a
receipts and payments mismatch which would be (1) picked up by Fujitsu's
reconciliation reporting or monitoring (at HNG-X) and (2) visible to the branch
when they balanced at the end of the trading period. Either of these would result
in investigation and resolution by the SSC team.

In paragraph 10 Mr Roll is describing an issue caused by reference data (which
defines the path to be taken from the payment of a bill to the third party actually
receiving money) being incorrect. I cannot recall any instances of incorrect
reference data misdirecting payments while Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu, but
reference data errors do happen and I recall an incident in 2012 involving the
Highland Council. These are usually human errors, in that mistakes can be made

by individuals when setting up reference data but these also have to be missed
during validation and verification before release. The Highland Council issue also
involved an application change which interacted with Post Office's data to cause
the problem, which should have been caught during the validation and verification
of the reference data, but was not.

When incorrect reference data is used, payment could go to the wrong Post Office
client and the customer's bill is not settled, but there would be no impact on a
branch's accounts. If a customer came back to the branch and pointed out that
they had paid a bill that a utility provider, for example, was chasing them for, then I
would expect the Subpostmaster to escalate this via the Helpdesk / Post Office,
rather than processing the payment again without taking any money from the
customer. This sort of issue would be picked up quickly. Peak PC0215488 {POL-
0441279} shows that the Highland Council issue was reported at 08:21:53 on 1
February 2012 and by around 11:00am a reference data download had been
expedited to fix this issue.

At paragraph 11 Mr Roll alleges that there were problems which sometimes arose
after Subpostmasters used the recovery process. He states that "/TJhis might
suggest that there was a problem with the recovery process itself, or at least that it
was not as straightforward as it should have been". He does not articulate any

specific issues, which makes it difficult to comment.

At the time Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu there were two transaction recovery
processes: AP recovery; and banking recovery. I do not have personal experience
of these processes, but am aware that they are set out in the branch
documentation that Post Office issues to Subpostmasters and their design is
covered in APS Counter and Banking counter design documentation {POL-
0107388} and {POL-0061134}. By their nature, recovery processes require a user
to complete a number of steps and where several steps are required mistakes can
be made. For that reason, recovery processes are designed to be as simple as
possible. I note that Mr Roll has not explained how he believes the recovery
processes described above could have been made more "straightforward", which

again makes it difficult to comment.

Mr Roll states that "Fujitsu's stance was generally that if there was a problem with
transactions following a recovery process and if SSC could not identify the cause,
then the problem must have been caused by the Subpostmaster not following the
recovery process properly". I agree that if Fujitsu was unable to identify the cause
of a discrepancy that was said to relate to a recovery issue, having investigated
the matter, the likely conclusion would be that the discrepancy (if there was one
following the recovery process) was probably the result of human error. The key

POL00000687
POL00000687

E2/12/5
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

point here is that the SSC would thoroughly review all of the available evidence. I
am confident that if there had been a software issue in relation to the recovery
process, the SSC would have identified it or in the very unlikely case that we could
not determine root cause, would have at least documented its symptoms. Having
conducted a careful investigation which did not reveal any software issues, human
error would be by far the most likely explanation.

Transaction Corrections (TCs) and Patterns of Software Errors

16.

17.

18.

19.

Mr Roll states at paragraph 12 that he cannot recall Fujitsu carrying out any
analysis of TCs to try and identify if there had been an underlying software error.
TCs were not introduced until 2006, some two years after Mr Roll had left Fujitsu.
During the period that Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu, Post Office sent Error
Notices to branches. Fujitsu would not have analysed Error Notices. They were
not within its remit, being dealt with by Post Office on the basis of its own back
office processes.

I agree with Mr Roll's statement at paragraph 13 that "[AJithough it is correct that
high frequency problems were found during testing, it was impossible to test for
every permutation of data, and testing did not result in the identification of all
errors". The same could be said of every computer system in the world.

POL00000687
POL00000687

{1/10/43

At paragraph 14 Mr Roll disagrees with a statement made by Dr Worden that “all {E1/10/4}; {E1/10/5}

software errors would have been picked up by processes which were in place, or
that the likelihood of software errors staying disguised as human errors was very
small. Mr Roll does this on the basis that "subpostmasters would have been held
responsible for problems which had not at any time been identified as software
errors, either because they could not identify the problem and did not pursue these
with Post Office or Fujitsu, or because when they were raised we (Fujitsu) were
ultimately unable to identify the problem at the time."

Fujitsu has mechanisms in place for detecting potential issues. In paragraph I{E2/11/5}; {E2/11/6}

26.1.1(b) of my first statement I briefly explained that the System Management
Centre monitors system events and I briefly described the work of the
Communications Management team in paragraph 26.1.2. Each of these teams
would generate support actions based on system generated event information. It
is also the case that the sheer number of Subpostmasters using the service and
reporting issues via the Help desks make it very unlikely that there is any
significant number of hidden errors. These mechanisms are so effective at
identifying when bugs are a cause of problems that it would be very rare for a bug
to not be detected.

Once an issue has been raised, Fujitsu is experienced in providing support and will
go to great lengths to investigate the root cause. In paragraph 61 of my first
statement I explained that Fujitsu use a custom solution, developed and
administered by the SSC, which allows us to record support knowledge into a
Known Error Log (KEL). KELs record support knowledge which is intended to
assist staff in the support and understanding of the Horizon system.

Mr Roll's statement that "subpostmasters would have been held responsible for
problems which had not at any time been identified as software errors... because
when they were raised we (Fujitsu) were ultimately unable to identify the problem
at the time" assumes that if Fujitsu was not able to get to the root cause of an
issue, it must have been a software error rather than a human error. But as I
explain in paragraph 15 above, if Fujitsu was unable to identify any software issues
after carrying out a careful investigation, human error would be by far the most

likely explanation.

On the odd occasion Fujitsu may identify that there is a software issue but we may
not get to the root cause of an issue and take a decision not to take matters
further. Such a decision would generally be where an issue is determined to be
low priority and low impact. It would be made by the development / architectural
group in conjunction with POL, not by the SSC. If the issue was causing a
financial impact in a branch's accounts, it would be treated as high priority and
high impact as I explained in paragraph 62.8 of my first witness statement. In such
cases, the Fujitsu Support and Development organisation would keep going until it
identified the cause of the software issue. This might even include generating
bespoke code in the application to generate additional diagnostics (Mr Roll would
not have carried out such work). Even a problem exhibiting minimal financial loss
(in terms of value) would be treated as essential to fix for the financial integrity of
the system.

I think that Mr Roll may be trying to suggest that Fujitsu were quite happy to
assume that issues were the responsibility of Subpostmasters. That is not the
case. We investigated matters thoroughly and if we identified an error in Horizon,
we dealt with it appropriately. Our investigative and analytical procedures have
always been thorough in my view and while I obviously cannot say that in each
and every case our diagnosis was correct, I am confident that that was the case in
the overwhelming majority of cases.

Testing of software and development fixes

24.

At paragraph 15 Mr Roll alleges that during his time at Fujitsu there were "budget
pressures and redundancies which impacted system development and testing"

POL00000687
POL00000687

(E 2/1118}

E2/12/7
25.

25.2

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

and which "negatively affected the test regime". \t is true that Post Office would
want to resolve issues quickly, in particular those which were causing major
issues, and it is also true that, like any other business, Fujitsu operated within a
budget. However, points such as this did not affect the quality of development or
testing that was done. Fujitsu would not knowingly release something that did not
or might not work and there were often times when releases were delayed to give
Fujitsu more time to carry out testing. I would also mention that Mr Roll would not
have had any first hand visibility of budgets in his role.

At paragraph 16 Mr Roll alleges that the SSC team and Fujitsu were generally
under pressure "due to an awareness of the financial penalties imposed by Service
Level Agreements between Post Office and Fujitsu". At paragraph 43 of my first
witness statement I explained that the possibility of financial penalties or Service
Level Agreement breach was never a factor which affected the diligence with

which SSC would investigate an issue. By way of further explanation:

Schedule 15 to the "Service Level Targets for Horizon Services" {POL-0084662}
contains the agreed service levels and remedies in force as part of the "varied and
restated" Codified Agreement between Fujitsu and Post Office dated 30 November
2005. The Service Level Agreements were concerned with the overall flow of data
through the estate and the need to ensure that transaction data reached its
destination within certain time limits.

There were no specific financial penalties relating to the SSC processing of
incidents. The Service Description for Third Line Software Support Service {POL-
0106081} confirms that:-

"There are no specific service targets linked directly with this service [i.e. the SSC].
However attainment of all data delivery Service Level Targets, as detailed in
Annex 2 of Schedule 15, is directly related to the successful provision of this
service."

Penalties on delivering transactions were assessed on a per transaction basis.
Therefore, if for example a large number of transactions did not reach their
destinations on time I suppose that penalties could in theory add up to the type of
figure Mr Roll refers to in paragraph 16. However, any penalties would not have
changed the SSC's attitude as to the level of diligence carried out. I agree that
such penalties were sometimes talked about in the support community but as far
as I am aware Fujitsu was never charged any large penalty. In my opinion that is
because Fujitsu did a good job and not because they cut comers to avoid them, as
Mr Roll seems to be suggesting. I would say that it is the nature of the support
environment that you only ever see the transaction that goes wrong and are not

POL00000687
POL00000687

E2/12/8
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

conscious of the millions of transactions that worked faultlessly. This can skew
one’s perception of the system as a whole.

The SSC had operational targets to turn incidents around based on an order of
priority. As explained in paragraph 22 above, if an issue was causing a financial
impact in a branch's accounts, it would be treated as high priority and high impact
by SSC. However, any increase in priority would not adversely impact the

diligence with which work was done.

Identifying Unexpected Events

26.

I agree with Mr Roll when he says that "Horizon's ability to identify unexpected
events depended on how it was designed and programmea" at paragraph 19. It is
correct that if the SSC found something that should have been picked up by the
system they would notify developers so they could fix the software or ensure that a
warning was generated to cause support action to take place. Anything which had
the potential to affect branch accounts would be considered to be high impact and
was raised with the development group for root cause fix.

Transaction Injection in Old Horizon

27.

28.

28.1

28.2

28.3

In paragraph 20 of Roll 2, Mr Roll describes a process by which transactions could
be inserted via individual branch counters by using the correspondence server to
piggy back through the gateway. He has not previously made this point clear.
Now that he has, following a discussion with colleagues who performed such
actions I can confirm that this was possible. I did not mention it in my first witness
statement because, when faced with a less clear account in Mr Roll's first
statement, my recollection was that if it was necessary for the SSC to inject a
transaction data into a branch's accounts, it would have been injected into the
correspondence server (injecting via the server was the default option which was
followed in the vast majority of cases).

PC0175821 {POL-0345994} is an example of data being injected into the
counter. I was not involved in this incident, but having reviewed the Peak I can
see that:-

this incident concerned five corrupted bureau transactions on the counter;

Post Office contacted the manager and they did another balance with the correct
declarations. This resulted in a net gain of £10.85;

Post Office agreed to the SSC taking corrective measures by inserting messages

which caused an equal but opposite effect and this resolved the issue;

E2/12/9

the messages were inserted with the additional property <Comment:PC0175821>
to allow them to be identified in the audit trail; and

details on the email conversations with POL (including their authorisation) are
attached to the Peak along with confirmation that the Branch Manager was
contacted.

At my request, my colleague John Simpkins (Senior Consultant), carried out a
search of the incident management system for incidents which required injecting
data into the counter, using any one of the following search terms:
“RiposteMessageFile", “RiposteMessage", "LPO Delete", "Marooned",
“RiposteObject put". From the results I can determine that this was only carried out
in the following circumstances while Mr Roll was employed by Fujitsu:-

fixing a Riposte Index at the counter;

removing a historic message that was influencing the balancing process on a
replaced counter;

correcting configuration data after a PinPad change;

removing redundant configuration items;

the example given above involving five corrupted bureau transactions; and
removing historic recovery information.

In total, data was injected into the counter on 14 occasions. 1 However,
transactions were injected in only one of these cases, namely the case described
in paragraph 29.5 above.

Transactions injected into a counter would appear on the transaction logs available
on Horizon as if it had been carried out by the user that was logged into the
counter at the time (if nobody was logged on, the User ID would be
missing). However, when injecting such a transaction, the SSC user would ensure
that it was clearly identified in the audit trail as having been inserted by SSC.
Examples of such identification I am aware of are the use of a SSC user as the
Clerk ID and / or details of the incident number as an additional property.

At paragraphs 21 and 22 Mr Roll states that both he and the "SSC team generally
had the ability to inject data" and that "there was no limit on the type of transaction
that we could insert". At paragraph 20.2 of my first statement I said that "some"
members of the team could do this, but this was badly stated. Everyone in the SSC
team had the ability to inject data. My intention was to express the fact that only
limited numbers of SSC technicians ever needed to inject financial data.

There were (and are) strict procedural controls in place relating to injecting
transaction data into branch accounts and I am not aware of any occasions on
which they were not followed in practice. Section 4.5.5.4 of the Access Control
Policy {POL-051 1064} states that:

“updates to code or data by application support staff require two staff to be present
when the change is made and all such changes to be audited, identifying what has
been changed (before and after values) and the individual who made the change."

To the best of my recollection these controls were followed in practice. The SSC
was (and is) hugely reluctant to change financial data as that was not their job and
they recognised the seriousness of doing so.

With reference to Dr. Worden's statement that "as for transferring money, Horizon
includes no functionality that allows payments to be made to external parties or
account", at paragraphs 20.1, 20.3, 21 and 58.4 of my first statement I said that
money could not be transferred, by which I mean that it could not be transferred
into a third party's bank account. I have given this matter further thought and
discussed it with my colleagues and we have now theorised that someone could
have carried out a Post Office transaction, such as a GIRO bank transfer® or a
utility bill payment. A GIRO bank transfer inserted by someone at SSC would have
been detected as part of Post Office's reconciliation processes because there
would be no accompanying paper document. There is no accompanying paper
document for a utility bill payment, so in theory such a transaction would not be
detected through reconciliation. I am not aware of any such activity ever taking
place and if it had occurred it would have resulted in instant dismissal.

Rebuilding branch transaction data

36.

At paragraph 23 Mr Rolls describes the process of "rebuilding branch transaction
data". As part of this process he alleges that transaction data was "corrected" by
copying it to the SSC, altering it whilst on the SSC's computers and then
downloading it back to the branch and that there was a risk of data not being

? & Giro bank is also an AP transaction (like bill payments). It is the only type of bank
account that is. All other banking deposits go through a totally different path

accurately copied across or even deleted. He goes on to say that this was
sometimes done without a Subpostmaster’s knowledge at paragraph 24.

In paragraphs 55.3 and 55.4 of my first statement I described what happens if one
of the sets of data on a branch counter became corrupted. I explained that:-

while this process involves deleting and replacing a set of data, no new data is
produced; all that happens is that the replicated data is used to replace the data
that has become corrupted from another counter in the branch; and

it would have been necessary for the SSC to inform a branch before carrying out
this task because it is likely that any attempt to use that counter would conflict with
the support work being carried out.

For completeness, in the rare circumstances where it was necessary for Fujitsu to
rebuild transaction data in Legacy Horizon, there were three possible scenarios:

when a counter failed and there was a complete replication of that counter's
transactions elsewhere, Fujitsu simply deleted the message (transaction) store on
the faulty counter and used the standard facilities of the Riposte software to re-
build the data from the replicated copy. In this scenario, the branch would be
unable to use the counter while this process was carried out (it would be in

“recovery mode”);

where no replicated copies of the transactions existed on the network, Fujitsu
would physically retrieve the disk from the faulty counter. The disc should hold all
of the transactions that had taken place on the counter. At its own office, the SSC
would extract the transaction data and deliver it to the replacement counter without
amending that data. The SSC would need the Subpostmaster's memory card
(AKA PMMC) to de-crypt the data. This was a physical card (a Subpostmaster had
two) and Fujitsu would have to borrow one — so the Subpostmaster would know
what was happening. If Fujitsu were to change anything, it would be to remove the
envelope around the transaction data. The envelope contains the system admin
data, i.e. the sequence number of the data and its ID. Fujitsu would not change
the transaction data itself and in removing the envelope data, they would simply be
allowing the system to automatically re-number the transactions when they were
re-inserted. Ultimately, when the counter was replaced at the branch the
Subpostmaster would be able to see what Fujitsu had done. I recognise this is
contrary to what I said at paragraph 55.4 of my first witness statement. This is
because I was not entirely clear on the points being made by Mr Roll when I was
responding to his first statement.

In the rare cases where Fujitsu was not able to access a portion of the transaction
data from the disk then we would replicate transactions as far as we were able to
and would notify Post Office and the Subpostmaster of this and any information
we had on the extent and potential timing of any missing transactions
(PC0049629 {POL-0224770}).

STATE

At paragraph 25 of his statement, Mr Roll states that "/...] whilst my workload did
involve some support to engineers opening and closing branches, I would
estimate that this made up only 30% of my work, and the majority of my workload
(estimate 70%) involved looking for faults on data stores, preparing reports for the
manager as a result of problems with Horizon experienced by the Estate,[...}." I
do not accept the alleged percentage split of Mr Roll's workload or his explanation
as to why that split was not reflected in Fujitsu's records. At Mr Rolls level, the
vast majority of his work would be recorded as attributable to him. As for his
suggestion "a group of perhaps 4 or 5 SSC staff could end up working on the
same problem, but for recording purposes this would be assigned to one person
[...}", it is possible that workload could be re-assigned to another person in the
event of sickness, rare skills being required on more urgent work or a change of
skillset being needed as an incident progresses. Wherever possible we would
ensure that the same SSC person worked through an incident to resolution to
ensure continuity. The suggestion that 4 or 5 people would work on the same

problem is an extreme case.
