1.0 Introduction

During 2003 Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account (RMGA) introduced a ‘streamlined’
set of Business Continuity plans comprising of three documents.

1, the Horizon Services Business Continuity Plan (CS/PLA/079);
2, the Horizon Support Services Business Continuity Plan (this document);
3, the Horizon Service Desk Business Continuity Plan

(CS/PLA/015 a CCD therefore kept separate.)

This Contingency Plan provides a summarised description of the overall Operational Horizon
Support Service provided by Fujitsu Services. This includes the following sub-services:

e Key Management Service;

e Auto-Configuration Service;

¢ Outlet Change Management Service;

e SAP (POLFS) Development and QA-Test Systems

e System Management Centre software and operational Services;
e System Support Centre Services;

« System Operate Services;

e Reference Data Management Service (BRAOI based);

e¢ Management Information Services, including the Data Warehouse and the Data
Reconciliation Service.

© Cable & Wireless (Network supplier);
e Transaction Network Services (Network Supplier).

e RMGA Programme and Development Operational Support

This document describes the measures taken by Fujitsu Services to minimise the risk of
RMGA being unable to provide these services and it explains the actions the Problem, Service,
or Business Continuity Manager will take to instigate service recovery.

4.0 Service Functionality

4.1 Services Overview

For the purposes of Business Continuity planning this contingency plan has been
produced to document the Royal Mail Group Account responsibilities for the end to
end Horizon Services. From an operational perspective it is impracticable for the plans
to cover every element or component in the end-to-end service, e.g. an unserviceable
power lead in a single counter outlet, however major components are documented in
the risk table within section 10.

Figure One provides an overview of all the Horizon Services for which RMGA has
partial or full responsibility. The diagram also provides details of the support
applications and services covered within REF 3 and 4.

It is emphasised that hardware components such as the Database Server, Generic
Agents, Correspondence Servers, LAN Switches and Network Routers in the Data-
centre deliver service to all the sub-services detailed in this plan. For some sub-
services, for example Network Banking, there are hardware and software components
specifically dedicated to that sub-service, e.g. the NBX Authorisation Agent servers
and NBX De-militarised Zone.

4.1.1 Infrastructure Sub-Services

A number of IT sub-services are used to support the Horizon services, however for the
purposes of this plan they can be categorised into the following seven infrastructure
support sub-services:

The Key Management Service;
The Auto-Configuration Service;
The Outlet Change Management Service;

Management Information Systems (Data Warehouse and Data Reconciliation Service
TES);

SAP - Post Office Limited Financial Service (Development and QATest servers)
System Management Service (primarily consisting of Tivoli eventing);
Network Services (C&W and Transaction Network Services).

For the purposes of this continuity plan these sub-services can be considered to be
running from the infrastructure contained in the campuses (see REF3 for Campus
details.)

4.1.2 Operational Support Sub-services
Additionally there are a number of Horizon operational support sub-services:
These consist of a number of support teams:
1) The Horizon Service Desk who provide first line support.

2) The System Management Centre who, in addition to system management, provide
second line technical support.

3) The System Support Centre (SSC) who primarily provides third line support
services.

4) Fourth line support is provided either by the Royal Mail Group Account
Development team or by external suppliers, e.g. Esher or Microsoft.

The Horizon service is also supported by number of operational units

1) The Core Services System Operate Service team who provide Unix, NT and
database operational expertise.

2) The System Management Centre operational event management team and MSS
staff based at Wigan and Stevenage.

3) The RMGA Customer Service operational teams, i.e. providing Reference Data
operational service, and the Horizon Service Delivery Management functions.

4) The RMGA Programme and Development operational support teams.

4.2 Infrastructure Support Services

This section provides descriptions of the functionality of the seven infrastructure
supporting sub-services documented within this plan.

4.2.1 The Key Management Service

4.2.1.1 Introduction to Cryptography in RMGA

The Security Functional Specification identifies a number of uses for cryptography in
securing the RMGA business services. Subsequent agreements have identified further
requirements for cryptography to protect third-party software. With one exception, the
complete list of cryptographic protections at the time of writing is:

e APS Smart Acknowledgement

e Audit Server

© Software Issue

© Client services Automated Payment service

© Post Office Filestore Encryption Key

© Post Office Counters Ltd, Transaction Information Processing

© POL Reference Data

e Automated Payment service bulk Client transaction records

e Landis & Gyr 3" party code and data protection

e Landis & Gyr transaction-enabling functions

¢ Utimaco Virtual Private Network

e Rambutan encryption of data links

e Pinpads

The exception is the Escher Riposte application software authentication. Keys for this
cryptographic function are not managed within the RMGA run-time system and so are
excluded from the scope of this document

4.2.1.2 Key Management System Implementation

All the cryptographic functions in the above list require keys. These keys must be
securely created, distributed and installed in the cryptographic functions, and each key
must be changed periodically. Hence, there are a number of common key management
activities to be performed across a diverse spectrum of keys. All of this activity is to be
managed by a single officer of RMGA, defined as the Cryptographic Key Manager.

To help to visualise this problem space, and to begin to organise it, the “fan diagram”
of Figure Two was evolved.

Figure Two.

It represents key management emanating from a single point of control and fanning out
along segments which correspond to the various uses of cryptography (as listed above)
to the many points at which the keys are used. Note that the TIP and RD
cryptographic applications are considered under the protection domains POL TIP and
PWY TIP, one corresponding to authentication of POL to RMGA and the other
corresponding to authentication of RMGA to POL.

Some key management actions are manual. Representation in the fan diagram does not
necessarily imply automation. For example, Rambutan keys, which are supplied by an
external agency and installed in special hardware, will be managed entirely by manual
procedures. However, the Key Management system will provide the Key Manager
with facilities to record and track manual procedures.

Figure Three provides an abstract view of the subsystems and main data flows of the
Key Management System.

4.2.1.3 The Key Management Controller

The Key Management Controller (KMC) is the software providing the control centre
for the key management system. It comprises the Key Management Application
(KMA), which is in fact a suite of programs built around a management information
database, together with supporting software and hardware for key generation and
certification. The database contains a model of the rest of the system and all the
managed objects (keys, clients, etc.) within it. The KMA uses this model to give the
Key Manager a view of the system status, and to assist the Key Manager in performing
management actions, guarding the integrity and coherence of the system as a whole.

The KMA functionality must be available to the Key Manager located at either BRAOI
or LEW02. This is achieved via a client-server architecture with KMA workstations
being located at BRAO1 and LEW02 and a server at each of the RMGA Campuses.

4.2.1.4 I The Key Management Application Workstations
KMA workstations are available at BRAO1 and at LEW02 (for disaster recovery
purposes).

4.2.1.5 The Key Management Server.

Key Management Servers are available at both Data-centres and are connected on
KMS LANs via two I Gbit inter-campus virtual LAN. One server acts as a standby
for the other. The disks containing the KM information base on the standby server

mirrors those of the active server via a high speed link. The disks are actually attached
to an EMC server which manages the replication. For simplicity it is considered that
the EMC server is part of the KM server. A spare client workstation is available in one
of the campuses.

4.2.1.6 Key Management Clients

A Key Management client comprises a platform and associated software requiring the
services of the Key Management Controller. The client population is numerically
dominated by the PCs on PO counters but there are many other client types

On many types of client, a Key Management Client Agent is installed; this is the
software primarily responsible for mediating between the Key Management system and
the cryptographic support software running on the client during normal operation.

The KMC and its clients communicate by means of distribution and monitoring
channels.

4.2.1.7 Certification Authority Workstations

The Certification Authority (CA) is an application which takes public keys as input and
packages them in public key certificates (PKC). The certificates are signed with the CA
private key. The CA also signs CRLs. The CA is implemented on a dedicated off-line
platform, the CA workstation (CAW). Data is transferred between the CAW and the
KMA workstation using removable disks. There are two CA workstations, a master
and a secondary for disaster recovery purposes, both are maintained in secure off-line
facilities.

4.2.1.8 I KMS Admin Workstations
KMS Admin workstations are available at:
BRAO1 and LEW02 for the use of the Security Manager and Security Auditor;

Trident House (IRE11) and Bridgeview (DR standby site) for System Operation
Service security manager, KMS SYSADM and DBA administration;

BRAO1 for System Support Centre support use.

4.2.1.9 I KMS Help Desk Client

KMS Help Desk client is installed on System Management Centre Tivoli workstations
for support use in STE04 and BRAO! (DR standby site).

4,2.1.10 Network Banking Service Key Production Workstations

Three workstations were introduced to support the production of keys for the
Network Banking Service. They are included for completeness and it should be
emphasised that the live operation of the KMS service is not directly dependant upon
them.

The Atalla ‘Secure Configuration Terminal’ is used to initially generate the keys for
the Compaq Atalla HSM cards. These keys are then transferred to the Card Loading
Workstation. Each Atalla card is installed in the Card Loading Workstation in turn and
loaded with its keys. The Atalla card is then removed and installed on the NBX
Authorisation Agent Servers (these have two cards), KMA Workstation or FTMS
Gateway.

The Secure Pinpad Key Generation Workstation is used to generate keys for loading
into Pinpads. These keys are loaded in to the Pinpads either by Hypercom or by a
remote download facility.

Keys are used to sign [R]s and [A]s between the Counter and the Authorisation Agent
Servers. Additional keys for the Network Banking Service are delivered to the NBX
Authorisation Agents and Counters using existing Horizon processes.

4.2.1.11 Debit Card System Key Management

Many aspects of the requirements of the Debit Card System for key management are
common to the Network Banking Service. However, over and above the NBX
requirements, there is a need to deliver appropriate keys to the DCS Agent Servers and
DCSM Servers.

Delivery of all keys for DCS utilises existing Horizon processes.

4.2.1.12 KMS Fail-over.

There are two KMA Servers, a primary KMA Server (in Bootle) and a secondary
KMA Server (in Wigan). Each server advertises two connections to the network, a
permanent connection and a switch-able resilient connection.

The switch-able connection relies on the Virtual LAN (VLAN) capability so that either
KMA Server can take over the IP address reserved for the ‘current’? KMA Database.
Three additional names KMSCURRENT, KMSSTANDBY and KMSINACTIVE are
defined for the switch-able connections. These logical names are recorded in HOSTS
files. The KMSCURRENT IP address is switched between the KMA Servers at times
of fail-over to the secondary KMA Server and fallback to the primary KMA Server,
whilst the KMS entries in the HOSTS files remain constant for all platforms
connecting to the KMA Database.

In the event of the ‘prime’ KMA server failing or the failure of a campus, then FSCS
operations will close down the ‘prime’ and transfer the KMSCURRENT IP address to
the ‘standby’ and restart the ‘standby’. All 'clients' of the KMA server can then connect
to the 'standby' via the KMSCURRENT IP address.

With this fail-over methodology, the ‘clients’ of the failed ‘prime’ KMA server do not
require any modification to the destination IP address or to the route to that KMA
server as the ‘standby’ is now the ‘prime’, with the same IP address and route.

The KMA application fail-over scripts, produced by KMA development, confirms the
IP address changes before starting any KMA applications on the ‘standby’.

KMA Operations Guide REF 10 provides full details, including to FSCS Operations, of
the fail-over process

4.2.2 Auto-Configuration Service

4.2.2.1 Introduction

Counter PCs are built with a defined software baseline. Due to the time delay between
PC build and installation, it is possible that the software level on the newly installed PC
has become out of date.

Auto-Configuration is the process, at either rollout or change, by which gateway or
slave PCs receive their personalised networking and printer details for operation within
an outlet. In addition, as part of the Auto-Configuration process, it supports software
catch-up as described in this section.

The Auto-Configuration Service is dependant upon the availability of the Host and
Maestro, the Outlet Change Management Service, the Tivoli infrastructure, the Key
Management Service, the VPN layer, Correspondence Servers and network
communication through to the counters. However, the focus is placed upon the Auto-
Configuration Service primary devices i.e. Auto-Configuration server and database,
Auto-Configuration Signing server and the Boot Server/Loader.

Service Structure

Figure Four provides an overview of the Auto-Configuration Service and its primary
interfaces.

Auto-Configuration Server

This is the server upon which the Auto-Configuration Database (ACDB) resides.
There is one server located at each data-centre. The Auto-Configuration database
holds the data necessary for the Auto-Configuration application to function.

Note that the Auto-Configuration server is not required to be online during the Auto
Config process of counter installation et al. (The counter-specific files and data are
held and distributed via Tivoli at a suitable point in time.)

Auto-Configuration Signing Server

The Auto-Configuration Signing Server provides a digital signature for Auto-
Configuration generated files for verification by Tivoli on receipt and on delivery to the
outlets. An Auto-Configuration Signing Sever is located at each data-centre.

Tivoli Infrastructure

Tivoli is the systems management tool used by the Horizon system to distribute
software to the counter. The Tivoli infrastructure takes a feed from the Network
Service Type (NSAT) process on the short-term performance database platform for
the introduction of the bronze and silver service outlets for Network Banking (for their
CHAP authentication process).

There is a feed, containing schedule data and other relevant information, from the
OCMS server to Tivoli.

Radius Servers

Radius Servers are accessed via the Aggregate routers and provide Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authentication for the in-bound calls
from ADSL, GSM and ISDN connected outlets.

Boot Service

The Boot service consists of a Boot Server platform (specifically for satellite
outlets) and a Boot Loader platform (specifically for ISDN & ASDL outlets). These
platforms provide the Boot Server Files, which contain the initial network
information and host name, to outlet gateway PCs when they are initially installed
or upon their replacement. A Boot Sever and Loader is located at each data-centre.

The Boot Server Files are transferred over a PSTN connection for ASDL and ISDN
connected outlets and via the Satellite networks for BT VSAT outlets.

4.2.2.8  Riposte Layer

The applications at this level are updated with details of new counters via the Auto-
Configuration database to establish data paths between the counters and the campus
platforms.

4.2.3 Outlet Change Management Service Structure

4.2.3.1 Introduction

The OCMS Server runs a Microsoft SQL Server database application which allows CS staff to
manage a set of defined ‘outlet change services’. OCMS provides facilities to allow Customer
Services to record, schedule and manage planned changes which require physical change at the
Outlet. Customer Services have agreed to provide specific services to Post Office Limited for
each required change. The agreed changes that may be requested by Post Office Limited as
planned Outlet Change are documented in the OBC Change Catalogue. Information is
exchanged with OCMS suppliers, i.e. Tivoli, Auto-configuration.

4.2.3.2 Structure

4,2.3.2.1_OCMS Servers

There are two Proliant 1850R OCMS Servers, one in each Data-centre, both of which
are capable of running the OCMS service. In normal operations one server would be
active and the other acting as a warm standby.

The OCMS data is held in an SQL Server database and a variety of ‘flat files’ on local
hard disk storage using RAIDS. SQL mirroring software regularly copies data to the
secondary server.

The OCMS servers are connected to the Data-centre host LANs.

4,2.3.2.2, OCMS Workstation

The OCMS Servers are accessed from, SecurID protected, OCMS Client workstations
connected over an encrypted link to Wigan or Bootle from a private LAN in BRAO1I.
CRE02 LAN connection is via a ISDN link.

For resilience three OCMS Workstations are available in CREO2 and two at BRAOI.
An additional OCMS Client workstation is available for System Management purposes
at Wigan.

4,2.3.2.3, OCMS Data Transfer.

OCMS data is transferred externally to Auto configuration, Tivoli and FSCS. The
OCMS Server has associated remote FTMS gateway servers for transferring data to
and from FSCS.

A separate FTMS Local Gateway machine, which resides on the Data-centre secure
LAN, for OCMS is included for transferring data to FSCS.

The Audit Server is used to copy off the OCMS files sent to Tivoli.

4,2.3.2.4 NT Domains.

The live OCMS Server and its Client Terminals will reside in the BOPSS NT domain
The backup OCMS Server will reside in the WOPSS NT domain.

4,2.3.2.5 I OCMS Fail-over.

The OCMS Servers at both data centres use the same IP address on a VLAN. This
allows the OCMS Client workstation to remain unchanged after fail-over from the
primary to secondary OCMS server.

4.2.4 Management Information Services

4.2.4.1. I Management Information Services Overview

The Management Information Service consists of three primary databases, i.e. the Data
Reconciliation Service, the Transaction Enquiry Service and the Data Warehouse, all
of which reside on the Database Server.

The NBX Network Banking RAC Model and the Debit Card RAC Model in REF3
illustrate the relationship of these three services/databases.

For operational details and contingency measures for the Database Server, the Data
Reconciliation Service and the Transaction Enquiry Service please refer to REF3.

The RMGA Management Information Service does not have access to the APOP
Voucher database which resides on the Database server. (An APOP Administration
Service is available within Post Office Limited at their Northern Data Centre.)

4,2.4.3.1 Data Warehouse Service Structure

The overall structure and functionality for contingency purposes may be represented as

follows.

The “data warehouse process” is the set of operations/processes required to source,
load, manage and publish data in the data warehouse. Typically, such processes involve
data loading, “cleaning”, transformation and aggregation. As noted in [1], data
“cleaning” will not be conducted for the RMGA data warehouse. Figure Seven gives a
conceptual overview of the processing required to operate the RMGA data warehouse.

Figure Seven
In summary, data is provided by the source systems in the form of flat files uploaded to

a dedicated area on the data warehouse. Note that the flat files are used to insulate the
data warehouse from dependencies on the source systems’ data models, software
version etc. The source files are then loaded (in parallel, where appropriate) into a
staging area within the data warehouse. This staging area holds a complete day’s
worth of data. Any transformations which may be required (e.g. derivation of values
etc) will be performed on loaded data, and not as part of the load processes. The
staging area will normally be the data source for processes which pre-compute daily
aggregated totals. These pre-computed totals are required by invoicing (invoice data)
and to satisfy end-user queries. The data in “today” is transformed into a dimensional
structure and moved into CP. CP stores the data pertinent to the current period while
it is being built up over the course of the week. Once the CP has been completed, the
data is moved over to PP (this move requires no transformation). After the data has
been moved, it is archived. Archived data is used by the “near-line” mechanism to
allow data which is no longer on-line to be queried. CP and PP are the data sources for
processes which pre-compute aggregates of grains greater than a single day (i.e.
weekly and monthly)

The DFD feed is provided from an interactive harvested agent. This is contrary to the
design goals of the DW to be able to operate asynchronously, and makes recovery a
tricky operation. In principle the Agent Run Table TMS_ART_DWH will enable the
harvesting to be restarted from the correct checkpoint in the message-store, but there
is a risk that the data may have been archived (deleted) from the message-store due to
old age, and Application Support assistance may be needed in re-harvesting. It is not a
problem if duplicate data is harvested, as the DW will cope with this.

If the data was harvested late the first time, and after fail-over is harvested 'on time’,
then reports produced before and after fail-over may vary. This will not happen with
feeds from data files.

No changes were necessary to the TPS Interface for the introduction of the NBX
service.

4.2.4.4 The Data Reconciliation Service

The DRS is the component that provides reconciliation processing. It interacts with the
Outlets, and the Horizon central systems.

Reconciliation takes places at several levels.

Between the FIs reported positions against [R], [A] and [C2] messages and the
Horizon reported positions. Confirmed (i.e. reconciled) transactions are reported to
the DRS as [C4] messages from the TES. Transaction exceptions are reported to the
DRS as [D] messages:

[D] indicates an exception or error condition

Transaction details are forwarded to TIP based upon the reported end of day from
each Outlet. The transaction details are derived from the [C1] messages. If a
communications failure occurs, or other failure leading to delayed EoD reporting this
flow may be delayed by (up to) several days. Existing EPOSS reconciliation measures
are used to detect and report on discrepancies across this interface.

The DRS provides reconciliation between the FI’s view and the TIP view by
maintaining tables of each reported transaction outcome across each interface:

[C12] — as derived from the NBX Confirmation Harvester Agent
[C1] —as reported to TIP
[C2] — as reported to the TES by the DRS

[C4] — as reported from the DRS by the TES (derived from the LREC and
REC files)

This position is maintained for each combination of IIN (range) and service. Since
there is no single PO Ltd EoD cut off, settlement and reconciliation will both be based
upon the MA settlement day boundary as a synchronisation point. This is notified to
Horizon within the [A1] message and via trailer records within the [C4] file, such that
each [C4] file can be recorded as associated with a FI posting day.

Where a zero-value [CO] is created following timeout of the [A], this value will be
blank and the Settlement Date will be provided in the [C4] message. Normally such
transactions will have no net settlement significance, although the original [A] may

generate a FI settled transaction posted on the day of authorisation, which is reversed
on a later posting day, following receipt of the [C2]. The DRS will apply separate
reporting category rules for dealing with exceptions reported by the NBE e.g. [D]
which will require investigation and manual corrective adjustment.

The immediate status of any specific transaction will be reflected in one of the internal
transaction states within the DRS.

4,2.4.4.1 Reconciliation Reporting — Horizon Outlets to DRS
There are two types of message flow between Horizon Outlets and the DRS.

1, Individual [C12] transactions. These are transferred throughout the day by the NBX
Confirmation Harvester Agent. Harvesting is done on a continuous basis, with the
[C12]s loaded into the DRS in recoverable commitment units, following normal
replication of the [C1] messages within the EPOSS transactions

2, EoD transaction processing of [C11] transactions. As part of the normal EoD
Campus processing, TPS transaction harvesting will occur following receipt of the
EoD marker from Outlets. This provides a delineated set of completed transactions
up to the Outlet declared EoD, which forms the basis for transaction reporting to
TIP. (Subsequently such transactions also provide the basis for calculating the Cash
Account report for TIP.)

NBX transactions included within the TPS harvesting will be forwarded to the DRS to
provide an aggregated Outlet position to support reconciliation. Such transactions will
be consistent with the Outlet reported transactions sent to TIP (other reconciliation
measures detect inconsistencies within the TIP reporting stream), and will include the
intended Cash Account Period (CAP) in which they will accounted by PO Ltd (as part
of the TIP processing).

4,2.4.4.2 Reconciliation Reporting - RMGA DRS to PO Ltd

A number of reports are generated, some daily and some weekly, as defined in
CS/SPE/011 — Network Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting.

4.2.4.4.3 MIS Clients

FS RMGA Customer Service on a monthly, weekly and ad hoc basis, produce
management reports. There are three MIS clients available at FS Bracknell, and for
contingency purposes two MIS clients are available at STE04, for the production of
these reports.

The TES Query Application is used by RMGA Service Delivery to access a read-only
view of Network Banking Transaction details. A ‘3 tiered’ approach has been adopted
using an Oracle Forms Server to query the TES Host Application and host the Query
application logic. User access to the application is via a local Web Browser running the
Oracle JInitiator Java Runtime Environment and Forms applet on the MIS clients.

4.2.5 POLFS Development and Test/QA Services

The Post Office Limited Financial Services SAP service consists of three elements a
Production service, a Development service and a QATest service. The POLFS
Production service is documented within the Horizon Services Business Continuity
Plan REF3.

The POLFS Development and QATest service have been classified as supporting
services and are therefore included in this plan.

The POLFS Development Service is hosted on a platform in the Fujitsu Bootle Data-
centre, and the QATest Service is hosted on a platform in the Fujitsu Wigan Data-
centre.

In the even of a disaster at Bootle or a major incident occurring with the Production
server, the QATest server at Wigan may be invoked for disaster recovery purposes.
Refer to REF3.

The POLFS Development and QATest services are normally available Monday to
Friday from 08:00 to 18:00. However either could be available at other times by
agreement.

There are no business continuity or disaster recovery requirements for either the
POLFS Development and Test/QA services.

Post Office Limited users can run and print POL-FS financial reports from the POLFS
Production system located in Bootle, by access through the POL Northern Data
Centre. Additionally, Post Office Limited users are able to develop and test changes,
along with Prism Development, on the POLFS systems in Wigan, again accessing these
systems via the POL Northern Data Centre.

Tn the event that the POL Northern Data Centre is unavailable, Post Office Limited
may decide to invoke POL NDC disaster recovery for the TIP remote Gateway at
SunGard Hounslow and for EDG gateway at Prism’s DR data-centre at Maidstone.
POL and Prism users can then access the services in Bootle and Wigan via Hounslow.

Duty Manager Notes:

1) In the event of a RMGA OOH Duty Manager being informed of ‘A’ priority
incident on either the POLFS Development and Test/QA services they are to inform
the RMGA Client Interface Service Delivery Manager (Kirsty Gallacher).

2) Post Office Limited have accepted a POL-FS ‘disaster recovery’ fail-over time of 48
hours and the unavailability of the POLFS QA-Test service.

3) It is Post Office Limited decision whether or not to invoke the fail-over to their
SunGard DR site at Hounslow and the time for full invocation is 48 hours

4) In the event Post Office Limited invoke SunGard the SAP-Basis support team need
to reconfigure IP addresses for POL print server at Hounslow.

4.2.6 System Management Infrastructure

4.2.6.1 Introduction

For the purposes of this document, System Management Infrastructure confines itself
to those components of the Horizon solution involved in the provision of the Tivoli
Enterprise management capability.

The capabilities and role of Tivoli are documented, in detail, in technical design
documents.

The primary uses of Tivoli within Horizon are as follows.

4.2.6.2. Monitoring

Monitoring of events on central Horizon infrastructure and equipment including (in
some instances via interfaces to other similar products) Sequent Host and Warehouse
platforms, Sun Servers, Windows NT servers and workstations and network devices.

4.2.6.3 Software Distribution

Software distribution and software upgrade is supported by Tivoli. This has the
facilities to manage and distribute software across multi-platforms e.g. to workstations,
servers and counter PCs.

4.2.6.4 Structure

Figure Eight below shows the inter-relationship of the systems management products,
within the horizon infrastructure, and the nodes being managed.

Within the Horizon infrastructure the Tivoli Management Environment consists of a
single Tivoli Management Region (TMR) built on two layers. These layers are:

1. The Master TMR which manages the UNIX gateway servers and a small
number of Windows NT servers at the campuses.
2. Gateway servers which act as proxy for the management of the remaining

campus servers and the post office counters.

4.2.6.5 Equipment locations

The Tivoli systems detailed above are effectively duplicated across the two data-
centres, Wigan and Bootle, and procedures for implementing contingency measures
are operated by the MSS. Wigan is utilised as the primary data-centre for the System
Management Service.

4.2.7.1 Branch Service Structure

Approximately 14,000 Post Offices are linked to two Fujitsu Services (Royal Mail
Group Account) Data-centres by one of the network service types defined in Table
One below. Table One also defines the contingency routing and/or fail-over network
services types which are available for each service type.

For a more detailed description of these network service types please refer to REF 3.

Table One — Branch Network Service Types

The ‘fail-over’ network service types can also be represented as follows

Note: At $92/T10 a new IP Stream network service was introduced to enable more rural
outlets, connected via either satellite or ISDN, to be migrated to ADSL. This created two
service-types 13 and 14, i.e., an ADSL Data Stream and an ADSL IP Stream.

At T50/T60 FRIACO Silver Daytime C1 NST 7 Service was withdrawn.

It should be noted that outlets connected over ADSL IP Stream can be identified as they
contain IPS_HOME or IPS_OFFICE within their BAS routers names.

RMGA Business Continuity Plan REF3 defines the primary RMGA Horizon services
provided using the C&W network. This document also defines the risks and actions to
be taken in the event of failure of network sub-components. RMGA Duty Managers
refer to this document in the event of network failures.

This document provides an assessment of the risks and associated recovery plans
provided by C&W as a supplier to Fujitsu Services RMGA. The Risk Assessment
detailed in the RMGA Business Continuity plans focuses on the processes involved
with the steady state (i.c. not new provisioning) maintenance of telecommunication
services for the Horizon project.

4.2.7.2 Client Links

The Client links are defined as those circuits conveying data between the Fujitsu
Services RMGA Data-centres and:

1, the Post Office Limited data-centre in POL NDC, e.g. for LFS, APS, POLFS and
Reference Data;

2, all AP Client data centres, including EDS for the Card Account Receipt Service.

4.2.7.3, The Branch Resilience Network (BRN)
The Branch Resilience Network provides the following coverage:

e An automatic ISDN backup network for the largest ADSL branches. This is
currently predicted to be 1800 branches.

e A backup on demand GSM service that covers all the ADSL and ISDN sites
(Note: limited counter numbers would be available due to bandwidth limitations)
This would involve an Engineer turning up within 48 hours after a network outage
had started and installing the backup network. Once the fault had been fixed, the
backup network GSM Modem would be removed.

e The ability to use the backup network, via GSM, for branch relocations if the main
network had not yet been installed in the new location — this would use the
facilities above.

e The backup network would use the same IP address as the main network. This
means that all Post Master functions will work, albeit with less bandwidth than
normal.

The Branch Resilient Network will not provide

Software Distribution capability.

e The ability to use the backup network for new branches if the main network has
not been installed.

e the functionality to replace the Gateway PC’s (for branches where the main
network link has failed and it is running on the GSM network

¢ Network resilience for satellite branches

5.0 Testing Strategy

5.1

5.2

Initial Testing

The initial testing of all business continuity contingency plans has been
documented in the Business Continuity Test Plan (REF2). Some tests are focused
at sub-service level, e.g. KMS, OCMS, however other tests are based upon a
facility, e.g. the Loss of Major Site (BRAO1). See the Business Continuity Test
Plan (REF2) for fuller details.

Ongoing Test Strategy

This refers to how the contingency measures, in place for the Horizon Support
Services, shall be periodically tested to ensure they are current and reflect the
service model for those services as they mature.

This is provided by an ongoing series of business continuity tests at a
predetermined frequency for the duration of the Fujitsu Services RMGA contract.
The nature of these tests are documented in the Business Continuity Test Plan
(REF2), which also contains a yearly test schedule.

6.0 Preventative Measures

6.1

6.1.1

6.1.1.1

It is a fundamental philosophy of the RMGA solution that wherever technically
possible, all components of the service are designed in such a way as to ensure
maximum resilience to failure by way of eliminating all possible single points of
failure, i.e. by providing multiple platforms performing similar functionality both
for performance and resilience.

As such the overall design process has at a single step reduced the risk levels to
low across the overall Horizon solution.

Infrastructure Support Services

This concept is extended to the RMGA Data-centre’s themselves, thus allowing
the RMGA service to be delivered in part, or indeed in total, from either data
centre should the need arise.

To complement this design philosophy, the overall Horizon solution adopts and
demonstrates industry best practice in areas such as systems enterprise and
operational management.

This provides the capability to monitor and report on virtually every hardware
component and software application comprising the Horizon solution in general.

It also allows a significant amount of automation to be introduced into the overall
Horizon capability, which in most situations allows more timely resolution of any
failures that are experienced.

Detailed design documents are available which document at the very lowest level
the exact architectural design of the Horizon solution, and is not the purpose or
the intent of this document to replicate those details here.

The following gives a high level summary of the measures in place, within the
Horizon solution, necessary to provide the Infrastructure Support Services.

The Key Management Service

KMS Servers and Database

The KMA and its database are mirrored between the main and standby sites using
EMC hardware replication of the filestore. The architecture is very similar to that
used for the host servers.

During normal operation, the standby KMA server is up and running its operating
system, but the DBMS and KMA-related NT services are not running.

Fail-over is via operator intervention following similar procedures to those used
for fail-over of the host servers. When the main KMA server has failed and the
standby is in use, particular care should be taken over the integrity of any data

generated, since reliable mirroring of the data is not provided by the EMC system
in this circumstance.

Data-centre Networks

Within each Data-centre the KM Server is connected to primary and secondary
isolated KMS LANs. These LANs are connected via firewalls and Logical
Campus Routers to the main Campus virtual LANs in each Data-centre. The two
Data-centre main Campus LANs are connected via Cisco Catalyst switches to two
1Gbit links. One is provided by C&W and the other, contracted via C&W,
provided by BT. Both KMA servers have unique IP addresses during normal
running. In the event of detection of a failure on the primary KMA server, the
secondary server has its IP addresses reset to that of the failed server and is
restarted. Access to the KMS service continues as before from either campus, see
section 4.2.1 for further detail.

Network to Data-centre(s)

Clients using the interactive distribution channel will be configured with the VLAN
IP address of the current KMA server. The KMS entries in the HOSTS files
remain constant for all platforms connecting to the KMA Database.

PO gateway PCs will additionally be configured with the IP of two VPN exception
servers, one at each campus.

Tivoli Infrastructure

With the exception of the Certification Authority Workstation (which is not
connected to the network), all processes in the Key Management Centre will be
monitored by Tivoli, which will raise appropriate alarms if a process stops running.

(Software updates for the Key Management Centre (except CAW) are installed
remotely by Tivoli software distribution.)

KMS Workstations

The Key Manager’s primary workstation is at BRAO1 and will normally available
continuously. There are secondary workstations in physically secure areas at
LEW02. In the event of loss of the primary workstation, the secondary can be
brought into use at no more than 4 hours notice at any time and will then be
available continuously until a new primary is installed. No KMS data is held on
the KMA workstation

The Certification Authority workstation at BRAO1 will normally be available
continuously. A secondary Certification Authority workstation will be available at
the same site as the Key Manager’s secondary workstation whenever the
secondary workstation is in use.

6.1.2.1

6.1.2.2

The Certification Authority Workstation is backed up to the KMA server each
time it is used, hence it is effectively a standby machine.

In the event of failure of either Key Management workstation or either
Certification Authority workstation the system will be recoverable or replaceable
in less than 1 day.

Riposte Messaging System

Resilience of the Riposte messaging system is known to be high; therefore no
additional measures have been included in the Key Management System to cover
communication faults.

Auto-Configuration Service

To complement this design philosophy, the overall Horizon solution adopts and
demonstrates industry best practice in areas such as systems enterprise and
operational management.

This provides the capability to monitor and report on virtually every hardware
component and software application comprising the Horizon solution in general
and the Auto-Configuration Service in particular.

It also allows a significant amount of automation to be introduced into the overall
Horizon capability, which in most situations allows more timely resolution of any
failures that are experienced.

Detailed design documents are available which document at the very lowest level
the exact architectural design of the Horizon solution, and is not the purpose or
the intent of this document to replicate those details here.

Below is a high level summary of the measures in place at each layer of the
Horizon solution necessary to provide the Auto-Configuration Service solution.
Wherever appropriate, references to more detailed design documents have also
been included.

Data Centre LANs

There are multiple connections to the Auto-Configuration Server, Signing Server
and Boot Server/Loader and a VLAN to the OCMS server, see 4.2.2 and Figure
Four. In the event of a failure of any Auto-Configuration Service component an
alert is raised via HPOpenview and operational staff are paged. Automated
processes have been implemented to re-route connections to the alternative LAN
in the event of a LAN failure.

Firewall(s)

Firewalls exist in pairs to provide resilience. On failure of the primary the
alternative firewall, of the pair, will take over responsibilities automatically.

6.1.2.4

6.1.2.5

6.1.2.6

Auto-Configuration Server(s)

A standby processor option is configured on the primary Auto-Configuration
server. On failure of one of the processor units, a second processor is available to
take control and continue operation. The data and system partitions are held on
RAID filestore and are therefore protected from single disk failure.

The server has dual network cards for LAN connection thus protecting against
single card failure.

The Auto-Configuration Database is replicated on to the secondary Auto-
Configuration server at the alternate data-centre. Should the Auto-Configuration
Server become unavailable, the database can be activated at the alternate site.

The database is checked for consistency and a security copy taken to cartridge on
a daily basis. There is a cold backup of the entire system taken on a weekly basis.
All backups are taken via the Audit Server.

All processes involved in the securing and mirroring of data, are monitored by
Tivoli.

Auto-Configuration Signing Server(s)

If the primary Auto-Configuration Signing Server fails the Auto-Configuration
Database Server will automatically attempt write to the alternative Auto-
Configuration Signing Server at the secondary data-centre.

Tivoli Layer(s)

Tivoli is used to monitor the Auto-Configuration primary and standby servers and
the Auto-configuration Signing Servers. For further details see 4.2.2 and Figure
Four.

In the event of a failure of the primary Tivoli infrastructure a standby Tivoli layer
is available at the alternative data-centre. If the Auto-Configuration Signing Server
fails to write to the primary Tivoli infrastructure it will automatically attempt to
write to the alternative Tivoli infrastructure at the secondary data-centre.

Tivoli provides storage facilities for the configuration data until it is required at the
correct point in time on other platforms.

Radius Servers

The LNS routers use the Radius Servers to provide CHAP authentication for the
inbound calls from ISDN, GSM and ADSL connected outlets. There are two
Radius Server per campus for these services, as they contain the authentication
details of all ADSL, GSM and ISDN connected outlets, there is contingency
across the Horizon data-centres. The availability of Radius Server does not
directly affect the Auto-Configuration Service.

6.1.3.2

Boot Server/Loader(s)

If the primary Boot Server or Loader fails a standby Boot Server or Loader is
available at the alternative data-centre. If the Tivoli infrastructure fails to write to
the primary Boot Server/Loader it will automatically attempt to write to the
alternative Boot Server/Loader at the secondary data-centre.

The ISDN Primary Rate Interface connections to the Boot Servers are
automatically switched by C&W on the loss of either Boot Server’s ‘Live Signal’.

Auto-Configuration Dependant Services/infrastructure.

The Auto-Configuration Service on the day of counter installation is dependant
upon the availability of the Outlet Change Management Service, the Tivoli
infrastructure, the Key Management Service, the VPN layer, Correspondence
Servers and network communication through to the counters.

Note the OCMS service provides schedule and temporary change information to
Tivoli. To the Auto-Configuration Service, OCMS provides address and outlet
details changes. These actions will have been completed before installation takes
place.

Outlet Change Management Service

This provides the capability to monitor and report on virtually every hardware
component and software application comprising the Horizon solution in general
and the OCMS solution in particular.

It also allows a significant amount of automation to be introduced into the overall
Horizon capability, which in most situations allows more timely resolution of any
failures that are experienced.

Detailed design documents are available which document at the very lowest level
the exact architectural design of the Horizon solution, and is not the purpose or
the intent of this document to replicate those details here.

Below is a high level summary of the measures in place at each layer of the
Horizon solution necessary to provide the OCMS solution. Wherever appropriate,
references to more detailed design documents have also been included.

OCMS Server

An OCMS server is available in both Wigan and Bootle data-centres.

OCMS Database

The OCMS data is held in an SQL Server database and a variety of ‘flat files’ on
local hard disk storage. Data resilience is achieved by the use of RAIDS. All
processes performed, to secure the data, are monitored by the Tivoli OCMS
watcher.

6.1.3.3 Firewall(s)

Each of the firewalls is paired to provide resilience. In the event of a firewall
failure its relevant pair will take over its responsibilities automatically.

6.1.3.4 Network to Data-centre(s)

Cable & Wireless IP Select network connections exist between the Horizon secure
LAN at Fujitsu Services BRAO1, and at LEW02, and to each Data-centre. Thus
data can be routed via alternative Data-centre and inter campus LAN should either
of the primary connections be unavailable.

A 128KBit ISDN connection is available from CRE02 to each data-centre.

6.1.3.5 Tivoli Infrastructure

Tivoli OCMS Watcher is used to process files from the OCMS primary and.
standby servers.

6.1.3.6 IOCMS Client Workstations

Three OCMS Client Workstations are available in BRAO1 and seven OCMS Client
Workstations are available in CREO2. An additional OCMS Client Workstation is
available at Wigan.

In the event of a disaster at either BRAO1 or CREO2 OCMS service will be
provided from the alternative Fujitsu Services site. In event of a disaster at Wigan
OCMS System Management service can be provided from either CREO2 or
BRAOI.

6.1.4 Data Warehouse

To complement this design philosophy, the overall Horizon solution adopts and
demonstrates industry best practice in areas such as systems enterprise and
operational management.

This provides the capability to monitor and report on virtually every hardware
component and software application comprising the Horizon solution in general
and the Data Warehouse/MIS solution in particular.

It also allows a significant amount of automation to be introduced into the overall
Horizon capability, which in most situations allows more timely resolution of any
failures that are experienced.

Detailed design documents are available which document at the very lowest level
the exact architectural design of the Horizon solution, and is not the purpose or
the intent of this document to replicate those details here.

Below is a high level summary of the measures in place at each layer of the
Horizon solution necessary to provide the Data Warehouse/MIS solution.
Wherever appropriate, references to more detailed design documents have also
been included.

6.1.4.1 Database Server/ Data Warehouse

The Data Warehouse runs, on the Horizon Database server, a Fujitsu-Siemens
Primepower 650 platform under Solaris 9 with ESF 2.3.

The server is provided with dual power supplies and has RAID-5 disk arrays.

The Database server has been provided with dual fibre-channel EMC Symmetrix
Disk Arrays using SRDF over the dual inter-campus 1GB intercampus links.

The Database server has Timefinder for Business Continuity Volumes, with
Veritas Volume Manager.

The Database server runs CA BrightStore EnterpriseBackup controlling a
StorageTek L180 tape library.

6.1.4.2. Database Server Resilience

There is a secondary Database server at the alternative Campus which can be used
in the event of a total unrecoverable failure on the primary Database server or at
the primary campus. As a guide it takes approximately two hours to fail-over to
and restore the secondary Database server. The time is dependant upon the size of
the databases.

6.1.5 System Management Infrastructure

6.1.5.1 Loss of Network Communications to Wigan

In the event of MSS at Wigan becoming isolated, due to the loss of network
devices, MSS staff can be relocated to either the Bootle data-centre or to STE04.
During the relocation process MSS staff can advise SMC staff at STE04, via
telephone links, on how to provide the MSS service. There is also a small team of
MSS staff based in STE04 who could provide a partial service.

6.1.5.2. Loss of Network Communications to STE04

In the event of STE04 becoming isolated, due to the loss of network devices, SMC
staff could relocate to BRAO1 in approximately three hours from the time a
decision is taken. During the relocation process SMC staff could request assistance
from the MSS in Wigan and the SSC in BRAO1.

6.1.5.3 Buildings -Wigan - MSS

With the loss of Wigan it is planned that the MSS staff would relocate to the
Bootle Data-centre, in approximately one hour, where previous arrangements have
been made. Alternatively, MSS staff could, on an emergency basis, be relocated to
either Data-centre (Wigan or Bootle). There is also a small team of MSS staff
based in STE04 who could provide a partial service.

6.1.5.4 Buildings - STE04 - SMC

With the loss of STE04 it is planned that the SMC staff could relocate to BRAO1
in approximately three hours from the time a decision is taken. It is also possible
for some staff to operate a TRIOLE For Service from STE04. If necessary it is
also possible to run SMC functions from MSS Wigan, either using MSS as a
temporary cover, or via SMC staff relocating to Wigan.

6.1.5.5 People - MSS

The MSS is operated on a ‘two shift’ basis. In the event of the loss of employees
from one shift, staff from the unaffected shift would be available. There is also a
small team of MSS staff based in STE04 who could provide a partial service.

6.1.5.6 People -SMC

The SMC is operated on a “24 by 7” basis. In the event of the loss of employees
from one shift, staff from the unaffected shift teams would be available to transfer
to an alternative site, or operate from STE04.

6.1.6 Network Services

6.1.6.1 C&W Preventative Measures

The core C&W network has been designed to provide resilience through the
deployment of SDH technology. The network is made up of a series of
interlocking rings, should one half of the ring fail (e.g. fibre break) the traffic will
be routed to its destination via the other half of the ring.

Both C&W (NMC) and BT (NMC) have network management centres that
monitor and control their respective networks 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
In the event of a fault being detected the appropriate maintenance team is
despatched to rectify the problem in the shortest possible contracted timeframe.

6.1.6.2 Fujitsu Services RMGA Data Centres - Bootle and Wigan.

The Bootle and Wigan campuses are networked over DWDM links, one provided
by BT and one provided by C&W although both are contracted via C&W. Over
each of the two DWDN links 2 presentations are provided to RMGA, one I Gbit
Ethernet and one 1 Gbit Fibre channel-link. The 1 Gbit Ethernet providing the
Intercampus IP network and the 1 Gbit Fibre Channel supporting the EMC SRDF
link. The two DWDM link are diversely routed.

Within each site or data-centre each fibre route terminates on physically separate
transmission equipment, which is powered via the sites UPS.
6.1.6.3 Fujitsu Services SDC01 & TCY01/02 Data Centres.

The Fujitsu Services ADSL IPStream infrastructure utilises four Points Of
Presences in the FJS Southern Data Centre 01 comms rooms I and comms room

2, and at TeleCity01 and TeleCity02 Data-centres. The DLS LNS routers are
configured to provide contingency across the four Points Of Presence.

6.1.6.4 Post Office Limited Northern Data Centres

Access to the POL NDC site is via C&W separately routed Cable & Wireless IP
Select network connections. The resilience of these circuits is also high due to the
fact that there is no common point of failure between each site and the data-
centres. Each data-centre has two separately routed Cable & Wireless IP Select
network connections back to two separate C&W Synchronous Network Access
Points (SNAPs). Connectivity between SNAPs and the RMGA data-centres is
provided by C&W fibre, via the C&W backbone.

6.1.6.5 WAN Circuits.

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology has also been
implemented within the C&W MPLS data network. Each ADSL Outlet has a
connection through a specific C&W Broadband Access Servers and therefore for
ADSL outlets this is a single point of failure within the C&W MPLS network.

For all outlets there are single points of failure within the BT network, namely at
some local serving exchanges where an ISDN2 line to a PO outlet terminates. This
would result in the loss of communication with a number of PO outlets, but ‘local
exchange failures, would be limited to a small geographical area.

6.1.6.6 Cable & Wireless Network Management Centre

The C&W Network Management Centre is a 24-hour manned facility based at
Bracknell. In the event of the unavailability of the Bracknell site the C&W NMC
shall relocated to the Watford disaster recovery site.

6.1.6.7 Cable & Wireless core/switched network Capacity

The C&W network (including interconnects) is continuously being expanded to
meet forecast traffic levels, in addition to which the C&W core switched network
and interconnect links with BT are monitored on a continuous basis to ensure that
the routes are sufficiently sized to cope with the actual traffic levels. Where it is
forecast that congestion is likely to occur then additional capacity will be
provisioned, if this is not already included in the general network expansion.

The C&W network has already been configured such that all RMGA calls have
two routes (primary and secondary) between C&W switches, hence if one route is
temporarily congested the call will automatically route via the second choice.

6.1.6.8 Capacity into Data Centres

The capacity of the access network to the data-centres at Bootle and Wigan has
been designed to ensure that each data-centre is capable of fully supporting the
predicted maximum network traffic.

6.1.6.9 Transaction Network Services UK LTD Service Structure.

The network links provided by Transaction Network Services are currently limited
to one X25 link from Bootle and Wigan Data-centres to Streamline for the DCS
online debit card transactions. Contact details for TNS are detailed in section 13.

6.2 Operational Support Services

6.2.1 The System Management Centre

In the event of a major incident or disaster at STE04 the SMC have access to the
SMC disaster recovery room in the Fujitsu Services BRAO1 building. The SMC
have warm standby Tivoli equipment stored on site and network access to the
Horizon estate.

6.2.2. The Systems Operate Service

6.2.2.1 Environment Monitoring Facilities

Trident House Operations staff continually monitor the environmental facilities
against the threat from fire or flood.
Examples would be:

Loss of mains power UPS and Generator take on load

Loss of UPS Generator takes on load

Loss of generator UPS takes load although only short life
approx 20- 30 minutes

Loss of Air Con Standby unit kicks in

Flood warnings Water Detection systems will give early
warning

Early detection is the key to the preparedness, the building disaster detection
facilities are regular tested and appropriately maintenance in accordance with
contractual agreements. In the event a problem is detected, which may affect the
live service kit, the appropriate support group responsible for implementation of
fault resolution or instigation of disaster recovery will be immediately contacted.
FSCS has a comprehensive maintenance and call out contract, covering all
environmental kit. All contractors are on a 4 hours response to site basis
agreement, as detailed in an earlier section, and as resilience is built into the main
systems, only minor disruption should occur.

6.2.2.2 Activation

Once an event has occurred that will impact the provision of the UNIX and NT
Service and/or the Operational Service, then in all instances the ‘Activation’
procedure will be invoked and a TRIOLE For Service call will be raised with the
SMC or HSD.

This section defines what action will be taken in the event of a service break to
minimised the impact during the service outage.

6.2.2.3 Loss of Documentation server

The document server is part of the office infrastructure and is located at the
Trident House operation-centre. A secondary document server is based in
Bridgeview. The contents of the secondary server are automatically updated at
19.00 each evening from the primary server. The secondary documentation server
is accessed as part of the Systems Operate Services test 11.

6.2.2.4 Loss of Power

In the event of a power failure the UPS will activate and keep all FS systems up
and running whilst the standby generator activates. The backup generator will take
effect approximately 30 seconds after the failure. The lighting and air conditioning
will have no power [due to being non-UPS supported] for the 30 seconds it will
take for the generator to come in, emergency lighting will immediately be activated
as the mains is lost.

6.2.2.5 Loss of Telephone exchange

In the event of the loss of ‘land-line’ telephone networks at either Trident House
or Bridgeview operation-centres mobile phones would be used as a backup
contingency measure. All Belfast based SOS staff are provided with company
mobile phones. The Services Manager would liaise with the Horizon Help Desk to
ensure a full awareness of the situation.

6.2.2.6 Loss of Trident House

In the event of a disaster that left Trident House inaccessible, Support Service fail-
over would be instigated in accordance with the FSCS Support Contingency site
fail-over procedure. Actions to restore all the required support functions will be
managed through incident management procedures as detailed in this document.

6.2.3 RMGA Customer Services

6.2.3.1 RMGA CS Preventative Measures Overview

Fujitsu Services (RMGA) Bracknell. REF 11 details the disaster recovery
equipment for CS operational use at LEW02. This equipment consists of a
mixture of hot and warm ‘standby’ equipment. The hot standby servers and
workstations are connected to the live infrastructure and maintained, by the FSCS
SOS at a fully operational state. The warm standby workstations are stored in a
“‘ready-for-use-state’.

The provision of operational documentation for all aspects of service delivery is
mandated and allows RMGA to ensure that the service is delivered in a consistent
way that satisfies not only service level requirements but also the quality model.

Internal business walkthroughs are conducted on an annual basis to assess the
preparedness of any new service element for implementation.

6.2.3.2 RMGA CS Incident Management

In the event of an incident occurring at Bracknell the Fujitsu Services (RMGA)
Incident Controller for Bracknell will be informed, See REF12. The Incident
Controller referring to the Incident Management Plan will inform all CS Business
Recovery Team Leaders of the event, instigate the raising of a TRIOLE For
Service call to escalate the incident and, if necessary, contact the Fujitsu Services
(RMGA) Crisis Management Team.

The Incident Controller will decide which CS teams and individuals are to be
relocated to Fujitsu Services LEW02, other Fujitsu Services sites, or are to work
form home. The Incident Management Team members will instruct the Business
Recovery Team managers of the invocation of relocation and the Business
Recovery Team managers shall decide which team members will be relocated.

The call will meet the HSD escalation criteria, so it will be escalated to the Fujitsu
Services (RMGA) Duty Manager. The Duty Manager will use the processes
described in REF4.

If the criteria for a major Business Continuity Event are satisfied (REFS) the Duty
Manager will escalate the incident to the Fujitsu Services (RMGA) Business
Continuity Manager as a Business Continuity event.

6.2.3.2.1_ Peak - Support Incident Management

The Peak Support Incident Management service is provided by the SSC.

The primary Peak server is installed in BRAO1 and the secondary Peak server
resides in LEW02. The database on this sever is synchronised on an hourly basis
over the Fujitsu Services corporate network. In addition daily back-ups are also
taken of the Peak servers.

The Peak Client is installed on the Office PCs in both BRAO1 and LEW02.

which are required for the support of the Horizon infrastructure.

e Change Control;
¢ Third and fourth line support incident management;

¢ Authentication of software releases to the live estate.

6.2.4.1.1 Change Control
A RMGA Programmes secondary PVCS server resides in LEW02.

The databases on this severs is synchronised on an hourly basis with the BRAOL
PVCS server via the Fujitsu Services corporate network. In addition daily back-
ups are also taken of the PVCS servers.

To access PVCS users require either ‘PVCS Terminal’ or PVCS Dimensions PC
Client which is installed on the Office PCs in both BRAO1 and LEW02

6.2.4.2 Configuration Management — Signing Server.

The RMGA Programmes secondary Configuration Management Signing server
resides in LEW02. The database on this sever is synchronised on an hourly basis
with the BRAO1 Signing server via the Fujitsu Services corporate network In
addition daily back-ups are also taken of the Signing servers.

In the event of a disaster at BRAOI the Programme team can access the CM
Signing server at LEWO2 using disaster recovery laptops at least one of which is
held off site.

6.2.4.3. Development Operational Support

6.2.4.3.1 Live System Team

The Live System Test (LST) team, who reside within the RMGA Development
organisation, test software changes about to be released into the live estate. This is
achieved by proving the software changes on discrete test configurations that
replicate the live software environment.

The prerequisites to provide this service are:

7.0 Preparedness Measures

7.1

7.2

7.3

Preparedness in the Horizon context is defined as, those measures taken to ensure
the technical solution and business processes supporting that solution deliver the
service that they are designed to deliver, in such a way as to meet and exceed the
service level.

Testing

From a technical standing, functionality is proven by testing the solution at a unit,
system and business integration level.

This functional testing has been complemented by performance and security testing
to ensure that the solution is both scaleable and secure.

Internal business walkthroughs are conducted on a regular basis to assess the
preparedness of any new service element for implementation.

In preparation for any Horizon Release, in conjunction with Post Office Limited, a
full end to end processing rehearsal and test is performed where the whole solution
and supporting processes are run as if live for a period of several days.

It is usual for this to include a rebuild of all operational platforms used in the
delivery of the service which further validates the accuracy of operational
procedures and configuration management processes.

Service Management & Delivery

From a business perspective, this process starts by establishing very exacting and
specific service level agreements with all suppliers to the Horizon Service which
are constantly monitored and reviewed.

The provision of Operational documentation for all aspects of service delivery is
mandated and allows RMGA to ensure that the service is being delivered in a
consistent way that satisfies service level requirements.

Risk Analysis

Section 11 contains an extensive risk analysis of the end to end supporting services
incorporated in this plan.

This identifies potential risks to those supporting services, the assessed probability
of that risk occurring, the impact of that risk becoming a reality and the
contingency activity or plans necessary to contain such an occurrence with
minimum impact to those supporting services.

Contingency Measures

Contingency measures are defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage
prior to recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident
management and initiation of recovery procedures.

Recognition

The Horizon solution includes a Systems management capability to monitor and
report on events that occur upon all the platforms involved in the service delivery
and counters.

The process of monitoring and managing the Network components and Routers is
performed by a combination of the products HP OpenView and CISCO works.

BMC patrol is used to manage the Unix systems and the applications, which run
upon them.

Maestro provides scheduling facilities for the Host and Agent processes.

Tivoli is used to manage and monitor the Sun Solaris Servers and Windows NT
platforms directly, and takes event information from BMC Patrol and HP Open
View, to provide a comprehensive management view of the entire solution at any
time.

Events that may lead to a break in the APS service will be recognised either by
operational observation at a console running one or more of the systems
management products, by a pager call from BMC Patrol.

Through the escalation processes the RMGA Duty Manager and Business
Continuity Managers will be informed of a disaster or major event at Fujitsu
Services operational sites.

Activation

Once an event has occurred that will impact the provision of the NBS Service,
then in all instances a call will be raised with the HSD.

There are a number of scenarios where the capability of the Systems Management
environment will trigger an operational script to run upon the platform/application
that have suffered the problem, to correct the failure. Operations personnel may
override this.

Fujitsu Services Horizon Support Service Business Continuity Plan Ref: CS/PLA/080
Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 24-OCT-2007

8.3 Incident Management

Personnel at the HSD will carry this out. If the incident cannot be resolved by the
HSD at the time of the call it will be routed to the appropriate support unit for
resolution. At the same time if the incident meets the HSD escalation criteria, it
will be escalated to the Fujitsu Services RMGA Duty Manager.

If the criteria for Cross-Domain Business Continuity Management are satisfied the
Duty Manager will escalate the problem to the RMGA Business Continuity
Manager who will own the problem as a Business Continuity event.

Note: Post Office Limited may also escalate Business Continuity events directly to
the RMGA Duty Manager.

8.4 Initiation of Recovery Procedures

Where this is a RMGA only incident, this would usually be instigated by the
support team charged with supporting the equipment upon which the failure has
occurred, as soon as possible, and certainly with intent to resolve the incident
within the relevant Service Level Agreement.

Depending on the severity of the incident, there may be some dialogue between the
Duty Manager and the support function to agree on the most appropriate course of
action.

Wherever there is a Cross Domain incident, the resolution would be instigated at
the time when all parties affected had agreed the course of action:

In the case of a Business Continuity incident, this would be after the Business
Continuity Team had agreed a plan of action, see Section 11, Plan Activation.

9.0 Recovery Of Normal Service

All aspects of the Services infrastructure within RMGA are managed operationally by
the Core Services division of Fujitsu Services (FSCS).

As such, the process of recovering from an event causing an impact to the service will
by definition involve FSCS in performing an operational activity to resume the full
service.

FSCS have developed an Operations Procedures Manual Index (REF7) from which
operational and recovery processes and procedures are identified, for all possible
failures in the end to end Horizon Services.

Thus in its simplest form, normal service could be resumed by the Duty or Problem
manager liaising with the support team, agreeing when the recovery action should be
run, and then carrying that activity out.

Where the recovery action is dependent upon a third party, e.g. Prism or Post Office
Limited, the support dialogue would take place between the support teams, and the
problem management dialogue would take place between the appropriate management.

10.0 Impact & Risk Assessment

10.1 Risks Identified Against the Horizon Services

The matrix below detail the identified risks to the data processing elements of the Horizon
Services.

The nature of the service changes between the day and night schedules. However to improve
the usability of this plan the worst case Critical Impact Timing for each service element
incident has been used

Day time processes are primarily concerned with Counter transactions and Help Desk
processes, Night time processes are primarily concerned with preparing for the next counter
day, and processing the transactions that have been processed during the Post Office Core
day. This is reflected in the actions against the identified risks.

As a matter of normal operational practice, a call would be placed against HSD if any of the
identified risks materialised.

The intention is that the list identified can act as a guide to personnel assessing and managing
any incident affecting the Horizon service.

The matrix contain a column identified as probability with a range of 0 to 4. These estimate
the probable risk of failure. It must be emphasised that these are not percentages and should
be considered simple weighting factors.

As a guideline the following occurrence ratings have been allocated:

Rating

0 Less than one incident is predicted per year

1 One incident is predicted per year

2 Two incidents are predicted per year

3 Approximately three incidents are predicted per year

4 Ensure that appropriate contingency measures are taken e.g. duplicate
routing or the holding of spares on site.

The probability of failure of major elements of the service is low because:
1
2, Extensive validation has been performed upon the infrastructure.

3, The Fujitsu Services RMGA project team has developed a vast knowledge of
component failure and service availability over the past three years.

There has been a high level of resilience and duplication built into the infrastructure.

Where a Potential MBCI or MBCI has been designated as being triggered and there is no
reference to section 11.3 then there are no further contingency actions to be performed over
and above normal operational incident processes and the actions already identified within the
risk table.

If a failure occurs during or after any hardware or software change, then consider regressing
the change.

Please Note: This business continuity plan is one of three. If the RMGA Duty Manager (or
other authorised person) is unable to find the failed infrastructure components in the plan they
are mandated to refer to CS/PLA/079 The Horizon Services Business Continuity Plan and
CS/PLA/015 The Horizon Service Desk Business Continuity Plan.

The risk assessment identifies the Critical Time Factors for activation of contingency measures
as defined in the Business Continuity Framework REF 1. For on-line service, e.g. NBX and
DCS the CTF is identified against Post Office Core Day Processing, whilst for file transfers,
e.g. APS and TPS the CTF is identified against Post Office Non-Core Day Processing.

The ‘Impact’ column contains the statement General Horizon Services. This impact from a
Support Service Perspective refers to a potential impact to primary services, e.g. APS, TPS,
as well as software drops, Reference Data releases, counter management etc.

Notes: 1) The following trigger table details the non-availability of the Primary component, and the Primary and Standby components. The non-availability
of support services Standby servers, e.g. OCMS, ACS, etc, or network components should be treated as a loss of resilience and resolved via
normal incident management processes.

2) Branch Network Resilience - No entries have been included in this table for the loss of ADSL and the ISDN/GSM service for outlets where
BNR has been implemented. If there is a loss of online services for Branches that have lost their primary connection through ASDL and
secondary through ISDN/GSM please treat the failure as an MBCI Trigger and the RMGA BCM is to inform the POL BCT.

3) No entries have been included in this table for the POLFS Development or QATest infrastructure as there are no contingency or DR
requirements for these services. Refer to CS/OLA/049 for details of the OLA for these services.

10.3 Summary of Contingency Actions

The following are additional contingency actions to be taken for the risks identified in
table 10.2.

10.3.1 KMS Service/KMA Servers

If the KMS service is unavailable, e.g. both KMA servers fail there are no additional
contingency actions available. This will become critical after 2 days because PMMC
recoveries, base unit swap-outs and new installations are not possible at counters.

11.0 Post Office Limited failures impacting RMGA
Services

11.1 Post Office Limited failures impacting RMGA RDMS
Service

The RMGA RDMS is reliant upon Reference Data initially being supplied by POL
Chesterfield. Further more, this service is dependent upon the POL Reference Data
verification processes at Bracknell. Non availability of either of these POL facilities or
services will inhibit the operation of this RMGA Service.

The availability of Post Office outlets to utilise the RDMS to the customer is a further
prerequisite of the end to end service provision.

Non availability of one or more post Office outlets restricts the availability of the
service and may trigger a Business Continuity event.

11.2 POL and AP Client failures impacting RMGA APS Service

11.2.1 Post Office Limited

The availability of Post Office outlets to provide the Automated Payment Service to
the customer is a further prerequisite of the end to end service provision.

Non-availability of one or more post Office outlets restricts the availability of the
service and may trigger a Business Continuity event, see Appendix One.

11.2.2 AP Clients

The availability of the Automated Payment Clients to receive the transaction files is a
further prerequisite of the end to end service provision.

Non-availability of one or more of the AP Clients restricts the availability of the service
and may trigger a Business Continuity event.

The Fujitsu Services RMGA plans and procedures for dealing with this situation can be
found in the Client Specific Operational Level agreements (CS/OLA/003 — Generic AP
Client OLA from which all specific Client OLA’s are derived).

11.3 Post Office Ltd failures impacting RMGA TPS Service

Non-availability of TPS service at POL NDC, or the disaster recovery site at
Isleworth, or one or more Post Office outlets restricts the availability of the service and
may trigger a Business Continuity event, see Appendix One.

11.4 Post Office Ltd and Supplier failures impacting RMGA NBS
Service
The non-availability of one or more of the Financial Institutions or one or more Post

Office outlets can restrict the availability of the Network Banking Service and may
trigger a Business Continuity event

The non-availability of the Streamline Debit Card System, or one or more of the Card

Issue services, or one or more Post Office outlets can restrict the availability of the
Debit Card Service and may trigger a Business Continuity event.

12.0 Plan Activation

Once the criteria for Business Continuity have been satisfied, i.e. a MBCI Trigger from
the table of risks in section 11, then after a call had been placed and appropriate details
logged at HSD, the problem ownership is passed to the Fujitsu Services RMGA
member of the Business Continuity Management team.

After compiling all relevant information, and if necessary communicating this to the
other members of the BCMT listed below in section 14, a full impact assessment will
be conducted to determine if the joint Business Continuity Management Processes
detailed in REFs 5 and 6 will be invoked. This will be done in conjunction with Senior
Managers, relevant Business Units and Expert Domains as appropriate

If the Joint BCM processes are invoked, the next steps will be to agree who from the
BCMT owns the MBCI.

The BCMT will then agree a plan of action and agree upon the recovery and
contingency activities to be carried out. Again, this will be done in conjunction with
Senior Managers, relevant Business Units and Expert Domains as appropriate.

The agreed plan will then be monitored and reviewed until such time as the MBCI
impacting the APS service has been resolved, and the MBCI closed.
