Amy,

Please see responses added in italics to your email below. As noted in response to point 9, Pete Newsome
and John Simpkins are available at 15:00 on Wednesday; please also include Steve Parker and myself on any
invitation.

In addition to those responses, we believe that the existence of superseded / deprecated versions of KELs has
been explained previously in the following ways:

The attached email from Feb 2019 “RE: Peaks / KELS...”, explained both what deprecated means, and for
which categories of KELs deprecated versions were available, it being clear from the explanation that it is a
fairly complicated picture, in that deprecated versions are not available for all existing KELs. It is also
implicit in the statement further down in that email chain where it is stated “The KELs listed below are all
deleted rather than deprecated or archived, and are therefore not retrievable”.

It is stated in SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 section 11.2.4, last bullet: “All KELs have version numbers, it is always
possible to view a previous version and highlight the differences between versions.”

There is evidence in Mr Coyne’s report of October 2018 that he read SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 as it is
referenced in footnotes 32, 35, 238, and at least some of paragraphs 4.87 to 4.89 look likely to be based on
section 11.2 of SVM/SDM/PRO/0875. Although he doesn’t explicitly acknowledge the continuing existence
of deprecated versions, paragraph 4.89 shows some understanding: “/nformation on the KEL is updated by
all levels of support as work to resolve the incident progresses. Any creation or update of a KEL must be
authorised by SSC before it can be seen by all users.”

We acknowledge that we were asked to check the EDQ, but noted that we were not specifically asked to
comment on that section, but on other parts that were highlighted for our attention, and also note that we
were given only a few hours to respond (10:20 am until 14:30 on the same day). From Michael Wharton’s
email of the 06-Dec-2017, it seems that the EDQ resulted at least in part from a phone call on 30-Nov-2017,
and we have been unable to find any record of the previous work that went into producing it.

REL Disclosure

Matthew

We have received the attached letter from Freeths in relation to the disclosure of the previous versions of the KELs.
So as Post Office can provide a response to this letter, please could you consider and provide a response to the
following queries — given the importance of these documents to the Horizon Issues Trial, it would be appreciated if
your responses are accurate and provide a detailed explanation where possible. If it would be helpful to have a call to
discuss the below before you respond, please let me know.

Scripts

Please could you provide:

An explanation of the script(s) and/or methods by which FJ extracted the KELs disclosed in:
[Matthew Lenton] The scripts are stand-alone Java classes.

They make use of some WIKI formatting functions taken from the internal SSC website which holds the
KELs for the support teams to view.

They take two parameters:

1. The database partition (the SSC website is used for more than just POA KELs and this controls
which database we connect to)

2. The output folder (where the KEL files are to be created)

a. May 2018 (being KELs generated up to March 2018)
WBON0001999
WBON0001999

[Matthew Lenton] The script used in May was named List_ALL_KELs.java (attached), this produced a list
of the ‘current’ version of both Horizon and Horizon online KELs. This can be seen by the SOL
command used:

select * from [dbo].[kel_active] where status in (‘Authorised’, Deactivated’) union all select * from
kel_active_HNGX where status in (‘Authorised', 'Deactivated')";

By retrieving the ‘Authorised’ and ‘Deactivated’ from the tow kel_active tables we would get the latest
version of each KEL.

b. January 2019 (being KELs generated from March to December 2018 AND deleted KELs)

[Matthew Lenton] The script in January was called List_Recent_KELs.java (attached)

This is very similar to the script above, except it now takes a 3” : parameter which is the start date for the
KELs creation, therefore the SOL query has changed to:

select * from kel_active HNGX where status in (‘Authorised', Deactivated’) and original_date >=
"+sDate+""

Note, we are only using the Horizon Online KEL table now as there are no new Horizon legacy KELs and
the parameter of the start date (sDate) is used to just list the recent KELs.

The script to list the deleted KELs was called List_Deleted_KELs.java and is very similar to the first script.
The main differences are the warning banner stating that this KEL was deleted and the SQL change:

SELECT [kel_ref] ,/[KEL_Reference] ,[title] ,/summary] ,[username] ,[fullname] ,[email] ,[original_date]
,lrevision_date] ,Joriginal_author] ,[revision_author] ,[release] ,[kel_type] ,/systemproduct] ,/branchcode]
,[servername] ,/symptoms] ,[problem] ,convert(varchar(max),[solution]) as [solution]
sconvert(varchar(max),[solution2]) as [solution2] _,convert(varchar(max),[solution3]) as [solution3] ,
[keywords] ,[approved] ,[evidence] ,[status] ,[visibility] ,[powerhelp] as [call_ref] ,[peak] ,[version] ,[class]
,[external_kel] ,[RefTypel] ,[RefValue1] ,[RefType2] ,[RefValue2] FROM [dbo].[kel_delete] union
SELECT [kel_ref] ,[KEL_Reference] ,/title] ,/summary] ,[username] ,[fullname] ,[email] ,[original_date]
,[revision_date] ,[original_author] ,[revision_author] ,[release] ,[kel_type] ,[systemproduct] ,[branchcode]
,[servername] ,[symptoms] ,[problem] ,convert(varchar(max),[solution]) as [solution]
,convert(varchar(max),[solution2]) as [solution2] ,convert(varchar(max),/solution3]) as [solution3] ,
[keywords] ,[approved] ,[evidence] ,[status] ,[visibility] ,[call_ref] ,[peak] ,[version] ,[class] ,[external_kel]
[RefTypel] ,[RefValuel] ,[RefType2] ,[RefValue2] FROM [dbo].[kel_delete_ HNGX]

The SQL was slightly more verbose because the two deleted tables had slightly different columns and this
means that the wild-card select could not be used.

If a script was used, please could you provide us with a copy of the scripts used in each of the above extractions (up
to March 18, March 18 to Dec 18, and deleted KELs).

Versions
WBON0001999
WBON0001999

We understand from Matthew's email (attached) that when Horizon moved from Horizon Legacy to Horizon Online
only the current versions of the KELs were kept and migrated — please could you confirm:

a. Where the documents were migrated from and to?

[Matthew Lenton] When a KEL was identified for migration the current version was moved from the
[kel_active] table to the [kel_active_HNGX], this was a process controlled through the SSC website
application. In order to stop people from migrating a KEL twice the KEL record(s) were deleted from the
old table.

b. On migration, was a back-up taken of the non-migrated KELs?

[Matthew Lenton] No.

Please could you explain how version numbering operates.

[Matthew Lenton] Versions start at 1 for the original KEL, when the KEL is updated the new version is
put in a separate table. An authorise request is sent to the SSC team who review the changes and either
authorise or reject the new version of the KEL.

If it is authorised the new version is inserted into the active table and the previous version is marked as
deprecated.

When the SSC website hardware was hosted by the SSC and space was at more of a premium, we only
maintained the last 3 versions of a KEL, older versions were deleted without a back-up.

When the SSC website was migrated to the ITG hosting this rule was relaxed and more versions of the
KELs were kept.

Is it possible to amend a KEL without generating a new version?[Matthew Lenton] No, in order to update a KEL
you would create a new version via the Website. In theory, with database access you could update the KEL
directly via SOL, however only a few SSC staff have that privileged access, and in practice this does not
happen. Does each update create a new version?/Matthew Lenton] Yes each update would generate a new

version. \s the version control automatically generated by the database when any change is made to a KEL, or is it
necessary to generate a new version manually?/Matthew Lenton] Versioning is done automatically with the SSC
website.

KEL JSimplins4251P (attached) was raised on 9 September 1999, and last updated on 20 Jan 2003 but is shown as
being "Version 1". Please could you explain why there is a difference between the raised and last updated dates, but
no subsequent versions have been generated? If a KEL has been updated since being raised, should it be Version
2? Is there any way to track what was updated on 20 Jan 2003?

[Matthew Lenton] We believe that can happen for a couple of reasons, unfortunately the HORIZON
legacy KELs do not have a history table, however the HORIZON online KELs do.

The same query arises in relation to GMaxwell574P, AChambers3558R and PCarroll2243R.

[Matthew Lenton] These are Horizon legacy KELs and we have no history for them.

When Mr Coyne attended Bracknell to view the KEL, was he informed that previous versions of the KELs were
available and if so, was he given the opportunity to view previous versions of a KEL? [Matthew Lenton] The system
demonstrated to Mr Coyne was the live system, so the “+ More details” link that leads to the list of previous
versions would have been visible on the screen for each KEL that was viewed (noting that it is not visible or
available on the exported versions of the KELs). Mark Wright believes that he would have explained and
demonstrated this, since it was visible and he explained everything about how the system was used; as the
meeting was not recorded however, he cannot state beyond any doubt that he did explain it, or that if he did,
Mr Coyne understood it.

Alternatively, is it obvious when viewing the KEL system that previous versions are still accessible (for example, they
are listed on a side pane)?[Matthew Lenton]

Deletion of KELs

. Matthew's email refers to a "housekeeping procedure" by which FJ deleted versions where the KEL had more than 3
versions - please could you explain how this procedure operated (for example, were these ad hoc deletions or was a

policy followed)? [Matthew Lenton] This was a scheduled daily task run by the database. I will attached the
script to this email (attachment:

Duplicates

. Matthew's email refers to a "defect in the KEL system" which produced duplicate KELs. Please could further
information be provided on why these duplicates exist and the reasons why they are believed to have been caused by
a defect?
WBON0001999
WBON0001999

[Matthew Lenton] The duplicates only exist in the Horizon legacy KEL table — there are no duplicates in
the Horizon Online table. It affected 20 KELs with a total of 34 duplicates.

A list of these is attached (attachment: Legacy _KEL_Duplicates.xlsx).

Looking at the worst occurrence, RKing3454R version 5 has 10 instances, they are identical except the
revision date:

2008-06-05 14:01:30.630
2008-06-05 14:01:40.537
2008-06-05 14:01:59,427
2008-06-05 14:02:21.210
2008-06-05 14:02:33.490
2008-06-05 14:02:46.990
2008-06-05 14:02:54.833
2008-06-05 14:03:11.663

These are all just seconds apart and it appears that the user was repeatedly trying to update the KEL but
was receiving a failure on the SSC website.

The last duplicate was on 12-March-2009.

The first two I looked at (BSheldon1119J and MHall5726K) had a null entry for the Summary property,
this is a mandatory field and would have should have cause the update to fail, instead it appears thata
bug allowed the partial update to take place. I expect that the other occurrences are also missing
mandatory (if difference) pieces of information .

. Have these documents been reviewed to confirm they are exact duplicates? If not, how did FJ learn that they were
duplicates?

[Matthew Lenton] Some of the duplicates are indeed different (MHall5726K adds some text to help SMC
decide upon the ticket priority). We will look to extract these as individual documents in the same format
as previously.
