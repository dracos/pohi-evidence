Rodric

Mark has an email from FJ that describes the controls around how FJ use the “Balancing Transaction" process. I'd be
grateful if you could confirm to Mark (cc'd above) that he can release the email to BD.

It would be useful if you could also confirm that Deloitte can release any other documents to BD on this subject as
needed (I don’t think we will need much else but it might save a bit of time).

Thanks
Andy
