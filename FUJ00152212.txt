1 Introduction

This document is intended to assist in the management and delivery of the service required to support
Post Office Limited (POL) in respect of criminal and/or civil litigation for the Horizon and Horizon Online
solutions. This service was introduced in response to Network Banking Requirements 260 and 315 and
this document is derived from the Horizon document NB/PRO/003

The defined detail of the Service is outlined in SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

This document is without prejudice to any of the parties and nothing contained herein shall be deemed or
construed as affecting contractual obligations or creating new contractual obligations between any of the
parties.

2 Scope

Audit Record Query (ARQ) requests are received, documented, interpreted and transaction data is
extracted from the Audit Archive and progressed to resolution.

Acomprehensive set of standard data information requests has been created and agreed with POL. In
the majority of cases these returns satisfy POL requests for transaction data and exceptions are dealt
with on a case by case basis. These procedures can therefore provide a flexible approach to the
provision of litigation support.

ARQ requests in support of potential litigation will be obtained solely from the Audit Archive / Server.
The method by which the integrity of this data is protected is described in the Audit Trail Functional
Specification, CRFSP6.

Requests for evidence and witness statements in support of litigation activity are received and provided.

3 Audit Record Queries (ARQs)

An AR@Q is a request to the Royal Mail Group Account (RMGA) for transaction data required to support a
POL investigation or litigation activity. This transaction data is held on the Audit Archive. The request is
received from the POL Casework Manager, or his nominated representative, and contains specific
search criteria. The stipulated criteria and the format of the returned data are as referenced in the
document Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

The agreed annual quotas and return timeframes for ARQ requests are as referenced in the document
Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

3.1 Format for ARQ Requests

ARQ requests in connection with litigation activity are made via an ARQ Form; the agreed detail of the
request is as referenced in the document Security Management Service - Service Description,
SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

POL will allocate a unique identifier to each request. This number will be retained by RMGA and will
form the basis of an audit trail for each request.

SVM/SEC/PRO/0018 Audit Data Extraction Process.

4.1 Despatch

The CD shall be sent to the POL Casework Manager via Royal Mail's Special Delivery Service.

The full service provided by RMGA is as referenced in the document Security Management Service -
Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

5.1 Witness Statement of Fact

document Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

Requirements for witness statements explaining the retention and extraction of audit data from Horizon
and Horizon Online in response to an ARQ shall be, where possible, completed by the individual from
RMGA who filled the ARQ request.

5.2 Court Attendance in support of a Witness Statement of
Fact

The author of a witness statement of fact may be required to attend Court to give evidence relating to
the detail contained in the witness statement provided.

6 Detail Retention/Litigation Support Database

The detail of all requests will be recorded in the Litigation Support database. This database will be used
as a register and all relevant information and dates will be recorded therein.

POL will also keep a log of requests made to RMGA.

The duplication of records will ensure that POL and RMGA meet contractual requirements on the
number of requests issued and returned.

6.1 Process for ARQ Cancellations

Once an ARQ has been received by RMGA and the unique identifier allocated the reference number will
not be reused, even if the request is later withdrawn.

7 Additional Litigation Support

Where additional information to that described in the standard litigation support service is requested
RMGA shall view each request on a case by case basis, and in accordance with the Change Control
Procedure.

7.1 ARQ Requests

ARQ requests beyond that specified under contract shall be agreed on a case by case basis and shall be
dealt with in accordance with Change Control Procedures.

7.2 Expert Witness Statement

Expert, in depth, analysis and detailed “expert” witness statements (as opposed to witness statements of
fact) are rarely required.

However, in the event of such a request RMGA will endeavour to provide “expert” witnesses who are
able to give more detailed and specific evidence to support POL’s litigation activity. This “expert”
activity shall be provided on a case by case basis and shall be dealt with in accordance with the Change
Control Procedure.

Again, RMGA shall use reasonable endeavours to meet dates notified by POL for the production of this
material and support.

7.3 Court Attendance in support of an Expert Witness
Statement

Attendance at Court in support of an “expert” witness statement shall also be considered on production
of an appropriate Change Request. The RMGA’s charges for assistance in this respect shall be
calculated on the basis of the rates set out in Schedule A12.
