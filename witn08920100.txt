Please explain the organisational structure of the Security team including the
different divisions within the Security team and their respective functions.
Please outline, to the best of your knowledge, any significant changes to the
structure of the Security team during your time in relevant roles within it.


26.To the best of my recollection, in July 2000 Tony Marsh was the Head of PO
   Ltd Security. I can recall Tony Utting becoming temporary Head of Security for
                                                                      permanent
   a time (dates unknown) before John Scott took on the role on a
   basis. He was still in post when I left in April 2012.

                                                                              strands
27. There were five strands within the Security Team when I left in 2012. All
    were headed up by a Senior Security Manager, reporting directly to John Scott.
   I recall the 5 strands led by Senior Security Managers as follows:


    -   Physical Security — John Bigley. This team managed PO Ltd premises,
        assets, equipment, burglaries and robberies.


    -    Information Security — Richard Barber. This team managed IT issues
         relating to systems in place at PO Ltd and compliance. eg Ensuring the
         systems were Payment Card Industry Compliant


    -    Commercial Security - Sally Smith. This team liaised with Clients such
         as Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), Girobank, Department for
         Work and Pensions (DWP) and was the go between for any issues with
         products, transactions etc


    -    Fraud Risk — Andrew Hayward. This team were responsible for identifying
         trends and implementing fraud risk programmes.

    within this strand which I think was known as the Investigation Team. I believe
                                                                                the
    the name changed to the Security Operations upon John Scott heading up
    Security Team. Each team consisted of around 6 investigators and one team
   leader. Between 2000 and 2012 when I left the business, there had been
   numerous head count reduction exercises. This reduced the teams over the
   years eventually to 3 teams with 3 team leaders and around 18 investigators.


29.Also within the Security Operations were the Financial Investigation Team.
   They were initially made up of two investigators Michael Matthews and Ged
   Harbinson. Following Michael Matthews and then Ged Harbinson transferring
                                                                                 this

30.Also within this strand was the Casework Team, originally based in London.

   can recall Brian Sharkey, Graham Ward, Dave Posnett and Jason
   working within this unit at various times, until it was relocated to Manchester
       and Jane Owens became the Manager (date unknown).

     other things for compliance checks on the files, requesting Fujitsu data, dealing
       with Post Office Card Account (POCA) enquiries and raising cases. This may

What, if any, supervision was there over criminal investigations conducted
by Security Managers? Please describe the nature of any supervision.


38. When I was new to the role I was guided by my Line Manager, Lester Chine
    and my peers. All cases were supervised by the Line Manager before
   submission. On completion of an investigation and for advice from Legal
   Services, case-papers were submitted to The Casework Manager who would
   complete compliance checks. The papers were then submitted to Legal
   Services for advice. The paralegal would ensure all matters outstanding were
   completed.


How did Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation and
prosecution of Crown Office employees differ from the policy and practice
regarding investigation and prosecution of SPMs, their managers and
assistants (if at all)? Did this change over the period of time you held relevant
roles within the Security team?


39. For losses where suspected criminal conduct was identified my recollection was
    that both Crown Office staff, Sub postmasters and their assistants were treated
   the same.


Audit and investigation


Please consider the document "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance"
(version 2, October 2008) [POL00104821]. In what circumstances would an
 investigator attend an audit of a branch and what was an investigator's role
 on attendance?


 40.After an audit shortage had been reported to the Security Casework Team it
    would be assessed as to whether a case should be raised. If a case was raised
    then it was allocated to the Team Leader for that area. The Team Leader would
    then assess what response was required and if necessary allocate it to an
    investigator. An Investigator would attend the office and try to establish the facts

             potential criminality was conducted by the Security team or the
             case was taken forwards as a debt recovery matter by the
             Financial Services Centre and / or the relevant legal team? Did
             this change during the period you worked within the Security
             team?

41. I am unaware of who determined whether a case was put forward as
    investigation or if it was dealt with by conduct by the Contracts Manager at the

   which related to the value of the loss. If the triggers were met then I believe
   would instigate a criminal investigation.

                                                                      contract

    of a loss and not suspend the Subpostmaster, then a criminal
    would not ensue.

           triggers / criteria for raising a theft or false accounting case
           different and if so what were they? Did these change during the

44. Once a case has been raised and assigned to an Investigator the
    (Contracts Manager) would be informed that the investigation had been
            assigned to them for further enquiries to be made. Contact made with the
            informant to establish the facts and consideration given to obtaining a witness
            statement. Intelligence gathered on the subject and a risk assessment
            performed should searches be required. Evidence collected to
            support/undermine the investigation by attending the office and retaining
            documentation. Consideration given to advising the Financial Investigators of
            the loss. Contact made with the subject either in person or on the phone seeking
            an explanation. Arrange interview under caution if suspected criminal offence.




 Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings


 Following an initial investigation, who decided whether a SPM, their
 manager(s) and / or assistant(s) or a Crown Office employee should be
 prosecuted by the Post Office and what considerations determined whether
                                                                    the time
 a prosecution was brought? To the extent that this changed during

45. Case-papers were submitted to Legal Services for advice as to whether a case
    was suitable for a prosecution. The Lawyer allocated the case would decide if
   there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. If Legal
   Services recommended a prosecution then the case-papers were sent to the
   Designated Prosecution Authority (DPA) to decide if a prosecution proceeded.
   On authority from the DPA the legal process would commence.


Where a branch was run by a SPM, did the SPM's local contract manager
                                                                  during
have any input into this decision-making process? Did this change
the period you worked within the Security team?


46. 1 do not recall the Contracts Manager having any input into the decision.
    However, if the Contracts Manager decided to reinstate the Sub postmaster
    then a prosecution would not be deemed appropriate and would not proceed.


What test was applied by those making prosecution and charging decisions?
In particular, what factors were considered at the evidential and the public
interest stage?


 47. This is not a decision I undertook and I was not familiar with the test applied for
     those making the prosecution and charging decisions.


 What advice, legal or otherwise, was provided to those making decisions
 about whether to prosecute and what charges to bring?


 48.The case-papers were returned to the Designated Prosecution Authority (DPA)
    from Legal Services with advice as to whether there was sufficient evidence to
    prosecute and charges if applicable. It was for the DPA to read the papers and
     decide for themselves whether the prosecution should proceed or not.

                                                                    criminal

 enforcement methods such as confiscation proceedings considered?

49. Where an audit shortage was identified and repayment was not made,
    depending on the amount of loss, a financial investigator would be assigned to
   the case. The investigator would report any identified assets and the Financial
   Investigator would consider a restraining order.


Who decided whether criminal enforcement proceedings should be pursued
and what factors did they consider when making decisions around this?


50.I cannot recall if this was the DPA, Head of Security or if the Fl made the
   decision.


Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team


What instructions, guidance and / or training were given to investigators
within the Security team about the following topics and how was this
provided:


       i)      interviewing a SPM / SPM's assistant / Crown Office employee
               who was suspected of a criminal offence;


51.The initial training in 2000 included conducting interviews as a 1st officer and as
   a 2"d officer supporting the OIC. I can recall partially attending a further
    interview course at Coton House, Rugby (cannot recall the dates but left early
    due to illness).


 52.A document of the most common offences and the points to prove were on the
    Intranet that detailed the Act and the points to prove to ensure all points were
    covered.


            ii) taking witness statements in the course of an investigation;


 53. This was covered within the initial training in 2000. R-v- Turnbull ADVOKATE
    was covered in this topic.

         iii) conducting searches in the course of an investigation;


54. During the course in 2000, training on searches was given and role playing
    done. This was followed up by attending the Thames Valley Police (TVP)
   training centre where searches were conducted within their training houses.


         iv) the duty on an investigator to investigate a case fully;


55,An investigator should take steps to make all reasonable lines of enquiries
   under CPIA that points to or away from the suspect.


          v) obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation;


56. Evidence should be securely retained and exhibited.


          vi) whether and in what circumstances evidence should be sought
          from third parties who might hold relevant evidence and, in
          particular, Fujitsu, where shortfalls were identified in branch;


57. Evidence held by a third party should be recorded and the third party asked not
   to destroy any data.


          vii) an investigator's disclosure obligations;


58. It was investigators responsibility to record, retain and reveal any material to
    Legal Services which may undermine the prosecution and or, assist the
    defence. This was an ongoing responsibility.


          viii) drafting investigation reports to enable a decision to be made
          about the future conduct of a case.


 59. There were templates available to ensure that the information required to be
     able make an informed decision was captured in the report.

     ii) David Posnett's email to you and others dated 23 May 2011 at
     [POL00118096] and the documents contained within the attached
     compliance zip file at [POL00118108], [POL001181091, [POL00118101],
     [P0L00118102J, [P0L00118103], [P0L00118104], [P0L00118105],
     [P0L00118106] and [P0L00118107].


In relation to the documents set out above please include in your account an
explanation of the following:


       i) Whether you were provided with either the 2000 or 2002 version of
      the Casework Management document when you held relevant roles
      within the Security Team;


60. I cannot recall whether I was provided with either of these documents.


      ii) What you understood by the instructions / guidance given in
      second, third and fourth bullet points on page 2 of the 2000 version
       and the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the 2002
       version (in particular whether you understood this to be relevant to
       Post Office' disclosure obligations in relation to information about
       Horizon bugs, errors and defects);


 61.As I am unable to recall these documents I cannot comment on my
    understanding of them at that time.


       iii) The circumstances in which investigations became subject to
       compliance checks, their purpose, the process for those checks being
       conducted and who conducted them;

62.The Casework Team based in Croydon initially completed the compliance
   checks on the case-papers. I do not recall if this was at the time of my entry into
   the Security Team or if this was introduced after my joining but this team I recall
   was headed up by Brian Sharkey. I cannot recall how these checks were
   performed and what criteria they were marked against.


63.There was a change of personnel within the Casework Team over the years
   with Jason Collins, Graham Ward, Dave Posnett, and Michael Mathews.
    performing this role at various times. I can recall a check list being provided to
    the investigators so that we could compliance check our own papers prior to
    submission. The aim being obtaining 100% compliance and driving up the
    standards.


       iv) What you understood the status of the suite of compliance
       documents attached to the email from David Posnett dated 23 May
       2011 to be at the time they were circulated;


64. Looking at the documents, it maybe that these were the current forms to be
    used from that time. These documents were provided to assist the investigator
    in achieving compliance as these were the documents from which your
    compliance check would be assessed and scored. This email appears to
    insinuate that compliance checks will be starting as if they have been previously
    stopped but I do not recall whether that is the case or not.


        v) What the purpose of the suite of compliance documents was at the
        times when they were in effect;


 65. I do not recall being sent these documents but having looked at them, I believe
     they were the current versions used at that time. These may have been
     circulated due to new members of staff joining the team.


        vi) Any role you had in relation to their development, management and
        any amendment;

66. 1 did not have any involvement in the development, management or
   amendments of the documents.


       vii) Your understanding of paragraph 2.15 (starting on p. 10) of the
       document entitled "Guide to the Preparation and Layout of
      Investigation Red Label Case Files - Offender reports & Discipline
      reports" ([POL00118101], attached to David Posnett's email of 23 May
       2011) and how this related to the Offender Report template (at
       [POL00118102], attached to David Posnett's email of 23 May 2011), as
       well as its relevance to the Post Office's disclosure obligations (and
       in particular as they related to information about Horizon bugs, errors
       and defects);


67. I do not recollect these documents.


       viii) Who drafted the document entitled "Identification Codes" (at
       [POL00118104], attached to David Posnett's email of 23 May 2011);


                                                                               this
68. I have looked at document [POL00118104] and I do not know the author of
    document.


       ix) Your view on the appropriateness of the identification codes
       described in the "Identification Codes" document;


 69. My view is that document [POL00118104] is offensive and inappropriate.


        x) Your understanding of why Security Team investigators were
        instructed to assign identification codes to suspected offenders.


 70. 1 believe the purpose of this was to be able to update the PNC upon conviction.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship
with Fujitsu


When you held relevant roles within the Security team, what analysis (if any)
was done by Security team investigators of Horizon data when a SPM/SPM's
manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed a shortfall
to problems with Horizon?


73. 1 cannot recall.


Where a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM's
manager(s) or assistant(s) /Crown Office employee(s) attributed the shortfall
to problems with Horizon, was ARQ data requested from Fujitsu as a matter
of course? If not, why not?


74. I cannot recall if it was requested as a matter of course.


Where ARQ data was obtained from Fujitsu, in circumstances where a
shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM was attributing the
shortfall to problems with Horizon, was this data provided to the SPM in
question as a matter of course? If not, why not?

75.ARQ data obtained was not provided as a matter of course but was retained for
   providing to the defence upon request.


Please consider fFUJ00153133]. Were you aware of the issue of duplication
of transactions records in ARQ returns? If so, please provide details of how
you became aware of this issue and your understanding of its implications,
as well as your understanding of how the issue was dealt with.


76. I have read [FUJO0153133] and I can see that I have been referred to an email
    regarding duplicate transactions. I can state that I do not recall an issue with
   duplicate transactions within ARQ data, nor do I recall if I received a statement
   from Fujitsu regarding this matter in the case of HOSI (Porters Avenue).


Please     consider     (FUJ00156491],       (FUJ00156309],        (FUJ00156151],
fFUJ00156140], (FUJ00156067], [FUJ00155987].              Please    describe    the
circumstances in which you would have contact with Fujitsu when you
worked within the Security team and the relevant contacts at Fujitsu (this
should include, but not be limited to contact with Gareth Jenkins and Penny
Thomas).


77. 1 have read and considered the following documents [FUJ00156491],
    [FUJO0156309],  [FUJ00156151],     [FUJ00156140],  [FUJ00156067],
    [FUJO0155987].


78.Our usual practice was all requests for Fujitsu data or statements, were
   submitted through our Casework Team who managed the relationship with
    Fujitsu. They were responsible for requesting the ARQ data as it was required
    as they managed the quota of requests. They would also normally request any
    statements required if needed for any prosecution.


 79.Although I do not recall any specific communications, I can recall I have had
    reason to speak with and or email directly Penny Thomas, Gareth Jenkins and
    Andy Dunks in relation to ongoing prosecutions.

What did you understand the role of Gareth Jenkins to be in relation to
criminal prosecutions he was involved in (see further below in relation to
individual criminal case studies)?


80. 1 understood Gareth Jenkins to represent Fujitsu as an expert witness. I
    understood him to hold a senior role within Fujitsu and be able to answer
   technical questions relating to the workings of the system.


Please consider [FUJ00153099]. To what extent did you consider Gareth
Jenkins to be acting as an expert witness? Did you understand the rules
governing independent expert evidence? Who advised or assisted you in this
regard?


81. I have considered [FUJ00153099] I believed that Gareth Jenkins was an expert
    witness for Fujitsu which I understood to be someone who was extremely
   knowledgeable within his field of expertise. In this case it was the workings of
   the Horizon system. I was not given any guidance on the rules governing
   'independent expert evidence'.


Relationship with others


Please describe your involvement with Cartwright King Solicitors, including
the level of interaction that you typically had in a case (and in which roles),
your main contacts and any other information that you consider to be of
relevance to the Inquiry.


82. I can only recall one case by name in which I believe Cartwright King Solicitors
    were involved. This was Enfield CFPO — Naveed & Saeed ANWAR. I do not
    recall the level of involvement they had in this case other than the case went to
    trial and Naveed ANWAR pleaded guilty on day 1 or 2 and the case was
    dropped against Saeed ANWAR. However, by the time the case had gone to
    trial I had transferred to RM and the case was managed by Graham Ward.

    but I do not recall. I cannot remember any of the names of Solicitors at this
   company.

How and when did you first become involved in the Suzanne Palmer case?


84. I have considered all of the above documents above.


85. As noted in the investigation report [POL00053007], I became involved in the
    Suzanne Palmer case on 03/02/2006. This was most likely the result of the
   audit team reporting a discrepancy to either the Casework Team or my then
   Line Manager Lester Chine. I would have been assigned the investigation, by
   Lester Chine and requested to attend the office the same day.


Please describe any involvement you had in the audit of the branch on 3
February 2006.

                                                                                 WITN08920100




86.I did not have any involvement with the audit nor did I request the audit was
   undertaken:


Please describe the circumstances in which Mrs Palmer was suspended.


87. I do not know the circumstances in which Mrs Palmer was suspended. It was
    most likely as a result of the outcome of the audit that was relayed to the
   Contracts Manager by the Auditor. It is then a decision for the Contracts
   Manager as to whether they suspend or not.


Whose decision was it to suspend Mrs Palmer?


88. It was the decision of the Contracts Manager Alan Lusher.


Please describe your involvement in the initial investigation.


89.Although I do not recall the conversation, it is probable that I or my Line
   Manager spoke with one of the auditors prior to attending.the office. They would
   have given the audit outcome and any explanation for the loss that they had
   been provided with by Mrs Palmer. I would have then attended the Post Office
   and spoken directly with her.


Were you aware of any allegations made by Suzanne Palmer relating to the
reliability of the Horizon IT system? If so, what did you think the significance
of this was?


90.I do not recall specifically any issues relating to the reliability of the Horizon
   system. I have considered doc [POL00053009] and Mrs Palmer does comment
    within the interview (tape 1) on the system going down and causing a loss in
    which she repaid and some other issues where the system is offline. I do not
    recall whether this issue was recorded on any Helpdesk logs and I am unable
    to recall if any further enquiries were made.

Please consider page 6 of the offender report [POL00053007J. What was the
basis of your observation that Mrs Palmer "has not received help when she
requested it and appears to have muddled through". What impact, if any, did
this have on your view of the case?


91 On reading document [POL00053007] on page 6 I believe the comments refer
   to a summary of Mrs Palmers interview that due to lack of training she has
   managed the best she can. I have described it as `muddling through'.


Please describe any discussions you had with Jarnail Singh before he
provided the advice set out in the memo of 10 March 2006?


92. I do not recall any discussions with Jarnail Singh prior to the advice set out in
   the memo of 10th March 2006 [POL00052990].


Please describe any steps you took after receiving that memo.


93.After receiving doc [POL00052990] and the DPA, I would have obtained the
   requested statements where possible and considered any further statements
   that were relevant.


Who made the charging decision in the case? What were the final charges
laid?


94. My observation from [POL00053007] was that Jarnail Singh would have
    prepared the charges and Tony Utting would have authorised the prosecution.


Who authorised the prosecution of Suzanne Palmer?


95. [POL 00053007] shows the DPA as Tony Utting in this case.


 Was any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ logs) requested from Fujitsu in
 this case?

99. 1 was the disclosure officer and responsible for providing the documents to
    Legal Services for reviewing as to whether anything was required to be
   disclosed to the defence.


What disclosure requests were made by the Defence in this case, what
advice did you provide in relation to any such requests and how did the Post
Office respond to them?


100.         Given the passage of time, I do not recall.


What are your reflections now on the way the investigation and prosecution
of Suzanne Palmer was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the
case? In addressing this question you may wish to consider the following
documents:


       i)       The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigations Team
                dated 31 January 2007 at[POL00052982];


       ii)      The Casework Management Initial Tick List for the Palmer case
               at[POL00052984].


101.       I did not make any decisions regarding the prosecution of any offenders
    in any of the cases. That was the responsibility of the DPA on advice from Legal
    Services. I fulfilled my role in putting the case together for the prosecution once
    authority had been given to proceed and dealt with any advice on the case from
    Counsel.

How and when did you first become involved in the Seema Misra case?


102.     I became aware of the audit shortage at West Byfleet Post Office on
   14/01/2008 when I was requested to attend the Post Office to assist the OIC,
   namely Adrian MORRIS with searches. The request was most likely to have
   come from Adrian MORRIS himself, who was assigned the case at the outset
   by our Line Manager Paul DAWKINS. I recall meeting Adrian MORRIS and Jon
   LONGMAN outside the Post Office. Although I do not recall being present when
   Mrs MISRA was cautioned this is contained within document POL00044541.


Please provide details of your involvement in the initial investigation.


103.     My involvement in the Seema MISRA case was limited to assisting the
   OIC along with Jon LONGMAN in conducting searches of the home address
   and gathering any documentation at the Post Office. This would have been a
   voluntary search and the relevant consent forms would have been signed as is
   stated in document POL00044541. To my knowledge I did not have any further
   involvement in this case.


Were you aware of any allegations made by Seema Misra relating to the
reliability of the Horizon /T system? if so, what did you think the significance
of this was?


104.       I was not involved in the interview nor did I have any further involvement
   in the case after the searches. I did become aware that Horizon was cited as a
   defence but I do not recall at what point during the investigation this was. I do
   not recall any of the details nor what issues were raised.


 Who asked you to provide a witness statement? Please provide details of
 any conversations you had in the drafting of this statement.


 105.        I do not recall whether Adrian MORRIS or Jon LONGMAN requested a
       statement from me. I recall Adrian MORRIS was the original OIC but either due
       to illness or his subsequent resignation the case was reassigned to Jon
                                   Page 31 of 37

                                                                                 WITNO8920100




  LONGMAN. I cannot recall any conversations regarding my statement. The
  continuation on the reverse is named as 'Jon Longman' which is clearly (also)
   incorrect. As there is no signature on the bottom this may well have been a draft
   copy sent to me for agreeing and then signing but I cannot recall.


Please describe any further involvement you had in this case.


106.      I do not recall any further involvement in this case after the searches
   other than providing a witness statement for the OIC.


What are your reflections now on the way the investigation and prosecution
of Seema Misra was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the
case? In addressing this question you may wish to consider the judgment of
the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited
[2021] EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278] (and in particular at paragraphs 75,
91, 198 to 209).


107.      I had limited involvement in the investigation and was not involved in the
   prosecution case of Seema MISRA.


General


To what extent (if any) did you consider a challenge to the integrity of Horizon
in one case to be relevant to other ongoing or future cases?




108.       I believed the Horizon system to be robust as documented in the relevant
    Fujitsu statements provided.


 Are there any other matters that you consider are of relevance to Phase 4 of
 the Inquiry (Action against Sub-postmasters and others: policy making,
 audits and investigations, civil and criminal proceedings, knowledge of and
 responsibility for failures in investigation and disclosure) that you would like
 to draw to the attention of the Chair?
