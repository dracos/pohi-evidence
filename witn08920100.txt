3. | preface my answer to this question by saying | have never been a Senior
Security Manager or a National Investigation Manager as provided for in the

question.

4. | joined PO Ltd on 26/08/1986 as a Postal Officer working within the Crown
Office Network. This role involved working on the counter and serving
customers. | was responsible for the cash and stock assigned to me and for the
summarising of my work both daily and weekly and the balance of that stock
unit. At this time balancing was on a weekly basis and was completed manually

by producing a balance sheet of summarised daily and weekly transactions.

5. In August 1992 | transferred to a Post Office where a computerised system had
already been implemented. This was one of two systems | used whilst a counter
clerk, but | cannot recall which way round they were installed. The two systems
| récall were ALPS (This stood for All London Post Offices | believe) and Ecco.
| do not recall whether | received class-room based training or if | received

onsite training by a member of staff.

6. Around 1995 | was promoted to Assistant Branch Manager which gave me
additional responsibilities for the day to day running of the Post Office. With the
exception of a secondment of performing an Admin Role supporting Retail Line
Managers (now known as Contract Managers) for a number of months, |
remained within the Crown Office Network until joining the Security Team
around July 2000.

7. Around July 2000 | was promoted ‘to an Investigation Manager. This role
involved investigating criminal offences against the business and its assets.
This role did evolve at one point.into a ‘multi skilled’ role whereby Physical
Security work was also undertaken. This could be attending offices after a
burglary or robbery, ensuring the equipment on hand is fit for purpose etc. But
this did return to an Investigative Role only at some point and was still so when
| left the business in April 2012.

WITN08920100

8. The only absence | can recall between joining Security in 2000 and leaving in
2012 was when | was on maternity leave for one year between March 2004 -
March 2005.

9. In April 2012 | transferred to the Royal Mail Investigation Team where | remain.
| am currently within the Economic Crime Team investigating offences against

the business, predominantly external crime.

It is understood that you joined the Security Team in 2000 as .a Security
Manager. In relation to your position as Security Manager (and any other

roles you held in the Security Team) please set out in detail:
i) How you became a Security Manager;

40.1 submitted an application and was invited to attend a one day assessment.
This assessment involved role playing, report writing and interviews with

personnel.
ii) Your training and relevant experience and expertise;

41. The initial recruitment process was an application for an Investigator Role within
the Royal Mail business. As at the time RM, PO Ltd and Parcel Force Worldwide
(PFWW) were all part of the same business, you were allocated a role suitable
for your experience. As | had PO counters experience and knowledge, | was

given a role within the PO Ltd Investigation Team.

42.1 attended a 3 week residential training course at the RM training centre at
Wolverton Mill, Milton Keynes. This was a mixed course of both PO Ltd and
Royal Mail Investigators. This training was delivered by members of the RM
training team | recall as; Michael MATTHEWS, Edward FREWER and Andrew
BROWN. In preparation for this course, | was provided with a number of
workbooks to complete prior to attending the course. At the start of the course
we had to sit an exam and there was a pass mark for me to be able to proceed
with the training. | do not recall the % but! did pass the test. A further test was

Page 3 of 37
WITN08920100
WITN08920100

taken at the end of the course confirming my current knowledge and
understanding and to ensure there was improvement on the initial test where

needed. Again | passed this test.

13.This training included but is not exhaustive to the commencement of an
investigation, approaching of suspects, interviewing, searches, statement
taking, the completion of RM Forms, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
(PACE), definition of offences, report writing and notebook entries.

14.1 also attended a Court Workshop in March 2002 to understand the legal
proceedings and guidance on giving evidence at court. | also attended Human

Rights Training.

15.1 completed the National Policing Improvement Agency Financial Investigation
Course in March 2011.

16.1 am sure there was further training provided but | cannot recall at this time the
details.

iii) What you understood the role to involve;

47.1 believed the role was to investigate criminal offences committed against the
business by both Crown Office staff, Sub postmasters and their employees.
This role may also involve working in partnership with other agencies such as

the DWP or the Police in the prevention and detection of crime.

iv) Who you reported to / your line management;

48. The reporting line in order as | recall was as follows;
- 2000 Lester Chine for a number of years

WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

- Jason Collins until | transferred to RM in 2012.

v) Your views on the competence and professionalism of your

colleagues and managers.

49.1 always found my colleagues and managers to be competent and professional.
| would not hesitate to approach them for guidance and advice when needed.

Insofar as not already addressed by the questions above, what role did you
consider you had in relation to each of the following (and when):

i) Disciplinary matters;

20.My role as an Investigator was to provide a report to the discipline/contracts
manager to assist them with deciding any course of action that may be required
following an enquiry. This report detailed only the facts of the case and not
opinion. The discipline Manager for Crown office member of staff would be the
Branch Manager, and for Sub postmasters the Contracts Manager.

ii) Interviewing those accused of criminal offence;

21.Part of my role was interviewing people under caution who were suspected of
having committed a criminal offence against PO Ltd. | would also be called upon
to assist my colleagues as a second officer when required. This role was to
simply assist the first officer during the interview which may include ensuring
the correct processes were followed, the caution given, and completing any

necessary forms.
iii) Disclosure in criminal or civil proceedings;
22.1n all cases where | was Officer in the Case (OIC), | was also the disclosure

officer. My role as the disclosure officer was to retain, record and reveal any

material that may assist the defence or undermine the prosecution case. | was

Page 5 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

responsible for completing the disclosure schedules and for conducting all

reasonable lines of enquiries.

iv) Litigation case strategy;

23.1 had no input into the Litigation Case Strategy. My role was to submit case-
papers to RM Legal Services for advice as to whether a case was suitable for
prosecution. Papers were returned with advice from an assigned lawyer on
further evidence/statements required if a prosecution was authorised. The
Designated Authorising Manager would then confirm if authority was given to
proceed to prosecution. Upon resubmission of outstanding enquiries summons
were raised and case assigned to counsel. Advice received from Counsel on

any further enquiries to be made.

v) Liaising with other Post Office departments in respect of the
progress of cases (please identify the relevant departments).

24. During the course of my duties | liaised with:
i) Product and Branch Accounting — Error Notices for all transactions
ii) Bank of Ireland Team — Post Office Card Account Transactions
iii) | NBSC —Calllogs
iv) | HSH—Call logs
v) Contracts Manager — Sub postmasters and their staff

Please explain the organisational structure of the Security team including the
different divisions within the Security team and their respective functions.
Please outline, to the best of your knowledge, any significant changes to the

structure of the Security team during your time in relevant roles within it.

26.To the best of my recollection, in July 2000 Tony Marsh was the Head of PO
Ltd Security. | can recall Tony Utting becoming temporary Head of Security for
a time (dates unknown) before John Scott took on the role on a permanent
basis. He was still in post when | left in April 2012.

27. There were five strands within the Security Team when | left in 2012. All strands
were headed up by a Senior Security Manager, reporting directly to John Scott.
| recall the 5 strands led by Senior Security Managers as follows:

- Physical Security — John Bigley. This team managed PO Ltd premises,
assets, equipment, burglaries and robberies.

- Information Security — Richard Barber. This team managed IT issues
relating to systems in place at PO Ltd and compliance. eg Ensuring the
systems were Payment Card Industry Compliant

- Commercial Security - Sally Smith. This team liaised with Clients such
as Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), Girobank, Department for
Work and Pensions (DWP) and was the go between for any issues with

products, transactions etc

- Fraud Risk — Andrew Hayward. This team were responsible for identifying
trends and implementing fraud risk programmes.

Page 9 of 37
WITN08920100

WITNO8920100

- Security Operations - Dave Pardoe. This team were responsible for

investigating criminal offences committed against the business.

28.When | joined the Security Team around July 2000, | believe there were 7 teams

within this strand which | think was known as the Investigation Team. | believe
the name changed to the Security Operations upon John Scott heading up the
Security Team. Each team consisted of around 6 investigators and one team
leader. Between 2000 and 2012 when | left the business, there had been
numerous head count reduction exercises. This reduced the teams over the

years eventually to 3 teams with 3 team leaders and around 18 investigators.

29.Also within the Security Operations were the Financial Investigation Team.
They were initially made up of two investigators Michael Matthews and Ged
Harbinson. Following Michael Matthews and then Ged Harbinson transferring
to RM, Graham Ward, Dave Posnett and Paul Southin took up roles within this

team at various times.

30.Also within this strand was the Casework Team, originally based in London. |
can recall Brian Sharkey, Graham Ward, Dave Posnett and Jason Collins
working within this unit at various times, until it was relocated to Manchester
and Jane Owens became the Manager (date unknown).

31.The London Casework Team managed the case-papers between the
Investigator and the Legal Services. They were also responsible for amongst
other things for compliance checks on the files, requesting Fujitsu data, dealing
with Post Office Card Account (POCA) enquiries and raising cases. This may
be as a result of an audit shortage or if information had been received where

suspected criminal offences had taken place.

32.1 cannot recall the responsibilities of Jane Owen once the Casework Team
transferred other than being the Fujitsu liaison point and Post Office Card
Account enquiries. | do not think she had the relevant experience to compliance
check the case-papers.

Page 10 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

Please explain your role in the development and/or management of any of

the policies listed above.

33.1 was not involved in the development and / or management of any policies.

What legislation, policies and / or guidance governed the conduct of
investigations conducted by the Security team during the period you worked
within it and how did this change over the period you held relevant roles
within it?

34.We adhered to PACE 1984, Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996
(CPIA 1996), Human Rights Act 2000, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA
2002), Data Protection Act 1998.

35. There were also a number of RMG policies within our databases that we
adhered to.

Please consider [POL00123309] and the attachments at [POL00123310],
[POL00123311] and [POL00123312]. Please describe the impact of the
separation of the Post Office from Royal Mail (if any) in relation to the way

investigations were conducted.

36.1 have considered the following documents [POL00123309], [POL00123310],
[POL00123311] and [POL00123312]. | left PO Ltd in April 2012 just as the
separation of Royal Mail and PO Ltd started, | have no comment to make on
the way in which PO Ltd conducted their investigations from this point onwards
as | was no longer employed by PO Ltd.

What was the process for dealing with complaints about the conduct of an
investigation by the Security team?

37. Having considered this question | do not recall the process. | have considered
[POL00104806] and | do not recall this policy.

Page 11 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

What, if any, supervision was there over criminal investigations conducted

by Security Managers? Please describe the nature of any supervision.

38.When | was new to the role | was guided by my Line Manager, Lester Chine
and my peers. All cases were supervised by the Line Manager before
submission. On completion of an investigation and for advice from Legal
Services, case-papers were submitted to The Casework Manager who would
complete compliance checks. The papers were then submitted to Legal
Services for advice. The paralegal would ensure all matters outstanding were

completed.

How did Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation and
prosecution of Crown Office employees differ from the policy and practice
regarding investigation and prosecution of SPMs, their managers and
assistants (if at all)? Did this change over the period of time you held relevant

roles within the Security team?

39. For losses where suspected criminal conduct was identified my recollection was
that both Crown Office staff, Sub postmasters and their assistants were treated

the same.
Audit and investigation

Please consider the document “Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance”
(version 2, October 2008) [POL00104821]. In what circumstances would an
investigator attend an audit of a branch and what was an investigator's role

on attendance?

40.After an audit shortage had been reported to the Security Casework Team it
would be assessed as to whether a case should be raised. If a case was raised
then it was allocated to the Team Leader for that area. The Team Leader would
then assess what response was required and if necessary allocate it to an
investigator. An Investigator would attend the office and try to establish the facts

Page 12 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

and identify if a suspected criminal offence had or had not taken place. They
would identify persons of interest to the investigation. Ifa suspect was identified
they would be. cautioned and depending on the circumstances request

voluntary searches and attendance at interview.

Where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a Post Office branch:

i) What and who determined whether an investigation into
potential criminality was conducted by the Security team or the
case was taken forwards as a debt recovery matter by the
Financial Services Centre and / or the relevant legal team? Did
this change during the period you worked within the Security

team?

41.1. am unaware of who determined whether a case was put forward as a criminal
investigation or if it was dealt with by conduct by the Contracts Manager at the
outset, However, | am aware there were ‘trigger points’ which | know one of
which related to the value of the loss. If the triggers were met then | believe that

would instigate a criminal investigation.

ii) Where the branch was run by a SPM, did the SPM’s local contract
manager have any input into this decision-making process? Did
this change during the period you worked within the Security team?

42.The contracts investigation would run independent of the investigation case.
However, if the Contracts Manager decided that they would accept a repayment
of a loss and not suspend the Subpostmaster, then a criminal investigation

would not ensue.

iii) What were the triggers / criteria for raising a fraud case following
the identification of a shortfall /discrepancy in a branch? Were the
triggers / criteria for raising a theft or false accounting case
different and if so what were they? Did these change during the
period you worked within the Security team?

Page 13 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

43.1 am aware there were ‘trigger points’ but | do not recall what the criteria was
during my time with PO Ltd.

The process followed by Security team investigators when conducting a

criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an audit

Once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal investigation, what
process did Security team investigators follow in conducting their initial
investigation? You may wish to consider the documents listed at paragraph
4 above in addressing this question.

44, Once a case has been raised and assigned to an Investigator the stakeholder
(Contracts Manager) would be informed that the investigation had been
assigned to them for further enquiries to be made. Contact made with the
informant to establish the facts and consideration given to obtaining a witness
statement. Intelligence gathered on the subject and a risk assessment
performed ‘should searches be required. Evidence collected to
support/undermine the investigation by attending the office and retaining
documentation. Consideration given to advising the Financial Investigators of
the loss. Contact made with the subject either in person or on the phone seeking

an explanation. Arrange interview under caution if suspected criminal offence.

Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

Following an initial investigation, who decided whether a SPM, their
manager(s) and / or assistant(s) or a Crown Office employee should be
prosecuted by the Post Office and what considerations determined whether
a prosecution was brought? To the extent that this changed during the time
you held relevant roles within the Security team, please describe any such
changes

Page 14 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

45. Case-papers were submitted to Legal Services for advice as to whether a case
was suitable for a prosecution. The Lawyer allocated the case would decide if
there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. If Legal
Services recommended a prosecution then the case-papers were sent to the
Designated Prosecution Authority (DPA) to decide if a prosecution proceeded.
On authority from the DPA the legal process would commence.

Where a branch was run by a SPM, did the SPM’s local contract manager
have any input into this decision-making process? Did this change during
the period you worked within the Security team?

46.1 do not recall the Contracts Manager having any input into the decision.
However, if the Contracts Manager decided to reinstate the Sub postmaster
then a prosecution would not be deemed appropriate and would not proceed.

What test was applied by those making prosecution and charging decisions?
In particular, what factors were considered at the evidential and the public

interest stage?

47. This is not a decision | undertook and | was not familiar with the test applied for
those making the prosecution and charging decisions.

What advice, legal or otherwise, was provided to those making decisions

about whether to prosecute and what charges to bring?

48. The case-papers were returned to the Designated Prosecution Authority (DPA)
from Legal Services with advice as to whether there was sufficient evidence to
prosecute and charges if applicable. It was for the DPA to read the papers and
decide for themselves whether the prosecution should proceed or not.

In what circumstances were steps to restrain a suspect's assets by criminal

enforcement methods such as confiscation proceedings considered?

Page 15 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

49.Where an audit shortage was identified and repayment was not made,
depending on the amount of loss, a financial investigator would be assigned to
the case. The investigator would report any identified assets and the Financial

Investigator would consider a restraining order.

Who decided whether criminal enforcement proceedings should be pursued
and what factors did they consider when making decisions around this?

50.1 cannot recall if this was the DPA, Head of Security or if the Fl made the

decision.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team

What instructions, guidance and / or training were given to investigators
within the Security team about the following topics and how was this
provided:

i) interviewing a SPM / SPlV’s assistant / Crown Office employee

51. The initial training in 2000 included conducting interviews as a 1* officer and as
a 2% officer supporting the OIC. | can recall partially attending a further
interview course at Coton House, Rugby (cannot recall the dates but left early

2011 to be at the time they were circulated;

64.Looking at the documents, it maybe that these were the current forms to be
used from that time. These documents were provided to assist the investigator
in achieving compliance as these were the documents from which your
compliance check would be assessed and scored. This email appears to
insinuate that compliance checks will be starting as if they have been previously
stopped but | do not recall whether that is the case or not.

v) What the purpose of the suite of compliance documents was at the

times when they were in effect;
65.1 do not recall being sent these documents but having looked at them, | believe
they were the current versions used at that time. These may have been

circulated due to new members of staff joining the team.

vi) Any role you had in relation to their development, management and

any amendment;

66,1 did not have any involvement in the development, management or

amendments of the documents.

vii) Your understanding of paragraph 2.15 (starting on p. 10) of the
document entitled “Guide to the Preparation and Layout of
Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports & Discipline
reports” ([POL00118101], attached to David Posnett’s email of 23 May
2011) and how this related to the Offender Report template (at
[POL00118102], attached to David Posnett’s email of 23 May 2011), as
well as its relevance to the Post Office’s disclosure obligations (and
in particular as they related to information about Horizon bugs, errors

and defects);

67.1 do not recollect these documents.

viii) Who drafted the document entitled “Identification Codes” (at
[POL00118104], attached to David Posnett’s email of 23 May 2011);

68.| have looked at document [POL00118104] and | do not know the author of this

document.

ix) Your view on the appropriateness of the identification codes

described in the “Identification Codes” document;

69. My view is that document [POL00118104] is offensive and inappropriate.

x) Your understanding of why Security Team investigators were

instructed to assign identification codes to suspected offenders.

70.1 believe the purpose of this was to be able to update the PNC upon conviction,

Please consider the email from Dave Pardoe, dated 30 August 2011 at
[POL00121772] and the attachment at [POL00121773].

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship
with Fujitsu

When you held relevant roles within the Security team, what analysis (if any)
was done by Security team investigators of Horizon data when a SPM/ SPM’s
manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed a shortfall
to problems with Horizon?

73.1 cannot recall.

Where a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM’s
manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed the shortfall
to problems with Horizon, was ARQ data requested from Fujitsu as a matter
of course? If not, why not?

74.1 cannot recall if it was requested as a matter of course.

Where ARQ data was obtained from Fujitsu, in circumstances where a
shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM was attributing the
shortfall to problems with Horizon, was this data provided to the SPM in

question as a matter of course? If not, why not?

Page 21 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

75. ARQ data obtained was not provided as a matter of course but was retained for

providing to the defence upon request.

Please consider [FUJ00153133]. Were you aware of the issue of duplication
of transactions records in ARQ returns? If so, please provide details of how
you became aware of this issue and your understanding of its implications,

as well as your understanding of how the issue was dealt with.

76.| have read [FUJ00153133] and I can see that | have been referred to an email
regarding duplicate transactions. | can state that | do not recall an issue with
duplicate transactions within ARQ data, nor do | recall if | received a statement

from Fujitsu regarding this matter in the case of HOSI (Porters Avenue).

Please consider [FUJ00156491], | [FUJ00156309], [FUJ00156151],
[FUJ00156140],  [FUJ00156067], [FUJ00155987]. Please describe the
circumstances in which you would have contact with Fujitsu when you
worked within the Security team and the relevant contacts at Fujitsu (this
should include, but not be limited to contact with Gareth Jenkins and Penny
Thomas).

77.1 have read and considered the following documents [FUJ00156491],
[FUJ00156309], [FUJ00156151], [FUJ00156140], [FUJ00156067],
[FUJ00155987].

78.Our usual practice was all requests for Fujitsu data or statements, were
submitted through our Casework Team who managed the relationship with
Fujitsu. They were responsible for requesting the ARQ data as it was required
as they managed the quota of requests. They would also normally request any

statements required if needed for any prosecution.

79.Although | do not recall any specific communications, | can recall | have had
reason to speak with and or email directly Penny Thomas, Gareth Jenkins and
Andy Dunks in relation to ongoing prosecutions.

Page 22 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

What did you understand the role of Gareth Jenkins to be in relation to
criminal prosecutions he was involved in (see further below in relation to

individual criminal case studies)?

80.1 understood Gareth Jenkins to represent Fujitsu as an expert witness. |
understood him to hold a senior role within Fujitsu and be able to answer

technical questions relating to the workings of the system.

Please consider [FUJ00153099]. To what extent did you consider Gareth
Jenkins to be acting as an expert witness? Did you understand the rules
governing independent expert evidence? Who advised or assisted you in this
regard?

81.1 have considered [FUJ00153099] | believed that Gareth Jenkins was an expert
witness for Fujitsu which | understood to be someone who was extremely
knowledgeable within his field of expertise. In this case it was the workings of
the Horizon system. | was not given any guidance on the rules governing

‘independent expert evidence’.
Relationship with others

Please describe your involvement with Cartwright King Solicitors, including
the level of interaction that you typically had in a case (and in which roles),
your main contacts and any other information that you consider to be of

relevance to the Inquiry.

82.1 can only recall one case by name in which | believe Cartwright King Solicitors
were involved. This was Enfield CFPO — Naveed & Saeed ANWAR. | do not
recall the level of involvement they had in this case other than the case went to
trial and Naveed ANWAR pleaded guilty on day 1 or 2 and the case was
dropped against Saeed ANWAR. However, by the time the case had gone to
trial | had transferred to RM and the case was managed by Graham Ward.

83. There are possibly other cases that were passed to Cartwright Kings Solicitors
but | do not recall. | cannot remember any of the names of Solicitors at this

company.

How and when did you first become involved in the Suzanne Palmer case?

84.1 have considered all of the above documents above.

85.As noted in the investigation report [POL00053007], | became involved in the
Suzanne Palmer case on 03/02/2006. This was most likely the result of the
audit team reporting a discrepancy to either the Casework Team or my then
Line Manager Lester Chine. | would have been assigned the investigation by
Lester Chine and requested to attend the office the same day.

Please describe any involvement you had in the audit of the branch on 3
February 2006.

Page 25 of 37 ,
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

86.1 did not have any involvement with the audit nor did | request the audit was

undertaken:
Please describe the circumstances in which Mrs Palmer was suspended.

87.1 do not know the circumstances in which Mrs Palmer was suspended. It was
most likely as a result of the outcome of the audit that was relayed to the
Contracts Manager by the Auditor. It is then a decision for the Contracts
Manager as to whether they suspend or not.

Whose decision was it to suspend Mrs Palmer?
88. It was the decision of the Contracts Manager Alan Lusher.
Please describe your involvement in the initial investigation.

89.Although | do not recall the conversation, it is probable that | or my Line
Manager spoke with one of the auditors prior to attending the office. They would
have given the audit outcome and any explanation for the loss that they had
been provided with by Mrs Palmer. | would have then attended the Post Office
and spoken directly with her.

Were you aware of any allegations made by Suzanne Palmer relating to the
reliability of the Horizon IT system? If so, what did you think the significance
of this was?

90.1 do not recall specifically any issues relating to the reliability of the Horizon
system. | have considered doc [POL00053009] and Mrs Palmer does comment
within the interview (tape 1) on the system going down and causing a loss in
which she repaid and some other issues where the system is offline. | do not
recall whether this issue was recorded on any Helpdesk logs and | am unable

to recall if any further enquiries were made.

Page 26 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

Please consider page 6 of the offender report [POL00053007]. What was the
basis of your observation that Mrs Palmer “has not received help when she
requested it and appears to have muddled through”. What impact, if any, did

this have on your view of the case?
91.On reading document [POL00053007] on page 6 | believe the comments refer
to a summary of Mrs Palmers interview that due to lack of training she has

managed the best she can. | have described it as ‘muddling through’.

Please describe any discussions you had with Jarnail Singh before he
provided the advice set out in the memo of 10 March 2006?

92.1 do not recall any discussions with Jarnail Singh prior to the advice set out in
the memo of 10'" March 2006 [POL00052990].

Please describe any steps you took after receiving that memo.
93.After receiving doc [POL00052990] and the DPA, | would have obtained the
requested statements where possible and considered any further statements

that were relevant.

Who made the charging decision in the case? What were the final charges
laid?

94.My observation from [POL00053007] was that Jarnail Singh would have
prepared the charges and Tony Utting would have authorised the prosecution.

Who authorised the prosecution of Suzanne Palmer?
95.[POL 00053007] shows the DPA as Tony Utting in this case.

Was any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ logs) requested from Fujitsu in

this case?

Please describe the nature of any discussions you had with counsel and the

your understanding of your role in the case?

97.1 do not recall any conversations regarding my role in this case.

Who was the disclosure officer in this case?

98.1 was the disclosure officer in this case.

Please explain your role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings.

Page 28 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

99.1 was the disclosure officer and responsible for providing the documents to
Legal Services for reviewing as to whether anything was required to be

disclosed to the defence.

What disclosure requests were made by the Defence in this case, what
advice did you provide in relation to any such requests and how did the Post
Office respond to them?

100. Given the passage of time, | do not recall.

What are your reflections now on the way the investigation and prosecution
of Suzanne Palmer was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the
case? In addressing this question you may wish to consider the following

documents:

i) The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigations Team
dated 31 January 2007 at [POL00052982];

ii) |The Casework Management Initial Tick List for the Palmer case
at [POL00052984].

101. | did not make any decisions regarding the prosecution of any offenders
in any of the cases. That was the responsibility of the DPA on advice from Legal
Services. | fulfilled my role in putting the case together for the prosecution once
authority had been given to proceed and dealt with any advice on the case from

Counsel.

How and when did you first become involved in the Seema Misra case?

102. | became aware of the audit shortage at West Byfleet Post Office on
14/01/2008 when | was requested to attend the Post Office to assist the OIC,
namely Adrian MORRIS with searches. The request was most likely to have
come from Adrian MORRIS himself, who was assigned the case at the outset
by our Line Manager Paul DAWKINS. I recall meeting Adrian MORRIS and Jon
LONGMAN outside the Post Office. Although | do not recall being present when
Mrs MISRA was cautioned this is contained within document POL00044541.

Please provide details of your involvement in the initial investigation.

103. My involvement in the Seema MISRA case was limited to assisting the
OIC along with Jon LONGMAN in conducting searches of the home address
and gathering any documentation at the Post Office. This would have been a
voluntary search and the relevant consent forms would have been signed as is
stated in document POL00044541. To my knowledge | did not have any further

involvement in this case.

Were you aware of any allegations made by Seema Misra relating to the
reliability of the Horizon IT system? If so, what did you think the significance

of this was?

104. | was not involved in the interview nor did | have any further involvement
in the case after the searches. | did become aware that Horizon was cited as a
defence but | do:not recall at what point during the investigation this was. | do

not recall any of the details nor what issues were raised.

Who asked you to provide a witness statement? Please provide details of
any conversations you had in the drafting of this statement.

105. I do not recall whether Adrian MORRIS or Jon LONGMAN requested a
statement from me. | recall Adrian MORRIS was the original OIC but either due

to illness or his subsequent resignation the case was reassigned to Jon

Page 31 of 37
WITNO08920100
WITN08920100

LONGMAN. | cannot recall any conversations regarding my statement. The
continuation on the reverse is named as ‘Jon Longman’ which is clearly (also)
incorrect. As there is no signature on the bottom this may well have been a draft

copy sent to me for agreeing and then signing but | cannot recall.

Please describe any further involvement you had in this case.

106. | do not recall any further involvement in this case after the searches

other than providing a witness statement for the OIC.

What are your reflections now on the way the investigation and prosecution
of Seema Misra was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the
case? In addressing this question you may wish to consider the judgment of
the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited
[2021] EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278] (and in particular at paragraphs 75,
91, 198 to 209).

107: | had limited involvement in the investigation and was not involved in the

prosecution case of Seema MISRA.

General

To what extent (if any) did you consider a challenge to the integrity of Horizon

in one case to be relevant to other ongoing or future cases?

108. I believed the Horizon system to be robust as documented in the relevant
Fujitsu statements provided.

Are there any other matters that you consider are of relevance to Phase 4 of
the Inquiry (Action against Sub-postmasters and others: policy making,
audits and investigations, civil and criminal proceedings, knowledge of and
responsibility for failures in investigation and disclosure) that you would like

to draw to the attention of the Chair?

Page 32 of 37

109. No

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
