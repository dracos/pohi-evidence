Positively Wilcox-ian. Good thoughts though, next catch up with her will have to address these.

Subject: BNR Meeting - Some Reflections

Team,

I was thinking about the meeting last night (a quiet night I know) and had the following reflections which could be worth
bearing in mind as we go forward:

e = There’s clearly still some confusion about what is Royal Mail and what is Post Office. She was talking about RM
collection offices and postbags as if that’s something POL does

e Asshe’s mentioned before she thought Horizon was another example of a Government IT debacle and that
innocent subpostmasters were the victims. Clearly this is wholly untrue in two respects, probably untrue ina
third

¢ When Paula / Al were explaining things she jumped to an understanding and it was difficult to bring her back
from that first impression / correct her

She spoke very openly about things she probably shouldn’t be so open about. While it was fine with POL there
are probably some meetings she will have on POL where this is not appropriate so we should be clear when
there are things she can’t say (that is, she can’t just keep using the excuse “I’m commercial so I say things other
Ministers might not” and laughing all the time)

e@ — She’s uncertain about which Ministers have responsibility for what. She thought we briefed Anna Soubry as RM
Minister on something to do with POL when it was the BIS Banking team (which she didn’t realise BIS had as she
thought it all sat within HMT) briefing their Minister, Anna Soubry, on banking. It was not a POL sub and was not
asking her to do anything, so it was not addressed to her

Cheers,

Tim
