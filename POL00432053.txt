(D)

The Parties are, at the date of this Agreement, companies within the same corporate group.

It is expected that the Parties will, at a date after the date of this Agreement, cease to be within the
same corporate group of companies and as such it is intended that they put in place agreements to
formalise certain existing arrangements between the Parties and to prepare for the Parties to cease
to be in the same corporate group by, amongst other things, providing for an orderly transition or
termination of the Services that are currently provided by Provider to Recipient.

This Agreement sets out the terms on which Provider shall provide the Services to Recipient and
makes provision for the transition or termination of the Services.

It is agreed that the Parties intend that this Agreement is not to operate as a permanent
arrangement for the supply of the Services and that Provider is not in the business of providing

intention is for Recipient Group to migrate away from the Services in accordance with the terms of

Accordingly, Paragraphs 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 (Charges) shall not apply to the calculation of such

more onerous than such Service Level Standard.

Subject to Clause 3.1 in respect of the availability of the Services, Provider shall treat the members

operate, with each other in the provision and receipt of the Services (as the case may be) and in
performing their other obligations under this Agreement, in a manner and to an extent, in all
material respects, equivalent to the manner and extent the Parties and the members of their
respective Groups co-operated with the other in the 12 month period immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement.

POST-SIGNING SERVICES

Subject to Clause 4.2, if, after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to 31 March 2012,
Recipient identifies any service (being a service that is not set out in Schedule 1 (Services)) that
any Authorised User had been receiving which was provided by or on behalf of Provider in the 12
months prior to the date of this Agreement and such service is not provided pursuant to this
Agreement, Provider shall, from a date appointed by Recipient in writing (acting reasonably)
(‘Post-Signing Services Start Date") provide those services or a substantially equivalent service
(‘Post-Signing Services’).

Provider acknowledges that it provides the pensions administration services, including the pensions
helpline, pursuant to the administration agreement between Royal Mail Pensions Trustee Limited
and Provider dated on or about 1 April 2005 (‘Pensions Administration Agreement’) and shall
continue to provide such services to Royal Mail Pensions Trustee Limited in accordance with the
Pensions Administration Agreement until such agreement terminates or expires in accordance with

28
POL00432053
POL00432053

Agreement is intended to give Recipient or any Authorised User any rights that Recipient or any
Authorised User would not otherwise have (if any) under the Pensions Administration Agreement.

(A) any services which are provided pursuant to the terms of another written agreement
between Provider (or any member of Provider Group) and Recipient (or any other member

amount payable in respect of the Annual Charges to reflect:

the date the relevant Post-Signing Services are provided in accordance with Clause 4.1 up
to 31 March 2012 (excluding any such Third Party Costs that have been included as part of
the Annual Charges for the Charging Period from 1 April 2011 up to and including 31 March
2012); and

(B) the Post Signing Services Charges after 31 March 2012.

4.5 Subject to Clause 13.1, Clause 13.4 and Clause 13.5 (Service Extensions), the Post-Signing

5. IN FLIGHT PROJECTS
Current Projects

5.1 Recipient shall bear its proportion of the Opex Costs and Amortised Capex Costs of assessing and
implementing each In Flight Project that is identified in Annexure 1 (In Flight Projects) and deemed
to be an In Flight Project in accordance with Clause as such proportion has been determined in
the Business Case for such In Flight Project. If the Business Case does not amortise the Capex
Costs or such proportion has not been determined in the Business Case, Recipient shall bear a just
and equitable proportion, as determined by the MSA Management Board in accordance with
Schedule 3 (Governance and Service Management), of Provider Group's Opex Costs and Capex
Costs (which shall be amortised (for the estimated useful life of the assets subject of the relevant In
Flight Project, as such period is determined in accordance with Provider's standard accounting
policies that apply from time to time) for the purposes of calculating the just and equitable
proportion payable by Recipient) of assessing and implementing such In Flight Project at such time
as those Costs are payable by Provider Group.

5.2 If, on or prior to 31 March 2012, Provider identifies any Project which is not set out in Annexure 1
(In Flight Projects) but which was approved by a member of Provider Group prior to the date of this
Agreement, such Project shall be deemed to be an In Flight Project. Provider shall, as soon as

29
POL00432053
POL00432053

reasonably practicable after it has identified such Project, notify Recipient of the intended
completion date of such In Flight Project and provide a description of such In Flight Project.

Mandatory Change Projects

5.3

5.4

5.5

5.6

Subject to Clause 5.5, if Provider undertakes any Project in respect of a Mandatory Change, such
Project shall be deemed to be an In Flight Project and Recipient shall bear a just and equitable
proportion of the Opex Costs and the Amortised Capex Costs of assessing and/or implementing
those parts of such In Flight Project that Recipient participates in, such proportion to be determined
based on the proportion of Recipient Group's anticipated use of such In Flight Project as it relates
to the overall use by Provider Group and Recipient Group (taken together) of such In Flight Project
and the period of time that Recipient is receiving a Service in relation to such In Flight Project,
provided that Provider shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide a notice to Recipient:

(A) at least 20 Business Days prior to undertaking such In Flight Project;

(B) identifying the date(s) that Provider intends to undertake each part of such In Flight Project
that Recipient shall participate in;

(C) identifying material resources (if any) which Recipient may be required to provide to
Provider in order to assess and/or implement each part of such In Flight Project that
Recipient shall participate in;

(D) setting out a description of the relevant Mandatory Change; and

(E) providing an estimate in respect of Recipient's just and equitable proportion of the Opex
Costs and the Amortised Capex Costs of assessing and/or implementing each part of such
In Flight Project that Recipient shall participate in (‘Mandatory Change Estimate’).

Where, in accordance with Provider's standard accounting policies which apply from time to time,
payment of the relevant Opex Costs or Amortised Capex Costs are deferred until such time as
Recipient Group is no longer receiving a Service to which a Project in respect of a Mandatory
Change relates, Recipient shall bear a just and equitable proportion of the Opex Costs and
Amortised Capex Costs in accordance with Clause 5.3 notwithstanding that Recipient Group has
ceased to receive the relevant Service.

If Recipient receives a notice from Provider in accordance with Clause 5.3 for a Project in respect
of a Mandatory Operational Change and Recipient does not wish to participate in such Project,
Recipient may refer such dispute to the MSA Management Board, which shall determine whether
Recipient is obliged to participate in such Project in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and
Service Management). If the MSA Management Board does not reach a determination within 10
Business Days of the matter being referred to it, either Party shall have the right to escalate the
matter to the Parties’ CEOs in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service
Management). If the matter is escalated to the Parties’ CEOs and the CEOs do not reach a
determination within 10 Business Days of the matter being referred to them, Recipient shall be
required to participate in the relevant Project.

Where a Project in respect of a Mandatory Operational Change is required to be implemented as a
matter of urgency and it is not reasonably practicable for Provider to provide Recipient with a notice

30
POL00432053
POL00432053

in accordance with Clause 5.3 or to escalate the matter to the MSA Management Board and/or the
Parties’ CEOS in advance of commencement of the implementation of the Project in respect of the
Mandatory Operational Change, Recipient shall participate in such Project. Provider shall provide
the notice required under Clause 5.3 as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of
such Project. If, subsequent to the commencement of Recipient's participation in such Project,
Recipient refers the Project to the MSA Management Board under Clause 5.5 and the MSA
Management Board and the Parties’ CEOs (if applicable) determine that Recipient is not obliged to
participate in such Project, Recipient shall be entitled to exit such Project at no Cost to Recipient.

5.7 If:

(A) notice to terminate a Service (in whole or part) is served in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement prior to Provider notifying Recipient of its intention to implement a Project in
respect of a Mandatory Operational Change in relation to such terminating Service in
accordance with Clause 5.3; or

(B) the Service End Date for a Service, in respect of which a Project for a Mandatory
Operational Change relates, expires prior to the scheduled implementation date for such
Project,

Clause 5.3 shall not apply and Provider shall exclude members of Recipient Group from any
Project implementing Mandatory Operational Changes in respect of the relevant Service (or part
thereof) for which notice to terminate has been served under Clause 5.7(A) or for which the Service
End Date expires prior to the scheduled Project implementation date under Clause 5.7(B) (as the
case may be).

Future Optional Projects

5.8 If, from the date of this Agreement, Provider intends to undertake any Projects which are not In
Flight Projects which are identified in Annexure 1 (In Flight Projects) or referred to in Clauses 5.2 or
5.3, Provider shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide a notice to Recipient:
(A) at least 20 Business Days prior to implementing such Project;

(B) identifying the date that Provider intends to implement such Project;

(C) identifying material resources (if any) which Recipient may be required to provide to
Provider in order to assess and/or implement such Project;

(D) setting out a description of such Project;

(E) identifying any Service (or part thereof) which shall be affected by Recipient's lack of
participation in such Project (‘Affected Services”) and the date that the Affected Services
shall terminate if Recipient does not participate in such Project ("Affected Service
Termination Date”);

(F) identifying the date by which Recipient must notify Provider that it wishes to participate in

such Project (“Opt-in Date”), which shall be no less than 4 Business Days prior to the date
referred to in Clause 5.8(B); and

34
5.9

(G)

POL00432053

notifies Provider by the Opt-in Date that it wishes to participate in a Project referred to in
Clause 5.8, such Project (or relevant part thereof) shall be deemed to be an In Flight
Project and Recipient shall bear a just and equitable proportion of the Opex Costs and
Amortised Capex Costs of assessing and implementing those parts of such In Flight
Project that Recipient participates in, for the period of time that Recipient is receiving a
Service in relation to such In Flight Project; or

notifies Provider by the Opt-in Date that it does not wish to participate in any Project
referred to in Clause 5.8 or does not provide a response to Provider by the Opt-in Date,
such Project shall not be deemed to be an In Flight Project.

Recipient may:

(A)

(B)

by providing written notice to Provider, request an estimate of Provider's In Flight Exit
Costs in respect of an In Flight Project (such notice shall specify the In Flight Project that
Recipient wishes to suspend or terminate its participation in, the date that Recipient wishes
to suspend or terminate its participation and such other information as Provider may
reasonably request). Provider shall provide such estimate to Recipient in writing no later
than 20 Business Days after the date of Recipient's notice; and

save in respect of In Flight Projects referred to in Clause 5.1 which are identified in
Annexure 1 (In Flight Projects) as mandatory projects and In Flight Projects referred to in
Clause 5.3, suspend or terminate its participation in an In Flight Project by providing no
less than 20 Business Days’ written notice to Provider provided that, if it does so, Recipient
shall reimburse Provider for all Provider's In Flight Exit Costs in respect of such In Flight
Project.

Provider may:

(A)

(8)

by providing written notice to Recipient, request an estimate of Recipient's In Flight Exit
Costs in respect of an In Flight Project (such notice shall specify the In Flight Project that
Provider wishes to suspend or terminate, the date that Provider wishes to suspend or
terminate such In Flight Project and such other information as Recipient may reasonably
request). Recipient shall provide such estimate to Provider in writing no later than 20
Business Days after the date of Provider's notice; and

‘suspend or terminate an In Flight Project by providing no less than 20 Business Days’

written notice to Recipient provided that, if it does so, Provider shall reimburse Recipient
for all Recipient's In Flight Exit Costs in respect of such In Flight Project.

of such Project.

TRANSFERRING ASSETS

To the extent that any Facility or Contract (or part thereof) is necessary for the provision by Provider
to Recipient of any Service (or part thereof) under this Agreement and all or part of such Facility or
Contract is transferred out of the control of Provider at any time following the date of this
Agreement to a member of Recipient Group in accordance with a Separation Plan, or as otherwise
agreed by the Parties, such that Provider is no longer able to provide any Service (or part thereof),
provision of the Service (or part thereof) which is affected by the transfer of the Facility or Contract
shall immediately terminate upon the date of such transfer. Notwithstanding this Clause 6.1,
Provider acknowledges that if a Shared Site, or any other premises, land or property is transferred
out of its control to a member of Recipient Group, such transfer shall not affect the provision by
Provider of any of the Facilities Management Services provided that Recipient provides, or
procures the provision, of such access to the relevant Shared Site, or other premises, land or
property and any utilities, facilities or other resources at such Shared Site, or other premises, land
or property which is reasonably required for the provision of the Facilities Management Services.

Subject to Clause 6.3, if Provider, or any member of Provider Group, intends to transfer any Facility
(or part thereof) to a Third Party such that Provider, or any member of Provider Group, is no longer
able to provide any Service (or part thereof), it shall notify Recipient as soon as reasonably
practicable of its intention to transfer such Facility (or part thereof) to a Third Party and to the extent
that any such Facility (or part thereof) is transferred to a Third Party:

connection with the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Clause 6.2(A) (including
the legal costs incurred in respect of running the procurement process);

(B) any relevant Internal Charges shall: (i) continue to be payable if Provider continues to
provide the relevant Service (or part thereof); or (ii) if Provider procures the provision of a
Replacement Service, cease to be payable in accordance with Clause 12.10(A)
(Separation and Recurring Stranded Costs);

(C) Recipient shall pay all Third Party Costs in respect of the provision of the relevant
Replacement Service in accordance with Schedule 2 (Charges); and

save in respect of Provider’s obligation specified in Clause 6.3(A), Provider shall have no
liability under this Agreement for its failure to procure a Replacement Service.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Clause 6 (Transferring Assets) and the MOU, which
the Parties acknowledge sets out the principal commercial terms agreed between the Parties in
respect of property related separation issues but is not legally binding, represents the sum of the
terms agreed between them in relation to the Shared Sites.

Each Party will procure that the provisions of the MOU including the dispositions of estates and
interests in land are implemented and will act reasonably and in good faith and use its best
endeavours to do so by way of a transfer scheme under the Postal Services Act 2011 (the
“Transfer Scheme’) to be put in place as soon as reasonably practicable to take effect as of 26
March 2012 (or such other later date as is agreed between the Parties acting reasonably) failing
which in such other manner as the Parties, acting reasonably, shall agree.

The Parties will continue with the programme of preparation of separation surveys and site plans
for each of the Shared Sites with a view to completing that work as soon as reasonably practicable.

From the date of this Agreement until 26 March 2012 the Parties’ occupation of the Shared Sites
shall continue to be governed by the intercompany charging arrangements existing at the date of
this Agreement and each Party shall permit the other to occupy the Shared Sites as currently
permitted.

From and including 26 March 2012 until the effective date of the Transfer Scheme (or other agreed
manner of disposition) in respect of a Shared Site, the Parties’ occupation of such Shared Site shall
be governed by the intercompany charging arrangements for the financial year 2012-2013, which
are to be agreed by the Parties acting reasonably and which shall exclude any amounts attributable
to rent payable in respect of occupation of a Shared Site but shall include all other occupational
costs usually included within the intercompany charging arrangements (the “2012-13

permitted.

From and including the effective date of the Transfer Scheme in respect of a Shared Site, the
Parties’ occupation of such Shared Site shall be as provided for in the Transfer Scheme and any
relevant documentation arising out of the Transfer Scheme, provided that:

(A) the charges payable under the 2012-13 Arrangements shall remain payable for the whole
of that financial year;

(B) any service charge regimes under any leases of any Shared Sites due to be put in place
under the Transfer Scheme shall not commence until 26 March 2013; and

(C) there shall be no double-counting of any amount or head of charge to the extent there is
any duplication between amounts payable under the 2012-13 Arrangements and any other
provision of this Agreement.

COMMUNICATIONS

Each Party shall appoint a person as its “Communications Director’ and an alternate on or before
4 April 2012 and shall immediately notify the other Party of such appointments. Either Party may
change the identity of its Communications Director by way of 5 Business Days’ written notice to the
other.

Recipient shall ensure that all corporate communications and announcements to be made by
Recipient or any member of Recipient Group or any Third Party on behalf of Recipient or any
member of Recipient Group, in each case prior to 1 April 2012, shall only be made with the prior
written consent of the Provider's Communications Director.

The Parties acknowledge that their brands impact on each other in the minds of the public, press
and politicians and that they have linked reputational issues.

At the end of each calendar month each Party's Communications Director shall discuss with the
other Party's Communication Director its plan for communications to the public and customers
(‘Communications Plan”) where such communication is relevant to the relationship between the
Parties. Each Communications Director shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in good
time prior to any announcement which is directly relevant to the other Party:

(A) notify the other Party of such announcements;

(B) provide an advance copy of all such announcements, including internal and external
communications and press releases; and

(C) consider in good faith any substantive comments received from the other Party prior to
making such announcement.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 7 shall not prevail over clause 6 of the Mails Distribution
Agreement.

8.6

Recipient shall pay the Charges and all other sums payable by Recipient pursuant to this
Agreement in accordance with this Clause 8.

The Annual Charges payable by Recipient are to be determined and allocated on the basis of, and
in accordance with, Schedule 2 (Charges) and Recipient shall use all reasonable endeavours to
assist Provider in order for Provider to undertake the calculations necessary to determine the
relevant Third Party Costs.

All sums payable by one Party to another Party under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of
all deductions, withholdings or encumbrances whatsoever, save only as may be required by
Applicable Law. If any deductions or withholdings are required by Applicable Law to be made from
any of the sums payable under this Agreement, the payer shall be obliged to pay to the payee such
sum as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the payee with the same
amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a
deduction or withholding.

If the payee receives a credit for or refund of any Tax payable by it or similar benefit by reason of
any deduction or withholding made under Applicable Law then it shall reimburse to the payer such
part of such additional amounts paid to it pursuant to Clause 8.3 above as the payee certifies to the
payer will leave it (after such reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than it would have
been if the payer had not been required to make such deduction or withholding.

Any sum payable under this Agreement by one Party to another Party is exclusive of any amount in
respect of any VAT chargeable on the supply for which that sum is the consideration and,
accordingly:

(A) if anything done by Provider pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
performance by Provider of any of the Services) is a supply on which VAT is chargeable,
Recipient shall pay to Provider, in addition to any amounts otherwise payable under this
Agreement, an amount equal to any VAT so chargeable against delivery of a valid VAT
invoice; and

(B) if anything done by Recipient pursuant to this Agreement is a supply on which VAT is
chargeable and that is made (or, for VAT purposes, treated as made) to a member of
Provider Group, Provider shall pay to Recipient, in addition to any amounts otherwise
payable under this Agreement, an amount equal to any VAT so chargeable against delivery
of a valid VAT invoice.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Clause 8.5 shall have effect both in the case where
anything done by either Party is a supply on which VAT is chargeable at the date of entering into
this Agreement and in the case where anything done by either Party becomes a supply on which
VAT is chargeable only as from a future date, the latter case including (without limitation) where

36
87

8.8

POL00432053
POL00432053

anything so done becomes a supply on which VAT is chargeable in consequence of Provider and
Recipient ceasing, for any reason, to be members of the same group of companies for VAT
purposes.

Unless expressly permitted otherwise under this Agreement, all payments made under this
Agreement shall be made in full without any set-off, restriction, condition and without any deduction
for or on account of any counterclaim.

All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be paid in pounds sterling, and unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Parties, via BACS or an equivalent payment system.

Charging Mechanics Pre Transaction Date

8.9

8.10

The Parties acknowledge that the following are the payment mechanics in place at the date of this.
Agreement in respect of sums due to Provider in connection with the provision of services
equivalent to the Services:

(A) 5 Business Days prior to each accounting period end, Provider raises a charge in respect
of the amounts owing by Recipient in connection with the provision of services equivalent
to the Services and all other trading between Provider Group and Recipient Group (“Inter-
Business Trading’) through Provider's finance system;

(B) on or prior to the second Business Day after each accounting period end, all charges
payable in respect of Inter-Business Trading are set off and any amount owing by one
Party to the other Party is recorded by Provider in the ledger known as the “Internal
Funding Account”; and

(C) on or prior to the tenth Business Day after each financial month end, the net amount owing
by a Party to the other Party is paid using BACS or an equivalent payment system.

The Annual Charges in respect of each month for Services provided from the date of this
Agreement to the Transaction Date and all other Charges payable by Recipient to Provider
pursuant to this Agreement up to the Transaction Date shall be payable in accordance with the
payment mechanics described in Clause 8.9.

With effect from 1 April 2012 up to the Transaction Date, Provider shall provide Recipient with a
summary of the Annual Charges and all other Charges payable by Recipient to Provider pursuant
to this Agreement, together with reasonably supporting documents in respect of the Annual
Charges and such other Charges.

Charging Mechanics Post Transaction Date

8.12

8.13

With effect from the Transaction Date, the Annual Charges and all other Charges payable by
Recipient to Provider pursuant to this Agreement after the Transaction Date shall be payable in
accordance with the payment mechanics described in Clauses 8.1 - 8.8 (inclusive) and Clauses
8.12 - 8.17 (inclusive).

Provider shall provide Recipient with an electronic monthly single invoice not later than 7 days
following the end of each month within a Charging Period in respect of the relevant proportions of

37
8.15

8.17

POL00432053
POL00432053

the Annual Charges to be payable in respect of the relevant month (unless otherwise agreed in
writing by the Parties) and each invoice will represent one of twelve equal portions of the Annual
Charges payable in the Charging Period. The Annual Charges payable in respect of that month
shall be due and payable within 14 days of the date of the invoice, provided Recipient has received
a relevant invoice from Provider.

Subject to Recipient receiving the relevant invoice from Provider, if, other than pursuant to Clause
8.16, Recipient fails to pay an invoice within:

(A) 14 days of the date of the relevant invoice to which the payment relates, the liability of
Recipient shall be increased to include interest on the outstanding balance of such sum
from the initial date on which that sum was due until the date of receipt of payment (both
before and after judgment) at a rate of two (2) per cent per annum above Barclays Bank's
base lending rate at the initial date on which the sum was due;

(B) 20 days of the date of the relevant invoice to which the payment relates, Provider shall
telephone Recipient to remind Recipient payment is due or send Recipient a written
reminder;

(C) 26 days of the date of the relevant invoice to which the payment relates, Provider shall
send Recipient a second written reminder; and

(D) 32 days of the date of the relevant invoice to which the payment relates, Provider shall be
entitled to notify Recipient that it is suspending, or will suspend, the relevant Services (or
part thereof) that are subject of the unpaid amount, provided that such notice sets out the
date such suspension shall take effect (which shall be no earlier than 5 Business Days
from the date of such notice) and, in all cases prior to Provider issuing any such notice, the
Party's respective CEOs shall discuss whether or not such a notice will be issued by
Provider.

If Provider suspends any relevant Services (or part thereof) in accordance with Clause 8.14(D),
Provider may only suspend the relevant Services (or part thereof) from the date set out in such
notice until the date Recipient pays the relevant unpaid amount and any interest that has accrued in

accordance with Clause 8.14(A),

Recipient may only withhold payment in respect of any Charges to the extent that all or such
portion of such Charges are the subject of a bona fide Dispute. In which case, Provider and
Recipient shall utilise the Dispute Resolution Procedures to resolve the matter. Upon settlement of
a Dispute, interest shall be paid on any such disputed amounts which are agreed or finally
determined to be payable at a rate of two (2) per cent per annum above Barclays Bank's base
lending rate from the initial date on which those disputed charges were due in accordance with
Clause 8.13 until the date of receipt of payment.

All sums payable by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, on or after the

Transaction Date, that are not Charges shall be paid within 30 days of the obligor being given an
invoice of such sums by the obligee.

9.1 Any Changes shall be progressed by the Parties through the Change Control Procedure contained
in Schedule 5 (Change Control).

9.2 The Costs of implementing Changes will be chargeable in accordance with Schedule 5 (Change
Control).

10. TERMINATION OF SERVICES
10.1 Subject to Clause 13.1, Clause 13.4 and Clause 13.5 (Service Extensions), and save in respect of

the Finance Services and IT Services, any Services that have not expired or been terminated by
the Long Stop Date shall immediately terminate on that date.

10.2 Subject to Clause 13.4 and Clause 13.5 (Service Extensions), either Party may terminate the
provision or receipt of all of the Finance Services and/or IT Services or one or more of the Finance
Services and/or IT Services on no less than 24 months’ written notice to the other Party (or (a) such
shorter notice period; and/or (b) any part of a Finance Service and/or IT Service, as the MSA.
Management Board may determine in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service
Management)), such notice to be served only after consultation by the MSA Management Board in
accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service Management) and in any event not to expire
prior to 31 May 2014 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.

10.3 Subject to Clauses 10.4, 12.7 and 12.8 (Separation and Recurring Stranded Costs), Recipient
may, with the prior written consent of Provider (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) terminate a Service or part of a Service, other than the Finance Services and IT Services,
for convenience by providing no less than 90 Business Days’ written notice to Provider, or such
longer notice period as Provider may reasonably require.

10.4 __ If Recipient provides a notice to Provider under Clause 10.3, the Parties shall discuss such request
in good faith within 15 Business Days of receipt of the request by Provider and Provider shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to the requested termination (in whole or part), and shall
in any event provide a response to Recipient's request within 15 Business Days following the
Parties’ discussion. Provider shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide Recipient with
details of any elements of the Services which are likely to be affected by the proposed whole or
partial termination of a Service.

10.5 If Provider does not provide its consent to Recipient's notice of termination under Clause 10.3,
Recipient may refer its request for termination to the MSA Management Board. In accordance with
Schedule 3 (Governance and Service Management), the MSA Management Board shall discuss in
good faith and reasonably consider the termination request and shall determine whether or not
Recipient's request for termination should be granted. For the avoidance of doubt, Recipient may
refer its termination request to the MSA Management Board under this Clause 10.5 irrespective of
Provider's reasons for withholding its consent to the termination. If the MSA Management Board:

(A) decides to grant Recipient's request for termination, the relevant Service or Services (or
part thereof) shall terminate on expiry of the notice period set out in Recipient's notice
(provided such period complies with Clause 10.3) or such other period determined by the
MSA Management Board; or

10.6

10.7

POL00432053

(B) decides not to grant Recipient's request for termination or does not reach agreement, the
relevant Service or Services (or part thereof) shall continue until the Service End Date in
respect of the relevant Service.

The Parties acknowledge that it shall not be unreasonable for Provider to withhold its consent to
termination of an IT Service (in whole or part) by Recipient prior to the Service End Date where
Provider reasonably believes the provision of the relevant IT Service is reasonably necessary to
enable Provider to provide any other Service.

The cessation of any Service provision (for whatever reason) shall not prejudice the rights accrued
by either Party up to the date such Service ceased to be provided.

Upon the termination of a Service (or part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Recipient shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Provider, lose any right to have that Service
(or the relevant part) provided to it.

Provider shall not be in breach of this Agreement (or otherwise be liable to Recipient) for any failure
or delay to provide any Service (or part thereof) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by the
termination, expiry or suspension of another Service in whole or part in accordance with this
Agreement, other than where a Service is terminated by Provider in accordance with Clauses 20.4
or 20.6 (Contracts and Consents) or by Recipient in accordance with Clause 11.3 (Term of this
Agreement), provided that Provider shall:

(A) give Recipient, to the extent reasonably practicable, prompt written notice of the effects it
anticipates that termination, expiry or suspension (as the case may be) of a Service (in
whole or part) is likely to have on the provision of the Services and/or the ability of Provider
to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and

(B) despite such termination, expiry or suspension (as the case may be) of a Service (in whole
or part), use its reasonable endeavours to continue to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to mitigate the adverse consequences (including its own costs) of
termination of a Service (in whole or part) without any obligation to incur additional cost or
use additional resources.

In the case of suspension of a Service (in whole or part), the relief from liability under this Clause
10.9 shall last for the duration of such suspension only.

Provider shall not be in breach of this Agreement (or otherwise be liable to Recipient) for any failure
or delay to provide any Service (or part thereof) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by
termination of another Service in whole or part by Provider in accordance with Clauses 20.4 or 20.6
(Contracts and Consents) or by Recipient in accordance with Clause 11.3 (Term of this Agreement),
provided that Provider shall:

(A) give Recipient, to the extent reasonably practicable, prompt written notice of the effects it
anticipates that termination of a Service (in whole or part) is likely to have on the provision
of the Services and/or the ability of Provider to perform its obligations under this
Agreement; and

(B) despite such termination of a Service (in whole or part) by Provider or Recipient (as the
case may be), use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform its obligations under
this Agreement (including provision of any Services which may be impacted by the
termination of such Service) and to mitigate the adverse consequences of termination of
such Service (in whole or part).

TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT

This Agreement shall commence on the date of this Agreement and shall automatically terminate
on the date that the last of the Services (or part thereof) terminates or expires in accordance with
this Agreement.

breach is capable of remedy, the Party in breach has failed to remedy the breach within 30
Business Days of receiving notice requiring it to do so.

Recipient shall have the right to terminate a Service by providing 20 Business Days’ notice to
Provider where Provider is in Persistent Breach of a Service and either such breach is not capable
of remedy or, if the breach is capable of remedy, Provider has failed to remedy the breach within 30
Business Days of receiving notice requiring it to do so. For the purposes of this Clause 11.3,
“Persistent Breach of a Service” means a material breach by Provider of its obligation to provide
a Service in accordance with this Agreement or breaches of Provider's obligation to provide a
Service in accordance with this Agreement that are repeated sufficiently often to have a material
adverse impact on the business of Recipient.

Provider shall have the right to terminate a Service (or part thereof) by providing 20 Business Days’
notice to Recipient where there is a Recipient Service Persistent Breach and either such breach is
not capable of remedy or, if the breach is capable of remedy, Recipient has failed to remedy the
breach within 30 Business Days of receiving notice requiring it to do so. For the purposes of this
Clause 11.4, “Recipient Service Persistent Breach” means a material breach by Recipient of an
obligation under this Agreement which is directly related to a Service (or part thereof) or breaches
by Recipient of an obligation under this Agreement that is repeated sufficiently often to have a
material adverse impact on Provider's ability to provide the relevant Service (or part thereof).

Without prejudice to Clauses 17.8 and 17.9 (Liability), if Provider provides as part of a Service any
advice or recommendation, or any Tax Services, which are fraudulent or negligent or in wilful
default of this Agreement, Recipient is entitled to terminate the relevant part of such Service or Tax
Services (as the case may be) by providing 20 Business Days’ notice to Provider.

A Party (the “Solvent Party”) may by notice to the other Party (the “Insolvent Party”) terminate this
Agreement with immediate effect in the event that the Insolvent Party becomes Insolvent unless:

(A) the Insolvent Party has notified the Solvent Party immediately on becoming aware that it is
Insolvent;

(B) the Insolvent Party continues to comply with all of its obligations under or pursuant to this
Agreement;

(C) the Insolvent Party puts in place arrangements satisfactory to the Solvent Party relating to
the settlement of all amounts outstanding as between the Parties including where required
by the Solvent Party putting in place trust or other security arrangements satisfactory to the
Solvent Party that ensure that the Solvent Party has security over any amounts that are
held by the Insolvent Party for the Solvent Party prior to settlement of such amounts; and

(D) an Insolvency Practitioner has not and does not seek to exercise any statutory right to
amend, repudiate or otherwise alter any provision of this Agreement or this Agreement as a
whole,

in which case this Agreement shall continue unless and until:

(i) any of the circumstances in Clauses 11.6(B) to 11.6(D) above cease to apply, in
which case the Solvent Party may by notice to the Insolvent Party terminate this
Agreement with immediate effect; or

(il) this Agreement otherwise terminates or expires in accordance with its terms.

The termination of this Agreement (for whatever reason) shall not prejudice the rights of either Party
accrued up to the date of termination.

Termination or expiry of this Agreement shall not affect either of the Party’s accrued rights or
liabilities or affect the coming into force or the continuance in force of any provision which is
expressly or by implication intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination,
including this Clause 11.8 and the following Clauses: 1, 12, 18 (insofar as it relates to Third
Party Loss suffered during the term of this Agreement), 22, 26.4(B), 27.5(B), 31, 33 to 45 and 48.

SEPARATION AND RECURRING STRANDED COSTS

Schedule 7 (Recurring Stranded Costs) identifies an amount in respect of: (i) Shared Sites,
premises, land and property which Recipient Group ceases to receive the benefit of; and (ii) each
Service, which it is estimated Provider Group will incur as Recurring Stranded Costs.

Save where otherwise provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties,
each Party shall bear its own Separation Costs.

Provider shall bear all Recurring Stranded Costs up to a total amount of fifteen million pounds
(£15,000,000) in respect of each Charging Period (the “Annual Stranded Costs Cap"). Any
Recurring Stranded Costs in respect of Shared Sites, premises, land and property which Recipient
Group ceases to receive the benefit of in excess of £1,500,000 shall not be included within the
Annual Stranded Costs Cap.

Subject to the other provisions in this Clause 12, Provider and Recipient shall bear equally any
Recurring Stranded Costs in excess of the Annual Stranded Costs Cap in a Charging Period.

Subject to Clauses 12.7, 12.9, 12.10 and 12.11, in respect of each Service or part of a Service
which terminates or expires (as the case may be), only those Recurring Stranded Costs which are
incurred by Provider within a 24 month period from the first day of the Quarter immediately after the
date the relevant Service, or part thereof, terminates (for whatever reason) or expires shall count

42
POL00432053
POL00432053

towards the Annual Stranded Costs Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Recurring Stranded
Costs are incurred by Provider after the 24" month from the first day of the Quarter immediately
after the date of the relevant Service, or part thereof, terminates or expires, all such Recurring
Stranded Costs shall be borne by Provider regardless of whether or not the Annual Stranded Costs
Cap has been exceeded.

12.6 _ Recipient may, by providing written notice to Provider, request an estimate of the additional Costs
referred to in Clauses 12.7, 12.9 and 12.11 (“Estimate Notice’). If the Estimate Notice is in relation
to the additional Costs referred to in Clause 12.7, the Estimate Notice shall specify the Service that
Recipient wishes to terminate, the date that Recipient wishes to terminate such Service and such
other information as Provider may reasonably request. Provider shall provide such estimate to
Recipient in writing no later than 15 Business Days after the date of the Estimate Notice.

Service End Date for such Service; and
(B) pay any:
(i) Third Party Costs;
(il) increased Costs payable or to be paid by Provider, or a member of Provider
Group, to a Third Party in accordance with a Contract as a result of a change to
volume discounts in respect of goods and/or services provided by that Third Party

Service terminating; and
(iii) termination fees or payments payable to a Third Party Provider and incurred by a
member of Provider Group in accordance with the terms of any Contracts which
relate to the Service which is terminated,
which are actually incurred by Provider and which Provider would not have incurred but for
termination of the Service (or part thereof) prior to the Service End Date.
12.8 If the circumstances outlined in Clause 12.7 arise:

A) the total amount of the Internal Charges paid by Recipient from the start of the Quarter
immediately after the termination date of the Service until the Service End Date under
Clause 12.7(A) shall be subtracted from the Recurring Stranded Costs in relation to such
Service (or part thereof) when calculating the Recurring Stranded Costs that count towards
the Annual Stranded Costs Cap for the relevant Charging Period; and

(B) any Incremental Recurring Stranded Costs shall count towards the Annual Stranded Costs
Cap.

Recipient unreasonably withholding or delaying its approval to the proposed Cost of Provider
obtaining a Third Party Consent in accordance with Clause 16 (Third Party Consents), earlier than

remedies:

Subject to Clause 13.2, and without prejudice to Clauses 13.4 and 13.5, in the event that a Service
expires or is terminated, other than in accordance with Clauses 10.3 or 10.4 (Termination of
Services), or Clauses 20.10 or 20.11 (Contracts), and it is not reasonably practicable for Recipient
to migrate away from the affected Service immediately upon such expiry or termination then,

46
13.2

13.3

13.4

POL00432053
POL00432053

following receipt of a written request from Recipient, Provider shall agree (subject to the terms of
this Agreement) to extend the provision of the Service for up to a 6 month period beyond the date
when the Service would otherwise have expired or been terminated provided (unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Parties) that no Service End Date may be extended beyond the Long Stop
Date (save in respect of the IT Services and Finance Services in respect of which there shall be no
extension save in the circumstances described in Clause 13.7(A) - 13.7(C)).

Clause 13.1 is subject to the following:

(A) Recipient shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange for the provision of the Service in
any other way other than through the operation of this Agreement; and

(B) the monthly Internal Charges for the relevant Service shall be amended from the beginning
of such extension so that Recipient pays Provider an amount equal to 130 per cent. of the
monthly Internal Charges for that Service immediately prior to the extension and such
Charges shall be calculated on the basis that the Service was provided for all of the
relevant Quarter notwithstanding that the relevant Service was only extended for part of the
relevant Quarter.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that Recipient's ability to migrate away from each Service
depends on Provider’s, any other member of Provider Group's and any Provider Personnel’s (each
a “Provider Entity”) performance of its respective obligations set out in the Separation Plans and
this Agreement and any Third Party Provider's performance of its obligations set out in the
Separation Plans (the “Provider Dependencies’).

Recipient shall give Provider's representative on the Business Sponsors Board prompt written
notice of:

(A) any material failure by any Provider Entity to comply with any Provider Dependencies; or

(B) any material delay in fulfilling any Provider Dependencies to the extent such material delay
is directly caused by a delay by any Provider Entity to comply with any Provider
Dependencies (“Provider Delay");

of which it becomes aware and which has or is reasonably likely to have an effect on the ability of
Recipient to migrate away from the affected Service upon an expiry or termination of such Service.
If Recipient's inability to migrate away from the affected Service upon such expiry or termination will
be caused or contributed to by such failure or delay (as applicable), the Service End Date or
termination date (as applicable) for the affected Service shall automatically be extended (subject to
the terms of this Agreement) for a period of time equivalent to the period of the delay caused by the
relevant failure or delay (each a “Provider Extension Period”), in which case:

(i) Clause 13.2(B) shall not apply in respect of the provision of the affected Service during the
relevant Provider Extension Period;

(ii) to the extent that the Provider Extension Period results in an expiry date which is later than
the Long Stop Date, the Long Stop Date shall be extended until such date; and

(ili) Recipient shall use reasonable endeavours to migrate away from the affected Service as
soon as reasonably practicable.

A Party may, at any time, request an extension to any Service End Date and/or the Long Stop Date
(other than in accordance with Clause 13.1) by providing a notice to the MSA Management Board
in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service Management) and the relevant Service
End Date and/or the Long Stop Date shall, if the members of the MSA Management Board agree
that the relevant Service and/or the Long Stop Date should be extended, be extended by the period
of time determined by the MSA Management Board in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance
and Service Management).

If the Transaction Date has occurred and Provider is still providing any IT Services and/or Finance
Services after 31 March 2015, Provider shall be entitled to increase the Internal Charges for any
such IT Services and/or Finance Services to reflect market rates. In these circumstances, the MSA
Management Board shall determine (in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service
Management)) the level of the increase to the Internal Charges, which shall not be more than 130%
of the then current Internal Charges for any such IT Services and/or Finance Services.

Clause 13.6 shall not apply if:

(A) a notice to terminate an IT Service or Finance Service (as the case may be) pursuant to
Clause 10.2 (Termination of Services) does not take effect immediately in accordance with
Clause 14.8 (Separation Plans) and as a result the relevant IT Service or Finance Service
is still being provided by Provider after 31 March 2015;

(B) as part of a Detailed Separation Plan, the Parties agree that the relevant IT Service or
Finance Service cannot be terminated by 31 March 2015; or

(C) the Parties otherwise agree an extension to the Service End Date for an IT Service or
Finance Service (as the case may be).

Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing or, in respect of Clause 13.5, unless otherwise
determined by the MSA Management Board, any Service provided through the operation of Clause
13.1, Clause 13.4 or Clause 13.5 shall be provided on the same terms (other than as provided in
Clause 13.2, Clause 13.4 and Clause 13.6) as it was provided prior to its expiry or termination.

SEPARATION PLANS

The Parties acknowledge that it is their intention that this Agreement should not operate as a
permanent arrangement for the supply of the Services and that the Parties shall work together in
good faith, and Provider shall provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to facilitate the
smooth migration of Recipient Group away from the reliance upon Provider for the provision of
each Service upon the termination or expiry of each Service and the separation of each of their
respective Group's businesses (“Separation”) in accordance with this Clause 14.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that Provider's ability to migrate away from the provision of

each Service depends on Recipient's, any other member of the Recipient Group's and any
Recipient Personnel's performance of its respective obligations set out in the Separation Plans and

48
14.3

14.4

14.5

14.6

14.7

POL00432053
POL00432053

this Agreement and any Recipient Third Party provider's performance of its obligations set out in
the Separation Plans.

Each Party shall appoint (and will notify the other Party with contact details of) an overall separation
project director (the “Separation Project Director’) who shall be a senior employee of the relevant
Party and who shall have responsibility for the overall Separation arrangements for that Party
together with, in the case of Recipient, the Procurement Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, each Separation Project Director will, in accordance with
the timeframes specified in Clause 14.5, work with the other to develop:

(A) a plan for Separation from all Services save for the Finance Services and IT Services (the
“General Separation Plan’) with a view to Separation of such Services occurring as soon
as reasonably possible having regard to the objective of the Parties to mitigate and reduce
Costs incurred in connection with Separation as far as reasonably possible;

(B) a high level plan for Separation of the Finance Services and IT Services and any finance or
IT elements of Services other than the Finance Services and IT Services (“High Level
Finance and IT Separation Plan’);

(C) a detailed plan for Separation of the relevant Finance Service and/or IT Service with a view
to Separation of the relevant Finance Service and/or IT Service occurring within 24 months
of the date of service of the relevant notice pursuant to Clause 10.2 or such longer period
as may be determined in accordance with Clause 14.8 (a “Detailed Separation Plan’).

The Separation Project Directors shall agree the Separation Plans as soon as practicable and, in
any event, shall agree:

(A) the General Separation Plan within 80 days of the date of this Agreement.

(B) the High Level Finance and IT Separation Plan within 6 months of the date of this
Agreement; and

(C) a Detailed Separation Plan in respect of the relevant Finance Service and/or IT Service
within six (6) months of service of a notice by either Party to terminate a Finance Service
or IT Service pursuant to Clause 10.2.

If the Separation Project Directors do not agree the relevant Separation Plan by the relevant dates
specified in Clause 14.5, then the Business Sponsors Board shall use all reasonable endeavours to
agree the relevant Separation Plan within 10 Business Days of the matter being referred to it.

If the Business Sponsors Board does not agree the relevant Separation Plan by the dates specified
in Clause 14.6, then the issue shall be escalated to the MSA Management Board which shall use
all reasonable endeavours to agree the relevant Separation Plan within 20 Business Days of the
matter being referred to it and thereafter shall be escalated in accordance with Schedule 3
(Governance and Service Management) and thereafter in accordance with the dispute resolution
procedure set out in Clauses 43.5 to 43.10 (Dispute Resolution), Clause 44 (Arbitration) and
Clause 45 (Conduct of Disputes).

POL00432053
POL00432053

14.8 If a Party serves notice to terminate a Finance Service and/or IT Service in accordance with Clause
10.2 (Termination of Services) and the other Party reasonably considers that a notice period longer
than 24 months is required in respect of Separation of the relevant Finance Service and/or IT
Service, it shall escalate the issue to the MSA Management Board within 20 Business Days of
receipt of the notice and the notice shall not, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, take
effect until the issue has been resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set out
in Clauses 43.5 to 43.10 (Dispute Resolution), Clause 44 (Arbitration) and Clause 45 (Conduct of
Disputes).

14.9 Without prejudice to Clauses 13.3 (Service Extensions) and 14.2 (Separation Plans), if at any time
during the term of this Agreement either Party envisages that:

(A) any stage of the relevant Separation Plan may not be completed by the date required by
the Separation Plan; or

(B) Separation in respect of a Finance Service and/or IT Service may not be achieved by the
date a notice served pursuant to Clause 10.2 is due to expire,

it shall notify the other Party immediately and the Separation Project Directors and the TSA Drivers
shall meet to discuss any amendments or adjustments to the relevant Separation Plan as may be
necessary, including if agreed an extension of the period for Separation of the relevant Service, and
otherwise to escalate any issues in accordance with Schedule 3 (Governance and Service
Management).

14.10 Each General Separation Plan and Detailed Separation Plan shall (to the extent relevant):
(A) adhere to the Separation Principles in Paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 (Separation); and
(B) shall include a plan for separating each Service.

14.11 The Separation Project Director appointed by each Party shall be:
(A) authorised to agree variations in respect of the Separation Plans; and
(B) generally available to discuss any aspect of the Separation Plans.

14.12 The Parties shall perform their respective obligations set out in each Separation Plan.

Data Migration

14.13 Data extraction and migration shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, be performed as part
of the Separation of the IT Services and the relevant Detailed Separation Plans shall:

(A) provide for and address the assistance to be provided by Provider in connection with the
extraction and migration of Migration Data from Provider's IT Systems to Recipient's IT

Systems; and

(B) detail appropriate timelines in respect of each Party's activities to extract and migrate the
Migration Data related to the IT Service. Provider agrees that such timelines shall provide

50
14.14

14.15

14.16

14.17

POL00432053
POL00432053

for extraction of the relevant Migration Data to allow Recipient a reasonable period in
which to migrate the Migration Data onto its IT Systems and perform sufficient testing of
the Migration Data on its IT Systems prior to the expiry of the relevant IT Service.

Recipient may request Provider to provide reasonable assistance and cooperation in relation to the
extraction and migration of Migration Data in respect of the Separation of any Service which is not
an IT Service prior to the termination or expiry of such Service. If Provider agrees (such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to provide such assistance and cooperation, the
timelines to extract and migrate the relevant Migration Data shall be agreed in the General
Separation Plan in respect of such Service. If Provider does not agree to provide the assistance
and cooperation requested by Recipient, Recipient may refer the matter to the MSA Management
Board to determine whether Provider shall provide the assistance and cooperation requested by
Recipient in respect of extracting and migrating the relevant Migration Data relating to the Service.
It shall not be unreasonable for Provider not to agree to provide assistance and cooperation in
connection with the migration of data pursuant to this Clause 14.14 where such assistance and
cooperation would require Provider to engage the provision of services or assistance from a Third
Party.

Provider shall in accordance with the relevant Detailed Separation Plan provide reasonable
assistance and cooperation:

(A) in relation to the extraction and migration from Provider's IT Systems to Recipient's IT
Systems of:

(i) Recipient Data; and

(ii) any other data which relates to Recipient's business and which Recipient is not
prohibited from using under the Mails Distribution Agreement,

to the extent such data is not already on Recipient's IT System (“Migration Data”); and

(B) including providing information (to the extent reasonably practicable) in relation to:
(i) the Services; and
(ii) the format of the Migration Data which will be migrated to Recipient's IT Systems

pursuant to this Clause 14.
Provider shall, at its own Cost, extract Migration Data from Provider's IT Systems in
accordance with the relevant Detailed Separation Plan and Recipient shall bear all other Costs
associated with the migration of such Migration Data from Provider's IT System to Recipient's
IT System.

As part of Separation of an IT Service, the Parties will provide each other with information in
relation to:

(A) the operation of the Parties’ IT Systems and interfaces between the IT Systems; and

(B) the manner in which Recipient uses Provider's IT Systems.

Agreement shall not be liable to pay any Costs to the relevant member of Provider Group
in connection with the termination of such Current Official Mail Services Agreement

pursuant to this Clause 15.1(B).

Agreement, including Clause 8 (Charges) and Schedule 2 (Charges).

16.5 If a Third Party Consent is refused, terminated or revoked, the Party which receives notice of such
refusal, termination or revocation shall notify the other Party in writing as soon as it becomes aware

Party to refuse to grant or to terminate or revoke any Third Party Consent.

16.7 Provider makes no representation or warranty, whether express or implied, as to whether any Third
Party Consent can be obtained or maintained for the purposes of this Agreement. Subject to its
obligations in this Clause 16, Provider shall not be in breach of this Agreement (or be otherwise

member of Provider Group (whether or not in respect of the Services and whether before or after
the date of this Agreement), Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees (for itself and on behalf of
the members of Recipient Group) that it shall do so at its own risk and that no member of Provider
Group shall be liable for any loss, damage, Costs or proceedings arising therefrom.

If Provider provides as part of a Service any advice or recommendation, or any Tax Services, which
are fraudulent or negligent or in wilful default of this Agreement, Provider shall reimburse Recipient
an amount which is equivalent to a reasonable estimate of the proportion of the Internal Charges
which Recipient paid in respect of the relevant part of such Service or Tax Services (as the case
may be). Recipient’s right to a reimbursement under this Clause 17.9 and its right to terminate the
relevant part of such Service or Tax Services under Clause 11.5 (Term of this Agreement) are its
sole and exclusive remedies in respect of the provision of such advice, recommendation or Tax
Services by Provider.

Subject to Clause 17.1 and Clause 17.3 and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the
maximum aggregate liability of each Party (and its Group) arising under or in relation to this
Agreement (whether in contract (including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence), under
statute or otherwise) shall, in respect of all claims made in any Contract Year, not exceed one
hundred per cent. (100%) of the Internal Charges paid under this Agreement during the Contract
Year immediately preceding the date of the event giving rise to the relevant claim (or if such claim is
made in the first 12 months of the term of this Agreement, the Internal Charges that have been paid
shall be increased by a pro-rata amount to create a 12 month Internal Charge solely for the
purposes of calculating the liability cap under this Clause 17.10).

In assessing whether a Party's limit of liability set out in Clause 17.10 has been met or exceeded,
no account shall be taken of amounts recovered or recoverable in respect of the types of liability or
losses referred to in Clause 17.3.

Each Party has a duty to mitigate (and, to the extent applicable, procure that its Personnel and/or
members of its Group mitigate) the damages and losses that would otherwise be recoverable from
the other Party (or members of Provider Group or Recipient Group, and/or Personnel, as
applicable) pursuant to this Agreement (including under any indemnity) by taking appropriate and
commercially reasonable actions to reduce or limit the amount of such damages or losses.

17.13 Provider shall be entitled, without liability, to suspend the provision of any or all Services in order
that emergency maintenance work be performed on the IT Systems of Provider or Recipient or any
member of their respective Groups, provided that Provider shall provide Recipient with written
notice as soon as Provider becomes aware of any emergency maintenance work which it considers
will or is reasonably likely to lead to suspension of the provision of any Services in accordance with
this Clause 17.13.

17.14 Subject to Clause 17.1 but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Provider shall not
be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable to Recipient for any damages, liabilities or Costs
incurred or losses suffered by Recipient in connection with any claim that any goods or services
have been procured in breach of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, save where Recipient has
suffered or incurred any damages, liabilities, losses or Costs in connection with any such claim in
circumstances where Provider, any other member of Provider Group or Royal Mail Holdings plc
has expressly overruled Recipient's decision in relation to award of a contract to a specific Third
Party or has required Recipient to procure goods or services for Recipient Group's benefit under a
contract in Provider's name

18. LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS

18.1 If Recipient suffers a loss as a result of a breach of a Contract by a Third Party Provider, ("Third
Party Loss") Provider shall, subject to Clauses 18.3 and 18.5, reimburse Recipient an amount
which is equivalent to such Third Party Loss to the extent that Provider would have a contractual
right to recover the Third Party Loss had such loss been suffered by Provider.

18.2 Provider may, in its sole discretion, elect:
(A) to seek to recover the Third Party Loss from the Third Party Provider; or

(B) not to seek to recover the Third Party Loss from the Third Party Provider. (For the
avoidance of doubt, an election by Provider not to seek to recover the Third Party Loss
from the Third Party Provider does not relieve Provider of its obligation to reimburse
Recipient in accordance with Clause 18.1.)

18.3 Recipient shall provide Provider with a breakdown of the Third Party Loss and shall give all
information and assistance reasonably required by Provider in order for Provider to determine
whether or not to seek recovery from the Third Party Provider for such Third Party Loss, and/or in
support of any negotiations, action or proceedings with the relevant Third Party Provider in respect
of recovery of such Third Party Loss.

18.4 If Provider elects to seek to recover the Third Party Loss from the relevant Third Party Provider
under Clause 18.2(A), subject to Clause 18.5:

(A) Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all Costs incurred by Provider in respect of such
claim, subject to Provider complying with its obligation set out in Clause 18.6(B)(i); and

(B) the amount to be reimbursed to Recipient under Clause 18.1 shall be equivalent to the
amount recovered by Provider from the Third Party Provider and shall only be payable
after the action against the Third Party Provider is finally concluded either via a binding
settlement agreement or a judicial determination from which there is no right of appeal or in

57
POL00432053
POL00432053

) respect of which the Third Party Provider does not lodge an appeal within six weeks. To
the extent an appeal subsequently lodged by the Third Party Provider against a judicial
determination is successful, Recipient shall reimburse Provider for any sums payable to
the Third Party Provider by Provider as a result of such appeal.

18.5 Where proceedings or an action is taken by Provider in respect of both a Third Party Loss suffered
by Recipient and losses suffered by Provider as a result of a breach of a Contract by a Third Party
Provider, Recipient and Provider shall:

(A) consult in relation to the conduct of negotiations and proceedings against the relevant
Third Party Provider;

i

I (B) share a just and equitable proportion of any Costs incurred in connection with such action;

and

I

J (C) share a just and equitable proportion of any sum recovered from the relevant Third Party

i Provider which shall be in proportion to the respective loss suffered by Provider and
Recipient.

In the absence of agreement, the proportion of Costs and sum recovered (as the case may be)
shall be determined using the dispute resolution mechanism set out in Clause 43 (Dispute
Resolution). Save where Clause 18.2(B) applies, Provider will not settle or compromise any claim
without Recipient's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

18.6 Where proceedings or an action taken by Provider relates solely to a Third Party Loss suffered by
Recipient:

j (A) Recipient shall, at Provider's request and Recipient's Cost, where permitted, assume
conduct of any such action or proceedings, including substitution of Provider as a party to
any such action or proceedings, provided that Provider shall give Recipient all reasonable
assistance required by Recipient in support of any such conduct; and

(B) Provider shall:

I (i) save where Clause 18.6(A) applies, keep Recipient fully informed of its progress
in conducting such action or proceedings and all Costs incurred and estimates of
Costs that Provider expects to incur in conducting such action or proceedings;

(il) save where Clause 18.6(A) applies, conduct any such action or proceedings,
and/or negotiations for the settlement such action or proceedings, as though
Provider itself (and/or any member of Provider Group) had suffered the Third Party
Loss; and

(ili) not settle or compromise any such action or proceedings without Recipient's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

18.7. Save where Clause 18.6(A) applies, Provider shall have the sole right to bring and control any
action or proceedings against any Third Party Provider.

19.3

POL00432053
POL00432053

The remedies specified in this Clause 18 shall be Recipient's sole and exclusive remedy in respect
of any failure, delay or other problem in connection with any Service (or any part thereof) or any
other breach of this Agreement caused by the act or omission of a Third Party Provider and
Provider shall not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable to Recipient to the extent of
such failure, delay or other problem.

EVENT OF FORCE MAJEURE

A Party (“Affected Party”) shall not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable to the other
Party (“Other Party”) for a delay in performing or failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed in performing that obligation by
an Event of Force Majeure provided that the Affected Party, to the extent practicable:

(A) gives written notice to the Other Party as soon as reasonably practicable on becoming
aware of the Event of Force Majeure, such notice to contain the following information:

(i) details of the Event of Force Majeure that has occurred;

(ii) the date from which the Event of Force Majeure has prevented or hindered the
Affected Party in the compliance of its obligations under this Agreement,

(iii) the obligations under this Agreement which are affected; and

(iv) its best estimate of the date upon which it will be able to resume the performance
of the affected obligations hereunder; and

(B) provides at reasonable intervals updated information to the Other Party on the status of the
Event of Force Majeure and the steps taken to resume full performance of its obligations;
and

(C) mitigates the consequences of the Event of Force Majeure;

Notwithstanding the generality of Clause 19.1 above, Provider agrees to maintain business
continuity plans in all material respects equivalent to the scope and standard to which business
continuity plans were maintained in the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement and Provider
shall not be able to rely on Clause 19.1 to the extent the failure to comply with this Agreement
results from a failure to maintain business continuity plans in all material respects equivalent to the
scope and standard to which business continuity plans were maintained in the 12 months prior to
the date of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a Service that is provided
under a Contract is prevented from being provided or is materially affected by an Event of Force
Majeure and Provider is not obliged to pay or is not paying any Third Party Costs under the relevant
Contract during an Event of Force Majeure, Recipient shall not be obliged to pay the related Third
Party Costs for the same period of time as Provider's obligation is suspended under such Contract.

CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

Where a Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) is, pursuant to this Agreement, required to indemnify the

to conduct any litigation and negotiations for the settlement of the claim. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to take a decision within this period, it will be deemed to have decided not to
conduct any such litigation or negotiations.

If the Indemnifying Party decides to conduct any litigation or negotiations, it shall do so at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance

(A) by the other Party, the other Party's Personnel or any relevant Third Party Provider for the
purpose of performing or receiving the whole or part of the Services; or

(B) by the other Party or the other Party's Personnel, for the purpose of verifying or carrying
out an audit of any of the Charges or other Costs payable under this Agreement, provided

If within 15 Business Days of being referred to the MSA Management Board the Dispute has not
been resolved in writing then it shall be referred to the CEOs of the Parties.

If within 15 Business Days of being referred to the CEOs of the Parties, the Dispute has not been

the Dispute by mediation and either the mediation has terminated or the other Party has failed to
participate in the mediation, provided that the right to issue proceedings is not prejudiced by a
delay.

In the event the mediation fails then the Dispute shall be settled through the operation of Clause
44.1 (Arbitration).

the Parties.

discussions and the proposals made by each Party in relation to the Dispute.

ARBITRATION

All Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the
rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by arbitrators appointed in
accordance with the said rules.

The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators to be appointed in accordance with the rules of the
Icc.

The place of arbitration shall be London.

The Parties agree that in so far as any provision contained in the ICC Rules relates to the
nationality of any arbitrator(s) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Articles 9(1) and 9(5) of the

providing the Services. Such proportion shall be determined based on the proportion of
Recipient Group’s anticipated use of a Service relating to such Change as it relates to the

relevant Service and the service provided to members of Provider Group which are
16.

equivalent to the Services and the period of time that Recipient is receiving a Service in
relation to such Change.

just and equitable proportion of: (i) the Costs of assessing and/or implementing such
Mandatory Change; and (ii) any increase in the Costs (if any) incurred by Provider in
providing the Services as a result of the Change. Such proportions shall be determined
based on the proportion of Recipient Group's use of the Mandatory Change as it relates
to the overall anticipated use by Provider Group and Recipient Group (taken together) of
such Mandatory Change and the period of time that Recipient is receiving a Service in
relation to such Mandatory Change.

Notes

POL00432053
POL00432053
For the purpose of the analysis above, all internal business rent charges have been
based upon the 2011/12 budgets.

All leasehold property transfers will be subject to a legal review of the lease
documentation to ensure that these properties are capable of being appropriately divided.

Separation Works

.

Whilst any shared premises are being used by POL and RM it is not proposed that the
separation works are carried out

If either party vacates their portion of the property it will be that party's responsibility and
at their cost to carry out immediately on vacation those works identified in the Separation
surveys under the “Mothballing” option to ensure the safe and secure trading of the other
party from their respective premises.

Prior to the completion of any disposal by sale or letting of the vacated premises that
party will fully carry out at their sole cost the preferred solution for Separation Works as
identified in the relevant Separation survey.

Informal Occupations

POL currently has circa 220 admin personnel who regularly work from, or are based in
RM properties. There are also a number of Counter Training Schools within RM premises
and usage of storage space and meeting rooms. These are informal occupations that are
not recognised on the property database. For the duration of the MSA it is agreed that the
existing arrangements will remain in place. Before the expiry of the MSA POL will make
arrangements and move all of their personnel out of these properties unless a formal
occupancy can be set up and the area POL personnel occupied can be made self
contained from the RM areas. RM to endeavour to create self contained rental units for
POL whereupon POL will pay RM a Market Rent for these rental units

Rack Rented Leasehold Premises

There are 4 standalone properties currently occupied by MSPO’s. In each of these cases
POL will take an assignment of RM’s leasehold interest subject to and with the benefit of
the existing lease to the MSP.

In the case of shared sites POL will take an underlease on terms in line with the agreed
Template lease including tenants only break option at the 5" year, but to reflect where
necessary the terms of RM’s Headlease. Where the Post Office occupancy is by way of
an MSP POL's underlease will reflect the terms of the MSP lease and will be subject to
and with the benefit of the MSP lease.

General

POL and RM will each bear their own legal costs in relation to all of the above matters
save for those reasonable legal costs which shall be borne by RM incurred where
operational premises may subsequently be reprovided in the circumstances referred to
above and as described in Categories 3, 6 and 7..

Itis intended that all the initial transfers will take place under a Transfer Scheme under
the Postal Services Act 2011 to take effect from the beginning of the 2012/2013 financial
year.

Gross Sale Proceeds

Less fees on disposal

Less acquisition fees for new Post Office
Less fit out costs for new Post Office

Less NPV of 10 years rent on new Post Office
Less acquisition fees for new Delivery Office
Less fit out costs for new Delivery Office

Less redundancy and excess travel and disturbance costs for both RM and
POL staff

= Net Sale Proceeds to be divided between RM and POL in line with the
latest valuation of the Post Office compared with the value of the rest of the
site

NB In the scenario re Windsor where there would be 2 DO’s moved into the
new facility the amount of fit out costs applied to the calculation above would
be a proportion of the total costs being the ratio of the GIA of the Windsor DO
to the combined GIA of both DO’s moving into the new premises. For the
avoidance of doubt, the sale proceeds of the second DO will not be attributed
to the calculation.

If the Landlord and the Tenant (or their respective surveyors) shall fail so to consult
or to agree upon the Market Rent by the Review Date (or within such extended

any Incidental expenses incurred from that other party on demand.

The Landlord and the Tenant may at any time before the Market Rent is determined
by the Surveyor settle the amount of the Reviewed Rent.

in accordance with this Schedule, a memorandum specifying the Reviewed Rent shall
be recorded in writing by separate instrument and signed by or on behalf of the
Landlord and the Tenant and shall at all times thereafter be conclusive evidence of
the amount of the yearly rent then payable.

If the Market Rent shall for any reason not have been agreed or determined prior to
the Review Date, the Tenant shall continue to pay rent at the rate payable
immediately prior to the Review Date until the Market Rent shall have been agreed
or determined, and upon the date ("Due Date") 14 days after the date of such
agreement or determination there shall be payable (in addition to any rent then due
and payable at the rate of the Reviewed Rent):

such sum ("Addition") as with the rent already paid for the period from and after the
Review Date down to the Quarter Day following the Due Date will equal the total
amount of the Reviewed Rent payable for that period; and

Addition from the time that it would have become due for payment if the Market
Rent had been agreed or determined prior to the Review Date, to the Due Date.

the rent pursuant to this Schedule or recovering any Reviewed Rent, then the
Landlord may by written notice to the Tenant postpone such Review Date to the first

lawfully recovered, but if the Landlord shall not so require, then the Review Date
shall be that specified in this Lease or as otherwise stipulated or permitted by such
Legislation.

Time is not of the essence in relation to this Schedule.
