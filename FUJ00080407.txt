L Purpose

This PPD describes the operation of the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH), in
accordance with ICL Pathway Core System Release Plus (CSR+).

This PPD provides a description of all the processes involved in order to enable
the contractual agreement of operations and to be a source from which authors
can develop any further user documentation needed.

2 Scope

This PPD contains high-level information on the Horizon System Helpdesk.

For brevity, the Horizon System Helpdesk is referred to in this document as ‘the
HSH’.

This PPD is one of a set of PPDs provided for CSR+. The way in which the set
fits together is described in the CSR+ Introduction PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/o93].

The procedure for the post office staff calling the HSH is described in the CSR+
Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/o97].

3 Overview

The following helpdesk service will be provided by ICL Pathway:

¢ The HSH, which provides Post Office Counters Ltd outlet staff with a single
point of contact for dealing with all problems relating to the Horizon system
procedures and the Horizon system installed in outlets, and also for OBCS
fallback encashments. Additionally it provides a single point of contact for
operational issues concerning the Horizon system from pre-determined
sources within Post Office Counters Ltd. Any calls received which are
inappropriate to this helpdesk may be re-directed to the NBSC (Network
Business Support Centre).

Pathway environment or the data feeds into ICL Pathway from Post Office
Counters Ltd and their clients. It provides a single point of contact for outlet
staff (for the calls described in Section 3 Overview) and ICL Pathway operation
staff. For further information for non-outlet staff and non-ICL staff, see Section
4.3.4 Non-outlet callers to the HSH.

HSH telephone numbery

4.2 HSH service houry

The service hours of the HSH are:

Full Service 0800 - 2000 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0500 - 0800 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 2000 - 2400 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0700 - 2200 Sunday

Arrangements for Bank Holidays shall only vary from a normal POCL working
day where agreed with POCL, having regard to the applicability throughout the
United Kingdom. No HSH service shall be provided on Christmas day.

The full range of HSH services are provided during the POCL core day. During
these hours of operation, all calls will be handled by ICL Pathway operators
with the telephone equipment relaying messages to callers in exceptional
circumstances.

The skeleton service is provided outside of the POCL core day. The skeleton
service will respond to calls concerning operational incidents that are non-
outlet-related. Calls that are outlet-related will be logged. Advice and guidance
calls will be responded to within the skeleton service, but not necessarily
according to the Service Levels that are applicable to the normal service. Other
outlet-related calls will be dealt with at the beginning of the next POCL core
day.

The HSH is available to take and record calls outside the hours shown above,
but diagnosis and action on those calls will not occur until the next defined
period of cover.

4.3 Contacting the HSH

4.3.1 Call volidetiow

The HSH is available to receive calls from any of its authorised sources and will
take calls that are described in Section 5 HSH calls of this PPD.

All callers to the HSH will be subject to initial validation. Callers failing
validation will not gain access to the HSH and the call will be recorded as
inappropriate.

FUJ00080407
FUJ00080407

The validation performed for each call is as follows:

Outlet staff

Verifies the identity of outlet staff by asking questions
based on the post office FAD (Financial Accounts
Division) code, post office address, name and
telephone number.

POCL non-outlet
staff

POCL non-outlet staff are normally filtered through
the NBSC. The NBSC will register a call with the HSH
on behalf of non-outlet staff. TIP (Transaction
Information Processing) and OSG (Outlet Systems
Group) have facilities to log calls direct with the HSH.

Circumstances surrounding when these callers request
a call to be logged on the HSH are described in Section
4.3.5.1 POCL.

NBSC

In cases of emergency closure, NBSC staff are required
to contact the HSH on behalf of an outlet. The NBSC
caller must provide a PATH code, name and telephone
number to enable the HSH to validate the caller. The
HSH will also require the outlet’s FAD and name, and
details of the nature of the incident.

Circumstances surrounding when the NBSC should
contact the HSH are described in Section 4.3.5.2 NBSC.

Password requests

Callers requesting the issue of authorised-user
passwords must contact the NBSC for verification.

They will then be issued with a reference number and
asked to contact the HSH. This process is described
more fully in Section 4.3.3 Authorised-user password
access.

Callers contacting the HSH without verification will be
refused access to the authorised-user password service.

ICL Pathway
suppliers

These groups are provided with a PATH code and will
be subject to the same verification procedures as POCL
non-outlet staff.

Circumstances surrounding when these callers contact
the HSH are described in Section 4.3.5.3 ICL Pathway.

Before calling the HSH, the caller should gather as much information as
possible to enable the HSH operator to diagnose the nature of the problem

swiftly.

4.3.2 Call logging

The operator will attempt to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone call. The information will be recorded as an incident onto a helpdesk
system and allocated a unique call reference number.

At the end of the call the operator will inform the caller of the call identity
number and what action to expect next. This identity number should be
recorded by the caller and quoted if the caller needs to ring the HSH about this
incident.

If the caller’s query/problem is not resolved within the initial telephone call, the
HSH will advise the caller the date/time by which they will next receive contact.
(This contact will take the form of either a site visit by an engineer or a
telephone call from someone in the ICL Pathway support chain.)

4.3.3 Authorised-—user password occesy
There are two types of requirement for authorised-user password access:

¢ Planned, i.e. from POCL Auditors in the case of an Audit visit, or Retail
Network Managers in the case of a planned outlet closure.

¢ Unplanned, i.e. when an outlet manager forgets their password or becomes
locked out of the system by repeated incorrect entry of their password.

The authorised-user password is issued by the HSH once the caller has been
verified by the NBSC.

The caller requiring authorised-user password access will call the NBSC and
obtain verification and a unique reference number. The caller will then call the
HSH quoting this unique reference number and will be asked to perform the
authorised-user password procedure sequence following instructions from the
HSH. This will allow access to the system.

The authorised-user password is valid for one session only. When the caller logs
out, the authorised-user password can no longer be used. Where the caller has
forgotten the password it is a priority for them to set up a new password for
normal use, using the procedures described in the CSR+ ACUA PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/ogo].

The system requires the authorised-user procedure sequence to be completed
within five minutes of being started.
4.3.4 Nov-ovtlet collery to the HSH

The HSH is available to take incident calls from sources other than POCL
outlets. These sources are NBSC, TIP and OSG for POCL operational calls and
from within ICL Pathway.

and Procedures Description
Version: 2.0
Commercial in Confidence Date: 12/09/00

These non-outlet callers will be pre-authorised by the allocation of a dummy
FAD code (PATH code). This PATH code is allocated by ICL Pathway who will
agree the incident types available to be registered via this route.

4.3.5 Nov-outlet call sourcey

4.3.5.1 POCL

POCL incidents affecting the EPOSS (Electronic Point of Sale Service), APS
(Automated Payments Service) or reference data services that arise in the POCL
environment will also be reported to the HSH in accordance with agreed
procedures.

4-3-5.2, NBSC

In the event of an unplanned post office closure, the affected post office will
contact the NBSC and inform them. The NBSC will then contact the HSH on
behalf of the affected post office to register an incident. The NBSC operator will
need to quote the post office FAD code, their name and telephone number and
the nature of the problem (see the CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/o97]. Additionally, NBSC staff will undergo the caller authentication
process which requires them to provide a pre-agreed pass code before the HSH
will activate an emergency closure.

4.3.5.3 ICL Pathway

Incidents arising from within the ICL Pathway operation will result in a call to
the HSH. Callers from within the ICL Pathway operation will also have to pass
the same verification procedure as an outlet by providing a dummy FAD code
or PATH code and name to access the HSH.

4.3.6 Call escalation
Call escalation can be interpreted in three separate ways:
¢ An incident passed through the support chain for resolution.
¢ SLA (Service Level Agreement) targets in jeopardy.

e Acustomer unhappy with the service.

4.3.6.1 Incident passed through the support chain

Once an incident is registered onto the HSH incident management system, it is
likely to be passed along the support chain to different support groups who are
responsible for different areas of the system, e.g. Networks. The HSH staff have
visibility of all incidents and will track progress of the call throughout its life.

4.3.6.2 SLA targets in jeopardy

Should the SLA targets of a particular incident approach or pass minimum SLA
levels, the HSH staff will begin to escalate visibility of this situation, using a
manual escalation process to ensure timely escalation into ICL Pathway, its
supplier, and Post Office Counters Ltd where appropriate.

Commercial in Confidence Date: 12/09/00

This escalation procedure may utilise a problem manager at a predetermined
point. The problem manager will be responsible for ensuring that the correct
management and resources are in place to resolve the problem and restore the
service levels. The problem manager will be supported by an agreed cross-
boundary escalation process that covers the Post Office Counters Ltd and ICL
Pathway organisations, should disputes of ownership and responsibility arise.

4-3-6.3 Customer unhappy with service

The caller’s view of escalation will arise should the caller be unhappy with the
service provided or disagree with the progress or actions taken to resolve a
particular incident. The caller will contact the HSH to register his or her
dissatisfaction. The HSH telephone operator will log a complaint incident and
then pass the caller onto a supervisor. The supervisor will attempt to correct the
situation. If the situation cannot be corrected by the supervisor, the call will be
terminated and the caller will then be contacted by an ICL Pathway manager
within two hours.

All complaint calls will be brought to the attention of ICL Pathway Service
Management and are available to the Service Management Forum if requested.

4.3.7 Inappropriate colly

The HSH may be mistakenly contacted by persons not authorised to use the
HSH. These callers will be unable to pass verification and will be refused access,
an incident call will be recorded on the HSH incident management system.

Should the caller be authorised to contact the HSH and pass verification the
HSH operator will establish the nature of the caller and if the issue is outside of
the responsibility of the HSH the caller will, where applicable, be re-directed to
the correct helpdesk. An incident will be recorded on the HSH incident
management system.

Callers requiring re-direction to another helpdesk will be supplied with the
phone number of the appropriate desk, if known.

4.3.8 Call redirecting

If the HSH receives a call that is not appropriate to the HSH, where possible the
HSH operator will advise the caller to ring the appropriate number. Where
applicable the HSH operator will supply the phone number of the appropriate
desk.

4.3.9 Contingency

In conventional circumstances the HSH service is provided from one site with a
second site being used to deal with overspill at peak times. These sites are
geographically separated, but linked by common computer and telephony
systems. Should the first site become unable to operate, the second site will
take over.

Depending on the nature and extent of the problem, there may be a period of
around two hours during which only a reduced service will be possible.

Incident

Description

Authorised-user
password required

Passwords within an office are controlled by the
manager, and if a member of staff forgets their password
the manager can reset it. If the manager forgets their
password they should contact the NBSC; an emergency
password can then be issued by the HSH using the
authorised-user password procedure to allow them to
reset their own password. Audit staff will also need access
to the system and require use of the authorised-user
service to gain access. Each person authorised to use this
service will be pre-registered and will have to undergo a
verification procedure before access to the authorised-
user service is permitted.

Once verified the caller will be issued with a password
that is valid for only one session and cannot be used
again. (Further information on using authorised-user
passwords is given in the CSR+ Access Control and User
Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/ogo].)

Caller fails initial
verification

Callers who ring the HSH in error and are not authorised
to use the HSH, will be refused access to the HSH and
directed to the NBSC.

Clerk/supervisor
access issue

If clerks/supervisors forget their passwords/get locked
out, the manager can sort it out. Any calls received by
HSH relating to this issue are directed to the NBSC to
have the procedures reinforced and to resolve any issues.

Communication

failed, could not
get security data

Ifa member of outlet staff reports that the system
displayed a message during a POLO procedure to say
that communication with the centre failed and it could
not get new security data, the HSH will establish the
cause of the failure.

e Ifthe outlet is not currently authorised to collect the
security data (for example, because an authorisation
granted by the automated systems has expired), the
HSH will invoke the necessary authorisation (known
as ‘opening the door’). If the HSH are unable to do
this, the incident will be passed into the ICL Pathway
support organisation.

Incident

Description

e Ifthe outlet cannot communicate with the centre via
the WAN, then the HSH will ensure that the
communications problem is resolved.

The HSH may advise the outlet to continue using the old
security data whilst the problem is being resolved.

Equipment stolen

Post offices that have equipment stolen must follow
existing Post Office Counters Ltd procedures to report
the theft (e.g. contact the Police and NBSC). ICL Pathway
will replace the stolen equipment once the incident has
been reported to the HSH by the NBSC. Should the
counter or the ICL Pathway wiring be undamaged, ICL
Pathway will arrange for the counter system to be
installed quickly to bring the post office back into
operation. However work may have to be scheduled to
correct any physical damage: this will be arranged at a
suitable time and agreed with the outlet manager. In
some cases this may result in a short-term closure.

OBCS stop list
enquiry

If the customer wishes to make an OBCS encashment
during a period of system failure, the HSH will ask the
caller for the Customer Reference Number, Order Book
Serial Number and Common Payment Package Number.
The HSH will then check the database and advise the
caller of the following:

¢ Ifthere is no stop in place, to make the encashment.

e Ifthere is a stop in place, not to make any
encashments but to impound the book.

e  Ifthere is a recall in place with the effective date
earlier than today, to encash one valid foil and
impound the book.

e  Ifthere is a recall in place with the effective date of
today or later, to encash valid foils dated prior to and
including today and impound the book.

PMMC or PIN lost

Each time a PC is powered on, the Post Office Log On
(POLO) procedure must be performed. The outlet
manager is issued with a PMMC card plus a spare and
PIN when the equipment is installed. This card and PIN
must be kept in separate secure locations and used when
the equipment is powered on after being switched off as
described in the CSR+ Access Control and User

Incident

Description

Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/ogo].

If the card or PIN is lost, the HSH must be contacted.
The HSH operator will ask a series of questions to verify
the identity of the caller and then pass the caller on toa
supervisor. The supervisor will then assist the outlet
manager to generate a new PIN or allocate a PIN to the
spare card. This process involves the caller following
verbal instructions from the HSH Supervisor. In extreme
cases, where the system cannot generate the PIN easily,
the caller will be taken through the underlying recovery
process that involves typing a 15-character Fallback
Response Code into the Horizon system.

The new PIN must be stored securely as instructed in the
CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/ogo]. In the case of a lost card, this procedure
invalidates the lost card and a replacement card is
ordered for issue to the post office to use as a spare.

If both cards are lost, stolen or damaged, then the system
will be declared down and an engineer dispatched to
replace the cards and bring the system back into
operation. The outlet manager, when completing the
Service Visit Report Card, will declare whether the cards
were lost, stolen or damaged and will surrender any
damaged cards to the engineer.

Security breach

If the outlet manager or Post Office Counters Ltd
representative suspects a security breach, for example,
passwords have become known to an unauthorised
person, the Horizon system has been tampered with or
someone suspects their user name has been used without
their knowledge, the HSH must be informed
immediately. The matter will be escalated according to
ICL Pathway escalation procedures. The caller will be
contacted during this investigation and is advised to
make notes of the circumstances surrounding the
suspected security breach. ICL Pathway may remove any
system access at this point and the post office may be
prevented from using the system until authorisation is
given.

(Further information on security breaches is given in the
CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/ogo] and CSR+ Operating Environment PPD

Software problems can arise in the form of an error
message displayed on the screen or during the use of the
system when something fails to work as expected. Outlet
staff should record any messages appearing on the screen
or details of what activity was being undertaken at the
time of the problem and advise the HSH operator of
these messages and actions. Details of the incident will
be captured by the HSH operators who will determine
the nature of the problem, allocate a call identification
number and inform the caller of the next expected
action.

If the problem has occurred before and has been
previously resolved, the operator will issue instructions to
the caller to perform an authorised temporary procedure
or alternatively the HSH operator may attempt to resolve
the problem by repeating the process on the HSH
reference system.

If the problem requires a more technical solution the
incident will be passed into the ICL Pathway support
organisation. The incident will then be investigated and
an authorised temporary procedure or resolution may be
applied. The support technicians may contact the caller
to understand the incident circumstance more fully or to
gather more evidence to assist the investigation. If an
outlet is contacted by a support technician, the support
technician will quote the call reference number.
