Dear Mr Robinson,

We need to talk. Specifically I shall be writing to Paula Vennells today, but
releasing my letter to the press. In order to maximise its impact, I rather think my
letter needs to be discussed on the Today Programme tomorrow morning. But I’d
like to discuss that with you before making any decisions, please.

Please ring my office (~ }) and, unless they have popped out for a
second, ask them to put you through to me.

Yours sincerely,

James Arbuthnot

The Rt Hon James Arbuthnot
MP for North East Hampshire
