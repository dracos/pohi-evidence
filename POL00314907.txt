>> Will do. I am currently at home dealing with it. It is second on BBC News but the piece just broadcast with James
Arbuthnot has been clearly toned down, probably because I've spent 20 minutes discussing the issue with their editor.

>>> I expect there to be adverse media coverage tomorrow on Today programme and BBC Breakfast and bulletins.

>>>

>>> We've spent the evening working hard to minimise impact but clearly won't know how bad it will be until the morning.
I've alerted Michael Larkin and Roger Gale, and Angela.

>>>

>>> We will have an internal mssg out first thing in the morning, and have proactively issued an external statement
tonight. The PR team has been engaged all evening on the issue. We will also monitor Social media.

>>>

>>> The line of attack will likely be around potential unsafe prosecutions (alleged) and remote access to branch. We
have strong rebuttals of course on these and other issues.

>>>

>>> I have made complaints about the BBC approach at very senior levels in BBC and will update you as required. In
short they have decided to cover the issue based on the agenda of those campaigning against us.

>>>

>>> I will update.
