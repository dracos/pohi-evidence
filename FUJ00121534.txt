Message

The response to the initial report of Jason Coyne of Best Practice Group has been sent to him and his reply is
attached. He has not taken on board any of the points made and has not revised his report at all.

I would welcome any further points you have to make on his further report but it seems to me that his report
cannot be accepted by PO Ltd and that an applicaton needs to be made to the court for Fujitsu to give evidence
about the Horizon system and its working in view of the stance taken by the expert witness.
