Hi Mel,

Re your email about the computer weekly article.

The below may be the scenario that’s being described.
Let me know what you think but we can raise it on the call tomorrow if needed as this is the only
example I have had raised to me.

Thanks
Anne

Thank you for the comprehensive update Andy.
With regard to the root cause, I have today received further information from Fujitsu as follows:

e This issue is caused by the user forcing log off when the post-login checks have not fully completed.

e Whilst this is a process issue and not a technical one, the ability for this to occur can be addressed by a code
change.

e The code change will be included within Release 13.05 which is targeted for deployment in March 2016.

e Previous instances of this issue have been caused in the same way (forced log off}.

1 will continue to monitor progress of this particular code change and keep you updated with regard to implementation
dates, meanwhile if you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Katie

Hi

The appropriate process to resolve this scenario would be for the branch to create 3 “phantom” rems out of the
outreach. They would need a spare barcode to allow them to generate the rem.

At present we have 3 uncleared rem outs from the Core sat in POLSAP.

Provided we were alerted to the phantom rems we would simply net these off against those outstanding and everyone
is clear.

There would be no further action required at the Core.

Our cash team have been in contact with Anne who is not comfortable with creating these phantom rems.

As an alternate approach we could normally issue transaction corrections to clear the duplicated rems.
Anne has informed us that she would prefer to wait for a transaction correction.
We are unable to do this at present as no Customer Account has yet been allocated to this branch.

This is a recurring theme for outreaches at present. We will try to get one allocated.
Anne is aware of this.

{don’t think there is a specific system issue te resolve here. That said branch to branch rems always seem to be messy
to resolve when an error has been made and I think both NBSC & FSC could benefit from some clarity around the
constraints of the process.

Thank you Kendra.
V've asked Fujitsu to advise regarding the root cause however my immediate concern is rectifying the reported loss.
Fujitsu have provided the following information which may be useful:

As per Fujitsu, they have found found 4 other instances {outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all but
the last removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding.
Branch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this

Many thanks,
Katie

Hi Rod/Dawn

Could I enlist your help and support on the below issue please?

POL-0026390
POL00029908
POL00029908

Whilst I am happy for NBSC to try and support where they can, the concern I have with the below is we have no process
for managing this type of issue and we are unable to see any of the back end accounting for this Branch. Therefore, any
advice that we try and provide could end up making matters worse ~ this is already showing a £24k loss. I am not happy
for NBSC to give advice on something that is not a process that exists within the knowledgebase.

Similar to a disconnected session, NBSC would have no understanding as to the implications on branch accounting if
they were to advise the branch as suggested below.

From the explanation below, this appears to be a technical issue, however, I don’t know if you have any other previous
similar scenarios that would advise on what the correct process should be for this particular situation?

Many thanks

Hi Kendra,

ican provide some background here which will hopefully explain why I suggested this call. The below issue was raised
with lan Thomas by Helen Baker on 8* October:

This morning Anne Remmed £8000 from core branch to outreach using barcode.

When she accepted into outreach, and settled, horizon printed receipt, then another, then another, then another..she
managed to stop it at four receipts of £8000 from the one barcode rem in transaction.

She was concerned as she had never seen this before. She balanced core and it was correct, but outreach was £24,000
short.

Although the core had sent only one lot of £8000, the outreach had accepted 4 lots of £8000 in one transaction!

She has spoken to NBSC ref 1358666 who told her it was a technical issue.

She then phoned the IT help desk ref: 17972295. She was unconvinced they understood the problem although they said
they would probably ‘rectify remotely'. After waiting till the end of day, she called back and escalated to option 7 and
spoke to Rich who told her to phone NBSC.

I don't think the helpline understood what's happened. I can understand that as you would think it not possible. But,
incredibly, Anne's outreach horizon now shows £24,000 short and it doesn't exist. As you can imagine, Anne is concerned
and I have told her not to touch the outreach unit until this is resolved for her.

The incident was passed to Fujitsu who have advised that in order to resolve the issue, the branch/NBSC must ‘complete
arem out for the excess to correct the cash holding’ which Fujitsu are unable to do. The NBSC has subsequently advised

POL-0026390
POL00029908
POL00029908

that they cannot assist as this is an IT issue however Fujitsu are also advising that they cannot assist. As a result, the
issue has been passed back and forward for over a week.

In order to resolve this as quickly as possible for the branch and avoid any further delays, I suggested a call between all
parties to discuss and agree a way forward.

lt hope this helps.

Thanks,
Katie

Hi Ib

No can you please hold fire on this as I don’t think this is something NBSC potentially should be getting involved in. I
need to read through this in detail.

Hi Ibrahim,

As this incident is not getting resolved can we have con-call set up between NBSC & Fujitsu.

The Site had transaction discrepancy,

As per Fujitsu, they have found found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all
but the last removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding.
Branch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this.

Please can your team contact branch & check if your team can remove the discrepancy by ‘completing a rem out for the

excess to correct the system cash holding’
