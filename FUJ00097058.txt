Duplication of Transaction Records Contained in ARQ Returns

On Monday 21 June 2010 duplicate transaction records were identified in an
ARQ return.

Initial investigation showed that duplicate records were held in the source
TMS file held on the Audit Server; which is now known can happen, under
what was thought to be ‘exceptional circumstances’.

When the Horizon Audit application was in use Riposte would not record
duplicate messages in the reconstructed messagestore held on the Audit
Workstation (AUW) and hence transactions were not duplicated on the ARQ
returns.

The HNG-X application does not identify or ‘discard’ duplicated records and
thus duplicated transactions are appearing in the ARQ returns.

PEAK 200468 ‘Horizon Audit Spreadsheet Producing Duplicate Transactions’
was raised on 21 June as an A priority.

Further analysis identified on 22 June that approximately one third of all ARQ
returns generated under the HNG-X application have duplicated transactions
included.

PEAK 200468 was updated with this information.

A discussion took place between Alan Holmes, Gareth Jenkins and Penny
Thomas and the following actions were agreed:-

1. PEAKs 200468 and 194639 to be identified in CS Prayers as urgent —
Action: Penny
A note was sent to Pat Lywood explaining the issue and identifying
PEAKs 200468 and 194639 ‘Audit Client does not highlight messages
with duplicate message numbers’ was also referenced.

2. As the unique identifier ‘NUM’ is not included in the current ARQ
returns it was agreed that this should be incorporated in the queries
used to filter the records until the problem is solved. This could allow
the service to continue and duplicated transaction records would be
identifiable. Action: Alan/Penny

3. Gareth agreed to draft a statement for management review detailing
the issue for onward transmission to POL. Action: Gareth

4. A separate issue was also identified where a seemingly duplicated
transaction had a different NUM and Gareth agreed to review the
detail. Action: Gareth
We need to identify which cases provided with ARQ returns since the HNG-X
application has been live have progressed to prosecution and identify whether
duplicate records were included. We will need POL involvement to ensure all
instances are covered. A very quick review identifies that both West Byfleet
and Porters Avenue are included here, to what extent is not yet known.
