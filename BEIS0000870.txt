Board.

This recommendation came from the Senior Independent Director
and the RemCo chair (two most senior Non-Execs on the Board),
both of which expressed serious concerns about Mr Staunton to
DBT. Note also RemCo chair has stated she will step down from
the Board if the Chair stays in post. Concerns include:

1) Multiple allegations concerning his conduct, including
allegations of misogyny and racism;

2)His repeated attempts to close down investigation into
his conduct, which included pressuring staff and Board
members to end the investigation repeatedly;

3) Aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful behaviour to
other Board members and members of the Exec Team.
There has been multiple written complaints from Execs to
the CEO concerning Mr Staunton's conduct;

4) Continued poor understanding of the public sector
operating environment and poor judgment of
appropriate actions given the particular scrutiny that Post
Office operates under, and;

5) Disregard for due process, including announcing a new
SID to the Board and seeking to close ongoing public
appointment process without formal consultation with the
Board nor seeking Shareholder approval.

Officials agree that Mr Staunton's conduct and judgement make
him unsuitable to continue as Chair, as their view is that Mr
Staunton:

1) Has not offered the leadership and cultural change the Post
Office needs;

2) Has been acting increasingly erratic and disruptive for the
business, including several outbursts in the office and other
incidents;

3)Acted in an unacceptable manner by seeking to stop the
investigations against himself.

Legal Privilege

SpAd comments: Victoria:

Dylan:
Minister Minister Hollinrake and Perm Sec both recommend removing
comments: him without inviting him to resign. This is due to the seriousness

of the allegations. Perm Sec is also apprehensive about a future
where the allegations come out and DBT is seen to have given
him the easy way out.
