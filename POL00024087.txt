The Fujitsu application for remote access:

I have now got the definitive written confirmation from Fujitsu they cannot/do not access for amendment or deletion

the branches Horizon front office business/financial systems.
This has taken several months.
Patrick (for Sparrow) and Audit have been informed.

Many thanks for this and for the translation (as a non-IT person, I confess to having had a hard time, personally, pin-

pointing exactly where in this document that clear conclusion appears!).
Kind regards

Patrick

CC’d Audit since I am aware that one of my exiting people raised this with you.

I had some concerns over an application ‘Cygwin’, that Fujitsu use on the Horizon systems, it was reported to me that
Fujitsu staff could ‘take control’ of the branches systems.

Given the scope of the Sparrow project and past allegations I thought it prudent to obtain clarity from Fujitsu.

However whilst Fujitsu were happy to verbally confirm the use of the application, they weren’t quite so keen on
providing a written report.

This has taken months but nonetheless I wanted to ensure that there could be no doubt and that we had a definitive
statement from Fujitsu on their remote support if there was a challenge in the future.

The attached provides confirmation that remote access is controlled and cannot be used to take control of or amend
business/financial information on branch systems.
