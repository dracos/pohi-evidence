Graham, thanks for your comments. I have made some adjustments to the presentation and/or added
comments below:-

Do we need to add to the last point on slide 2 that although we know of no instance when we will not get
an error which will indicate incompleteness we cannot guarantee this.

Tivoli event data is known to be incomplete, viz turn off TECs during event storms, gaps in the events
sequences generated by OMDB, there are occasional corrupt records within the events audit tracks

Do we need to add something about if we do find a gap we do not know what to do about this? If we do say
this we will need to say what we are doing to progress a solution to this or what the options are to tell POL
that we can't provide data?? .

Added to slide 5

Slide 3 I think the second point should say ‘prone to human error’ I am presuming if we automated this the
error indicated in this point would be removed.

It's not just human error, the process is not secure. But yes, that's my belief, partially automating will remove
this point

Slide 3, why does the CP not suggest full automation or does it automate as much as possible in which case it
should probably be worded like that.
We cannot fully automate, we-will always need someone to check unfiltered errors

Need a final slide saying what we want the audience to help with. I think we mentioned 2 things
1. Support the CP

2. Provide guidance on the immediate issue of the witness statements.

Item (1) added to slide 4, item (2) already there .
Amended presentation attached. Please let me know if I havn't fully covered your comments, or if any others
have been identified.

Kind regards
Penny

Urgent Issue
ARQ Service (Audit System)

Contracted to supply historical extracts of data,
used in legal proceedings

The completeness of data was underwritten by
our witness statement

Counter problem — PEAK PC0152376 — “The
fact that EPOSS code is not resilient to errors is
endemic”

We are manually cross checking with available
event data but completeness is still not
guaranteed

Manual & Proposed Process

Manual process is onerous and must be reviewed —
It is error prone and time consuming

It involves moving large volumes of data between the
Audit server and workstation

It requires local and insecure storage of event audit data,
invalidating certain statements made within the current
witness statement

It has no DR mechanism.in the event of DR from BRAO1
to LEWO2

Proposed CP to partially automate in a secure manner

Immediate Issue — Witness
Statements and Court Attendance

¢ Current standard witness statement is now
incorrect — we guarantee completeness and
integrity

¢ Consideration is needed to :-
— Support the CP
— correct the statement with legal advice
— agreement with POL
— action relating to statements submitted, awaiting court
— 3 witness statements pending
— action relating to historic court cases
Associated Issues

Any gap identified will need bespoke
examination

Historic and current data has proven to be
incomplete

Ramifications of historical data provisions
