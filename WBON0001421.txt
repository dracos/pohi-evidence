Dear Andy,

I found your drafting very useful and thought that it was both fair and effective. I have bashed my way
through it without reflecting too much on what I’m adding, with a view to reflecting later on whether I’ve
added too many points to be useful (often the curse of counsel) or too much detail to be useful (ditto) or
addressed things in a way that might give them undue emphasis. I’m planning to reflect on such points
tomorrow, but would be happy to have the benefit of your views when doing so.

Best wishes,

Tony

I hope that this is helpful rather than inappropriate — I've bashed out a "starter for 10" speaking note for the board next
week.

Feel free to amend, delete or totally disregard as you see fit, but I hope this gives you a flavour of what I think is
needed. If anything, this might too much detail.

One to discuss next week perhaps.
