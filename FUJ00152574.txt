Subject: Torquay Road ARQ 506/368

Brian - RE: Torquay Road

Further to the e mail below and letter sent on the 9th December 2005, please find attached a letter from the Subpostmaster dated 12 Dec 2005
forwarded to me by Solicitors acting on his behalf. Whilst still not precise it provides some background into his suggestion that Horizon is to
blame for his losses.

(See attached file: Bajaj letter dated 12 Dec 2005.RTF)
I would be gratefull if you could peruse the content before providing a full response.
Thankyou

As discussed by phone this morning, could I please ask that the request below be expedited.
FUJ00152574
FUJ00152574

Both the ARQ requests detailed in the Subject title are Civil matters where there is a suggestion that the losses incurred at the offices are as a
result of faults with the Horizon software.

Marine Drive - In this case Bond Pearce Solicitors acting on our behalf have asked for an investigation into the workings of the system (their
letter dated 18/11/05 refers, copy posted back to you today details exactly what analysis is required ). Could I ask that you deal with the
questions raised and prepare a formal response to be returned via me as soon as possible

Torquay Road - The same scenario as above applies. I am awaiting details from our Solicitors dealing with the matter, outlining exactly what
is required and as soon as I receive this information, I will be asking for a formal response from you, much the same as with Marine Drive.

Tam assuming that in both cases, you have copies of the ARQ information already supplied.
Regards
