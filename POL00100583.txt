Thank you for your letter of 16 April to Jo Swinson MP, about the Initial Case Review and
Mediation Scheme. I am the Minister responsible for Post Office policy, while Jo
Swinson takes maternity leave.

I am conscious that the Scheme, which is jointly overseen by the Working Group
comprising representatives from the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, Post Office Ltd,
and Second Sight, has an independent Chair in Sir Anthony Hooper.

The Government, as shareholder in Post Office Ltd, does not play a role in the operation
of the Working Group. As an independent Chair whose appointment was approved by
the members of the Working Group, Sir Anthony Hooper must be allowed to perform his
duties independently and free from influence, but Government is supportive of the
Working Group and the ambitions of the Scheme. It is in the interests of all parties,
especially those who have lodged applications for their cases to be considered, for there
to be a timely resolution.

As a member of the Working Group, you will understand that the Government cannot be
involved in operational matters concerning Post Office Ltd, the Working Group, or the
Scheme and it would be inappropriate to respond to the operational concerns that you
have raised. The Working Group and the Scheme have been established to consider
very serious claims, and it is important that your concerns be addressed by the
appropriate parties. Given your concerns relate to the operation of the Working Group,
and specifically about the engagement of Post Office Ltd with the Scheme, I intend to
forward a copy of your letter to both Sir Anthony Hooper and Paula Vennells so that they
can make informed responses to the issues that you have raised. If you have any
objections to my doing so, please contact my Private Secretary, Claire Rannard, who
would be pleased to discuss any concerns you might have with that course of action.

I would be grateful for your response by Wednesday 30 April.

I have recently received a letter from Alan Bates, Chair of the Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance (“JFSA”) regarding the Initial Case Review and Mediation Scheme, of which the
JFSA plays a role as a member of the Working Group, and of which you are independent
Chair.

The Government, as shareholder in Post Office Ltd, does not play a role in the operation
of the Working Group, and is keenly aware that you must be allowed to perform your
duties independently and free from influence.

The Government is supportive of the Working Group and the ambitions of the Scheme,
and believes it is in the interests of all parties, especially those who have lodged
applications for their cases to be considered, for there to be a timely resolution.

In that spirit, I am forwarding to you correspondence from the JFSA that sets out their
concerns about the operation of the Scheme. This is provided without prejudice, and I
have previously informed the JFSA that I would be sharing their letter with you.

More widely, at an appropriate point in the future, I would be pleased to meet to discuss
the Working Group and the operation of the Scheme.
