Andy

Just to keep you in the loop, I spoke to Rodric earlier today; he said he was very happy with the approach we have
been taking and is impressed overall.

He had some amends which I have noted to the SR responses, a number of which I haven't been able to make
without some documentation he said he would send (witness statements in certain judicial review proceedings he
has been involved in). These witness statements apparently reference certain clauses in the modified SPMR
contracts with Post Office. He has asked that I find the clauses in the standard contract between SPMR and Post
Office which mirror those in the modified contract and insert these with an explanation where appropriate. I have
just this minute received the documentation from Rodric and so I will start working on the amends now. As you
will see from my email to Simon, I explained this and said I would provide the final responses to him by mid-
morning tomorrow (if he is happy with that approach) which he has confirmed he is. This will enable me to run
the changes past Gavin tomorrow morning before they go out (Gavin is not around today and Tom said he would
prefer Gavin to review them rather than him).

I also spoke to Steve Allchorn regarding SR 5. He confirmed he has sent the response to SR 5 to Second Sight on
Thursday of last week. He sent me what he sent to Second Sight regarding this spot review (attached above).

Hope that all makes sense. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
R

Steve
I'm sorry for the delay in replying. There’s a lot going on at the moment...

I attach a copy of Spot Review 5 which describes the allegations that have been made.

WBD_000213.000002
WBONO0000343
WBON0000343

The emails that have been forwarded to you appear to describe matters that may be relevant to the allegation.
Please note that we are primarily interested in finding out the following:

1. What capabilities did the POL Bracknell team have? (As far as TC or Rem Out type transactions or Journal
adjustments are concerned)

2. What were the PHYSICAL or LOGICAL controls over their use of the systems available to them?

3. What audit trail is available to show the extent that they posted TC or Rem Out type transactions, or
Journal adjustments?

4. Can we reply of the COMPLETENESS of the audit trail? i.e. does it record all transactions or just
transactions meeting certain criteria? Is it protected from user manipulation?

5. What USER ID was used if TC type transactions or journal adjustments were posted?

Could the POL Bracknell team log on with either super user or SMPR credentials?

7. How would TC, Rem Out or Journal Adjustment type transactions executed by the POL Bracknell team be
seen by SPMR of Branches affected by those actions?

a

There are probably other questions / issues that will arise after you have had a preliminary look at this.

Please note that we’re not really interested in what the procedures manual says about any of this. We need to look
at whether it would be possible for a rogue employee to do what is alleged and what log files would be generated
to record that activity. Please note that I have now been provided with a second batch of employee email and I
may find other emails that are potentially relevant to this matter.

Thank you for your help with this
With best wishes

Hi lan
I’ve been forwarded the email stream below however having not been party to prior conversations or spoken to
Susan as she is formally off-work I just need to understand the context of the enquiry as the email pdf’s attached
are a collection of individual instances rather than a clear line.
My perception of what I think you need is;

1) Aclear documentation/articulation of the end-to-end Transaction Corrections process, how it is applied

and the sign-off authorities that are in place (e.g. subpostmaster acceptance etc.).
2) An understanding of how the attached email instances relate to that process and authorities.
