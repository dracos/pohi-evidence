We’d like to use this from Second Sight’s Interim Report, which is their overriding conclusion on the central point of this
exercise:

“We have so far found no evidence of a system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software”
And this from PO’s press release following receipt of that report:
Post Office Chief Executive, Paula Vennells, said:

“tt does...raise questions about the training and support we have offered to some sub-postmasters and we are
determined to address these issues.”

On this last point, we already have, as the Q&A/Speech record.
Best wishes

Patrick

Sorry, one more question - where we say there were no system wide problems with the system, can we add a couple of
quotes from the July 2013 report?

Could I ask again that, should Jo get sight of James Arbuthnot’s speech in advance, you could either share this with us or,
if that’s not possible, share with us the broad thrust of it so that we might put Jo in the best possible place to answer
and helpfully and accurately as possible ?

ind it’s (almost) never

As to tomorrow's arrangements — I can meet you wherever/whenever is conven
important I am there, if only to gauge the atmospherics. My personal mobile isi.
off,

Belinda / Patrick

Once again thanks for coming over. I have noted down the actions for you / me following the meeting, and I think there
are as follows:

e Belinda to get in touch with Sir Anthony to request making the letter available to Parliament (and to share with
JA?)

Belinda is on the case ~ email sent and follow up call soon

Can you provide a line or two which I can add to the questions around POL’s level of commitment to the
scheme, “if pressed”, regarding costs paid to SPMs?

If pressed:

@ PO has made £1500 + VAT contribution to any SPM in the Scheme who wishes to engage the services of a
professional adviser to assist them in preparing their complaint

e junderstand that almost all SPMs in the Scheme have availed themselves of this offer

e Inaddition, PO provides an additional contribution for professional advice of £1250 + VAT for a full day
mediation and £750 + VAT for a half day mediation

e  SPMs are not required to pay anything toward the mediation venue costs and their travel is also paid for by PO

Could you provide the number of cases within the 24 where you have not voted for mediation, but will
nevertheless mediate?

As Belinda explained on the phone, very few, if any cases, have gone to formal vote ~ James Arbuthnot has tried to make
a statistic (the infamous 90%) out of the fact that PO may have raised questions in Working Group discussions of certain
cases which is, frankly, only what you might expect them to do — it is not a statistic and says nothing. The fact remains
that 24 cases have been recommended by the WG for mediation and in only 2 has PO declined to actually mediate
(somewhat less than 10%).

I will find out what Jo was happy to share with lan Murray (outstanding Mark D request)

Thank you.

e I will change the numbers in the q&a regarding the number of cases, so it adds to 24
