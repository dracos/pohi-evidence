John,

I understand Jonathan requested, during a conversation with our GC Jane MacLeod, that prior to this afternoons
consultation he is provided the following additional documents:

Hansard: House of Commons Debate — ‘Post Office Horizon System’ 9 July 2013
Hansard: Westminster Hall Debate — ‘Post Office Mediation Scheme’ 17 December 2014
Transcript of Oral Evidence: Business, Innovation and Skills Committee (3 February 2015)
Hansard: House of Commons Debate — ‘Post Office Horizon System’ 29 June 2015
Second Sight’s Briefing Report — Part One (25 July 2014)

Second Sight’s Briefing Report — Part Two (21 August 2014)

eee

Second Sight’s Briefing Report — Part One is essentially FAQs about the Post Office. As such I have taken the liberty of
attaching the below as I think that may be more useful to Jonathan.

Second Sight’s Interim Report into alleged problems with the Horizon system (8 July 2013)

The documents listed abover are all attached. However, some of are of significant size. If you would prefer to be
