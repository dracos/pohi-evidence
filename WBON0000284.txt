Pete called me again. Steve has now agreed to be a witness so we can stand down Paula.

Pete Newsome just called me. There has been no material progress in unblocking the Steve Parker issue. Pete also
does not think there is an alternative to Steve.

I've gently but clearly warned Pete that (i) this matter is getting escalated to Paula and (ii) if needs be, we will
summons Steve. I've said that we are prepared to entertain any viable solution but this must come from FJ because
we are looking to challenge evidence from a former FJ employee about FJ operations.

Pete understands the problem, he just can't see the solution. He's going to speak to others at FJ again tomorrow. I
said we will be briefing Paula anyway as time is very short.

In light of this, please find attached a briefing note to Paula for your comments.
