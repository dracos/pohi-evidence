Subject: RE: Yetminster

Dear Dave in Susan’s absence I have now had opportunity to discuss the case with Alwen Lyons the company secretary.
and accordingly drafted a letter to

Ms Merritt.

Regards

Jamail

Dear Ms Merritt

I write in connection with the investigation carried out into the audit shortage of £11,886.77 which occurred during the
period of your appointment as sub postmaster of the Yetminster Post Office®.

Post Office Ltd remains entirely satisfied as to the evidential strength of its case against you and remains of the view that
any criminal prosecution would, if pursued, be entirely successful. Post Office Ltd has, however, carefully considered the
representations made on your behalf by Mr Oliver Letwin MP and has decided on this occasion not to pursue this matter
further.

The decision not to proceed to prosecution does not in any way constitute an admission that the losses were the result of
an error with the Horizon computer system. Any such allegations will be robustly defended. Post Office Ltd continues to
have absolute confidence in the integrity of the Horizon computer system and its branch accounting processes.

Yours faithfully

Jarnail, as this was a case whereby Horizon was being cited as being at fault; I’m not sure if we want to accompany the

change in stance with a carefully worded missive stating that our position is not an admission of Horizon integrity issues
{as it stands one of my security managers has been asked to advise the suspect — presumably verbally). Apologies if this
is already to hand but I’m conscious of the impact the decision may have on similar cases going forward.

Regards

Dave Pardoe
