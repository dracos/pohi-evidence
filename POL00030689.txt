Chris.

As discussed on Tuesday, please find attached a one page report in regards to the current position of investigations, in
particular the cases that are on hold awaiting a Horizon Subject Matter Expert.

The risks are:

* People are held in suspense as to whether they will be prosecuted or not and may be deemed unfair causing
anxiety and stress during this period.

e The value of the outstanding loss will not be recovered via the Proceeds of Crime Act (i will follow up in regards
to running a civil process at the same time ~ however as discussed there are risks with this approach if we were
then to try and use the POCA at a later stage).

e@ Should the business have the appetite to resume prosecution, there will be a high work load volume and with
the reduction of headcount over the last few months there may be a resource impact.

Having learnt over the last few months that Legal Services like the detail, the excel spread sheet details the relevant
cases.

I will let Amanda know the password.
Happy to discuss through.

Regards.

John.
