Immediate Priorities

+ Full commitment to Orders target — build plan to deliver growth

+ Maximise Revenue — current view £594m, (plus FTS at £121) being
£271m from backlog and £259 from new business, giving a gap of

* Profit delivery plan — major challenge. BU outlook £20m, PSD view
£40m but still with high risk

+ FTS revenues of £121m and Profit of £9.4m taken at face value in
this forecast — need to verify and confirm.

+ Get underneath HNGx and fully understand delivery and integration
issues

+ Ensure stabilisation of !

and delivery to revised plan

+ Rigorous review of PSD opex base and structure
+ Complete review of sales team and strengthen as appropriate
+ Stability of forecasts across all BU’s — need to reduce volatility

Operating Profit Track — May Forecast

+ May Forecast profit is £40m, £37m below the Q2 Restated budget including
FTS. (BU roll up gave a profit of £19.4m.). Forecast still contains
considerable risk es; ecially around cost assumptions in HNGx which have
still to be reviewed. Net risk is circa £30m.

* Original budget contained a task of £20m which was not owned or allocated
to sub BU’s.

10.8m from Transformation slippages,

from HNGx programme slippages

have taken a £5m profit task to be delivered by additional 3°
