GROUP RISKS - HALF YEAR RISK REVIEW

Purpose

1 The purpose of this session is to enable the Risk and Compliance Committee
(RCC), at the half year, to review the Group Risk Profile and report to the ARC.
In particular, to consider whether, in light of external or internal changes and
experiences of rolling out the Three Year Plan, there have been any:

A) changes to our Group Risks

have the previous Group Risks changed in description, have new risks
emerged, similar risks consolidated or current risks become less
significant?

B) changes to the current evaluation of our Group Risks
have the current (net) evaluations of any Group Risks changed?

Cc) changes to the target evaluations for our Group Risks

in light of the above, but also considering our draft Risk Appetite
Statement (which proposes the extent of risk we are willing to take), have
our target evaluations for these Group Risks changed?

Preparation

2. In advance of the session, could you consider if there have been any changes
you would like to suggest to the 27 Group Risk identified in May 2015 (see slide
1a of the support materials).

3. To suggest additional risks, we have worked with your Risk Champions to identify
other potential risks from your Risk Registers - a “bottom-up perspective” and
also added further options from a standard risk model (see slide 2).

4. To help expose gaps and overlaps, we have presented all these risks in a “Risk
Universe” format, divided between external/ strategic, transformation,
operational, financial and compliance risks (slides 1b and 2).

5. Please start with focusing on risks to your own Business Area or Function,
before considering Group Risks “owned” by other RCC members.

Work steps

6. During the session we will discuss and agree your collective view on the most

significant risks to the Group.

7. Once we have a revised list of Group Risks, we will re-confirm each risk’s current
evaluation using a Risk Profile/ Heat Map (see slide 3), taking into consideration
any changes since May 2015.

8 And finally, we will trial, for a few selected risks, how we can use our draft Risk
Appetite Statement (see slide 4) to help us identify target evaluations for each
Red Risk - what we feel is the acceptable level of risk taking for each risk. This
will show us the extent of Key Further Actions we will need to bring these risks

back to this target. The Risk team will continue this after the session with
individual risk owners for discussion and approval at the next RCC.

Support materials

9. As background we include in the attached slide pack:
For part A) Changes to our Group Risks
Slide 1) a) our previous Group Risk Profile (May 2015), plus 1b) the risks
displayed in a “Risk Universe” format to stimulate thoughts on
completeness and help us spot any gaps or where we can
consolidate similar risks
Slide 2) potential additional risks proposed by your Risk Champions at a
recent risk review workshop, plus other risks suggested from a
model Risk Universe
For part B) Changes to our current evaluations of our Group Risks
Slide 3) 3a) an example Risk Profile/ “Heat Map” mocked up for our risks
and 3b) our Risk Evaluation Measurement Criteria Bands
For part C) Changes to the target evaluations for our Group Risks
Slide 4) our (draft) Risk Appetite Statement shown as a spidergramme.
Outcome
10. The intended outcome of this Risk Review session is for the RCC to update the

previous Group Risk Profile, for changes to risks, their current (net) evaluations
and target evaluations. This will:

a) help us to systematically challenge our progress with the Three Year Plan
(and protecting our reputation).

b) influence decisions on the nature, extent and timing of Key Further
Actions, to be completed post RCC, to achieve the Three Year Plan (and
protect our reputation).

c) provide feedback on the draft Risk Appetite Statement as we look to refine
this further through practical application.

d) provide assurance to the ARC (and so the Board) that the RCC is actively
monitoring and challenging the Group Risks, ensuring that they are within
our (draft) Risk Appetite and that appropriate Key Further Actions are
being taken.

The output will be summarised in a Group Risk Profile (per slide 4) and Summary
of Key Further Actions (per slide 5).

If you have any questions or comments beforehand, please feel free to contact
the Head of Risk and Assurance, Mike Morley-Fletcher, or Steve Miller, Head of
Risk.

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 PAPER THREE

To: RCC

From: Steve Miller

Date: 28 August 2015

Re: Update on Policy and Control Framework, and compliance with UK Corporate Code
Required:

1. For information. Committee members to be aware of the approach to these two key framework
items which will be presented to Audit and Risk Committee

Background:

2. Papers on two framework and governance elements will be presented to Audit and Risk
Committee in September. This note summarises the approach; the two elements are closely
linked.

3. Policy Framework:

a. POLneeds a common approach to managing a top-down suite of policies. A proposal is in
preparation outlining the process and timetable for establishing scope, process and
timetable.

b. The proposal will set out the key steps; specify requirements, develop the design, test and
evaluate, report and feedback, then prioritise and implement.

c. Effective policy framework and governance is vital to understanding how we manage the
key risks. Policies will include definitions of exposures, how these are controlled and
managed, responsibilities and accountabilities. A set of measures for each significant risk
and control assists putting risk appetite limits into operation in the line.

d. This will start with the Corporate Services related policies to use as a test, and will be
followed by a prioritisation exercise to identify the business critical elements to work on
first.

4. Approach to compliance with UK Corporate Code (The Code):

a. The costs of compliance with the risk management requirements of The Code are high, both
centrally and across business areas. Given the current state of risk management maturity,
compliance will need significant investment.

b. However, the risk management section of The Code can be used as an internal benchmark
for our performance. Industry is currently showing a range of practices; we need to ensure
that our response is the most appropriate, showing cost-benefit in managing the risk
profile, and in oversight of the internal control framework.

c. Consequently, meeting Code requirements has dependency on the effective
implementation of the Policy Framework.

d. Apaper will be presented to Audit and Risk Committee updating the gap analysis on the
Annual Assessment process which was produced in March. FRC guidance includes a series
of questions boards are advised to use in conducting the assessment. These questions have
been used to assess the POL risk framework status in line with current industry practice and
summarised key actions for the next six months.

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 PAPER FOUR A

To: RCC

From: Steve Miller

Re: POL — Business Continuity update plan and Interim Incident Management Procedure
Background:

1. The RCC in its last meeting in August 2015 reviewed the Business Continuity Planning status and
action plan and requested a more detailed paper covering the resource requirements.

2. Whilst business continuity including wider incident management is an area currently undergoing
review, following the evacuation of Finsbury Dials out of hours on Wednesday 26 August 2015, a
potential gap was identified in the current incident management procedure.

3. It was felt appropriate to implement an interim procedure.

Issues:

4. The Risk Team has prepared a Business Continuity resource plan covering both the business
resources (1 line) and the Central Business Continuity team (2" line).

5. The plan is spread over three phases with varying resource requirements which is a mixture of:

a. Contract staff (in Central Risk Team — 2™ Line) totalling 2.35 FTE across all phases.

b. POL operational business units to provide SME / line management resource (1* line).
This has been totalled and given a sum FTE value across POL of 3.5 FTE commitment
across all phases

6. The current incident management procedure is focussed on IT and does not effectively cover
non-IT incidents.

7. This was highlighted on 26 August 2015 when Finsbury Dials had to be evacuated and the
building security was not aware of who to contact in the Post Office and how to coordinate
related activities.

8. This was brought to the attention of the CoSec and CEO who requested an urgent review and an
interim Incident Management plan has been developed and distributed across all Post Office
administration buildings.

Actions:

9. RCC are asked to consider the resource plan and approach and:
a. Approve the recruitment of an interim Senior BCM to deliver Phase 1 and commence
Phase 2 on initial six month contract. Senior BCM to be supported by an additional
contract BCM after three months (subsequent to Phase 1 completion).
b. Support the time commitment required from the 1“ line business areas running business
critical processes in engaging with this initiative and providing appropriate SME.
c. Review and approve the approach in the attached paper (Paper 4B).
10. The Property and Risk Teams have developed an interim procedure on the request of the CEO
and Company Secretary which is being presented to the RCC for their comments and feedback
(Paper 4C).

POL00110129

Background &

It was appreciated by RCC that the resource for BC management is low. This paper details
actions required for adequate BC management, and estimates time and cost.

The resource assessments are based on:
* Central Risk Team engaging contract resource for Phase 1 and 2.
* Business units engaging with the risk team at each phase and providing SME resource.

Phase 1 would be completed as rapidly as possible by a contract Senior Business Continuity
Manager in 3 months.

This provides an assessment of the most urgent actions, and starting points for governance, risk
assessment and incident management. A further resource of Business Continuity Manager would
be added at the end of Phase 1 to begin executing the action plan.

Completion of Phase 2 would be expected to give a reasonable BC management response for
POL, but at low level of maturity.

Phase 3 delivers increased maturity, and sets up BCP as a BAU activity with programmes of
assessment, testing and review. The five most critical areas identified in Phase 1 will have BC
plans by 30 June 2016.

Resource Requirement

Summary of resources:

Resource is a mixture of requirements on existing operational staff (1st Line) and contractors
(2"4 Line). The table below totals the demand on business units (15t Line) across POL into a
single FTE number.

In summary, 15 Line is 3.5 FTE and 2" Line is 2.35 FTE.

Test CMT and incident management processes

Develop risk assessment and business impact analysis methodology and set
resilience levels

Identify and map business critical activities and plan programme of BIA
assessments

18 line: 255
2" line: 225

The above summarises the deliverables for each phase and cost estimate.

Cost estimates are based on the assumption that there will be 20 BC plans required for POL based on the
number of business units, key locations and functional areas. Allocation of 1* line (business process
owner) resource requirements is based on the number of days per plan/business unit with a cost £400 per

day (although this is opportunity cost).

Second line (Central Risk Team) resource has calculated at one senior contractor starting in October 2015
at £750 per day and a second contractor joining from January 2016 month four at a cost of £500 per day.

Severity Assessment

5) In the event of an incident the SPoC should assess the severity (see below) and invoke a
proportionate response:-

Minor Incident — Little internal impact with no external customer impact and minimal staff
impact, resolution timescales measured in hours (for example localised flood within a
premise due to burst pipe).

¢ Moderate Incident — Additional internal impact but no customer impact. May require short
term alternate facilities for staff, resolution timescale extended to several days (for example
a localised flood effecting fixed wiring or damaging computer equipment, or a fire causing
predominately smoke / decorative damage).

¢ — Significant Incident — Any incident where there is a potential external customer impact, or
where staff are required to work remotely or from a different premises (for example
substantial flooding, fire damage, extended loss of utilities or incident external to Post Office
premises restricting access).

Major Incident — Confirmed impact to external customers, extensive destruction /
impairment of Post Office premises preventing access or use for an extended period (for
example serious fire within the building, structural damage due to weather, terrorist activity
or similar).

Resultant Action

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Board of Post Office Limited
FROM: Alisdair Cameron, Chief Financial Officer
SUBJECT: Corporate Insurance Programme 2015/16
DATE: 22 September 2015
Recommendation
1. It is recommended that the Board’s approval for the renewal of this programme, noting

the 14% reduction in premium in addition to the c30% reduction achieved since
separation from RMG which is in addition to the c90% reduction in payments for
claims during that period.

Executive Summary

2.1. This is the fourth anniversary of the PO stand-alone Insurance Programme following
the split from the RMG insurance programme in September 2012.

2.2 PO confirmed its intent to appoint Lockton Companies LLP to act as its corporate
Insurance Adviser with effect from 1 July 2015

2.3 The insurance programme is due to be renewed on 1 October so negotiations are
continuing which may further improve terms — no policy will be renewed on terms
worse than those at Annex 3 unless of course there is a material change to Post
Office’s risk profile before renewal (eg a major claim).

2.4 As part of the insurance review POL will utilise the Official Journal of the European
Union (“OJEU”) process for the procurement of insurances where applicable.

2.5 PO and Lockton agreed all quotations received from Insurers will be subjected to the
following scoring matrix to demonstrate best value to PO:

Cri Points Weight
Price for Insurance cover 600 60%
Assessment of Policy Cover 250 25%
Claims Service 100 10%
Added Value and Innovation 5 5%

Key Insurance policies
2.6 The key corporate insurances currently in place are (more detail at Annex 3):

Crime

Directors and Officers Liability

Property Damage/Increased Cost of Working
Terrorism

Professional Indemnity (Government Contracts only)
Personal Accident/Travel

Special Contingency

eo eevee

Claims

2.7. This has been another good year for PO with regards to claims, with a relatively stable
pattern of claims notified, which is better than envisaged when our standalone
programme was set up.

2.8 It should be noted that PO now has clear claims procedures in place, with QBE
handling all liability and motor claims. This has led to a substantial drop in amounts
paid out in claims since RMG managed the process. Full details are attached in Annex
2.

Summary of Insurance Review

2.9 A review has been undertaken of all the major risks and relevant insurance policies.
Full details are contained in Appendix 1, however in summary, the main findings of the
review are:

Our insurances are fit for purpose

« Some policies will not be renewed (Contractors All Risks)

« Our deductibles are high for a company POL’s size so these should be reduced
where there is no impact on premium

e Leveraging our risk and claims data to reduce premium where possible

e We are obtaining quotations for Professional Indemnity Insurance across POL
rather than split policies for POMS and POL as now.

2.10 Some of the savings are being achieved by having 2 year deals
POMS

2.11 A review will be undertaken over the next 12 months, when POMS is fully operational ,
to see if it is economic to manage some of this insurance programme through POMS.

Financial Metrics

3. The total premium for a year for all the insurance policies will be no greater than
£1.267m (last year’s equivalent £1.441m) exc Insurance Premium Tax of 6%.

Conclusion

4. It is recommended that the insurance programme should be renewed for a premium of
no more than £1.267m (exc Insurance Premium Tax).

APPENDIX 3
Brief synopsis of Insurance cover
1. Crime Insurance

1.1. PO historically has one of the largest stand-alone Crime policies in the UK
insurance market, insuring to a limit of GBP600 million, and is a requirement for
membership of the Bank of England’s Note Circulation Scheme. The policy
covers all risk of crime including theft by employees. The policy carries a
GBP1million excess and is insured by QBE and others. This is PO's largest
external premium spend.

2. Property Damage/increased Cost of Working/Terrorism.

2.1. PO has a Property Damage policy, insuring the full value of properties valued at
above GBP1m. There is a GBP10 million increased cost of working limit. There
have been no claims.

2.2 Zurich is the current insurer and there is a GBP1million excess on the policy.
Terrorism is purchased separately.

2.3 We have obtained alternative quotations for the Property insurances from
several Insurers, the most attractive at this stage of negotiations being QBE. We
have alternatives from Mitsui and ACE and are in discussions with other insurers.
We expect to see circa 10% premium savings on a like for like basis.

2.4 QBE Insurance currently underwrite a large proportion of Post Office Ltd's
insurances. QBE are one of the world’s top 20 general insurance and
reinsurance companies, employing 17,000 people in 38 countries and with a
strong London market presence. Their gross written premium in 2014 was
US$16bn and they are currently S and P A+ rated (insurer financial strength
rating)

During this year’s remarketing exercise QBE have additionally quoted
competitive terms on POL’s Property Damage & Business Interruption insurance.

Lockton have an in house market security committee which monitor the suitability
and security of all Insurers that they place business with. QBE Insurance is
currently an approved insurer by the committee.

3. Combined Liability Insurance (Employers/Public Liability)

3.1. PO has a combined Liability programme from QBE, providing GBP50m of
coverage on both Employers Liability and Public Liability. This carries a
GBP250k excess per loss with an annual aggregate cap of GBP2.35m (incl
motor below). QBE handle the claims below the excess and is reimbursed by PO
on a quarterly basis. This is a relationship that works well.

PAGE 6
POL00110129

POLO00110129

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 RESTRICTED PAPER FIVE

4.

Motor Fleet Insurance

44

42

PO has two motor fleets (Commercial vehicles and Private Cars) both insured via
QBE.

The policy is placed in the same way as the Combined liability (namely, with a
GBP250k excess with claims below the excess paid by QBE and reimbursed by
PO on a quarterly basis).

Directors and Officers Liability

5.1

5.2

5.3

This policy provides cover for PO directors and officers where they are sued as a
result of a wrongful act, resulting from something that they are alleged to have
done while acting as a manager of PO.

In addition, the policy will respond if there is an investigation into an act that they
are alleged to have committed.

The policy currently has a limit of GBP60m. An insurance review last year looked
at whether reducing this limit to GBP40m (saving approx. GBP20,000 in
premium) was viable. As a large organisation, it is felt that the current limit of
GBP60m is the minimum level that PO should have and therefore should be
retained.

Professional Indemnity

6.1

6.2

This policy was purchased to meet the Government Service Contracts
contractual requirements. The policy has a GBP10m limit and covers a breach of
professional duty by PO resulting in a third party loss. The policy covers Civil
liability, defence costs and expenses, libel and slander (committed by PO or any
person employed by PO). The policy has a GBP250k excess. QBE are the lead
insurer.

Our strategy, particularly in relation to our FI products, and the increased risks
this brings to the organisation, means that we should consider purchasing
Professional Indemnity insurance for the whole organisation. The review is
underway and insurers have spent some time with PO assessing the exposures.
POL’s cover will be extended to align with POMS so this decision will be taken to
allow renewal of both policies on Dec 1°.

Cyber Liability

71

7.2

This insurance is purchased as a specific requirement for the DVLA and Border
Agency contracts and is a broad cover, extending to breach of privacy, extortion,
network security, as well as breach of data. This policy renews in April 2016.

One of our key strategic risks relates to data protection and data integrity. The
Insurance review has identified that consideration should be given to purchasing
Cyber Liability across PO which would offer us a level of protection in the event
of a significant loss.

Re: Litigation Half Year Update
Purpose:

1. Risk and Compliance Committee to review the following Litigation report for the 2015/16 Half
Year Briefing Book, prior to submission to ARC.
POL00110129
POL00110129

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 PAPER SIX
Litigation Report Extract for 2015/16 Half Year Briefing Book:

17. Litigation and Claims - Potential Claims regarding Horizon (Half Year 2015-2016)

Background

17.1 Post Office Limited has received various claims from postmasters (PMs) alleging defects in
the Horizon system and Post Office’s internal processes. These allegations were initially
made more than 3 years ago in 5 claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths. Similar
allegations have been made by the “Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance” (JFSA) and
advanced through PMs’ MPs.

17.2 Following discussions with James Arbuthnot MP and JFSA, in July 2012 independent
investigator Second Sight Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) was appointed to carry out a
review into these allegations.

17.3. On 8 July 2013, Second Sight published a Report finding shortcomings in Post Office’s
internal training and support to PMs on the Horizon system, but no systemic problems with
Horizon itself.

17.4 Following Second Sight’s July 2013 Report, on 27 August 2013 Post Office launched an
Investigation and Mediation Scheme aimed at understanding and resolving individual
complaints made about Horizon.

Mediation Scheme

17.5 The Scheme received 150 applications, 136 of which were investigated in detail (the
remainder being either ineligible or swiftly resolved) and progressed through the Scheme
under the direction of a Working Group chaired by retired Court of Appeal Judge Sir
Anthony Hooper, and comprising representatives from Post Office, Second Sight, and JFSA.

17.6 On 10 March 2015, Post Office agreed to mediate all cases remaining in the Scheme except
those the subject of a previous court ruling, and closed the Working Group.

17.7. On 9 April 2015 Second Sight produced a “Briefing Report - Part Two”, ostensibly to assist
applicants understand certain themes common to multiple applications. Although the report
found that the majority of the investigated branch losses were caused by “errors made at
the counter”, Post Office was unable to endorse Second Sight’s report as a whole, and
produced a Reply to correct inaccuracies and provide information excluded by Second Sight.

17.8 Second Sight has now completed its reviews of the individual Scheme cases and its
engagement with Post Office has ended. Steps have been taken to ensure the preservation
and return to Post Office of all documentation considered or generated as part of its
engagement.

17.9 Currently, 59 cases are waiting for mediation to be scheduled or take place. All mediations
will continue to be overseen by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), the
independent organisation appointed by Post Office to administer the mediations.

17.10 Orchestrated by the JFSA, 43 applicants indicated their wish to withdraw from, or postpone,
mediation until such time as the Scheme is ‘reviewed by Parliament’. We have however
written to all Applicants with cases approved for mediation requesting that they contact
CEDR by 4 September 2015 to arrange a date for mediation, failing which we would
consider their case closed.

Political Activity.

17.11 The Scheme and allegations concerning Horizon continue to generate Parliamentary activity
following the Westminster Hall Debate on 17 December 2014 and a BIS Select Committee
hearing on 3 February 2015.

17.12 Andrew Bridgen MP, now leading the Parliamentary campaign following James Arbuthnot’s
retirement, asked for a judicial enquiry during an Adjournment debate on 29 June 2015 and
during Prime Minister’s Questions on 1 July 2015.

17.13 The position being communicated by BIS is that no inquiry is necessary as those with
complaints have existing routes to resolution available to them (mediation, appeal or
litigation). It is however possible that a newly constituted BIS Select Committee could bring
POL00110129
POL00110129

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 PAPER SIX
further scrutiny in due course. Post Office’s Communications team is managing this activity
with support from the Mediation Scheme team.

Legal Activity

17.14 To date, no claim has been made against Post Office in the civil courts, and no appeal has
been made to the Court of Appeal against any conviction obtained in the criminal courts,
arising out of the matters raised in Second Sight’s reports or through the Scheme.

17.15 “Horizon” has been raised as a defence to one court claim brought by Post Office for
repayment of a £50k branch debt. Post Office Legal and external solicitors are managing
this case, which is in the early stages of the court’s case management procedure,

Media Activity

17.16 The Scheme and allegations concerning Horizon continue to generate media interest, most
significantly the BBC Panorama programme “Trouble at the Post Office” broadcast on 17
August 2015.

17.17 We are continuing to engage with the BBC about the programme, which we consider
broadcast untrue and damaging allegations about Post Office. The programme did not
however produce anything with which we were unfamiliar, and so far has not been picked
up widely by other media.

17.18 Post Office’s Communications team continues to manage this media activity.

Regulatory Activity

17.19 Post Office is engaging with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in relation to 20
applications made by former PMs seeking a review of their convictions, 16 of whom are
applicants to the Scheme. The CCRC can refer a case to the Court of Appeal if its review
identifies new evidence or legal argument which gives rise to a “real possibility” that the
conviction would be overturned on appeal.

17.20 Post Office’s Legal team is liaising with the CCRC so as to comply with its statutory
obligations under the Criminal Appeals Act 1995, and has provided to the CCRC very
substantial documentation for review. The CCRC has not indicated how long it will take to
complete its reviews, but it is it not anticipated that they will be completed before calendar
year end 2015.

17.21 Post Office also received 45 simultaneous “Data Subject Access Requests” (DSARs), 42 of
which have been made by Scheme applicants. Post Office’s Mediation Scheme, Legal and
Information Security teams are coordinating Post Office’s responses to the DSARs in
accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

17.22 Post Office has applied substantial resources to the DSARs, and anticipates completing its
responses by the end of October 2015. Applicants may however make formal complaints to
the Information Commissioner’s Office if they are not satisfied by the timing or content of
the response they receive.

Property Regulatory internal audit has continued to work with Legal in assisting Property to implement adequate governance and
Compliance controls around regulatory compliance requirements and attended the Property Compliance Forum.

The following issue was highlighted at the last Forum ( held on the 13" of August):
the safety certifications have expired for ail lifts within the Post Office estate as the assessments have not been
carried out by the service provider (Norland). The assessments are the independent means of verification, proving
lifts are safe and providing assurance to the regulator and third parties (i.e. Health and Safety Executive) that PO
has done everything reasonably possible to ensure lifts are well maintained. The verification exercise has now been
approved by PQ. Although no detailed farmal programme af works has yet been provided by Norland. The
verifications are expected to be completed by mid-October,

The issues highlighted at the August RCC meeting have nat been fully addressed:

* Responsi les to oversee property compliance matters have not been assigned to any GE sub-committee,

+ The Property Compliance Forum operates without formal Terms of Reference (a draft version has been prepared
but still not f lly approved and adopted). There is no formal mechanism to escalate the issues and risks
identified to a higher management level or committee.

2 are no PO dedicated compliance resources providing first line of defence and assurance to mitigate property
compliance issues. PO is currently reliant on an interim manager seconded (part time} from Norland, who is
technically competent but in no way independent.

* There is a need for more rigorous contract management of the services provided by Noriand and Servest to ensure
expected performance levels are maintained and the necessary compliance is achieved in a Umely manner.

An initial meeting have been scheduled for the 4th of September between Legal, internal Audit and Procurement
team to discuss how address the above issues.

Whilst it is acknowledged that the focus of Procurement has been on the

Background

The management of supplier contracts within PO

is split between the

Procurement team and business area that benefits from the relevant service. For
IT contracts some elements of contract management are undertaken by Atos.
The objective of the review was to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of
current processes and controls over contract management with a specific focus
on managing supplier performance.

* There have been some changes to management during the review with leads
for both non-IT and IT contracts leaving PO in December (non-IT) and March

Key issues

that the lack of focus on ‘business-as-usual’ contract management has
brought its own associated costs.

The report has three overarching messages on contract management at PO:

1. The split of roles and responsibilities between Procurement and the
business is not clearly understood or communicated.

2. PO does not fully recognise and understand the different risks and
complexity attached to different types of contracts.

3. PO contract portfolio is not fully known at present.

3. Staff have the ability to define their own roles and responsibilities.

4. Management are unable to effectively foresee and manage expiration
of contracts.

Bravo, 111 contracts had

APPENDIX A - PWC Framework

Best Practice

A mature contract management control environment is based on a formal framework which all personnel involved in contract management are aware of,
understand and follow in the sourcing, procuring, managing and operating of contracts. A framework should include the following:

Categorisation of contracts This allows flexibility across different contracts dependent on the size, risk, value and complexity of a contract
arrangement. Each category is subject to different levels of oversight with the most basic contracts requiring
very minor on-going monitoring and the more complex contracts requiring more regular and detailed
monitoring, independent assurance and collaboration across the organisation.

Roles and responsibilities These should be clearly defined within the framework. It should be clear who is accountable for what and
individuals should be incentivised accordingly (e.g. fixed reward or variable).

Clear linkage between The individuals responsible for the operation of the contract should be involved in agreeing the scope, Service

procurement and the business Level Agreements and KPIs set within the contract as they will be responsible for managing the contract once in

function operation. At the very least there should be a formal handover from procurement to the business function.

Clear plan for Depending on the length and complexity of a contract it can take a number of months to renew/tender a

renewing/renegotiating contract. Trigger dates should exist for all contracts for this process to begin to avoid operating expired

contracts on expiry contracts.

Minimum management A minimum level of management information should be defined up front and be maintained for each contract

information requirements (the level of which will depend on the categorisation of the contract) as this allows for consistency across
contract management.

Action 1667 (refresh the gifts and hospitality process “with Commercial) was discussed and SM
confirmed that the risk team were in the process of reminding the Commercial team of the
requirements. NK queried why the action was confined to Commercial and was reminded that the
Gifts and Hospitality report at the last meeting had shown very few reports from Commercial.

Action 1666 (present the Conduct Risk Audit to the Committee) had not in fact been closed, as a
timing issue meant the papers were not cleared in time to be presented to the meeting. The audit
will be presented at the September meeting.

For Action 1660 (clarify Business Transformation reporting line for risk and assurance) JM noted
that there were regular BT risk workshops but that these were not governance meetings, and it had
been agreed with the Transformation Director that transformation risks would be presented to the
RCC as a regular item from October onwards.

For Action 1657 (POMS reporting at RCC) JM confirmed that going forward POMS RCC minutes
would be presented to the POL RCC (see item 2) and noted that POMS ARC papers would be
presented to the POL ARC.

The committee agreed the minutes of the previous meeting and the attached actions.

da Item 2, POMS RCC minutes and actions _

The committee asked NK whether there were any concerns arising as a 2 result of the Collinsons
audit. NK noted that POMS had recently undergone a series of audits which had generally shown
that it was in good order, despite having only recently been established.

JM asked if the approach to customer detriment was the same in POL and POMS, and NK confirmed
that as customer delivery is managed through POL the approach is the same.

NK clarified that POMS has regulatory authority and responsibility for online and telephone sales at
present but does not commence oversight of sales within POL branches until 1°t October.

AC noted that the style of minute taking in the POMS minutes was more detailed than in the POL
RCC meeting, and wondered if this created a risk of recording something that might be taken out of
context at a later date. The Committee discussed the more comprehensive style of minute taking
required by a regulatory authority and JM noted that the FCA would be looking for evidence of
challenge to be demonstrated in the meeting. The Committee requested that JM speak to Victoria
Moss to stress importance of capturing this in the POMS RCC minutes (Action 1668).

“Agenda Item 3, Risk profileupdate _

SM presented the updated risk profile, which included a method of comparing POL’s stated risk
appetite to the risk exposure of each top risk. This enabled the Committee to consider whether the
level of risk exposure was in line with the amount of risk the business was comfortable taking.
Incidents and metrics were used to demonstrate whether the qualitative evaluation of risk
exposure (the risk score) was correct. The Committee discussed the report and agreed that it was
a good start and that work should continue to improve the articulation of controls, and the quality
and number of metrics and incidents. It was agreed that SM would engage with Committee
members to gain their feedback on the top risks prior to presentation of the revised risk profile in
the September meeting (Action 1669).

PV queried why Sparrow was not included in the list of the top risks and it was agreed that there
would be a separate discussion with JM to determine the appropriate treatment for Sparrow
(Action 1670).

The Committee was asked to note the examples contained in these papers as further detail on
incidents as mentioned in the risk profile update.

an

SM gave an update on the current status of business continuity planning in the business. The
Committee discussed the situation and agreed that there was both a need to understand POL’s
business continuity landscape in order to identify the gaps, and to test and improve business
continuity arrangements on existing key systems.

JM explained that there is no existing resource in the business who can do this (the business
continuity function is currently being backfilled by a risk business partner who is spending most of
his time on business continuity elements in current procurement processes). JM agreed to
determine the scope of the task and estimate the cost and then discuss with AC (Action 1671).

The Committee noted that it was likely that there were existing business continuity processes in
place covering key systems used in customer critical functions such as Supply Chain and the call
centres, PV requested that the key systems were identified and the relevant SLT members asked if
they were confident that business continuity arrangements were in place (Action 1672).

SM briefly explained that there was no single POL-wide incident management process but instead a
series of disparate reporting lines, and that further work was needed to identify the optimum
solution for POL. The Committee approved the suggested next steps which include a report to the

September RCC (Action 1673).
Agence rly and vulnerable customers review

MG and AP updated the Committee on the work that had been done on POL’s approach to elderly
2

POL00110129
POL00110129

RCC 7 SEPTEMBER 2015 PAPER EIGHT
Post Office Ltd —- Confidential

and vulnerable customers since the last Committee meeting. This had included a review of the
existing processes and procedures in place and identification of the gaps. It had been discovered
that a Disability and Discrimination working group had been established and it was proposed that
the vulnerable customer work would include their input.

The Committee discussed the definition of vulnerable customers, and recommended that the word
‘elderly’ was dropped from the description, as not all elderly customers are vulnerable, nor all
vulnerable customers elderly. It was noted that it was sometimes challenging to identify
vulnerable customers, particularly in the case of temporary vulnerability such as bereavement. AC
requested that the costs of any proposed initiatives be reported.

MG agreed to provide a one page update to each successive Committee meeting until this work is
completed (Action 1674).

PV requested that MG identify the most common sensitive situations where vulnerable customers
were encountered (for example, an elderly person whose phone line has developed a fault, or a
customer whose relative has died) and ensure that special arrangements were in place and had
been communicated to the relevant staff. A short summary of this activity should be provided to
the next meeting (Action 1675).

JS provided the Committee with key highlights from the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) report.

It had been identified that up to 2% of branch transactions exceeded the 15,000 Euro limit
imposed by POL’s class of registration with HMRC. A top-performing branch was currently being
investigated for performing transactions above permitted limits and the Committee agreed that it
was important that correct action was taken with regard to the agent who had failed to follow the
required procedure. The Committee discussed whether POL should consider offering higher value
transactions; JM explained that a higher value of transaction brought more onerous customer due
diligence requirements and any proposal would need to take this into account. JS explained that
the 4' Anti-Money Laundering Directive will reduce the Euro limit to 10,000 Euros and the
Committee noted that this is a relatively small amount. JS explained that HMRC was concerned
because we cannot track customer spending between different branches.

JS also explained that HMRC were suggesting that POL has ownership and liability for AML matters
relating to bill payments on six of our bill payment clients, because of the structure of the
contracts.

The Committee discussed the potential mismatch between the contractual responsibility for AML
which lies with our banking partners, and the regulatory expectation that we will be carrying out
appropriate monitoring and training.

JS explained that there was currently no dedicated AML resource at managerial level, although he
was recruiting for a band 4 position which was intended to cover both Financial Crime and AML. JM
explained that in order to get a clear understanding of what POL’s risk and responsibilities were
around AML an external review would be commissioned which would, initially, be funded from the
legal budget.

JS mentioned that they were also looking at possible technological solutions to help with
monitoring, and the Committee recommended that this be discussed with the Back Office
programme. NK asked JS to meet him and Jono Hill to discuss forex and bill payment issues
(Action 1676).

discussed the relevance of conducting cancellation call
audits and it was explained that this is due to the FCA’s
focus on Post Sale Barriers (PSB) within this area. The
members discussed whether there is a risk-based way of

Executive Summary

Post Office's Board and Group Executive (GE) recognise that Cyber and Information
Security threats present significant commercial and operational risk to Post Office and to
those of its subsidiaries. GE are committed to developing a strategic response to current
and emerging Cyber and Information Security threats as an enabling mechanism for Post
Office to achieve its growth, modernisation, customer focus and employee engagement
objectives whilst preserving Post Offices’ brand, commercial image, reputation, competitive
advantage, revenues, and profitability alongside legal, regulatory and contractual
compliance.

In response to this, GE have devolved accountability for Cyber and Information Security to
the General Counsel and established the Information and Security and Assurance Group
(ISAG) who are ultimately responsible for the establishment, implementation, maintenance
and continual improvement of Post Office’s Cyber Security and Information Assurance
(CSIA) framework.

Organisational Structure

General Counsel has devolved responsibility for CSIA to the Head of Information Security
and Assurance who is supported by ISAG. Additional CSIA contractors will be recruited and
allocated on a needs basis for specific Post Office projects or programmes.

Head of ISAG
Risk & Compliance Technical Data Protection and
Assurance Privacy

Figure 1: ISAG High Level Structure

Scope

The scope of ISAG includes responsibility for the systemic security governance, risk
assessment and compliance oversight across all business areas within Post Office and our
third party supply chain. These are generally consistent with the recommendations in the
ISO 27002 code of practice and the associated ISO 27001 Information Security
Management System standard. Another key benchmark is the PCI-DSS (Payment Card
Industry-Data Security Standard).

Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the General Counsel with respect to CSIA are as follows:

e Presentation of CSIA reporting to GE.
e Ensure ISAG is adequately resourced.

Due Diligence

Since part of the Post Office’s strategy is to multisource / outsource, ISAG involvement is
imperative in new programme initiatives including any transformation activities. The ISAG
involvement shall be mandated by the inclusion of information security within the
Programme Initiation Documentation as a Design Authority contributor. For newly created
business activity at the time of the High Level Design creation, Information Security and
Assurance Group shall be involved to ensure that they are able to advise and assist at the
earliest opportunity to ensure risks are managed appropriately.
