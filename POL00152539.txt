Hi Tom
As discussed towards the end of last week, here is a draft reply for Paula to send to BNR.

As you will see, it expresses a ready willingness to meet but does flag that a) this won’t be the first time we have tried
this and that b) it’s not clear what more the PO could do (indeed, there really isn’t any more we can do).

The suggestion is that Mark and I attend for the PO. Jane has seen and is happy with this letter but is, as you know, on
some well-deserved leave. We do not judge it appropriate for Paula to attend and the fact of her not doing so has the
added bonus of reducing the ability of MPs to make mischief about the fact of the meeting.

However, we do think it would be useful for Paula to have a candid conversation with BNR if time could be found. As
Paula is aware from her meeting with Mr Bridgen and others in November of last year (and the subsequent WHD and BIS
Select Committee), we are not dealing with genuinely open minds with an interest in what the facts of the cases actually
demonstrate. In our view/experience, anything that falls short of the PO making admissions and payments for which
there is simply no justification will not satisfy those with a predetermined outcome in mind, irrespective of what the
evidence shows. However, we’re obviously keen to do what we can to help BIS help us.

We’re keen to have this meeting just as soon as possible and certainly before the Summer Recess.

Happy to discuss of course.

Patrick
