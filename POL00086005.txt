Agency Changes Communiqué (ACC)

To: Angela Van Den Bogerd, RMs, FCAs, John Breeden, Lin Norbury, Contracts
Admin. Team, Contract Advisors, Steve Northey, Kjetil Fuglestad, Ketul Patel,

cc: ACC distribution list.
From: Paul Inwood, Agents Contracts and Policy Development Manager.

Date: 16th June 2011.

Subject: Policy and Process Amendments to ACC 12/2009 (Deployment of Post
Office® operating models in cases of summary termination and resignation to avoid
summary termination.)

1. Introduction and purpose

ACC 12/2009 set out our approach to deal with potential operating model change in
cases where an agent's contract had been summarily terminated, or where the agent
had resigned to avoid that outcome. Further to a review of that, this document
explains a number of policy and process changes, and should be read in conjunction
with that ACC.

This ACC does not deal with the adoption of the Main PO model as there is a
separate BAU process for that. For the avoidance of doubt, cases where 3 months
notice has been given are out of scope of this policy.

2. Summary of the change.

2.1 Policy

2.1.1. Where the Network Planning Team deem it appropriate, vacancies resulting
from the circumstances described at 1 above will be advertised and filled on the

basis of the preferred operating model (i.e. not the Subpostmaster model) as
specified by the Network Planning Team ,however see 2.1.3 below.

2.1.2 In cases where long term vacancies have existed and where no formal interest
has resulted in that vacancy being filled, and the termination / resignation to avoid

termination occurred before the release of ACC 12/2009, because of the length of
time that has now elapsed and the lack of interest, it will now be appropriate to apply

2.1.1 above. Where the site is appropriate for PO Local, steps will need to be taken
by the FCA in liaison with HRSC to ensure that the vacancy is now advertised as the
desired model, and the ex-agent

informed in writing of that fact using the 2H below. In cases where an application has
already been enlivened on IRIS and an application submitted, we should not seek to
change the basis upon which that vacancy is filled, unless the application is not then
successful.

2.1.3. In exceptional cases only, and only with the authority of the Head of Network
Services, where it has not been possible to fill vacancies using the PO Local model,
vacancies may be filled using the subpostmaster / a different suitable model. The
FCA should provide the background to such cases to the Regional Manager (RM),
who, where appropriate, will seek to obtain authority from the Head of Network
Services.

Note that this provision will end at a point in time when we will not be able to issue
legacy contracts. Further instructions on how we will manage the transition to that
state in general will be issued nearer the time.

2.2 Process and documentation.

The following amendments have been made, and are reflected in the documents at
3. below.

- Terminology has been changed / aligned where necessary.
- A return deadline of 14 days has been included in letters where appropriate.

- A revised letter 2B to deal with resignation to avoid termination in all such
cases.

- A ‘follow-up’ letter 2G has been included for cases where there is no response

- Reference to a ‘new operating model’ in letter2E to the ex-subpostmaster has
been removed

- Letter 2F is now sent by the FCA and not the Regional Manager.

- Instructions to HRSC regarding the model to be advertised are made clearer.
- Aletter 2H has been added to deal with cases described in 2.1.2 above.

- Aletter 2J has been added to be used by the FCA in cases where it is not

clear who is in control of the premises

NB. Advertised remuneration for vacancies should only be sourced from the
Network Planning Team, not the Agents Pay Team or HRSC / other sources.
