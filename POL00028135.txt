    CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

                This Statement of Service Requirements (SSR) is supplied to remaining qualifying
                prospective Service Providers who -responded satisfactorily to Notice Reference 94/S
                165-58937/EN in the Official Journal of the European Communities published on 30
                August 1994 and were shortlisted following the evaluation of their response to a
                Request for a Statement of Capability. Relevant information has been provided
                previously in:

                •     the information pack containing the prospectus "Bringing Technology to Post
                      Offices and Benefit Payments"; and

                •     the "Request for a Statement of Capability".

                Reference may be made to information contained in these earlier documents.

                Nothing in this SSR or any of the documents mentioned above, binds the Contracting
                Authorities to award a contract to any bidder, and nothing in this SSR or any of the
                documents mentioned above is to be taken as constituting an agreement, offer or
                representation that a contract will be awarded in accordance with any procedure referred
                to in the aforementioned documents or at all.


    1.1         PURPOSE

    1.1. l.     The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements of the Contracting
                Authorities, who are Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL) and the Department of Social
                Security (DSS). The Benefit Agency (BA) is the project sponsor on behalf of the DSS,
                DHSS Northern Ireland and other government agencies. The requirements are for the
                design, development, integration, support, operation and management of computer and
                related services referred to in this and the documents previously provided. Prospective
,               Service Providers should read this SSR carefully before responding.

    1.1.2.      The requirements are both diverse and complex. Some relate to the provision of a more
                efficient solution to problems within the existing businesses of BA and POCL (in
                particular the payment of benefits at post offices) while others concern the provision of
                a strategic IT infrastructure to support a programme which will incorporate POCL's
                anticipated future business requirements.

    1.1.3.      In this SSR, where the business of BA or DSS is described, it should be assumed, unless
                otherwise stated, that this extends to cover the requirements of other departments and
                agencies which will use the Benefits Payment Service (BPS).

1.2         OBJECTIVES

1.2.1.      All parties recognise and commit to the programme's overall service objectives which

            •     a fraud-free method of paying benefits at post offices that is automated, has lower
                  end-to-end costs than the current paper-based process, with continuously reducing
                  overall administration costs year on year;

            •     extending automation to POCL's other client transactions, its products and its
                  support processes to improve competitiveness, increase efficiency, and to enable
                  greater commercial opportunities for POCL;

            •     full and speedy reconciliation of benefits payments, with accounting arrangements
                  consistent with recognised accountancy practices;

1.2.2.      In addition, there are detailed sets of objectives for BA and for POCL, as follows.

            BA Objectives

1.2.3.      The automation of the benefits payment service through post offices is seen as a major

                  evidence to support prosecution of illegal action;

            (d)   provide full accounting and reconciliation facilities;

            (e)   reduce current administration costs, secure the lowest value for money cost for the

            •     integration of POCL, BA, and/or third party software applications.

1.5.2       Constraints

1.5.2.1.    The detailed design of this service is a matter for the Service Provider but the overall
            solution proposed must be acceptable to both Contracting Authorities, be economically
            advantageous to both Contracting Authorities and meet the programme objectives. In
            particular the Service Provider must have regard to the areas below (which are listed in
            no significant order and are not exhaustive):

            •     Legal

                 The service must operate within the legislative requirements applying to the
                 Service Provider, POCL, BA, and any authorised agents, customers and clients.

            •     Security

                 The service must operate in accordance with existing security standards adopted
                 by POCL and BA. Any security standards imposed by the Service Provider must
                 be compatible with those of POCL and BA.

            •     Financing

                 It is desirable to procure the services under the Private Finance Initiative of the
                 UK Government.

            •     Standards and Architecture

                  A common set of technical standards and architecture for the boundaries of the
                  5ervices and infrastructure is imperative. The Service Provider's system must be
                  able to exchange information with the computer systems of the Contracting
                  Authorities and their authorised agents and clients.

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

            The purpose of this chapter is to provide background information about the Contracting
            Authorities, non-specific to this requirement, which places them in context in terms of
            si:ze (both organisational and financial) and business functionality.


2.1         OVERVIEW OF POST OFFICE COUNTERS LTD

2.1.1       Structure and Size

2.1.1.1.    POCL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office. It conducts its business through
            a national network of some 19,700 offices comprising about 750 directly operated
            offices (owned and staffed by POCL) and about 18,950 agency offices which are run by
            individuals or organisations as POCL agents. The turnover for 1993/94 was £1.1 billion,
            with 28 million customers each week being served by over 65,000 employees, agents
            and assistants in the UK• s largest retail chain.

            Staffing

2.1.1.2.    POCL has over 14,000 employees and 51,000 agents and assistants. These staff are
            based in post offices, 7 regional offices, Central Services Group, business centres, and
            Head Office.

            Network of Post Offices

2.1.1.3.    POCL's competitive advantage stems from its reach. POCL is an integral part of every
            cc,mmunity and has more outlets than banks and building societies combined. Since
            becoming a limited company within the Post Office Group in 1987. POCL can point to
            a track record of year by year growth in business and achievement of Government profit
            and efficiency targets. Business volume has grown steadily both in and out of the
            recession and over the last decade efficiency has improved by 13%.

2.1.1.4.    To improve service to customers and reduce costs POCL has been running a programme
            of converting directly operated offices to agency status and has developed a franchise
            post office concept which has been very successful. The agents run a variety of private
            enterprises alongside their post office: typically these are general stores, stationers, or
            confectioners/tobacconists/newsagents, while some have no private business and only
            operate a post office counter.

2.1.1.5.    POCL is committed to protecting the competitive advantage which comes from its
            extensive network. This includes the rural network where 'community offices' (offices
            with restricted opening hours) have been introduced in order to maintain a service to
            local populations. The network of post offices and its relationship with agents and
            franchisees will remain under POCL control and is beyond the scope of this
            procurement.

BA/POCL SSR                                                            RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                            Background

2.1.2       Main Areas of Business

2.1.2.1.    POCL's mission is to be the leading overall provider of benefits distribution, postal
            services, banking and bill payment facilities. Essentially the organisation is a channel
            for the movement of cash, information and stock, such as value items and forms,
            between customers who visit post offices daily and clients, such as BA and Royal Mail,
            for whom services are provided. Historically; POCL has been restricted in terms of the
            services it can provide and, as a result, the organisation is largely dependent on a small
            number of clients. Eight clients generate over 90% of the business carried out in post
            offices.

2.1.2.2.    POCL has had much success recently in expanding its client base - British Gas, National
            Rivers Authority and the National Lottery are notable examples and it has a growing
            own label retail segment through a network of almost 200 Post Shops. Bill payment and
            advance payment schemes have seen an increase in volume linked to the use of an
            automated payment terminal, described in chapters 3 and 4. With this equipment in
            place, POCL is aiming to secure a significant share of the utilities prepayment market.
            POCL has no monopoly: for every service offered, alternative and competitive services
            are available. Postage stamps can be bought at many other retail outlets, direct debit is
            an alternative means of paying bills, and ACT is an alternative method of paying
            benefits.

2.1.2.3.    It is the recognition of this competition which drives the business desire to develop an
            automated solution and improve the way benefits are paid. From an automated platform,
            POCL can improve the existing services it provides to other clients and exploit new
            opportunities. POCL sees opportunities in several areas, for example in retail banking
            by exploiting the opportunities presented by bank branch closures. Broadening the pre-
            pavment facility is a further opportunity and builds on the strong base already
            established with the automated payment services.

2.1.3       Commercial Nature of POCL

            Finance

2.1.3.1.    POCL had an income of£ 1089m for the year ended 31 March 1994 and made a profit of
            £ 12m after taxation.

2.1.3.2.    The income arises from POCL's many clients, own label retail products, licences and
            franchise fee income, as shown in the table below.

             Postal Communications (Royal Mail and Parcel force)              £243M
             Licence and Franchisee Fees                                        £7M
             Government Clients                                               £457M
             Retail, Banking and Utilities                                    £382M

                                                                            £1089M

                                           Background

2.1.3.3.    POCL prepares and publishes accounts which follow the requirements of the Companies
            Acts and Stock Exchange Listing rules, and is set targets by the Government. These are:

            •     Real Unit Costs (RUC}

                 This measures the extent to which POCL's costs rise more slowly than prices
                 generally.

            •     Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

                 This combined profit and asset utilisation target represents the percentage return
                 from the investment in the business.

            •    External Financing Limit (EFL)

                 The Post Office Group is required to generate a cash surplus as a contribution
                 towards the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. (The target for 1994-95 is
                 £226m.) POCL does not have a specific target for EFL, as it does with RUC and
                 ROCE, but it is required to contribute to the overall Post Office EFL target.

2.1.3.4.    The level of profit, income, expenditure, business volume, RUC and ROCE are the six
            financial key performance indicators utilised to manage POCL business.

            Legislative Framework

2.1.3.5.    POCL is an ordinary limited company whose shares are wholly owned by the Post
            Office. However POCL' s Memorandum forbids it from doing anything the Post Office
            is not allowed to do (subject to exceptions sanctioned by the President of the Board of
            Trade). Further, the Post Office Act 1969 (as amended) requires the Post Office Board
            to enforce this. Effectively therefore, POCL may only do what the Post Office may do,
            together with such other things as the President allows. However, the Government's
            recent green paper has confirmed a proposed enlargement of POCL' s commercial
            freedom.

2.2.1       Introduction

2.2.1.1.    The DSS is the executive arm of the UK Government responsible for: the development
            and delivery of the Social Security programme; War Pensions; the National Insurance
            Fund; and the implementation of the Child Support Act. It comprises a Headquarters

2.2.2       Relevant Agencies

2.2.2.1.    The required service will support some of the business functions of three of the
            executive agencies within the DSS (BA, Child Support Agency (CSA) and War
            Pensions Agency (WPA)), the Social Security Agency (SSA) which is an executive
            agency of the Department of Health and Social Security (Northern Ireland) (DHSS (NI))
            and the Employment Service (ES) which is an executive agency of the Department of
            Employment.

            Bent!flls Agency

2.2.2.2.    BA is the largest Government agency. Its primary aim is to help ministers meet social
            policy goals through the efficient delivery of social security benefits in a manner which
            meets the customers' needs and achieves best value for money. BA is responsible for
            administering payments of benefits in three main categories: contributory benefits;
            income related benefits; and benefits that are dependent on qualifying conditions.
            Additionally, BA acts as an agent on behalf of the Department of Health for the
            distribution of milk tokens. In certain circumstances payments of benefit may be made
            by agents acting on behalf of BA, e.g. ES who make combined payments of Income
            Support and Unemployment Benefit for those customers with dual qualification, and
            local authorities who make payment of Housing Benefit in respect of those customers
            who qualify.

            Child Support Agency

2.2.2.3.    The primary aims of the CSA are to deliver on behalf of children a fair and effective
            service for the assessment and payment of maintenance, and to ensure that parents
            maintain their children whenever they can afford to do so. In some circumstances the
            CSA make payments to customers by Girocheque.

            War Pensions Agency

2.2.2.4.    The primary aim of the WP A is to deliver a consistent, efficient and effective service for
            the assessment and payment of War Pensions and War Widows' Pensions. The WPA
            administers payments of War Pensions to customers who meet the relevant qualifying
            conditions.

            Social Security Agency (Northern Ireland)

2.2.2.5.    The primary objective of the SSA is the payment of benefit to the people of Northern
            Ireland. The range and rates of benefits payable equate to those on the UK mainland.

            The Employment Service

2.2.2.6.    Th~ overall aim of the ES is tc, promote a competitive, etf ,;ient and flexible labour
            market by helping into work unemployed people, especially those who are
            disadvantaged, and by paying benefits and allowances to those who are entitled to them.

                                            Background

2.2.2.7.    One of the ES's areas of responsibility is the delivery of unemployment benefits and
            training allowances. The ES pays Unemployment Benefit and Income Support on behalf
            of the DSS, and training allowances on behalf of the Department of Employment (DE),
            the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office.

2.2.3       Main Areas of Business

2.2.3.l.    The main areas of business of the agencies involved in and pertinent to this procurement
            are broadly similar. They can be divided into services offered to customers and support
            provided to ministers.

            Customer Charters

2.2.3.2.    The various agencies operate within the framework of responsibilities documented in
            their customer charters which detail the service customers have a right to expect from
            the agency and its staff. The charters set performance targets for the agencies (e.g. BA's
            administration of claims to benefit).

            Assessment of Eligibility and Entitlement

2.2.3.3.    Agencies have a responsibility for the assessment of whether a customer, applying for
            payment of a benefit administered by them, meets the relevant qualification criteria.
            These differ and are dependent on the type of benefit applied for. Customers provide the
            appropriate domestic, personal and/or financial information required to officers of the
            agency. Based on the information provided a decision as to their eligibility to receive
            the benefit applied for is taken. Dependent on the type of benefit, customers are required
            to declare any changes in their personal circumstances that may affect their continuing
            eligibility.

2.2.3.4.    Having adjudicated on a customers eligibility to receive benefit, their entitlement is
            calculated. Once entitlement has been calculated a notification is issued to the customer.

            Payment of Benefits

2.2.3.5.    The agencies' computer systems, having calculated a customer's entitlement to benefit,
            transmit payment award details which result in the issue of payments to customers. The
            rate of payment may not remain constant during the life of a customer's claim.

            Advice and guidance

2.2.3.6.    As a continuing customer service the agencies provide advice in relation to questions
            concerning, primarily, entitlement to and payment of benefits. These services generally
            take the form of telephone advice-lines and may be located on either a national, regional
            or local basis.

                                           Background

            Support of Ministers

2.2.3.7.    The DSS assists Government with the administration of existing Government policy,
            development and implementation of new policies and direct support of ministers in their
            duties.

2.2.4       Funding

2.2.4.1.    The social security programme has two somces of finance. The cost of contributory
            benefits and their administration is met from the National Insurance Fund. Non-
            contributory benefits and their administration are financed from money voted by
            Parliament from general taxation, paid into the Consolidated Fund.

2.2.4.2.    Additionally, training payments made by the ES are financed from general taxation via
            votes held by Department of Employment, Scottish Office and the Welsh Office.

2.2.5       Legislative Framework

2.2.5.1.    The DSS and its agencies operate within a legislative framework provided by Acts of
            Parliament and associated Statutory Instruments. Of particular relevance to this
            procurement are the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Claims
            and Payments regulations, and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.

2.2.5.2.    Additionally, training payments made by the ES are covered by the Employment
            Training Acts of 1973 and 1988.

             (e.g. the National Lottery). POCL is looking more professionally at where post offices
             are located, how they look, and what type of layout best meets its customers needs.
             POCL is experimenting with:

             •                     queue hosting, a technique where a member of staff assists customers with fonns
                                   and queries before reaching the counter;

            •                      open plan offices, removing the physical barriers between staff, agents and
                                   customers.

2.3.1.6.    POCL is committed to its total quality programme which has become firmly embedded
            in the business. At post offices, this manifests itself as "Putting the Customer First" and
            forms the basis of local quality improvement projects linked to individual post office
            customer surveys.

2.3.1.7.    During any change therefore (e.g. the introduction of new technology), customer
            acceptability must be the paramount consideration. POCL must protect its core values of
            integrity and personal service, and maintain the brand its customers recognise. This
            means accuracy of transactions, choice and protection of identity.

2.4         KEY FEATURES OF EXISTING DSS BUSINESS

2.4.1       Introduction

2.4.1.1.    This section highlights the high level key features, relevant to benefit payments, of the
            core business of the DSS, SSA (DHSS NI) and ES which characterise the service
            provided by the existing agencies and any future Service Providers. The primary
            function of the agencies is to deliver benefits in accordance with the law and to the
            satisfaction of ministers and customers. The aim of the agencies is to fulfil this function
            economically, efficiently and effectively with due regard to the varying needs of their
            customers.

2.4.2       Performance Targets

2.4.2.1.    High level targets, covering a wide range of key issues, are set by the Secretary of State.
            The chief executives, in consultation with the Department's headquarters additionally
            set a range of internal targets, relating to matters such as clearance times and accuracy
            rates for individual benefit types. Performance targets relating to clearance times for
            processing benefit claim applications appear within the customer charters of the relevant
            agencies. Customer charters may be purchased from her Majesty's Stationery Office
            (HMSO).

2.4.3       Customer Issues

2.4.3.1.    The DSS pays social security benefits to some 30 million people, who fall within the
            following broad customer groups (which may be subject to change):

            (a)   the elderly;

            (b)   long-term sick and disabled;

            (c)   short-term sick;

BA/POCL SSR                                                                        RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                                  Background

            (d)      families;

            (e)      unemployed;

            (f)     war pensioners;

            (g)     widows and others.

2.4.3.2.    Each agency has a responsibility for the provision of differing services for different
            customer groups. It is, however, likely that an individual customer will have dealings
            with more than one agency during their lifetime, and often simultaneously. Generally
            the output of their contact will be a calculation of entitlement and subsequent award of
            benefit

            Confulentiality, Integrity and Availability of Information.

2.4.3.3.    The DSS must comply with the Data Protection Act 1984 which gives legal rights to
            individuals about whom information is recorded on computer.

2.4.4       Payment Of Benefit

2.4.4.1.    In terms of transactions, at post offices alone (excluding other payment methods such as
            ACn, BA authorised almost 1000 million individual payments in 1993/94. Full details
            of volumes can be found in appendix 3-8.

2.4.4.2.    There are three broad benefit types administered by the DSS (grouped within which are
            over 30 individual benefits), each agency being responsible for the administration of a
            number of the individual benefits which fall within these broad bands. The agencies
            assess entitlement of customers against the qualifying criteria associated with each
            benefit type prior to awarding a payment. Each type of benefit is intended to meet
            different categories of need. The table below (Table 2-5) shows each type, the basis for
            entitlement and some examples of individual benefits.

                                             Background

            NewBeneflls

2.4.4.3.    The current list of individual benefit types is subject to change. Benefits may be
            introduced, changed or withdrawn according to Acts of Parliament. An example is the
            recent ministerial announcement concerning the introduction of Job Seekers Allowance
            in 1996. Take-up of this benefit will lead to the phased withdrawal of Unemployment
            Benefit.

            Rating of Benefits

2.4.4.4.    The rate of benefit to which a customer is entitled may change frequently during the life
            of a claim. There are two main factors which may necessitate the rate of payment
            changing. These are described in brief below:

            (a)   Statutory Re-rating

                  Parliament annually reviews the rate of benefit payments. Decisions are generally
                  announced in November for implementation the following April.

            (b)   Circumstantial Re-rating

                  A customer' s circumstances may change during the life of their claim to benefit.
                  Dependent on the nature of this change it may lead to a re-assessment of their
                  entitlement to benefit which in turn may require benefit payments to be either
                  increased (up-rated) or decreased (down-rated).

            Emergency Procedures

2.4.4.5.    Tue DSS has a statutory obligation to make payments of benefit to those who are
            entitled and within set performance timescales. DSS, SSA and ES have agreed with
            POCL, and other agents a set of emergency procedures to ensure the continuing
            payment of benefit in the event of normal service delivery failure. Existing emergency
            procedures are detailed in appendix 2-5.

2.4.5       Auditability

2.4.5.1.    It is a feature of the existing service that there is a requirement to produce audit trail
            information in conformance both with the DSS Departmental Security Standards (see
            appendix 2-3) and the DSS Common Audit Trail Model (see appendix 2-8).

 CHAPTER 3. EXISTING SERVICES

               •s chapter describes the existing service applications administered by the Contracting
            Authorities, their authorised agents or clients. In the case of POCL, services are
            p~vided to a number of diverse customers and clients. In the case of DSS the
            ap lication detailed describes the end-to-end benefit payment process. In general this
            c ter describes those aspects of current services that:

            (a)   will be directly affected or replaced by the service being procured; or

            (b)   will be required to interface or exchange with the new services; or

            (c)   may be added to the procured service infrastructure in the future.


3.1         POCL SERVICES

3.1.1       Summary

3.1.1.1.    A summary of the wide range of services that POCL offers is given in this section. This
            section is not intended to represent its clients' requirements for automated products. A
            summary of the range of services, processing and IT services POCL currently offers and
            supports is set out below with further details at appendix 3-1. This section is merely
            intended as background to the products and services and does not represent the
            specification for automated services.

3.1.1.2.    The Service Provider will be expected to work with POCL to develop and engineer both
            replacement and new products and services, and to consider appropriate product roll-out
            and implementation plans. The interface with clients, agents and customers will remain
            under POCL' s control. POCL's IS Strategy (see appendix 3-2) defines its approach to
            automated products and transactions. This section is purely background information to
            aid understanding of POCL' s present product offering.

            Benefit Payments

3.1.1.3.    Full details of the POCL procedures for benefit payments have been included in section
            3.4, and are summarised below.

3.1.1.4.    Details of the current order book system for the payment of pensions and allowances are
            given in section 3.4.7 and this work is carried out on behalf of BA and SSA (NI).

3.1.1.5.    Other benefit payments include unemployment benefits and social fund loans which are
            paid via Girocheques.

3.1.1.6.    Pension payments are also made on behalf of the Ministry of Defence via an order book
            system. Other benefit related products include the issue of milk tokens and prescription
            refunds on behalf of the Department of Health. Various initiatives have been trialed
            aimed at reducing fraud including the use of electronic stop notices. Plans are currently
            underway for the provision during 1995 of an electronic stop notice system at

 BA/POCL SSR                                                               RESTRICTED- Commercial
                                              Existing Services

               approximately 1470 post offices in the M25 area using PCs and bar code reading
               technology (the Automation of London Post Offices project - ALPS). The ALPS project
               is considered to be completely stand-alone but Service Providers should consider this
               equipment and functionality as part of their migration proposals. In view of the fact that
               the ALPS equipment will replace some ECCO+ terminals and automated payment
               terminals (APT) it is also required to provide additional functionality. More details on
               ALPS are included in section 3.2.5 and chapter 4.

               Postal and Communications

3.1.1.7.       Post offices sell a range of stamps, stamp books and related products at all offices for
               use on inland and international mail. Philatelic products, e.g. first day covers and
               presentation packs are also available at all directly operated and selected agency offices.
               Letters, packets and parcels, with payment via stamps or meter impressions, are
               accepted for both inland and international postings. Priority services such as Recorded,
               Registered, Guaranteed Delivery, and Datapost are also provided on behalf of both
               Royal Mail and Parcelforce. There is also an extensive range of support services such as
               meter resetting.

3.1.1.8.       On the communications front, POCL retail BT phonecards and is examining other
               options for the provision of telephony related products and services.

3.1.1.9.       Opportunities in this market range from the use of track and trace technology to
               improved stock control, management information for retail products and improved
               product/sales support for staff and agents. There is limited systems support in this area
               although electronic scales are in use in some offices. The ECCO+ system which is
               described in chapters 3 and 4 also provides management information via POCL central
               systems.

               Licensing

3 .1.1. l 0.   Payment and collection services in the licensing market currently include television
               licences, motor vehicle licences, fishing and game licences, and the provision of
               passport services. In addition to the actual purchase there are a range of prepayment
               options which centre around the purchase and redemption of savings stamps.

3. l .1.11.    Some small-scale trials using the automated payment terminal (APT) are underway
               which involve the provision of savings facilities (for a licence) via a card based system.
               It is envisaged that full automation would facilitate further development of this along
               with improved authorisation and processing facilities.

               Financial Services

3.1.1.12.      POCL is the largest handler of cash in the UK. A range of in-payment and out-payment
               facilities is operated on behalf of Girobank and the Department for National Savings.
               Services include business deposits, cwTent and savings accounts, an<l cash handling
               facilities, as well as premium bonds and saving certificates.

                                            Existing Services

3.l.J.13.     New services in this market include the provision of travel related services such as
              bureau de change and money transmission, thereby enhancing POCL' s existing offering
              (passports). Plans are also underway to offer a travel insurance facility, and other
              insurance services are under consideration. POCL also envisages future developments in
              the cash and savings areas to improve its competitiveness.

3.1.1.14.     An automated infrastructure is seen as supporting or complementing the product
              offering in this area.

              Bill Payment

3.1.1.15.     A range of bill and prepayment services is offered at post offices for clients such as BT,
              British Gas and Girobank as well as other major utilities and local authorities.

3. l .1.16.   Although some of the products are still manually based, a large percentage of business
              has now transferred to magnetic stripe or smart card technology, and utilises the
              automated payment terminal currently being installed in some 5000 offices. Non-
              automated offices also utilise a POCL document processing facility to process card
              vouchers and the automated/manual data streams are merged via a central host system.
              The document processing centre is also used to process cheques and bills. Service
              Providers will need to consider how data from the document processing centre will be
              merged with the automated stream to ensure continuity of service.

3.1.1.17.     A technical specification for the automated payments terminal is provided at appendix
              4-7 together with a specification for the central host system at appendix 4-8.

3.1.1.18.     A further phase of development is planned to cater for recharging of British Gas
              Quantum smart cards and to replace existing client equipment used in a limited number
              of offices (around 460).

              Retail

3.1.1.19.     POCL sells personal stationery (including own label) and greeting cards, as well as
              postal products through some 200 Post Shops (separate retail units within directly
              operated post offices) and a smaller selected range of products on browser units at
              approximately 280 post offices. A wholesale offer to agents of POCL' s own label
              product range is being developed and other opportunities e.g. Post Shop franchises, are
              being tested.

3. l .1.20.   Post Shops are equipped with an EPOS terminal, CRISP (Counters Retail Information
              Systems in PostShops) (see appendix 3-3), which is a stand alone system, but POCL
              would be interested in integration options.

3. l .1.21.   Post Shops are among 4000 outlets which will have on-line Lottery terminals, and a
              further 6,000 instant games outlets are envisaged. Current plans are for Lottery
              terminals and communication links to remain separate from other post office systems.

                                          Existing Services

3.1.1.22.     Other retail opportunities revolve around developing POCL' s consumer offerings in
              areas such as travel and leisure ticketing, redemptions and membership schemes.
              Automation would undoubtedly be useful in developing these markets.

3. l .1.23.   Interactive media is another business area under consideration which would be assisted
              by automation.

              New Business
3.1.1.24.     There will be opportunities in the wider markets enabled by the Government's green
              paper commitment to greater commercial freedom for POCL. Areas under examination
              include home shopping ordering, personal applications, family entertainment, cash
              transfer and insurance products.

3.2         EXISTING SUPPORT SYSTEMS

3.2.1       Introduction

3.2.1.1.    POCL currently operates a range of automated services which need to be taken into
            consideration by Service Providers. A brief overview of the following services is given
            in sections 3.2.2 - 3.2.8 below:

            •     Automated Payments Terminal (APT);

            •     ECCo+;

            •     CRISP;

            •     CAPTURE;

            •     ALPS/ESNS;

            •     Host Polling System;

            •     Document Processing .

3.2.2       Automated Payments Terminal (APT)

3.2.2.1.    The APT is a custom-built tenninal developed for the bill payment and prepayment
            markets, based on PC technology. It is housed in a compact counter top unit comprising
            a full alpha numeric keyboard, a small liquid crystal display, and a tally roll printer. The
            terminal includes a magnetic card reader, and it can also read and write to smart cards,
            and recharge smart keys used in utility prepayment meters. The terminals are connected
            to a phone line, and transaction data is collected daily via a modem by the Host Polling
            System in Farnborough for consolidation and onward transmission to clients' and
            central POCL systems. APTs are currently being installed in 5,000 offices throughout
            the UK, situated according to client needs.

3.2.2.2.    Automated payments facilities are also provided on ECCO+ equipment (see section
            3.2.3) and will be in ALPS offices (see section 3.2.6). A manual alternative is provided
            by imprinters in non-automated offices. Imprinters are also provided as a back-up
            facility in automated offices. Documents from the imprinter transactions are processed
            at the Document Processing Centre described in section 3.2.8.

3.2.2.3.    Appendix 4-7 provides additional details on the APT, its capabilities and constraints,
            and provides a summary of non-APT local bill payment equipment. Further relevant
            information can also be found in Appendix 4-8 (Polling and Terminal Control).

3.2.3       ECCO+

3.2.3.1.    ECCO+ is an. EPOS system based on PC technology at each counter position with a
            back office processor, designed to capture transaction details, and to facilitate office
            summarisation and balancing.

                                          Existing Services

3.2.3.2.    In addition, a package is available for agency offices wishing to rent ECCO+, and to
            date some 30 offices have taken up this offer.

3.2.3.3.    ECCO+ produces daily and weekly summaries for certain clients, and prepares a weekly
            cash account which is forwarded to the Client Transaction Processing centres at
            Chesterfield and Edinburgh. There are currently 671 ECCO+ offices.

3.2.3.4.    ECCO+ provides a platfonn for point of service automation including APTs (utilising
            the swipe card facility for magnetic stripe card transactions, and also linking the back
            office processor via a modem to the host polling system). Electronic scales are linked to
            a number of ECCO+ counter terminals and a purpose built Automated Payments
            Peripheral Unit (APPU) provides the ability to handle smart card and smart key
            transactions where required. In a small number of open plan offices De La Rue Teller
            cash dispensers are used. POCL is investigating the possibility of integrating ECCO+
            with the teller cash dispensers.

3.2.3.5.    Appendix 4-6 provides details on the ECCO+ system, its capabilities and limitations.

3.2.4       CRISP

3.2.4.1.    CRISP (Counters Retail Information System in PostShops) is an EPOS system launched
            in late 1992 to provide better data capture and transmission from PostShops. There are
            currently 209 PostShops, a number forecast to rise to 350 by 1999/2000. Data from the
            CRISP terminals is transferred electronically to a central computer at Chesterfield which
            processes an average of 150,000 records daily. The system is based on a standard RIVA
            6900 EPOS tenninal. The software is designed and maintained by RIVA Systems
            Limited.

3.2.4.2.    Appendix 3-3 provides additional details on the CRISP system.

3.2.5       CAPTURE

3.2.5.1.    CAPTURE is a PC based cash accounting package, currently sold by POCL to agency
            offices, that is designed to assist in the accounting and summarisation of transaction
            data. Approximately 1600 agents have purchased CAPTURE. It is estimated that 2000
            offices will be using CAPTURE by March 1996. CAPTURE is available as a package
            comprising hardware, software, and printer; software plus printer; or software only.
            CAPTURE is supplied complete with an update and support package. It is a back office,
            not an EPOS system, and data is not captured in real time. The system produces daily
            and weekly summaries for certain clients and prepares a printed weekly cash account
            which is forwarded to the Client Transaction Processing centre at Chesterfield. Other
            similar systems, developed by third party suppliers are used at a number of offices, but
            are not supported by POCL.

3.2.5.2.    Appendix 3-4 provides additional details on the CAPTURE system.

3.2.6           ALPS

3.2.6.1.    ALPS / ESNS is a current development designed to provide the following functionality
            to post offices within the M25:

            •      Electronic Stop Notice facility for BA at all offices;

            •      ECCo+ at larger offices;

            •      APT where required.

3.2.6.2.    ALPS is to be installed in approximately 1470 offices (4200 positions) by August 1995.
            The system is based on PC technology with a LAN, and incorporates a POCL specific
            EPOS keyboard. A purpose built APPU provides the ability to handle smart card and
            smart key transactions. Communications to and from ALPS offices for ESNS and APT
            functions are facilitated by ISDN links to the Host Polling System in Farnborough.

3.2.6.3 .   The ESNS system is designed to minimise the risk of fraud in benefits distribution. It
            does this by the validation of order books at the point of encashment using negative
            authorisation against an electronic stop notice. The system accesses a national 'stop list'
            of benefit books to perform a comparison with the bar code record printed on a book
            that has been presented for encashment. The clerk is given an indication of whether to
            'pay', 'pay and impound' , or ' impound only'. The stop lists are updated daily and
            details of the days transactions are collected and transmitted to BA daily for processing.

3.2.6.4.    Technical aspects of the hardware and software are given in appendix 4-5.

3.2.7       Host Polling system

3.2.7.1.    The Host Polling System in Farnborough currently performs data polling and
            distribution services in relation to Automated Payments and ESNS, including the
            following :

            •      collection of Automated Payments Transaction data;

            •      collection of data from the Document Processing centre;

            •      distribution of new programmes and reference data for automated payment
                   offices;

            •      separation of transaction data by client;

            •      format of client files ;

            •      transfer of transaction data to clients during the morning following the data
                   collection;

            •      tr-ansfer of transaction data to finance and administration systems in Chesterfield;

            •      management control of the terminal population;

             •     distribution of stop notice data for ESNS;

             •     collection of BA data from ALPS offices.

 3.2.7.2.   APT polling (including ECCo+ offices) takes place five nights a week (Monday to
            Friday). BA transmissions take place additionally on a Saturday.

3.2.7.3.    Appendix 4-5 provides additional details the operational requirements of the host
            polling system and provides further information on equipment and volumes of data

3.2.8       Document Processing

3.2.8.1.    POCL has established a Document Processing centre in central London, which
            processes BT bills, cheques used in payment at the counter, and imprinter vouchers for
            automated payments. The centre has recently been registered by the British Standards
            Institute (BSI) to ISO 9002. The paper documents are read by image scanning
            equipment. Customer, client and financial details are captured automatically wherever
            possible.

3.2.8.2.    Approximately 100,000,000 cheques and other documents are processed each year.


3.3         OTHERPOC LPROCEDUR ES

3.3.l       Reconciliation and Accounting

3.3.1.1.    Post offices currently complete a weekly cash account and there is a wide range of
            supporting documentation some of which is forwarded with the cash account. The data
            from the cash accounts is keyed into the system at POCL' s financial accounting unit at
            Chesterfield and forms an integral part of the reconciliation and settlement process.

3.3.1.2.    The bulk of the process is manually based and there is a separate feasibility study
            un_derway within POCL that is considering the future of transaction information
            processing. Financial integrity is perceived as one of POCL's key strengths and new
            systems and interfaces will need to meet appropriate standards in this area.

3.3.2       Distribution

3.3.2.1.    POCL's retail network is supported by a network of physical distribution centres. In
            addition to distributing cash and stock to the outlets and receiving returns, the
            distribution centres also perform certain transactions on behalf of POCL clients, e.g.
            accept Girobank business deposits. The transactions are identical to those performed in
            the outlets, but typically small volume and high value.

3.3.2.2.    Information relating to transactions remittances and returns for each distribution centre
            is currently recorded on a cash account and supporting documents which are forwarded
            to the financial accounting unit at Chesterfieici where the data is keyed in to the system
            for reconciliation and accounting purposes.

                                         Existing Services

3.3.2.3 .   Distribution centres currently operate stand-alone systems to assist in the management
            of cash and stock distribution. A separate project is investigating the system
            requirements for distribution.


3.4         BENEFITS PAYMENTS SERVICE

3.4.1       Introduction

3.4.1.1.    This section describes the existing computer systems and the end-to-end process and
            procedures within the benefit payment service that are currently employed by the DSS
            to ensure that customers receive correct and authorised payments of benefit. The service
            requirements detailed in this SSR are intended to replace or interface with existing
            procedures relating to the payment of benefits and their subsequent reconciliation
            against payment awards. Within the existing process the Instrument of Payment (IOP)
            represents physical proof of a customer entitlement to receive authorised payments of
            benefit. Additional authentication (in terms of production of evidence of identity) may
            be required to support any benefit payment transaction at a post office.

3.4.3       Operational Strategy (OPSTRAT)

3.4.3.1.    Computer Systems detailed above currently operate within the DSS to capture and
            maintain the information necessary to enable the payment of benefits. Most of the above
            systems form the DSS Operational Strategy. They have been designed to a common
            architectural standard, using where relevant, common processing. The systems run on a
            mainframe estate located at 4 Area Computer Centres (ACCs) around the UK.

3.4.3.2.    Users in approximately 2000 locations (DSS and ES local offices) access OPSTRAT
            systems from terminals or PCs via the Government Data Network (GDN), an X.25
            network utilising low bandwidth (9.6 Kbs) lines.

            Common Payments Package (CPP)

3.4.3.3.    Each benefits system, with the exception of the Child Benefit system, includes the CPP
            code used to produce instruments of payment (IOPs). CPP can produce a number of
            different methods of payment (Order Book, Girocheque, Payable Order and Automated
            Credit Transfer (ACn). CPP is also used to produce notifications/letters to be sent to
            the customer.

3.4.3.4.    The output from CPP for the OPSTRAT systems is produced at the ACCs, using impact
            printers, high speed laser printers and output handling equipment. CPP is tailored to the
            individual benefits needs of each system.

3.4.5       Compute Payment

3.4.5.1.    This section describes the procedures referred to in Process 1 within Fi~ 3-1.

3.4.5.2.    Prior to the authorisation of an award of benefit payment, a customer's entitlement to
            receive benefit must be confirmed.

            Qualif,cation Criteria

3.4.5.3.    Customers wishing to claim benefits administered by the DSS have to satisfy the
            relevant qualification criteria which relate to their own particular circumstances. These
            criteria will vary according to the benefit type. Some are dependent on the level of a
            customer's income (e.g. Income Support), some on their contributions history (e.g.
            Contributory Retirement Pension) and some on their personal or domestic
            circumstances (e.g. Child Benefit or War Pensions).

            Claims Procedure

3.4.5.4.    In order to ascertain whether customers satisfy the above qualification criteria they are
            required to provide a statement of their personal circumstances. Generally this
            information is provided on postal application forms which are sent to DSS offices for
            consideration.

            Method of Payment (MOP) and Instrument of Payment (/OP)

3.4.5.5.    Having established an entitlement to benefit, a payment is authorised, computed and
            issued. Except in the case of a small number of low volume benefits, where payment
            direct to a bank account is not an available option, customers have the choice of
            payment by ACT or at a post office. The choice is generally made at the time of the
            initial claim, but the customer may change that option at any time in the life of the
            claim. If the customer chooses to be paid at a post office, the decision as to whether he
            is paid by order book or girocheque will usually depend on benefit type but is ultimately
            at the discretion of the Secretary of State.

3.4.5.6.    Should he chose to be paid by ACT, he is required to provide details of the bank
            account in which he wishes to have payment credited, otherwise he is required to
            nominate the post office at which he wishes to encash IOPs.

            Calculation of Entitlement

3.4.5.7.    DSS staff at relevant grades and performing relevant duties are empowered to act as
            "adjudication officers" and are required to decide on a customer' s entitlement to receive
            benefit. This decision is based on information provided at the time of claim (verification
            may be required in some circumstances) and the customer's rights under law.

3.4.5.8.    OPSTRAT computer systerns generate a calculation of entitlement based c,n input data
            relating to the customer' s personal circumstances.

                                          Existing Services

 3.4.5.9.    Individual benefit computer systems compute payment awards where relevant taking
             account of any deductions which may be requested by the customer, an authorised third
             party (e.g. Local Authorities for payments of Community Charge, or Utilities for
             payment of outstanding bills ), or required by the DSS (e.g. to recover overpayments of
             benefit or social fund loans made to customers). Payment award data is generated via
             the CPP.

             Multi-Entitlement

3.4.5.10.    Customers can have entitlement to receive more than one benefit. In these cases some
             benefits are combined, two benefit types payable on a single IOP via a single benefit
             system. Other benefit types do not allow for this, e.g. War Pensions and Child Benefit,
             in these cases two or more benefits have to be paid via separate benefit systems on
             separate IOPs.

             Generation of Payment

3.4.5.11 .   Following an authorised award of benefit OPSTRAT systems generate payment files in
             respect of both paper-based and ACT payments (the latter being routed through BACS).
             The ACCs administer the payments of all OPSTRAT system generated requests.

3.4.5.12.    In the case of a customer choosing payment by the paper-based method, these payment
             files control the printing of personalised IOPs on stationery (produced to defined
             security standards) held within the ACC. The personalisation details held on each IOP
             relate both to the individual customer and the nominated post office. The typical
             composition of this information is shown below:

                      Each customer's personalisation details
               1.     Name
               2.     Address
               3.     National Insurance Number (NINO) or in some instances another form
                      of reference number
               4.     IOP serial number
               5.     Benefit type payable
               6.     Payment award details (amount, period, due date of encash.ment)

                      Each post office's personalisation details
               1.     Name
               2.     Address
               3.     Office identifier (Finance Accounting Division [FAD] Code)

3.4.5.13.    Additionally local DSS offices have the capability of issuing payments to those
             customers in urgent need by the clerical preparation and issue of IOPs.

3.4.6       Make Payment

3.4.6.1.    This section describes the procedures referred to in Process 2 within Figure 3-1.

            Methods of Payment (MOP)

3.4.6.2.    Payments of benefits are currently made by one of the four main methods of payment
            detailed below. The first two are entirely paper-based, the third (payable orders) is
            paper-based but makes use of electronic reconciliation. the last is conducted entirely
            through an electronic medium.

            •    Order Book

                 A book containing up to 52 payment foils, each of which carries personalisation
                 and award details, which are encashable at post offices at a pre-determined
                 frequency. Individual payment foil values are dictated by a series of upper limits
                 which vary according to Order Book and benefit type. The limits currently in
                 operation are:

                  (i)    System-generated books issued in            From 1 April 1995 upper limit
                         relation to Incapacity Benefit or           per payment foil= £550
                         War Pensions Allowance

                  (ii)   System-generated books for all              Upper limit per payment foil
                         other benefit types                         = £350.00
                 (iii) All non-system Order Books                    Upper limit per payment foil
                                                                     = £99.99
                 Payments made by this method comprise some 91 % of all benefit payments at
                 post offices, by number of transactions, authorised by the DSS and other relevant
                 agencies.

            •    Girocheque

                 A one-time payment voucher carrying personalisation and award details. Values
                 of individual girocheques may fall within two value bandings:

                 Value :                         Redeemable at :

                 (i) up to £350                  Encashable at post offices or through bank or
                                                 building society accounts;

                 (ii) between £350 and           Redeemable only through bank or building
                      £5,000                     society accounts.

                                              Existing Services

             •         Payable Orders

                       This method of payment is generally used to make payments over £5,000 to
                       individuals, utilities, or institutions (where a single payment may cover a number
                       of customers). Payable orders may also be used to administer payments below
                       £5,000, for example when making administrative payments or payment to
                       customers who although resident abroad retain entitlement to benefits paid in the
                       UK.

                       All payments made by this method have to be paid through the payee's bank or
                       building society account. Following the presentation of a payable order through a
                       bank account, funds are cleared via the Paymaster system and Banlcs Automated
                       Clearing System (BACS).

            •          Automated Credit Transfer (ACT)

                   This method utilises the payment of benefits directly to bank or building society
                   accounts nominated by customers. Payments to be made by ACT are written to
                   magnetic tape by the ACCs. Tapes are then sent to BACS for the funds to be
                   credited to the appropriate customer accounts.

            Issue System Payments

3.4.6.3.    After the IOPs are produced at the ACCs, they are issued to customers. This is achieved
            in a number of ways dependent on the method of payment:

            (a)   Order Books:

                  1.       the majority of order books are sent to the customer's nominated post office
                           for collection,

                  ii.      in a small number of instances order books may be issued directly to a
                           customer' s home address;

            (b)   Girocheques:

                  1.       the majority of girocheques are issued directly to the customer' s home
                           address,

                  11.      in a relatively small number of instances (mostly for administrative or
                           security reasons) they may be issued to a DSS or ES office for personal
                           collection,

                  111.     in a number of post offices in Sunderland a local agreement exists whereby
                           girocheques are issued direct to post offices.

3.4.6.4.    ACCs are also responsible for the production of a variety of informative or
            administrative literature to be issued to customers. Of primary importance to the
            payment of benefits is the production of payment award notification and Order Book
            pick up notices. The former advises the customer that an award of payment has been

                                                                                                POL00028135




BA/POCL SSR                                                              RESTRICTED- Commercial

            made and details their entitlement, the latter advises them that an order book has been
            issued and is ready for collection at their nominated post office. Existing Output
            Handling Deadlines, with associated service levels for the production and dispatch of
            IOPs and associated documents, are shown in appendix 3-7.

            Issue Clerical or Emergency Payments

3.4.6.5.    DSS offices have a facility to issue IOPs without generating a payment award through
            the benefit systems. In the case of order books this is normally used when, for
            administrative or security reasons, it is decided to issue a payment locally. In the case of
            Girocheques it is generally exercised when a customer requires an immediate payment
            of benefit to satisfy an urgent or emergency need. In the latter case a customer may have
            no continuing entitlement to payment of benefit. On receipt of an urgent or emergency
            need payment it may be possible for a customer to nominate the closest post office to
            the point of issue as the encashment office.

            Validity of JOPs

3.4.6.6.    IOPs remain valid for encashment for differing periods of time. In the case of order
            books each payment foil remains valid for three months from its due date of encashment
            (imprinted on each foil). Girocheques remain valid for one month from the due date of
            encashment, which is imprinted on the document. Periods of validity are occasionally
            reviewed by DSS and are subject to change. The DSS is considering whether and when
            to reduce the validity of the order book foil from 13 weeks to 4 or 5 weeks.

            Periodicity of JOPs

3.4.6.7.    The frequency with which IOPs may be encashed varies according to both benefit and
            instrument type. The majority of payment foils are encashable on a weekly basis,
            however some benefits are payable two or four weekly. Girocheques are intended to act
            as a one-time payment within one month of the specified due date of encashment. The
            due date of encashment may allow for entitlement for periods in advance, arrears or a
            combination dependent on benefit type.

3.4.7       Control IOP

3.4.7.1.    This section describes the procedures referred to in Process 3 within Figure 3-1.
            Payment having been issued to a customer the DSS retains a responsibility for its
            control, including security, reconciliation and accounting procedures.

            Collection of Order Books

3.4.7.2.    Generally, Order Books produced by the ACCs and dispatched to post offices are sent
            through the postal system, with up to three books per envelope. On receipt post office
            staff remove them from envelopes for sorting and storage prior to handover to
            customers. At the same time as initial order books are dispatched to post offices
            customers are issued with a Pick-up Notice (PUN) which informs them of the issue of a

            book to their nominated post office for collection. Subsequent order books are collected
            in exchange for the expired covers of current books following the encashment of the last
            payment foil.

            Stop and R~caJJ Notices

3.4.7.3.    Having issued an IOP the DSS may subsequently decide that no payment should be
            made on it (e.g. in cases of suspected fraud or where the customer has reported its non-
            receipt, loss or theft) or wish to recall it for re-rating (e.g. due to a reported change in
            customer circumstances):

            •     Stop Notices

                  In the event of the requirement being to stop a payment, paper stop notices are
                  distributed to the relevant nominated post offices (in the event of widespread fraud
                  a wider circulation is possible). These carry instructions to the counter clerk that,
                  in the event of the identified IOP being presented for payment it should be
                  impounded and no payment made. BA has conducted trials in the London area
                  into the effectiveness of an Electronic Stop Notice System (ESNS) based on
                  machine readable bar-codes imprinted on Order Book covers. Following a
                  successful trial period it is planned to expand this facility to all post offices within

            •     Recall Notices

                  In the event of the DSS wishing to recall an order book for re-rating a letter is
                  issued to the customer requesting that they return their book to a local office
                  following encashment on a specified date. The ESNS enables recall notices to be
                  transmitted electronically to post offices within the area covered by the service,
                  allowing clerks to pay a specific date's entitlement, and then subsequently
                  impounding the book for return to DSS local offices.

            Encashment at Post Offices

3.4.7.4.    Customers present their IOP to post office clerks for payment. The IOP is examined by
            the clerk who confirms that payment is collectable on that date. In certain circumstances
            additional supporting identity may be requested of the person presenting the book for
            encashment. The clerk issues payment (in cash) and authenticates the transaction; in the
            case of order books by stamping both the payment foil and its associated counterfoil
            (which remains in the order book) and in the case of girocheques by stamping the IOP
            and retaining it.

            Reconciliation

3.4.7.5.    Reconciliation is the process of comparing amounts of benefit issued and paid. The
            objectives of the reconciliation process are to:

            (a)   enable full accounting of all transactions;

            (b)   identify losses to expenditure from fraudulent payment transactions, and:

                  i.     identify customer fraud,

                  11.    identify counterfeit payments,

                  iii.   identify internal fraud,

                  iv.    identify third party fraud by the general public or others (e.g. employees of
                         Royal Mail);

            (c)   identify and correct errors;

            (d)   identify omissions for issue data and/or non-encashments.

            Current Procedures

3.4.7.6.    The procedures currently used to achieve the above objectives are described below:

            (a)    Girocheques

                  The reconciliation of girocheques is contracted to Girobank plc. Information is
                  sent to Girobank from ACCs on computer tape in the case of system generated
                  payments. For clerically issued payments information is recorded manually onto
                  copy sheets and is then transferred onto computer tape and forwarded to Girobank.
                  Additionally all encashed girocheques are also forwarded to Girobank who ensure
                  that for each encashed cheque there exists corresponding issue information, and
                  that discrepancies and omissions are reported. Girobank totals the amounts shown
                  on the issue information for comparison with the claims made by post offices,
                  banks and building societies, and reports discrepancies.

            (b)   Order Books

                  There is currently no procedure for the complete reconciliation of order book
                  encashments against issue data. All encashed payment foils are routed from
                  individual post offices to the DSS Paid Order Unit (POU) in Lisahally, Northern
                  Ireland. POU carry out a number of checks to identify incorrect encashments and
                  to detect manipulated or counterfeit foils. Encashed foils are then archived by
                  POU and retained for a period of 12 months for accounting and retrieval purposes.

            Security

3.4.7.7.    The security aspects may be summarised as follows:

            (a)   Standards

                  The DSS benefits payment processes operate within a framework of security and
                  audit standards set by various internal regulatory bodies (see chapter 2 paragraphs
                  2.4.4, 2.4.5 and 2.4.6).     •

            (b)   Investigation

                  Suspicions or allegations of fraud relating to the IOP system are investigated by
                  specialist teams within the DSS. Large-scale organised criminal attacks (e.g.
                  involving wholesale counterfeiting of IOPs, or burglaries) are investigated by the
                  BA Security Organised Fraud unit, often in conjunction with relevant Police
                  Forces. All investigations and subsequent court proceedings have to be conducted
                  in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 and other
                  relevant legislation.

            (c)   Evidential Requirement

                  In order to support criminal prosecutions relating to attacks on the benefit
                  payment system evidence of fraudulent encashment is required. This evidence is
                  primarily obtained through the following procedures:

                  i.     Statement of         A statement (accompanied by the relevant PACE
                         Issue                certificate) is produced by relevant DSS staff which
                                              confirms and details the issue of system produced
                                              IOPs. Similar statements may be obtained in relation
                                              to clerically produced IOPs;

                  11.    Statement of         Statements of Loss are obtained from: individual
                         Loss                 customers in the event of theft; or relevant DSS
                                              officers in the event of burglary;

                  iii.   Evidence of          The evidence of a fraudulent or incorrect encashment
                         Encashment           is currently obtainable by the retrieval of the relevant
                                              encashed IOP. In the case of Order Books a search
                                              request is issued to the DSS POU who search their
                                              archives, retrieve the relevant payment foil and send
                                              it to the requesting authority. In the case of
                                              Girocheques the encashed cheque is retrieved from
                                              Giroban.k, together with any necessary supporting
                                              statements;

                  iv.    Evider.cc of         DSS investigation officers arc required to produce
                         Investigation        supporting evidence and any necessary statements to

            Accounting

3.4.7.8.    Departmental Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the use of money
            voted to departments. The chief executive of each agency acts as the Accounting Officer
            for their individual budget and portions of relevant votes. Toe Permanent Secretary of
            the DSS is the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) with a responsibility for ensuring
            the standard of financial management throughout the DSS as a whole. Briefly all
            Accounting Officers are responsible for:

            (a)   signing the appropriate (or agency) accounts for the funds for which they are
                  responsible;

            (b)   the propriety and regularity of expenditure;

            (c)   prudent and economical administration of funds;

            (d)   safeguarding public assets;

            (e)   ensuring that financial considerations are fully taken into account in policy
                  formulation;

            (f)   appearing as a witness before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to answer
                  questions on any areas relating to their duties.

            Volumes

3.4.7.9.    All volumetric information (e.g. the number of order books issued) can be found in
            appendix 3-8.

3.4.8       Other Benefit Payment Procedures

            Agency/Appointee Procedures

3.4.8.1.    Customers, with an authorised entitlement to benefit, may elect to nominate third parties
            to encash their awarded benefit on their behalf: Further information relating to these
            procedures is contained within appendix 3-5. This payment to a proxy may take a
            number of different forms:

            (a)   Permanent Appointee

                  A customer, unable to act on their own behalf, may nominate a third party to act
                  as their appointee on a permanent basis. In this instance entitlement is dependent
                  on the customer's circumstances, but payment awards are made to the nominee
                  who encashes them on behalf of the customer.

                                                                                                POL00028135

                                            Existing Services

            (b)   Temporary Appointee

                  A facility exists for customers to nominate appointees on a temporary basis,
                  although it is not often exercised by customers.

            (c)   Permanent Agent

                  A customer may request a third party · to act as their permanent agent. This
                  arrangement must be acceptable to, and authorised by, the DSS. The payment is
                  issued to the customer but the existence and details of any permanent agent are
                  noted on the instrument of payment. Encashments are made by the agent.

            (d)   Casual Agent

                  A customer may on an ad hoe basis authorise a third party to collect a payment on
                  their behalf. Each IOP contains a section in which the customer names their
                  chosen agent and authorises them, by signature, to encash the benefit payment.

            Alternative Payee Procedures

3.4.8.2.    The Secretary of State has the power (always exercised in the case of a married couple)
            to make arrangements to pay Child Benefit, Family Credit or Disability Working
            Allowance either to the customer entitled to it, or to the other partner, where the couple
            live together. In two parent families, where these benefits are paid by order book, the
            book is issued in the name of the mother with the father's name appearing as alternative
            payee.

            Special Facilities Procedures

3.4.8.3.    Special facilities are provided so that customers can encash up to 2 payment foils at post
            offices other than their nominated one within the lifetime of an order book.

3.4.8.4.    There is a facility for advance payment at particular times of the year (e.g. bank
            holidays) and extra payments (e.g. £10 Christmas bonus).

3.4.8.5.    Claimants can change their nominated post office by completing the appropriate form
            (P80MA).

3.4.8.6.    The present system also has a procedure so that claimants unable to read or write can
            collect their benefit at a post office.

                                  Description of Functional Requirements

 CHAPTER 4. DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

            This chapter details the Contracting Authorities' service and business applications which
            the Service Provider's service(s) are required to support, and general operational
            constraints to which they must conform. These are covered as follows:

                    Section 4.1         overview of required services;

                    Section 4.2         POCL strategic infrastructure requirements;

                    Section 4.3         overall benefit payment function;

                    Section 4.4         exemplar POCL data flows.

            Throughout this chapter, to aid Service Provider's undentanding of the business
            requirement, assumptions have been made about the way certain business
            processes will work. These assumptions reflect current thinking and to an extent
            current practice, but should not be considered to be definitive. The Service
            Providers should concentrate on the underlying business requirements, and where
            considered appropriate propose alternative business processes to exercise
            innovative thinking, indicating any benefits, costs or risk implications (for example
            for security or counter service time) of their proposals.

                  in due course to automate all transactions at the counter. The first release will
                  include the Benefits Payment Service (BPS) to be delivered on this platform;

            •     to support the end-to-end benefit payment needs of BA, of which the POCL
                  automation is one part. The procurement will support other benefit payment
                  requirements in addition to the delivery mechanism which will be installed in post
                  offices.

4.1.1.2.    Figure 4-1 below shows the component services (in boxes) within the procurement
            service boundary (the large oval) that are to be provided by the Service Provider.
            Outside the procurement service boundary are the services (in boxes) and users (in small
            ovals) with which and whom the Service Provider will interface. The dotted box around
            Value Added Processing (V AP) is to indicate that the Transaction Management Service
            (TMS) is part of VAP. Each of the component services are described under sections 4.2
            and 4.3.

4.1.1.3 .   Within this chapter, in order to explain fully the end-to-end business application
            requirements, assumptions have been made about the split of functionality between the
            logical components within the procurement service boundary. It is however recognised
            that there are many options for precisely how such a split can be made. The Service
            Provider may suggest alternative models if he believes they represent better value for
            money. However in suggesting alternative models, the Service Provider must keep
            distinct the service interfaces between the component services and specify how they are
            defined.

4.1.1.4.    In addition, Service Providers are reminded that, whether or not they suggest alternative
            models, the will be required to bid on the minimum specification which will be given in
            the contract documents. See OJEC notice (38/94) at paragraph 7.

4.1.2       General Services and Constraints

            General

4.1.2.1.    Service Providers are required to provide a value for money service which supports the
            automation of existing and anticipated business requirements of the Contracting
            Authorities which are specified in this SSR.

4.1.2.2.    The prime requirement is for the design development, integration, support, operation
            and management of a secure and auditable strategic IT infrastructure which, together
            with associated service applications, will meet the joint requirements of POCL and BA

             specified in this SSR.     The Service Provider's proposals must describe how their
             proposed solutions:

             •      meet the programme objectives of both the Benefits Agency and POCL set out in
                    chapter I;

             •      ensure that all business transactions are conducted in a manner which is
                    acceptable to the Contracting Authorities·, their customers, clients and agents;

            •       are compatible with existing and planned IS/IT security strategies of the
                    Contracting Authorities;

            •       ensure business transactions are conducted in a manner which 1s secure,
                    confidential , accountable and auditable;

            •       provide a foundation for the generation of new business for POCL;

            •       are in conformity with any legislative requirement imposed on the Contracting
                    Authorities.



            Systems Standards

4.1.2.3 .   The Service Provider must ensure that any services provided by him are able to interface
            and exchange information with computer systems operated by the Contracting
            Authorities and their authorised agents or clients and that they conform to the
            Contracting Authorities relevant data management policies and standards.

4.1.2.4.    This chapter and associated appendices sets out an exemplar architecture and standards
            for the required systems and services. As with business processes, these should not be
            considered to be definitive. However the Contracting Authorities will be concerned to
            agree the positioning of the service boundaries and appropriate standards for the
            associated interfaces. During the contract negotiation phase, Service Providers may
            wish to discuss the relevance of these, or other, standards. Service Providers should, in
            response to this SSR, include any reservations they may have about the appropriateness
            of the standards provided.

            Audit

4.1.2.5.    Various internal audit services support BA and POCL in monitoring the achievement of
            business and IS/IT objectives against plans and compliance with financial control and
            integrity. Service Providers must be able to satisfy the audit requirements and any
            requirements for external audit, so that they can provide an assurance on the level of
            adequacy of internal control to the relevant Accounting Officer and/or Finance Director.

            Management Information

4.1.2.6.    Toe Contracting Authorities' specific management information requirements will
            evolve during the course of the procurement. The starting point for this evolution is the
            set of requirements outlined in the relevant sections of this document (e.g. audit trail
            data requirement outlined in appendix 2-8). However, the Contracting Authorities
            should be able to extract any reasonable data relating to the service from the Service
            Provider's systems to support ad hoe management information needs.

            Accounting

4.1.2.7.    Toe services which are outlined in this SSR must contribute towards the generation of
            separate statements of account for POCL and the DSS agencies involved (and the
            Service Provider). The requirements outlined in this document will provide the DSS
            and POCL with accounting information at the individual business transaction level. The
            Service Provider will be required to ensure that the data passed back to the Contracting
            Authorities will be accurate, timely and complete.

4.1.2.8.    Note that generation of accurate benefit accounts is a major business driver for the DSS
            and lies behind the creation of the programme of which this procurement forms part.

            Security

4.1.2. 9.   The Service Provider must have, or put in place, a security policy which is compatible
            with those of the Contracting Authorities.

4.1.2.10.   The DSS, in addition to having to comply with requirements imposed by the law, has a
            well defined security policy which complements that of Her Majesty's Government
            (HMG).

4.1.2.11.   To support the implementation of this security policy. the DSS maintains approximately
            1,300 security standards, some of which will be applicable to this service; where a
            standard is deemed applicable it must be satisfied or alternatively a risk decision can be
            taken not to implement if this is agreed during contract negotiations.

4.1.2.12.   Further detail is given in appendices 2-3 DSS Departmental Security Standards, 4-1

            Systems Security and 4-4 The Post Office (Group) Information Technology
            Architecture and Policy.

            Existing Infrastructure Services

4.1.2.13.   The Government and the Post Office both have data and voice networks which Service
            Providers may wish to consider using on a contractual basis as part of their services.
            The Post Office also has a number of secure delivery systems which could be used for
            the supply of cards or other sensitive items. Enquiries about the facilities that might be
            available in this context should be channelled through the Response Unit (see chapter
            9).

4.2         THE POCL STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE

4.2.1       Introduction

4.2.1.1.    This section describes the requirements for the POCL strategic infrastructure. This is
            one of the main elements of the service architecture for this procurement and supports a
            range of business services at the po~ office counter.

            Outline of the Strategy

4.2.1.2.    One of the aims of the BA/POCL project is to provide a technology architecture at every
            post office, which will enable POCL in due course to automate all transactions at the
            counter. The first release of this will support, amongst other things, the Benefits
            Payment Service (BPS).

4.2.1.3.    POCL aims to embrace industry standard hardware and software, and packaged rather
            than bespoke software, where it provides value for money. This new hardware and
            software is to be known as the automation platform. This architecture must be capable
            of supporting other POCL and client applications in line with the generic software
            approach discussed below.

4.2.1.4.    POCL recognises two possible approaches for providing software at the counter - the
            'Product' approach and the 'Generic' approach. The 'Product' approach broadly means
            building a separate application for each individual product, and this has been the
            historical approach to development in the Post Office.

4.2.1.5.    The 'Generic' approach means automating common sets of functions which can be put
            together quickly to service diverse client requirements. This approach has worked well
            in the POCL automated bill payment area and is the direction in which the retail
            software industry is moving.

4.2.1.6.    POCL has reviewed the high level business and data requirements for current and future
            counter transactions. This has demonstrated that all types of transaction (including the
            BA requirement) can be supported at the counter by the 'Generic' approach in 5 generic
            software modules, which POCL has called lnpay, Outpay, EPOS, Personal Details
            Capture and Token Management. The following conditions need to be satisfied:

            •    when the products are engineered into an electronic format, the common business
                 processes required to support them are harmonised (e.g. the look and feel is the
                 same across all types of transaction);

            •    the software modules are designed to perform standard processes, but on different
                 data sets which are defined by the client transaction (e.g. validation of a credit
                 card should be the same transaction as validation of a benefit card - one
                 transaction gets data automatically from the credit card company, the other from
                 the DSS);

                                                                                              POL00028135




BAIPOCL SSR                                                            RESTRICTED - Commercial
                              Description of Functional Requirements

            •     the shape of the client transactions are defined in rule tables which describe how
                  the 5 generic transaction functions are combined. (e.g. BBC Licence payment
                  would be a 'Generic Personal Details Capture' followed by a 'Generic In-pay',
                  whereas a benefit payment would be a 'Generic Out-pay', both also using the
                  'Generic EPOS');

            •     using the rule tables, a data entry screen format can be dynamically selected from
                  a database of screen formats based on the transaction being carried out. (e.g. a
                  fishing licence transaction will call up a fishing licence, whereas a TV licence
                  transaction will call up a different data entry screen format).

4.2.1.7.    The 5 generic functions are illustrated more fully later in this chapter and described in
            appendix 3-2, but in general tenns the generic functions are defined by common sets of
            business functions working upon commonly described data. For example, there should
            be no material difference in the way a television licence is processed as compared to a
            vehicle licence, or fishing licence. The business processes and underlying functionality
            will be common. The detailed data content will obviously vary.

4.2.1.8.    POCL seek the Service Provider's confirmation that this concept is feasible, practical,
            and cost effective: research leads POCL to believe that there are clear benefits to both
            the Service Provider and BAIPOCL in adopting the generic approach. These benefits
            fall into the following categories:

            •    Reduced Cost:             It is hoped that the overall cost of automating products
                 which pass over post office counters will be reduced by using standard code, as
                 compared with writing bespoke application code for each new product. Any
                 increase in short-term costs will need to be weighed against the potential for
                 longer-term savings.

                 The cost of adding additional products in the 'Generic' model is small. The cost
                 of adding additional products in the 'Product' model is large - both in terms of
                 application coding and in managing the interfaces needed.

            •    Reduced Timescales:                The time to bring a new product to market in
                 the 'Generic' model is low - a small number of days/weeks will be required to
                 develop the data capture screens, test them, and roll out. The time to bring a new
                 product to market under the 'Product' model will be long. Months will be
                 required to develop user requirements, develop code, test and roll out.

            •    Reduced Risk:              In the 'Generic' model, risk is reduced by using
                 established code each time a new product is brought to market. In the 'Product'
                 model there is high development risk each time a new product is required.

            •    Reduced Maintenance: The cost of maintaining the 'Generic' model is
                 relatively low, because there is a small number of well defined interfaces to
                 support. The impact of changes can be easily modelled and tested. The
                 maintenance costs of the 'Product' approach gets higher as more products are
                 added because of the greater complexity of interfaces and monitoring the impact
                 of any changes.

             •      Reduced Support:           Authorised end users can update the parameter tables
                    e.g. to introduce new products or price changes, with little or no involvement from
                    IT staff.



4.2.2        Overview of Business Requirements

4.2.2.1.     The remaining sections of this chapter set out the generic transaction functions in more
             detail and explain other key aspects of the Information Systems Strategy, demonstrating
             how the BA application, as well as other client applications, could be delivered using by
             this approach.

4.2.2.2.     The POCL Information Systems Strategy focuses on the business processes that are
             required to support the mission and vision of the business. There are five key processing
             areas which make up the core business of POCL, known as the "Business Value Chain".
             They are shown in Figure 4-2 below, together with the key data flows that link them
             together.

4.2.2.4.      Notes:

              (a)    The POCL IS Strategy is described further in appendix 3-2;

              (b)    The Financial Administration and Distribution areas as shown in Figure 4-2 The
                     POCL Business Value Chain are outside the scope of this procurement, but are
                     important in terms of their interface with the Transaction Management Service
                     (TMS);

              (c)    The POCL Strategic Infrastructure needs to be sufficiently flexible to support
                     subsequent applications for POCL, its agents and clients as well as maintaining or
                     migrating existing functionality.

4.2.3       The Counter Interface

            Counter Functions

4.2.3.1.    The "Applications Portfolio for post offices" (see appendix 3-2) identifies five generic
            functions for the processing of all transactions at the post office counter.

4.2.3.2.    POCL's Point of Sale Transactions:

            (a)    EPOS

                   To manage all common point of sale transaction activities and complement point
                   of service transactions. Features include: product and price look-up, receipt
                   production, method of payment (EFTPOS etc, plus the Service Provider should be
                   ready to incorporate an ' electronic purse' type method of payment) and
                   authorisation, stock update and token endorsement.

4.2.3.3 .   POCL's Point of Service Transactions:

            (a)    Personal Details Capture

4.2.3.4.    Other transactions:

            (a)    Token Management

                   To manage the distribution of client tokens. These are items which are personal to
                   a specific customer, for example order books and mobile telephones.

4.2.3.5.    The requirements for the POCL infrastructure services may be satisfied by applying
            these generic functions to every transaction passing through a POCL outlet. The
            functions chosen and the order in which they are used will depend on each requirement.
            A guide to how the functions could be used initially to support the requirement for
            EPOS, Bill Payment, and Benefits Payments is given in Table 4-1. The list of required
            transactions is not exhaustive.

4.2.3.6.    In implementing the above types of transaction. all five of the generic functions will
            have been covered. The five generic functions should be designed to be sufficiently
            flexible to permit the implementation of all other post office transactions.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

             Constraints Affecting the Counter Interface

             Physical Constraints - Environment
4.2.3.8.     The counter interface is required for a variety of types of post office, from large multi-
             position post offices (with, say, 20-30 positions) down to those with only a single
             position. Also the layout of offices varies, from the traditional counter positions behind
             glass screens to open plan offices, post offices with Post Shops, 'community' offices in
             various difficult environments or set up temporarily or seasonally in, say, village halls,
             mobile post offices (there are four currently) and emergency post offices (currently 17
             portacabin units - the equivalent of three standard post offices).

4.2.3.9.     The post office counter environment is considered to be more hostile for computer
             equipment than an office environment. Post offices vary considerably with respect to
             atmospheric temperature and contamination. The movement of people and paper in
             particular result in a dusty environment.

             Physical Constraints - EQuipment
4.2.3.10.    The space available on the counter for computer hardware (e.g. screens, keyboard,
             magnetic swipe reader) is often limited. Hence the equipment will often need to be
             compact.

4.2.3.11.    The choice of screen type (colour or mono), keyboard type and the specifications of the
             terminal equipment is for the Service Provider to propose and explain. Service Providers
             should not feel constrained by the technical specifications set out in appendix 4-4 in
             their proposals for counter equipment.

4.2.3 .12.   Any equipment proposed must conform to the appropriate health and safety regulations.
             It must not interfere with the health, comfort or normal pattern of work of staff as a
             result of emission of acoustic noise, vibrations, heat fumes or other radiation, or as a
             result of its construction.

             Operational Constraints - Staff
4.2.3 .13.   The counter interface is to be used by counter clerks with a wide range of backgrounds
             and ages. No assumptions can be made about their previous level of computing
             experience.

             Operational Constraints - User Interface
4.2.3.14.    The counter interface needs to provide a consistent interface for handling different types
             of transactions. This needs to be intuitive for staff to minimise errors and delays. Staff
             should find the system simple to operate (with minimal training).

4.2.3 .15.   The interface needs to be adaptable to allow the introduction of new applications and
             client transactions with the minimum of effort, disruption and re-training.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

 4.2.3.16.    The operation of a transaction must be quick to avoid build-up of queues. At present
              transactions take from under 5 seconds to several minutes to complete, with a mean of
              the order of half a minute.

              Operational Constraints - Data Capture
4.2.3.17.    Given the variety of clients and transaction types, the interface will need to support a
             variety of card technologies.

             Qperatjonal Constraints - Printini:
4.2.3.18.    The equipment at the counter interface will need to produce retail type output, e.g.
             receipts, printing on cheques and printing on pre-printed forms such as vehicle licences.

             QperationaI Constraints - Miwti 0 n
4.2.3.19.    During roll-out of any newlIT services it is important that post offices do not suffer a
             loss in functionality of the systems. This means migrating from existing systems
             where they are in operation. xisting systems are described in separate appendices.

4.2.3.20.    The minimum application configuration to be available at each post office on the day
             roll-out reaches it (and therefore to be supported by the infrastructure) is:

             •     Benefit payments;

             •     an EPOS application to replace ECCo+ functionality;

             •     Automated payments migrated from APT (e.g. In-pay);

             •     Operational Support Services as set out in section 4.2.5;

             •     Connectivity to the remainder of the POCL business value chain via the TMS
                   element of VAP (indicated in Figure 4-2).

             Qperatjonal Constraints - Security
4.2.3.21.    The counter interface needs to provide security features that work at the level of the
             individual staff member e.g. with respect to log-in identification and authorisation to
             perform functions.

4.2.3.22.    Systems need to be trustworthy and, in the event of failure, re-established without loss
             of integrity. Any disruption to the normal provision of services to customers caused by
             the failure of computer systems must be minimised. Fall-back and recovery
             arrangements are needed for continuing to provide post office services when failures
             occur.

              Commercial Constraints - User Interface
4.2.3.23.    Where an agent of the post office may in future use the counter infrastructure (e.g.
             EPOS) for his own business, then it will be necessary to identify the transactions for his
             business and post office work separately, in particular for financial accounting.

4.2.3.24.    The counter interface should be designed so that features can be added or adapted to
             take advantage of new developments in technology.

4.2.4        Transaction Management Service

4.2.4.1      Overview of the Transaction Management Senrice

4.2.4.1.1.   The TMS is a part of the Value Added Processing business function. This is the
             business function which allows a small number of clients (currently less than 200) to
             communicate with a large nwnber of post offices and distribution centres (currently
             more than 19,000), and in tum allows the post offices and distribution centres to return
             relevant information to them.

4.2.4.1.2.   The purpose of the TMS is to provide the essential data collection and delivery links
             between post offices, distribution centres, POCL and clients. The TMS will replace the
             existing host polling centre.

4.2.4.1.3 . It is not envisaged that the Service Provider would take on the work currently performed
            by the client transaction (cash account) processing centres at Chesterfield and
            Edinburgh or the Docwnent Processing Centre (Data Central) in London. However, the
            Service Provider may decide that he needs similar facilities to provide contingency,
            resilience and migration from current paper-based systems.

4.2.4.1.4.   The following sub-sections covering TMS discuss:

             (a)   the interface with POCL' s clients;

             (b)   the interface with Financial Administration ;

             (c)   the interface with Distribution;

             (d)   the interface with other Value Added Processes; and

             (e)   audit requirements.

4.2.4.1.5.   The interface between the TMS and the Counter Interface service is not discussed as this
             is entirely within the service boundary.

4.2.4.2      Interface with Other POCL & Client Systems

4.2.4.2.1.   The TMS will provide the !ink between the transactions performed at the Counter
             Interface and the appropriate POCL systems. In some cases, the Service Provider may

BA/POCL SSR                                                               RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                 Description of Functional Requirements

             also be required to provide a link to client systems. The Service Provider will also be
             required to transmit client data to post offices.

4.2.4.2.2.   As identified in the prospectus, currently eight clients generate over 90% of the business
             carried out in post offices. The split, represented by percentage income, is as follows:

             •     Benefits Agency                              32%

             •     Postal (Royal Mail and Parcelforce)          22%

             •     Alliance and Leicester / Girobank            20%

             •     Other Government Departments                 I 0%
                   (Department for National Savings and
                   Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency)

             •     Other clients (BT and BBC)                   7%

4.2.4.2.3.   New business opportunities are also being developed as described in Chapter 3 and the
             previously received prospectus, including the area of bill payments.

4.2.4.2.4. The nature of the interface with clients and their systems will depend upon the nature of
           the information that needs to be exchanged to support their transactions. Options
           include:

             (a)   on-line authorisation from client systems;

             (b)   batched authorisations transferred to the TMS for on-line authorisation at the point
                   of sale;

             (c)   transfer of batched information, with details of each transaction or summaries of
                   transactions;

             (d)   transfer of client standing data.

4.2.4.2.5 . The exact method used for a particular client will be specified on a client by client basis.
            However it should be possible to change the authorisation approach by changing system
            parameters.

4.2.4.2.6.   In the case of the Benefits Agency, the Benefits Payment Service may use any or all of
             the above as proposed by the Service Provider and justified on economic, risk and
             service quality grounds.

                                     Description of Functional Requirements

4.2.4.3          Interfaces with Financial Administration

4 .2 .4 .3 .1.   The TMS needs to provide information about counter transactions to the rest of Value
                 Added Processing (VAP) and through VAP to the Financial Administration (FA)
                 business functions. These areas are concerned with the reconciliation of client
                 transactions and the settlement of client monies, as well as statutory accounting and
                 treasury functions.

                 High Level Functional Objectives

4.2.4.3.2.       The high level objective of reconciliation is to substantiate specific accounts in order to
                 demonstrate the completeness and accuracy of the ledgers. This involves specifically
                 reconciling all inter-office remittances and ensuring that errors resulting from cash
                 account processing are investigated and corrected. Our current intention is to retain this
                 function within POCL, but using data supplied by the Service Provider.

4.2.4.3.3.       The objectives of settlement are to arrange payments due to clients and to receive
                 payments due from clients in accordance with their contracts. This involves ensuring
                 accurate settlement on the due contracted date and that appropriate funding
                 arrangements are in place so that there is no cash flow disadvantage to POCL. Again
                 our current intention is to retain this function within POCL, but using data supplied by
                 the Service Provider.

                 Information Needs

4.2.4.3.4.       To achieve these objectives, given the automation of transaction processing at the
                 counter, the following information must be captured:

                 (a)   value of each transaction;

                 (b)   volumes of transactions;

                 (c)   a unique code for each product so that detailed product information can be made
                       available across all clients (e.g. breakdown by denomination of Royal Mail stamps
                       sold);

                 (d)   source (i.e. outlet clerk and till identification);

                 (e)   client reference and client scheme or product reference for each transaction;

                 (f)   customer identification and details (e.g. for transactions involving cheques,
                       passports, motor tax discs);

                 (g)   method of payment;

                 (h)   date and time of the transaction.

4.2.4.3.5.       All the above needs to be captured daily for all transactions and products and made
                 available for the Settlement and Reconciliation.

                                 Description of Functional Requirements

 4.2.4.4       Interface with Distribution

 4.2.4.4.1.    The TMS also needs to provide infonnation about counter transactions to the
               Distribution business function and receive infonnation from it. This function plans and
               controls the physical distribution of cash and stock across the business. The specific
               requirements for this interface are described in appendix 4-3. In general these cover
               daily or weekly transfer of details about:

              (a)   overnight cash holding;

              (b)   value and transaction stock holding;

              (c)   remittances and returns.

4.2.4.4.2. The provision of overnight cash holding information will need to be in place from the
           start of the roll-out of the new service. The other details may not be required by the
           Distribution systems until later.

4.2.4.4.3 . Any services provided by the Service Provider for use in distribution centres must be
            capable of interfacing with their current stand-alone distribution systems as well as
            forwarding infonnation on transactions and stock movements via the TMS in the same
            way as any other outlet. Further discussions with the Service Provider will be necessary
            in order to determine the precise nature of these interfaces.

4.2.4.5       Interface with other Value Added Processes

4.2.4.5.1.    The TMS should have the facility to provide information about relevant counter
              transactions to other value added processes, as and when systems to support these are
              put in place. Chapter 3 referred to POCL' s Transaction Information Processing project,
              and it is not currently envisaged that Value Added Processing (V AP) areas other than
              the TMS will be within this procurement. Service Providers are asked to indicate the
              feasibility and implications of adding other aspects of VAP to the procurement at a
              future stage.

4.2.4.6       Audit Requirements in POCL

4.2.4.6.1.    The TMS needs to maintain an audit trail of transactions for inspection by POCL's
              auditors. Arrangements may be made for passing back audit information following
              closure of reporting period books.

              High Level Objective of Internal Control

4.2.4.6.2. The objective of internal control is to ensure that the processing of client transactions is
           carried out in an orderly and efficient manner, that assets are safeguarded and the
           completeness and accuracy of records is secured.

              Information Needs

4.2.4.6.3.    To achieve these objectives, the overall business processes following the automation of
              transaction processing at the counter are to ensure that the following requirements are
              met:

              (a)    POCL and agents' private transactions are separately identifiable;

              (b)   capture of data at the outlet is complete, accurate and robust e.g. unique reference
                    per transaction;

             (c)    any transfer of data to/from a central location (repository) is secure, complete,
                    accurate and robust;

             (d)    whether off or on line the service must be capable of validating transactions by
                    format and value;

             (e)    in the event of fraud it can be proved that the service was operating without
                    defect;

             (f)    transaction receipts (identifiable to specific clients) are automatically generated
                    for customers and retained to allow recovery if there is a failure between back up
                    cycles, or to allow problem resolution at post offices;

             (g)    accountability for cash, stock and any supporting documentation is maintained by
                    each outlet and individual clerk where appropriate;

             (h)    the method of payment is recorded at the point of sale;

             (i)    access to the system and to certain functions within the system is restricted and a
                    user log is maintained;

             (j)    appropriate back ups are taken including a complete record of daily transactions;

             (k)    it should be possible to require an independent/supervisory check to amend or
                    cancel transactions after a certain level of processing;

             (I)    both operator and device are uniquely identified within each outlet;

             (m) data should undergo a balancing procedure to enable a final review and
                 authorisation;

             (n)    all transactions are collected using a secure method at the earliest opportunity;

             (o)    transactions not collected from previous days are clearly identifiable;

             (p)    all transactions can be reconciled to an appropriate supporting voucher depending
                    on the transaction type. Where necessary these vouchers are to be available for

                                   Description of Functional Requirements

               (q)    the system should maintain an up to date record of cash and stock on hand for
                      audit purposes and be capable of reporting current balances;

               (r)    all transfers to/from other offices and between staff are clearly identifiable;

               (s)    all specified summaries are produced automatically when required and all
                      transactions are included since the last summary was completed;

               (t)    items posted to suspense accounts can be identified for future investigation;

               (u)   information to show compliance with relevant legislation. e.g. Health and Safety,
                     Data Protection Act, Companies Act;

              (v)    an outlet must be able to continue operating and to maintain an audit trail in the
                     event of system failure.

4.2.5         Operational Support Services

4.2.5.1       Scope

4.2.5.1 .1. It is envisaged that the two parts of the Operational Support Services to be included in
            the procurement will be Outlet Remuneration & Reconciliation and Reporting & MIS,
            as outlined below. The former would support Postmaster remuneration, while the latter
            would allow production of the Cash Account. Both of these are produced by the
            Capture software and would need to be produced in this solution. The Reporting & MIS
            function would also allow other financial and management reports (e.g. cash account) to
            be produced.

4.2.5 .1.2.   However, as a general rule the provision of the Operational Support Services within
              Post Offices will not be part of this procurement. The Service Provider will need to
              ensure that the capability to add these services is provided.

4.2.5.1.3 .   During the period of the service contract(s), POCL may request some more, or all of
              these services to be implemented , but on a case by case basis, and costed separately.

4.2.5.2       Office Accounting and Cash Account Production

4.2.5.2.1.    Together with the facilities offered by the Counter Interface, the purpose of the
              following is to provide full accounting for individual post offices. These comprise:

              (a)    Stock Management including cash;

              (b)    Purchase Order Management;

              (c)    Financial Accounting;

              and are described briefly below.

4.2.6         Migration of current POCL systems

4.2.6.1       Introduction

4.2.6.1.1.    In order to avoid duplicating systems (especially at the counter where space is at a
              premium), and to ensure that there is a sensible integration of applications, POCL
              recognises that there will need to be some redevelopment of existing systems and that
              some will be superseded by the new automated systems. In particular, the following
              should be noted:

              (a)   functionality of ECCO+, and APT must be available on the new platform from the
                    outset;

              (b)   the migration plans for CAPTURE, ALPS and CRISP are yet to be determined;

              (c)   it is not envisaged that functionality will be provided for National Lottery services
                    which currently use stand-alone systems;

              (d)   the Service Provider may wish to consider the use of the POCL Document
                    Processing Centre as part of their migration / contingency plans;

 BA/POCL SSR                                                               RESTRICTED- Commercial
                                 Description of Functional Requirements

               (e)   the Service Provider will need to consider how to migrate/ integrate services
                     currently provided by the POCL Host Polling centre.

 4.2.6.1.2.    The functionality and service standards provided by ex.1stmg systems must be
               maintained without degradation to POCL, its Clients, Customers, Staff and Agents
               throughout the development and roll-out of the new automation platform.

 4.2.6.1.3.   Service Providers are also invited to identify where there is scope for improving upon
              the current levels of service and functionality.

4.2.6.1.4.    Service Providers are asked in particular to reflect the following sections.

4.2.6.2       Specifications of Existing Systems

4.2.6.2.1.    These are set out in appendices 3-3, 3-4, 4-5, 4-6 and 4-7; and Service Providers are
              asked to consider all relevant information e.g. fallback/contingency; customer access
              (magnetic stripe, smartcards); data transfer requirements and communications.

4.2.6.2.2.    Details of current volumes, and future where known, have been included although these
              are a reflection of the existing systems coverage. Service Providers are asked to
              indicate any volume constraints given their national roll-out assumptions.

4.2.6.3       Client Specification

4.2.6.3.1.    The provision of the APT and ALPS service standards are underpinned by contractual
              commitments with a range of clients. It is not envisaged that any change to the actual
              equipment will have contractual implications but it is essential that service provision as
              per current levels is maintained as an absolute minimum.

4.2.6.3.2.    Service Providers are asked to specify the way in which their proposals for integration
              can be achieved whilst avoiding any disruption to existing system standards and
              functionality .

4.2.6.3.3.    It is emphasised that any contact with clients or agents in respect of these services or
              this procurement must be channelled via POCL using the procurement contact given in
              chapter 9.

4.2.6.4       POCL Specification/Interfaces

4.2.6.4.1.    Existing systems have a variety of interfaces with POCL's accounting, reconciliation
              and settlement systems and these are set out at a high level in appendices 4-8.

4.2.6.4.2. It is envisaged that all counter transaction data passing through the counter interface will
           be passed on to the TMS to enable error checks and reconciliation with financial
           accounts. Separate POCL projects are addressing the areas of transaction information
           processing, distribution systems, and the interface with financial administration. Service
           Providers should ensure that the "data stream interfaces" can, as a minimum, deliver
           systems which will meet existing specifications.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

 4.2.6.4.3.   Service Providers are asked to highlight any additional benefits e.g. speed/frequency of
              data provision, over and above the existing specifications.

 4.2.6.S      POCL Support Services

 4.2.6.5.1.   POCL currently operate a range of support services, e.g. help desks, for which high
              level details are included chapter 5. Service Providers are asked to set out their
              proposals for integrating these support facilities with any of their own services both
              during roll-out and in a steady state environment.

 4.2.6.6      Intellectual Property Rights/Asset Transition

4.2.6.6.1 . Service Providers are requested to set out any proposals for taking over ex1stmg
            equipment/assets whilst noting that the commercial and operational arrangements would
            need to be discussed and agreed with POCL, and via POCL with appropriate third
            parties e.g. agents (Capture).

4.2.6.6.2.    Service Providers will need to consider with POCL the transfer of Intellectual Property
              Rights (IPR) arrangements for any new systems and applications in line with the
              guidance set out in chapter 8.

4.2.6.7       Technical Design/Ergonomic Considerations

4.2.6.7.1.    The services to be provided both within post offices and in the TMS must reflect the
              constraints of the operating environment (section 4.2.3) and POCL technical and
              commercial considerations.

4.2.6.7.2. The proposals for the TMS should take account of POCL's view that two logical
           systems for polling individual sets of equipment within post offices are considered
           undesirable. Alternative physical locations may however be appropriate to facilitate
           migration or for contingency purposes and Service Providers are asked to specify the
           reasoning behind their service architecture.

4.3             BENEFIT PAYMENT SERVICE

4.3.1           Introduction

4.3.1.1.    This section describes the primary business service which will become the mechanism
            by which Social Security benefit recipients receive their payments in post offices.

4.3.1.2.    Today, these customers receive Social Security benefits in the post office (both cash and
            milk tokens) using an order book of payment foils, or a Girocheque.

4.3.1.3.    Under the required service, of which this procurement forms a large part, the
            encashment of benefit payments will be conducted at post offices by use of a token
            (hereinafter referred to as a card) which, once authenticated, unlocks payment details
            held in the PAS. To this extent the value is held in the system not in the card.

4.3.1.4.    The Service Provider's service will receive authorised payments from the CAPS and
            ensure their availability via the service infrastructure at post offices. This data will
            comprise benefit payment details, across all benefit types, and customer personal
            details. The exact nature of the latter are a matter for the judgement of the Service
            Provider, subject to confirmation of acceptability by the Contracting Authorities. A
            more detailed description of this service application follows.

4.3 .1.5.   Payments by card will be utilised for benefit collection at post offices replacing, over
            time, payments currently made by order book and Girocheque. The Government are
            committed to offering benefit customers a choice of payment method and will continue
            to encourage the use of ACT as an alternative to payment in the post office. The new
            method of payment (MOP) will also be used by the DHSS (Northern Ireland) Social
            Security Agency (SSA) and the War Pensions Agency (WPA). Further applications may
            be found for the process in the future such as payments from the Child Support Agency
            (CSA). In this SSR, where the business of the BA or DSS is described. it should be
            assumed unless otherwise stated, that this extends to cover the requirements of other
            departments and agencies which will use the BPS.

4.3.1.6.    Unemployment benefit is currently administered by Employment Services (ES) on
            behalf of the DSS and this benefit is paid predominantly by Girocheque. However,
            Unemployment Benefit will be phased out from April 1996 and replaced by Job Seekers
            Allowance (JSA) which will be administered by BA staff mostly from ES offices. The
            current planning assumption is that JSA will be paid initially by Girocheque or ACT but
            will be migrated, with all other BA administered benefits, to the new card method of
            payment.

4.3.1.7.    The benefits which may be covered by the BPS currently include:

            •       Attendance Allowance·

            •       Child Benefit;

            •       Child Special Allowance;

             •    Benefit Offices - About 2,000 locations from which benefits are administered.
                  Currently this includes all BA, WP A, ES and SSA locations. However the
                  Service Provider should note that future changes in benefit administration, along
                  with other uses of the services, will result in changes (potentially significant) to
                  this estate over time;

            •     CAPS (Customer Accounting and Payment System) - a new system which
                  creates a customer account for each benefit customer and, for card payments,
                  releases authorised payments into PAS;

            •     PAGL (Programme Accounting General Ledger)- a new system to generate and
                  maintain full benefit accounts, eventually on an accruals basis;

            •     Payment Authorisation Service (PAS) - a new service which authorises, via the
                  POCL Strategic Infrastructure, benefit payments for collection in post offices;

            •     Card Management Service (CMS) - a new service which manages the
                  production, distribution and monitoring of benefit payment cards to benefit
                  customers.

            Benefll Systems

4.3.2.3.    BA will, by the time the first card payments are issued, administer in excess of 30
            benefits from approximately 2,000 locations (including ES locations from which Job
            Seekers Allowance will be administered) including central benefit processing sites, the
            largest of which are at Blackpool and Newcastle. The administration of all but a few
            benefits (in all, less than 500,000 recipients) is supported by existing computer systems
            which are located in four Area Computer Centres at Swindon, Washington, Livingston
            and Norcross (Fylde). As used in this document 'benefit system' refers to both the
            computerised and the clerical systems.

4.3.2.4.    Under current arrangements, the majority of benefits are paid by order book. Alternative
            methods of payment for most benefits are Girocheque, ACT or payable order (in certain
            emergency circumstances, benefits can also be paid directly in cash). The problems with
            the current methods of payment at post offices and the solution to those problems -
            which has led to the creation of this programme - are explored fully in "Strategy for
            Benefit Payment at Post Office Counters", BAIPOCL, February 1994, an abridged
            version of which has been sent to all bidding Service Providers.

4.3.2.5.    Currently, benefit systems either print the physical instruments of payment (IOP)
            directly (a limited number are produced manually) or, in the case of ACT, feed directly
            into BACS. Today there is no one system which records all the payments that may have
            been made to an individual. Most of the benefit systems are designed to calculate future
            payments (up to a maximum of 52 weeks in advance) within various constraints (for
            example where the nature of the benefit rules limit the length of each award or where
            there is an impending benefit rate change). CAPS, to be built as part of this programme,
            will accept this string of future benefit payments. CAPS is to be developed as a
            component of the programme of which this procurement forms part.

 BA/POCL SSR                                                                  RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                    Description of Functional Requirements

 4.3.2.6.        It is important to note that the award of benefit has to be adjudicated (legally authorised)
                 and that these adjudications can only take place within the benefit systems under the
                 control of authorised officials. The services which are being procured as part of this
                 programme are concerned purely (in relation to the BPS) with ~ benefits and not
                 awardina benefits; this is an important separation.

                 CAPS - Customer Accounting and Payments System

 4.3.2.8.        CAPS will evolve to be the primary 'Benefit Customer Account' for all benefit
                 payments, debts and recoveries, including payments currently made by non-
                 computerised benefit systems.

 4.3.2.9.        It is assumed that CAPS will eventually hold, by customer, details of all benefit
                 payment transactions - both future (as they are calculated by benefit systems) and
                 previous (for up to two years) - irrespective of the method by which the payment is
                 made. The question of whether CAPS holds details of order book and Girocheque
                 payments for accounting and customer account enquiry purposes in the interim (before
                 the roll-out of cards is complete) is still under consideration.

4.3.2.10.    Although CAPS holds strings of future payments, where calculated by the benefits
             systems, the assumption in the SSR is that CAPS only releases an individual authorised
             payment into PAS just prior (making allowance for transmission and processing delay)
             to the due date for encashment in the post office. The CAPS design will also cater for
             the early release of authorised payments into PAS to allow for public holidays.

4.3.2.11.    In addition to authorised payments, CAPS also receives from the benefit systems
             notifications of debt decisions (e.g. the recognition within the benefit systems that an
             overpayment has occurred). Although these debt decisions are needed to create
             complete customer and benefit accounts they have no impact on the BPS. However,
             benefit systems can make provision to recover these debts through future benefit
             payments - such reduced payments will be notified to PAS by CAPS in the normal
             way.

4.3.2.12.    Where debts are recovered from the customer directly (rather than from benefit) these
             repayments are recorded on CAPS. This, again does not impact the BPS.

4.3.2.13.    The vast majority of customer enquiries handled in benefit offices are about payments.
             Therefore an important benefit of CAPS to the BA (in conjunction with other
             components of the BPS) is its ability to provide benefit staff with a single, complete
             information source for a customer's payments.

4.3 .2.14.   To support card payment and accounting functions, CAPS must source personal details
             for three categories of individual:

             •       all current BA, SSA and WPA customers (i.e. currently or recently in receipt of
                     benefit);

             •       all ex-customers of BA, SSA or WP A that have an outstanding debt;

BNPOCL SSR                                                                 RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                Description of Functional Requirements

             •     all individuals who act as an appointee, permanent agent or are an alternative
                   payee for a BA, SSA, WP A customer and are paid those benefits using the card
                   MOP and are not also in either category above (termed proxies).

4.3.2.15 .   CAPS needs personal details for a number of purposes, either for its own use or to pass
             to client services such as CMS and PAS:

             •     to verify that changes to personal details are, in fact, reported by the correct
                   individual;

             •     for use on enquiry screens and reports to confirm that the correct individual is
                   being dealt with;

             •     to contact individuals (e.g. to send them card pick-up notices via CMS or to send
                   them customer account statements);

             •     to send to CMS where some personal details are used on the card;

             •     to send to PAS to control payments (e.g. notification of appointee);

             •     to set up a CAPS account (even where the account holder is not paid any benefit
                   by card);

             •     to send to PAS for authentication at the post office.

4.3.2.16.    The sourcing of personal details for CAPS, which has a wider dimension than for other
             DSS systems, is still under discussion in the Department.

             CMS - Card Management Service

4.3.2.18.    CMS (described in more detail in 4.3.7) is responsible for arranging the supply.
             personalisation and distribution of the card and monitoring its status throughout its life.

4.3.2.19.    CMS receives an initial instruction from CAPS when an individual needs to be supplied
             with a card for the first time. It is assumed that cards will be refreshed, as decided by the
             Service Provider and agreed with the DSS, automatically by CMS and not under the
             control of CAPS.

4.3.2.20.    CAPS could make available to CMS certain personal details which may be needed to
             manage the card process (although this does not preclude data being gathered via
             another route).

4.3.2.21.    It is possible that the physical components of the CMS could be used to provide other
             card service offerings; including cards to be used for non-benefit payment purposes
             elsewhere in POCL' s domain.

                                   Description of Functional Requirements

                 PAS- Payment Authorisation Service

 4.3.2.23.       PAS (described in more detail in 4.3.6) is closely coupled to (but separate from) CMS
                 and receives authorised payments from CAPS. When the customer arrives at a post
                 office counter, PAS authorises any payments via the POCL Strategic Infrastructure.

 4.3.2.24.       PAS, via POCL Strategic Infrastructure, records the encashment and passes back a
                 confirmation of the encashment to CAPS.

4.3.2.25.        Individual authorised payments can be stopped in PAS (upon receipt of a stop
                 instruction from CAPS) if they have not been encashed.

4.3.2.26.    Authorised payments in PAS can only be cashed in a post office between their due date
             and their expiry date. Subject to CAPS control, early encashment may be available due
             to public holidays. If an authorised payment expires in PAS it is made void and a
             confirmation passed back to CAPS.

             PA GL - Programme Accounting General Ledger

4.3.2.28.    The PAGL will hold, in summarised form, all the transactions that flow through CAPS
             to create a set of accounts for benefit expenditure. Where authorised payments combine
             more than one benefit component the accounting analysis will be done at the individual
             component level.

4.3.2.29.    It is assumed that PAGL will be able to create accounts on both a cash basis and
             eventually on an accruals basis in order to feed into Resource Accounts for the
             Department.

4.3.2.30.    The ability of the new BPS described in this SSR, along with CAPS and PAGL, to
             genc..1.ate accurate benefit accounts is a major driver in the DSS behind the creation of
             the programme of which this procurement forms part.

             BAS - Benefit Apportionment System

4.3.2.32.    The BAS is currently used to apportion expenditure to create benefit accounts from an
             analysis of the issued payments. It is probable that BAS will continue in operation while
             order books are still in use and for an extended period until PAGL is fully operational
             and working smoothly. PAGL will eventually supersede BAS.

4.3.3        Key Business Events

4.3.3.1.     To provide a context for the components described above, this section shows how they
             ~ be combined to support some of the key business events supported by the BPS. It
             should be emphasised that these examples:

             •       are purely illustrative and do not intend to restrict Service Provider proposals;

             •       do not represent all the business events that must be supported by the BPS.

            •        illustrated in Figure 4-5, the customer selects (or is switched to) the card method
                     of payment) which is notified to the benefit system (step 1) (which will
                     automatically update CAPS). Alternatively the necessary details to switch the
                     customer to card MOP are already held in which case the benefit system directly
                     notifies CAPS (step 2);

            •        CAPS sends an instruction to CMS notifying the customer's need for a card (step
                     3) along with relevant personal details;

            •        CMS sends the card to the post office (step 5) which confirms its arrival (step 7/8)
                     via the POCL Infrastructure. CMS then issues a pick up notice to the customer
                     (step 4);

            •        the customer collects the card at the post office (step 6) and the post office informs
                     CMS of the collection (step 7/8).

                •    illustrated in Figure 4-6, the customer sends in a claim form or notifies a change
                     of circumstance (step I); the benefit systems record the evidence and make an
                     award;

                •   the benefit systems pass authorised payments to CAPS (step 2) which, at some
                    time before they are due, passes them to PAS (step 3);

            •       the customer comes into the post office to collect the payment (step 4) and
                    presents a card which is used to authenticate the individual in PAS via the POCL
                    Infrastructure (step 5/6)·

            •       the customer encashes the required payments and a confirmation is sent back to
                    PAS via the POCL Infrastructure (step 5/6); PAS then sends a confirmation back
                    to CAPS (step 7).

                                    Figure 4-7 Card reported stolen

            •       illustrated in Figure 4-7 the customer reports that his card has been stolen (step 1)
                    to CMS help desk (the customer can also report the theft of the card via the benefit
                    office, but the preferred route will be direct to the CMS help desk). CMS help
                    desk confirms with the customer (either at the time of contact or by a pick up
                    notice) the post office from which he should collect the replacement card (step 2);

            •       CMS invalidates the old card (informing PAS to prevent further encashments);

            •       CMS sends the replacement card to the post office (step 3) which confirms its
                    arrival via the POCL Infrastructure (step 5/6) to CMS;

            •       the customer collects the replacement card at the post office (step 4) and the post
                    office informs CMS of the collection via the POCL Infrastructure (step 5/6).

            •           illustrated in Figure 4-8 the customer notifies their change of name to the benefit
                        system (step 1) which then informs CAPS (step 2);

            •       CAPS sends notifications to CMS and PAS notifying the customer's new name
                    (steps 3/4);

            •       CMS sends a new card to the post office (step 5) which confirms its arrival (step
                    8/9). CMS then issues a pick up notice to the customer (step 6);

            •       the customer collects the new card at the post office (step 7) in exchange for
                    her/his old card (and pick up notice) and the post office informs CMS, via the
                    POCL Strategic Infrastructure of the collection (step 8/9). CMS invalidates the
                    old card at this point;

            •       CMS then informs PAS that the old card has been invalidated and the new one is
                    now active (step 10). PAS now accepts via the POCL Infrastructure, the new card
                    in future authentication attempts (steps 11/12).

            Services Included within the Scope of this Procurement

            End-to-End DesiiD of the Benefit Payment Service
4.3.4.2.    The Service Provider is required to design a total service that extends from the
            information links with the CAPS system to the appropriate BA customer encashing a
            payment at the post office. Where the Service Provider develops and operates
            components of this end-to-end service, they will be required to accept responsibility for
            those components in terms of service quality, service levels and risk.

4.3.4.3 .   ln addition to this end-to-end design the Sen·ice Provider ~hould show how their
            proposed technical components within that design - PAS, CMS and the POCL

              components.

 4.3.4.4.    The Contracting Authorities will need to be satisfied that the proposed services can
             contribute to the overall acceptability of the business service, and that the characteristics
             of the service (e.g. the authentication process) are acceptable both legally and socially.
             During the contract negotiation phase of the procurement such acceptability will be
             confirmed, and the effect of any restrictions discussed.

             Payment Authorisation Service <PAS)
4.3.4.5.     The Service Provider will provide the service which allows, and reports on, the
             encashment of specific payments by specific customers. The payment details will be
             provided by CAPS, and the system will provide the service through the interface to the
             POCL Strategic Infrastructure to enable the counter clerk to make a valid payment to a
             customer. The risk of authorising the encashment will be the Service Provider's. Full
             details of PAS are provided in 4.3.6.

             Card Manaiement Service <CMS)
4.3.4.6.     The Service Provider will be responsible for the service of producing, issuing, replacing
             and renewing the card which will be the primary means of identifying customers of the
             end-to-end benefit payment system. The CAPS system will provide business led
             prompts for changing the state of a card (e.g. new customer, deceased customer), and
             there will be a series of other events the service must react to (e.g. reported loss,
             reported damage, card life expiry). Full details of CMS are provided in 4.3.7.

             Services Excludedfr om the Scope of this Procurement

             Benefit Systems
4.3.4.8.     The Service Provider will not be required to adopt or replace the systems which already
             exist to adjudicate on and calculate the payment of benefits. These systems will provide
             payment and personal details to CAPS which will, in turn pass the relevant information
             to the Service Provider's PAS and CMS .

             Benefit Apportionment System <BAS) Pro2[amme Accountini General Ledier <PAGL)
4.3.4.9.     The existing and proposed BAS and PAGL systems will not form part of the services
             falling under this procurement. The services will have no direct interfaces with PAS or
             CMS. All such interfacing will be handled by the CAPS service.

             Customer Accountini and Payment System <CAPS)
4.3 .4.10.   The initial version of CAPS is currently being designed by the DSS and will be
             developed by the DSS Information Technology Services Agency (ITSA). Its operational
             capability will be provided for the Department by a third party Service Provider through
             ITSA's 'Focus 95' service delivery outsourcing programme.

               Services which, at the Option q,fthe Service Provider, may be Included within the
               Scope of this Procurement

 4.3.4.12.    The Service Provider is free to propose an extension of the scope of the services defined
              in this requirement, other than into the areas specifically excluded above. In this case the
              Service Provider must fully justify the benefit to the Contracting Authorities of the
              extension in terms of value for money and service quality, and must accept the right of
              the authorities to decline such extensions at their sole discretion.

4.3.5         Benefit Payment Service Features

4.3.5.1       Card

4.3.5.1.1.    The card is a token with no intrinsic value, the purpose of which is to identify the
              holder. Further information (to be agreed with the Service Provider) will be used to
              verify that the person holding the card is the one identified by it (authentication) for the
              purpose of paying DSS benefits and other DSS purposes. If successfully authenticated,
              the person will then be able to collect the payments they have been authorised to
              receive. All payment items must be collected and taken in full.

4.3.5.1.2.    When fully rolled out, cards (plus any alternative temporary token, see 4.3.7.1) will
              support the only Method of Payment available in post offices, with the exception of
              ACT payments made into National Savings or Girobank accounts - these can also be
              withdrawn at post offices.

4.3 .5.1.3.   It is currently assumed that customers will hold only one valid card at any point in time,
              even if the customer is acting as appointee or agent for another customer. However, the
              assumption may not hold and the Service Provider must provide the flexibility to allow
              customers to have more than one active card. Any valid card must allow the individual
              to collect all benefits to which they are entitled.

4.3.5.1.4.    It should be noted that cards may have more than one livery (even within a single
              agency's customer base); for example SSA and WPA cards may be different from BA
              cards. It should be possible to replace or renew a card with one of a different livery. Any
              card held by a customer must give access to all payments due, even across agencies.

4.3 .5.1.5 . The Service Provider must consider the requirement to print any collateral material,
             which supports card issue and processing, in multiple languages including non-
             European languages. In particular, the Service Provider should note that it is
             Governmental policy to use the Welsh language where applicable - the Service
             Provider should note that this requirement extends across the entire BPS (and indeed all
             other services at post offices). Any constraints of the Service Provider's service in these
             areas must be identified.

4.3.5.1.6.    The DSS will, in consultation with POCL, agree the design of the card with the Service
              Provider and any such design will ultimately require the approval of the Secretary of
              State for Social Security. The DSS may require, over time, design changes to the card
              which the Service Provider would need to support.

                                        Description of Functional Requirements

 4.3.5.1.7.         The details that are visible on the card can be proposed by the Service Provider but
                    should include:

                    •    National Insurance Number (NINO) to facilitate client identification by the DSS
                         and to encourage wider recognition of NINO amongst DSS customers for use in
                         their contacts with the Department;

                    •    customer's requested name to allow differentiation of cards within the household;

                •        card number to support keyed entry (if the card cannot be machine read);

                •        expiry date.

4.3.5.1.8.      Every card number should be unique. Service Providers should conform to card industry
                numbering standards and may use a numeric version of the customer's NINO within the
                card number scheme if they wish.

4 .3. 5.1. 9.   Although no constraints are placed on the technology used for the card (for example,
                magnetic stripes are not mandated), Service Provider's card proposals should, where
                possible, conform to the relevant financial industry standards. Indeed, it is thought that
                to maximise customer acceptance of the card it is desirable to assume the characteristics
                of payment methods with which the public may already be familiar.

4.3.5.l .10. Any use of the card for a purpose other than the card MOP at post offices would require
             the approval of the Secretary of State for Social Security. Such approval is unlikely to
             be given except for:

                •       DSS purposes other than the payment of benefit;

                •       other applications at the post office counter (which of course would also need
                        POCL approval).

4.3 .5.1.11. The Service Provider should note that proposals for such additional uses are not sought
             as part of this procurement.

4.3.5 .1.12. The Service Provider should note that the Home Secretary has announced plans to
             evaluate the potential uses of a UK Government smart card and that such a card could
             be used to collect Social Security benefits in addition to other uses. The Service
             Provider is required to:

                •       provide a defined migration path to smart card technology;

                •       indicate how their services could be adapted to utilise, for the purpose of benefit
                        encashment at post offices, such a card issued by a third party.

4.3.5.2         Authentication

4.3.5.2.1.      To ensure that benefit payments are encashed by the right person (and hence ensure the
                valueless nature of the card), it is expected that some form of authentication will be

                  required. The purpose of authentication is to ensure that the customer is who he (and the
                  card) says he is.

 4.3.5.2.2.       It is for the Service Provider to propose the preferred means of authenticating card
                  holders (including the initial and repeated collection, or "registration", of such data). To
                  facilitate this the DSS can make available to PAS (via CAPS) the following data items
                  from the current systems:

                            Composite List Penona l Details Available via CAPS:
                   1.       National Insurance Number of Customer
                   2.       National Insurance Numbers of all individuals that can act as a
                            proxy for this customer (appointees, alternative payees,
                            permanent agents)
                   3.       Address (including No Fixed Abode -       NF A -    and Dead Letter
                            Office -DLO- indicators)
                  4.        Surname, forenames and title
                   5.       Requested title (full style of a customer's address where this is not
                            catered for by the surname , forename and title fields e.g. 'The
                            Warden of St. Annes')
                  6.        Date of Birth
                  7.        Customer Sex
                  8.        Date of death
                  9.        Nominated post office (if appropriate)

4.3.5.2.3 . Beyond this list of data items, the Service Provider is at liberty to collect, via
                                                                                               their own
            arrangements, additional personal data for authentication purposes . However, such
            additional data collection is subject to the following constraints:

              •         additional data items are the property of the Secretary of State for Social Security ;

              •         Secretary of State for Social Security approval is needed for the collection of each
                        such additional item;

              •         for additional items of data that are mandatory for making benefit payments by
                        card, that the necessary powers to collect such information are conferred by the
                        Social Security Administration Act and that such powers may not be directly
                        transferable to the Service Provider .

4.3.5.2.4.    In designing their authentication proposals, the Service Provider should consider the
              following :

              •         there is a very broad range of people that 1D.l.lS1 be able to use this method of
                        payment effectively;

                               Description of Functional Requirements

             •    for the most disadvantaged, it is quite likely that this is the only method of
                  payment open to them;

             •    for these groups careful consideration should be given to the appropriateness and
                  effectiveness of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs);

             •    it is unlikely that certain biometrics, such as finger prints or palm geometry, which
                  might be considered intrusive, would be acceptable forms of authentication
                  (although photographs and behavioural biometrics such as dynamic and static
                  signature recognition may be acceptable);

             •    authentication procedures (and possibly cards) that differ across client groups (e.g.
                  pensioners/ working age) may be proposed. However, such proposals must not be
                  discriminatory on any other basis and would be subject to approval by the
                  Secretary of State for Social Security;

             •    authentication procedures must not impair customer service levels; in particular it
                  is expected that there will not be any increase in counter service time. The time
                  taken will be an important evaluation criterion;

             •    it should be possible to invalidate cards and- record and retain other proofs of
                  identity or cards used in attempted fraudulent transactions without breaching
                  confidentiality, and to retain necessary evidence.

4.3.5.2.5.   Any primary or secondary research available to the Service Provider in support of their
             proposed forms of authentication would be of interest to the Contracting Authorities.

4.3.5.2.6.   The Service Provider should be able to demonstrate that a series of successively more
             secure anti-fraud measures can be deployed using the proposed underlying architecture,
             infrastructure and interfaces without the need for significant re-engineering. Such
             measures could be kept in reserve and deployed as needed.

4.3.5.3      Proxy Arrangements under Cards

4.3.5.3.1.   The end-to-end benefit payments system must support payments to persons other than
             the beneficiary in all of the following cases:

             •    the beneficiary has an appointee;

             •    the beneficiary has nominated a permanent agent;

             •    the beneficiary has nominated an alternative payee (for those benefits where this
                  facility is currently or in future is made available);

             •    the customer has authorised a casual agent to collect payments due.

4.3.5.3.2.   All proxy arrangements, except casual agents, must be approved by the DSS. The
             Service Provider will then be informed of such arrangements (and hence of the potential
             need for cards) on either a customer basis or individual payment basis.

                                 Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.5.3.3.    The Service Provider should propose mechanisms that will support a fraud-resistant
              casual agent encashment facility.

              Appointees

4.3.5.3.4.    Where an individual is appointed to collect benefit on the customer's behalf the
              customer will not be able to collect the payment in their own right. This will be reflected
              in the authorised payment passed from CAPS to PAS (the customer's National Insurance
              Number will not be included in the 'allowed payee' list, see 4.3.6.2). Note that
              institutional appointees are usually paid via ACT.

4.3.5 .3.5.   Appointees act for the customer in collecting all designated benefits that the customer is
              entitled to. This includes any previously issued payments that have not yet been
              collected, as well as all future payments. The customer, for whom the appointee acts,
              should also be able to collect any previously issued (but uncollected) payments,
              although, in practice, this is unlikely to happen. The customer should not be able to
              collect future payments.

4.3.5.3.6.    The nominated appointee will have a separate card (unless the appointee opts to have
              the payments made by an alternative MOP). If the nominated appointee is in receipt of
              benefit in their own right, or acts as agent or appointee for other customers, then the
              same card will be used by the appointee to encash all the payments they are authorised
              for (except where such payments are not issued via the card MOP). See also section
              4.3.5.1. (cards).

4.3.5.3.7.    It should be noted that, in addition to appointees, War Pensions have the ability to pay
              pension to other persons where the Secretary of State representative decides it is
              appropriate.

              Permanent Agents

4.3.5.3.8. The customer, can under certain circumstances, nominate a permanent agent who may
           collect nominated benefits (not necessarily all) on their behalf. The customer can also
           collect these payments. Some benefits may not allow permanent agent encashment -
           such situations will be notified to PAS by CAPS on a payment basis.

4.3.5.3.9. The nominated permanent agent will have a separate card to the customer. If the
           permanent agent is in receipt of benefit in their own right, or acts as agent or appointee
           for other customers, then the agent's card will be used by the agent to encash all the
           payments they are authorised for (except where such payments are not issued via the
           card MOP). See also section 4.3.5.1 .

              Casual Agents

4.3.5.3.10. At any time and for any reason, a customer may wish to nominate any other individual
            to act as a casual agent for the collection of any payments that the customer is entitled
            to. Such a casual agent may or may not be known to the DSS, the Service Provider or
            the post office.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.5.3.11. At present, for order books, the customer currently signs the front of each foil to be
            encashed (in the normal place) and hands over the whole book to the casual agent. As
            well as confirming entitlement of the customer to the benefit, the signature informs the
            post office that the payment may be collected by the agent, whose name is written in the
            appropriate place on the back of the foil.

4.3.5.3.12. The agent takes the book to the post office and collects the money. The only
            requirement is that the agent signs the back of each foil. He may also be asked to
            provide some form of identity (such as a driving licence). New procedures are being
            introduced for some benefits that will require casual agents to bring evidence of identity
            of the customer too. Apart from the name and the signature, no other information is
            recorded about the casual agent.

4.3.5.3.13. The process is similar for a Girocheque unless it is crossed, in which case it can only be
            paid into a bank account.

4.3.5.3.14. Any post office restriction that applies to the customer will also apply to the casual
            agent when cashing the customer's benefit payments.

4.3.5.3.15. Whilst providing a high level of customer service, this arrangement represents a
            significant risk to payment security and is currently a potential source of fraud. Some
            possible scenarios are as follows:

            •     the order book / Girocheque may be stolen. in which case the criminal can sign the
                  foils and complete the casual agent details for himself. The post office does not
                  verify the customer signature against any independent source;

            •     customers may give up or sell their order book / Girocheque;

            •     customers can be forced to confer casual agent status under duress.

4.3.5.3.16. Such problems occur because there is currently no method of confirming that the casual
            agent has been appointed in good faith and no independent mechanism for verifying the
            arrangement.

4.3.5.3.17. However, it is a requirement that customers that are unable to come to their post office
            should still be able to receive their benefit. It is also desirable that at least some of the
            wider customer service flexibility implied in the current arrangements should be
            available in the new service, albeit with different procedures. The Service Provider must
            propose how a casual agent facility would be provided and describe the balance struck
            between customer service and security: the Service Provider might consider that where a
            casual agent is able to present their own benefit payment card, which can be
            authenticated in the normal way, as a form of identity then the need for additional
            checks may be reduced.

                               Description of Functional Requirements

            Alternative Payees

4.3.5.3.18. Under certain circumstances - generally dictated by specific benefit rules - an
            alternative payee can be nominated for the benefit (currently for Family Credit,
            Disability Working Allowance and Child Benefit).

4.3.5.3.19. The purpose of the alternative payee arrangement is to continue to allow the primary
            customer to have the control over whether they or the alternative payee collect each
            payment (primarily in order to allow a mother to gain primary access to the benefit).

4.3.5.3.20. In circumstances where an alternative payee is a beneficiary in their own right and has a
            separate card, payments made to the primary customer should not automatically be
            available to be encashed by the alternative payee without prior authorisation by the
            primary customer.

4.3.5.3.21. The Service Provider is encouraged to propose mechanisms which achieve the same
            policy goal in a cost effective manner (it should be noted that the majority of alternative
            payees do not receive another benefit in their own right and therefore may not
            necessarily have a card for any other purpose).

            General

4.3.5.3.22. Where a customer receives his or her benefit using the card MOP, alternative payees and
            permanent agents must also use the card MOP for those payments. An appointee can
            choose to switch to ACT.

4.3.5.3.23. The security constraints governing the issue and use of cards for appointees, permanent
            agents and alternative payees will be at least as stringent as those governing the use of
            cards by the primary customer.

4.3.5.3.24. It is assumed that if a customer has an appointee they cannot also nominate an agent
            (casual or permanent), or have an alternate payee.

4.3.5.3.25. It is assumed that a customer can nominate a permanent agent in addition to having an
            alternate payee.

4.3.5.3.26. Under any of the proxy arrangements discussed above, authentication is at least as
            stringent as that required for beneficiaries and is as already described. Authentication
            provides to the Service Provider a greater level of confidence that the person requesting
            encashrnent is who the card (or temporary token) says he is. Entitlement of that person
            to payments (his own and others) is indicated by the payment data and not the card.

            office to support the BPS. These relate to the collection of new cards and the

 BNPOCLS SR                                                                  RESTRICTED - Commercial

                  by the Service Provider for situations when a post office is unable to use PAS (for
                  whatever reason).

 4.3.5.4.2.       The Service Provider should balance very carefully the need to deploy counter measures
                  against fraud with the need to maintain high levels of customer service and safety,
                  whilst designing to minimise total service transaction times (these times will be taken
                  into account during evaluation).

 4.3.5.4.3.    The Service Provider should ensure that the Benefit Payment Service is available to all
               customers or potential customers, including the elderly, those with disabilities and those
               of no fixed abode. It should also be provided in all post offices. There should be no
               service differentiation between different customers or post offices.

              Collection of New Card

4.3.5.4.4.    Although the description below presumes that the new card will be sent to post offices,
              the supplied service should not preclude them being sent directly to the customer or
              distributed by some other channel which the Service Provider might recommend. The
              Service Provider will be responsible for getting the card to the customer.

4.3.5.4.5.    New cards may be sent to the post office as they are issued. If so, they must be handed
              over to the customer upon presentation of appropriate identification (for example a card
              pick up notice, PUN, that has been issued by CMS). Some form of authentication may
              also be required as proposed by the Service Provider and agreed with the Contracting
              Authorities.

4.3.5.4.6.    It should be noted that the Service Provider's proposed card distribution procedures
              should allow for the circumstance where the customer, say through illness or severe
              disability, is unable to visit a post office, DSS office or other office in person. If the
              Service Provider's proposals allow for agent collection of cards then the following might
              be considered:

              •       where an agent is able to present their own benefit payment card which can be
                      authenticated on-line in the normal way, as a form of identity then the need for
                      additional checks may be reduced;

              •       although the card may have been collected by an agent it may be appropriate to
                      require some special procedure when the card is used for the first time.

4.3.5.4.7.    The Service Provider will need to cater for the situation where the customer arrives at
              the post office (assuming distribution of cards via post offices) with a valid PUN and for
              some reason the card is not available for collection (e.g. the card could not be read when
              it first arrived at the post office).

              Payment Encashment

4.3.S.4.8.    Customers will attend the post office to collect card payments as they do now for order
              book and Girocheque payments. The service should ensure that payments can only be
              encashed by a person who has been authorised by the DSS, their authorised agents or an

             authorised customer. The service should also support payment to authorised customers
             who are unable to attend the post office.

4.3.5.4.9.   Upon presentation of the card at the counter a number of stages will be required, as
             described below.

             Customer ldentif,cation

4.3.5.4.10. To identify the customer, the reference identifier for the card will be entered onto PAS
            via the POCL Strategic Infrastructure (e.g. by swiping the card or by keying the card
            number), which will check that the card is valid (using positive validation) and indicate
            the recorded card holder.

             Authentication

4. 3. 5. 4 .11. Having confirmed the validity of the card, an authentication stage will be required to
                ensure that the customer is the recorded card holder. This is likely to require the
                customer to provide details that correspond to those on the system (rather than the card).
                Collection of these details must be such that no other customer could gain access to
                them.

             Collection of Payments

4 .3 .5 .4 .12. If authentication is successful then payment details for the customer are presented and
                encashment is allowed to proceed.

4.3 .5.4.13. A receipt and declaration of entitlement are produced for the customer to sign. The cash
             is then issued and the card returned.

4.3.5.4.14. If the customer has payments for more than one beneficiary (including potentially
            himself) then it is expected that payments for each must be dealt with separately. Each
            will require a separate hand-over of cash and signing of a receipt. This facilitates the
            subsequent transfer of the correct money and receipt to each beneficiary. as appropriate.

             Receipts

4.3.5.4.15. The dated receipt will be a multiple copy item, although single ply paper is not ruled
            out. Each copy will need to be sent to the appropriate destination.

4.3.5.4.16. Subject to the Service Provider's proposals, the signing of the receipt may also be part of
            the authentication procedure.

             Temporary Tokens

4 .3 .5 .4 .17. In order to support encashment of urgent payments, the Service Provider may need to
                support the use of 'one-shot' temporary tokens. Such tokens should be used only once
                and should be invalidated and impounded at the post office after use.

                               Description of Functional Requirements

             Encashment Problems

 4.3.5.4.18. Encashment problems may arise due to failure of any component of the service,
             including the card or the POCL infrastructure. Service Providers should indicate how
             payments could be made under such circumstances.

4.3.5 .4.19. A number of other problems may occur at the post office counter during encashment,
             such as:

            •     attempt to use an invalid or suspended card;

            •     authentication failure;

            •     attempt to make an invalid foreign encashment;

            •     attempt to collect a restricted payment at a post office other than the one to which
                  the customer or payment has been restricted.

4.3.5.4.20. These are described in more detail in sections 4.3.6.1. 'Encashment Problems'.

            Related Customer Services

4.3.5.4.21. Other services, related to benefit payment, may be offered to customers at post offices.

4.3.5.4.22. Customers can currently report changes to their nominated post office at post offices. It
            is thought desirable that the Service Provider should offer some form of automated
            process to support reporting of these changes. See section 4.3.5.7 for further details.

4.3.5.4.23. It is currently envisaged that a statement of account may be provided by the DSS to
            benefit customers on request. This statement may indicate all payments issued to the
            customer since the last statement (the exact nature and format is still under
            consideration).

4.3 .5.4.24. It is expected that the statement will be produced and distributed by the DSS although it
             may be desirable for a customer to request the statement while at a post office. Service
             Providers should note that this feature may not be required initially at 'go-live' of the
             service. However, provision should be made for it in the design of the service. If this
             feature is introduced as part of the service. it should only be possible to request a DSS
             statement as part of a payment collection transaction and not as a separate counter
             transaction.

4.3 .5.4.25 . Such a request would be transmitted, via the POCL Infrastructure and PAS, to CAPS.

4.3.5.4.26. A customer' s eligibility for milk tokens and the number to be issued is currently stated
            on the order book or Girocheque. Service Providers are asked to consider how their
            proposed system design/service might allow for the entitlement to be flagged to the
            counter clerk. The Contracting Authorities will confirm their requirements at a later
            date.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.5.4.27. POCL are considering the provision of a saving/budget account facility which would be
            available to all customers, including benefit recipients. Subject to agreement with the
            BA and the Service Provider, this may involve limited use of the benefit payment card.

4.3.5.5      CMS Customer Services

4.3.5.5.1.   It is expected that the responsibility for dealing with the majority of reports and queries
             from the public about cards (along with other services provided by the Service Provider)
             will lie with the Service Provider. The Service Provider should propose both the form
             that this public interface may take (for example, a 24 hourfreephone help line) and how
             they will promote its use by the card using public.

4.3.5.5.2.   It is accepted that benefit staff should, subject to business process design, also be
             capable of dealing with such queries (although it should not be the favoured
             mechanism). To this end, the Service Provider should demonstrate how they can
             provide benefit delivery staff with secure and auditable access to CMS.

4.3.5.5.3.   The Service Provider should propose ways to reduce the extent to which benefit staff
             have to deal directly with card related enquiries while still providing customers with a
             seamless, one stop service. Where benefit staff need to be involved in the process of
             handling card related enquiries, even if this involvement is limited to transferring a
             telephone call or letter, the Service Provider should propose ways in which they could
             facilitate the necessary staff training.

4.3.5.6      Financial Reconciliation

4.3.5.6.1.   The required service must allow BA to reconcile fully (at an individual transaction level
             if desired) the statements it receives from POCL in respect of benefit payments and any
             associated handling fees.

4.3.5.6.2.   Every payment made (also stopped payments and expired payments) will be confirmed
             on CAPS with a message sent from PAS. Therefore, the BA will have an accurate
             record of its benefit expenditure.

4.3.5.6.3.   The service design should minimise the potential for disputes to arise between the
             Contracting Authorities and the Service Provider regarding responsibility for errant
             transactions.

4.3.5. 7     Nominated Post Offices

4.3.5.7.1.   When a customer elects to receive benefit payments at the post office, he currently
             selects the post office at which he will normally encash his payments. This is termed the
             'nominated' post office and encashments at any other post office are called 'foreign'
             encashments ("temporary change of post office" - "holiday" - encashments). The
             assignment of a nominated post office has various advantages. These include support for
             encashment restrictions (the customer is currently limited to two foreign encashments in
             any one order book); the monitoring of potentially fraudulent benefit encashment; the

             management of cash provision; and the links which POCL' s agents develop with local
             customers.

4.3.5.7.2.   Certain payments made by girocheque do not require a post office to be nominated.
             Customers may encash such payments at any post office without restriction

4.3.5.7.3.   Service Providers are encouraged to suggest alternatives to the present nominated post
             office procedures detailing the implications operationally and for the customers.

             Changes to "Nominated" Post Offices

4.3.5.7.4.   Whilst in receipt of benefit payments the customer may currently change their
             nominated post office using a special procedure. This procedure involves completing a
             form (P80MA) at either the post office or the benefit office. The BA can then either
             accept the change (entering details separately into the benefit systems) or, in unusual
             circumstances, the change may be refused.

4.3.5.7.5.   If nominated post offices continue the current procedure could remain. However, the
             Service Provider is encouraged to propose an alternative mechanism; preferably one that
             captures the change of nominated post office in the post office and reports the change
             (via the POCL Strategic Infrastructure) to CAPS, and one that does not involve clerical
             intervention by BA staff other than by exception. Such a mechanism must not allow
             changes of nominated post office where the customer is currently restricted to their
             nominated post office (this can only be lifted under control of benefit staff).

4.3.5.8      Customer Education and Marketing

4.3.5.8.1.   Order books, the most widely used current method of payment, have been in use in the
             lf1'- for over 40 years and are familiar to over 20 million people. The problems in
             changing to a new method of payment are therefore very significant. The Service
             Provider will be required to submit detailed proposals as to how they can achieve the
             education programme, implied through welcome packs, other collateral and other media,
             and how they will monitor its effectiveness.

4.3.5.8.2.   In any case, card customers should be encouraged to value the card; i.e. they should
             store it safely even during periods between benefit claims (note that certain client
             groups drop into and out of benefit on a cyclical basis).

4.3.5.8.3.   Although market research into the potential use of cards to pay Social Security benefits
             shows that the majority of benefit customers would be in favour, concern over the use of
             this MOP has been expressed by some special interest groups, including those
             representing the elderly and the disabled. The Service Provider should therefore propose
             ways in which the new method of payment can be designed and marketed in order to
             allay any public concerns. These proposals should be illustrated with any Service
             Provider specific experience in related payments projects. All or part of this marketing
             and custcmer educr.tion efforl may be contracted for fr~m the Se:-vice Provider.

                                  Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.5.9          Functional Qualities

             Reliability

4.3.5.9.1.   In common with all system interfaces dealing with financial authorisation and
             associated personal identification and authentication, those between CAPS and PAS /
             CMS must be reliable in terms of both ~suring secure data transmission and
             maintaining the integrity of that data. This reliability is particularly important in the
             context of benefit payments since the customer base includes some of the most
             vulnerable in society who rely heavily on the accurate and timely availability of their
             payments.

             Auditability

4.3.5.9.2.   All data transmission across the DSS / Service Provider boundary, and any related
             actions taken by the Service Provider, must be fully auditable both to enable resolution
             of any disputes that may arise and to support external scrutiny. In particular, the Service
             Provider should note that, in addition to tracking the movement of cards and receipts,
             payment transaction details and any collateral forms (such as may be required to support
             casual agent encashment) will also need to be tracked and stored for audit purposes and
             possibly for use as evidence in court in fraud cases.

4.3.5.9.3.   The Service Provider's design should allow for non-availability of infrastructure
             services to the post office such as mains electricity and communications networks
             (including the Public Switched Telephone Network).

             Data Sensitivity

4.3.5.9.4.   Certain cases (such as those for VIPs) are maintained as 'nationally sensitive' within the
             DSS. Access to any details on such cases is limited and, in some cases, to very small
             numbers of DSS staff. In addition, cases which relate to 'locally sensitive' individuals
             (for example, local councillors or relatives of benefit delivery staff) are also marked and
             access limited in the corresponding locations. The Service Provider will need to
             demonstrate the ability to place similar access restrictions on the data supplied to them.

4.3.5.9.5.   More generally the Service Provider must describe how they intend to provide security
             control across their proposed services including (and for example):

             •       physical storage and transmission of data;

             •       physical access to hardware infrastructure;

             •       authentication of users;

             •       data and function access control;

             •       auditing accesses and changes to the data.

              Configuration Management

4.3.5.9.6.    It is anticipated that the Benefit Payment Service will give rise to a number of specific
              configuration management issues in addition to the general requirements covered in
              Chapter 5, such as:

              •     the management of distributed cryptographic keys for card or user authentication;

              •     synchronisation of time based events (such as payment stop request and response)
                    across physically discrete systems, so that sequencing of transactions between
                    systems can be guaranteed and overall data integrity maintained.

4.3.5.9.7.    The Service Provider must indicate how such issues will be addressed, both within the
              procured service and across the BPS as a whole. Solutions must take into account
              required business processes as well as any proposed system components.

              Scalability

4.3 .5.9.8.   The DSS, in common with other governmental and private sector bodies, is subject to
              frequent and sometimes rapid changes in its core business. The Service Provider should
              anticipate a degree of volatility and, to support such changes, should be able to
              demonstrate scalability of their solution to cope with wide-ranging benefit changes such
              as the introduction of new benefits and withdrawal of current ones.

4.3.6         Payment Authorisation Service

4.3.6.1       Functional Properties

              Ge11era/

4.3 .6.1.1 . CAPS will receive card payments both for benefits which are currently computerised
             and those which are paid currently via a clerical process. It will forward them to PAS
             which will be responsible for managing the payment process from that point. Such
             payments may include both cash entitlement and various tokens. They will only be valid
             from a due date for a defined period after which time the payment expires. Although
             milk tokens (of two types - one for ordinary milk and the other for dried) are the only
             form of token in use at present, the service should provide the flexibility to deal with
             multiple token types if needed.

4.3.6.1.2. To support PAS in controlling payments, CAPS could supply PAS with a range of
           personal details consisting of the client's name together with any authentication data that
           has been agreed.

4.3.6.1.3. Payment details must not be alterable by any unauthorised body during their passage
           through the end-to-end benefit payment service.

              Urgent Payments

4.3.6.1.4.    Nomially payments will be passed to PAS before their due date. However, support must
              be provided for urgent issue of payments for encashment at a post office (nominated or
              otherwise). It is anticipated that a likely target time for making an urgent payment
              available for collection in the post office is 30 minutes from its award by the benefit
              system. Depending on the circumstances, such transactions may necessitate the use of
              temporary tokens and authentication procedures.

4.3.6. l.5.   Urgent payments are likely to have a short period of validity, as specified on the
              payment data sent from CAPS to PAS.

              Foreign ('Holiday') Encashments

4.3.6.1.6.    It is envisaged that if 'nominated post office' remains, the restrictions, which currently
              apply lo order book encashments at 'foreign post offices' (i.e. post offices other than the
              nominated post office), will continue to apply for card payments. Encashments at a
              foreign post office will only be allowed for a specified number of times within a
              specified period (currently 2 weeks within a 20 week period). The DSS will retain the
              flexibility to change these two parameters. In some cir-cumstances, foreign encashments
              may not be allowed at all (see Restricted Encashment below). In other cases foreign
              encashments may be unlimited.

4.3.6.1.7.    The card method of payment may, dependent upon the Service Provider's proposals, be
              the subject of a phased roll-out. During any such period, the Service Provider would
              need to propose ways in which foreign encashments can still be made, using the card, at
              post offices which are not equipped with the POCL Strategic Infrastructure. It is
              anticipated that the solution to this problem could also be used, even after roll-out, to
              continue to pay via card where the equipment in the post office is faulty, unavailable or
              unable to connect to the POCL Strategic Infrastructure.

              Restricted Encashment

4.3.6.1.8.    PAS must allow encashments to be restricted to a specific post office for either a
              specific customer or a specific payment. If the restriction is placed on the customer then
              the restriction applies to all payments they have entitlement to. Where this customer has
              a proxy (appointee, agent or alternative payee) then the restriction also applies to the
              proxy in respect of payments collected for the restricted customer. Restrictions for a
              specific payment would apply to that payment only (irrespective of the customer
              collecting it).

              Authorisation

4.3.6.1.9.    Authorisation for card-based payments is the transmission of the payment by CAPS into
              PAS. Payments will be authorised in sufficient time for PAS to make the payment
              available (but not earlier so as to minimise the number of revisions across the CAPS /
              PAS boundary). The payment data will include the allowed payees together with any
              post office restriction applicable.

                               Description of Functional Requirements

               Expiry

4.3.6.1.10. All authorised payments will have an associated expiry date which is the last day upon
            which they can be encashed in the post office. Payments which have passed their expiry
            date must be made void in PAS and a confirmation returned to CAPS.

4.3.6.1.11. The payment expiry date may vary with benefit or transaction type. It is passed to PAS
            with the payment data.

4.3.6.1.12. Currently, order book foils have 3 month validity and Girocheques I month: a recent
            sample of order book foil encashments showed that the vast majority were encashed
            within the first week. Service Providers are invited to give their views on the benefits or
            costs of reducing the validity period of all payments to 4 or 5 weeks.

           Stopped Payments

4.3.6.1.13. It must be possible to stop previously authorised payments which (as far as CAPS is
            aware) have not yet expired, been encashed or stopped. The response from PAS,
            indicating success or failure, must be returned to CAPS immediately. Failure implies
            that the payment has already been encashed and therefore could not be stopped. In the
            case of failure, it is desirable that PAS returns the relevant encashment details to CAPS
            immediately instead of waiting for the encashment confirmation to return via the normal
            path (see 4.3.6.2. 'Stopped Payments').

           Customer Identification

4.3.6.1.14. PAS must provide the facility for the post office clerk to check the validity of a card
            presented for payment encashment and (if valid) to identify the customer presenting the
            card.

           Authentication

4.3 .6.1.15. Having established that the card is valid, PAS will need to support whatever
             authentication process is specified by the Service Provider.

           Collection of Payments

4.3.6.1.16. Having successfully authenticated a customer, PAS must allow collection all payments
            the customer is entitled to collect (both as a customer in his own right and, where
            authorised to do so, on other people's behalf). PAS must enforce the following
            restrictions in respect of collection of payments:

           •       each payment can only be encashed once and only for the amount authorised by
                   the DSS;

           •       payments of a given type (i e. relatine to a specific payment string from the
                   benefit system) must be encashed in date sequence. CAPS will provide PAS with
                   the relevant sequence infonnation;

                                 Description of Functional Requirements

                •   partial encashment of an individual payment will not be allowed.

4.3 .6.1.17. PAS will, via the POCL Strategic Infrastructure, present all payments available for
             collection to the post office counter clerk who may communicate this information to the
             customer. For reasons of confidentiality this information should not be disclosed (either
             visibly or so that it can be overheard) to any other customer except the one involved in
             the transaction.

4.3 .6.1.18. Where a payee is collecting benefits for more than one customer, it is anticipated that
             they encash payments for each separately. PAS will therefore allow selection of the
             beneficiary for whom the payee wants to collect benefits first; this transaction continues
             until completion (including printing and signing of the receipt). PAS must then allow
             the payee to select the next beneficiary for whom they want to collect, then continue the
             encashment process for that beneficiary. PAS will repeat the encashment procedure until
             the list of available customers is exhausted. For example, if a payee collects benefit for
             three benefit customers then three receipts will be printed. Note that the customer
             should only be required to complete the authentication procedure once at the beginning
             of the whole process.

4.3.6.1.19. PAS should provide the facility to display, at the time of encashment, specific messages
            to the clerk, relating to the collection of a specific payment, which the clerk may then
            act upon. These messages will be supplied to PAS via CAPS.

            Receipts

4.3.6.1.20. PAS must support the production ofreceipts with the following attributes:

            •       audit information for the transaction (e.g. transaction ID, when and where the
                    transaction has taken place, post office clerk identifier);

            •       optional messages intended for the recipient, under instructions received from
                    CAPS (subject to the physical constraints of the receipt);

            •       one or more legal declarations that the payee acknowledges entitlement to and
                    receipt of the payment, each of which is signed by the payee;

            •       a description of each of the payments encashed;

            •       total amount encashed;

            •       predicted date and amount of the next payment (of the same type) for each
                    payment type.

4.3.6.1.21. When the new service starts, the current working assumption is that the 10J2 copy of the
            signed receipt is initially retained by the post office clerk and is eventually stored at the
            DSS facility at Lisahally in Northern Ireland (the exact arrangements for handling
            receipts is a matter to be agreed between POCL and BA). The Service Provider should
            suggest how best receipts might be handled to permit the rapid location, recovery and

            provision of an original receipt whilst overall providing a lower cost process compared
            with present arrangements.

4.3.6.1.22. The Service Provider should note that they will be required to provide Police and
            Criminal Evidence Act certification that their services were working normally at the
            time of any alleged offence.

4.3.6.1.23. A copy of the receipt will be retain~d by the customer.

4.3.6.1.24. The Service Provider should state any restrictions that their solution imposes with
            respect to receipts (such as languages/character sets supported, number and length of
            messages, etc.).

            Encashment Confirmation

4.3.6.1.25. Having completed the encashment procedure and confirmed it to PAS via POCL
            Strategic Infrastructure, PAS ~hould report details of the encashment to CAPS. One
            encashment confirmation is required for each receipt signed (and, hence, for each
            quantity of cash given out). The encashment confirmation should include details of
            location, time, amounts and to which payments the encashment relates.

            Encashment Problems

4.3.6.1.26. In order to maintain high levels of customer service, the Service Provider's proposals
            should minimise the frequency of card read failure. However, where the card fails to
            read at the post office, it must be possible to proceed with the encashment although this
            may involve, subject to Service Provider's detailed proposals, additional customer
            identity verification. The reference number shown on the card may need to be keyed in
            to aJlow PAS to access the authentication details associated with the card holder. In their
            proposals, the Service Provider should state how incorrect keying of card numbers will
            be detected - for example using check digits within the card number. The Service
            Provider's proposals are invited regarding the extent to which card replacement should
            be ·automatic upon read failure.

4.3.6.1.27. The Service Provider must consider and describe how his proposed solution will
            provide measures both to prevent and to detect fraud, but due regard should be given to
            the customer service requirements discussed in this document. Furthermore, the
            proposed system should be designed to minimise false negatives; i.e. the possibility of a
            legitimate card holder failing an authentication check.

4.3.6.1.28. An attempt to use a card which is not valid will be recognised by PAS and indicated to
            the post office counter clerk. The clerk should be prompted to impound the card and
            inform the customer that it is no longer valid.

4.3.6.1.29. If a suspended card is presented, the post office clerk will be informed by PAS and a
            message displayed advising the customer to contact his benefit office. The card should
            be returned to the customer. Card suspension is explained in more detail in section
            4.3.7.1.

                                  Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.6.1.30. The Service Provider may consider ways in which card payments made under duress
            could be flagged in PAS and, potentially, in the encashment confirmation sent back to
            CAPS.

4.3.6.1.31. Where the card payee fails the authentication check defined by the Service Provider it is
            desirable that the post office retains the card (which should now have been invalidated
            by the authentication failure) for potential examination by POCL or BA security staff.
            Again, the Service Provider's proposals regarding the handling of these items are
            invited.

4.3.6.1.32. If the customer attempts to use the card when he is restricted to a specific post office,
            and the post office in which he presents is not the one to which he is restricted, the post
            office clerk will have an appropriate message displayed which informs him of the
            restriction. The message will not include the name of the restricted post office - if the
            customer is uncertain he will be referred to the BA.

            Encashmen t Monitoring

4.3.6.1.33. The service should be able to record, summarise and report details of all transactions
            made, in particular providing the following information:

            •     amounts paid;

            •     methods of payment;

            •     due dates;

            •     encashment dates;

            •     benefit type;

            •     payments to agents;

            •    payments to appointees;

           •      number of items impounded .

4.3.6.1.34. Encashments will also need to be monitored to detect suspicious conditions. It is
            desirable that such conditions do not always have to be pre-programmed into the
            monitoring system; i.e. the monitoring system should be capable of learning what
            exceptional encashment patterns look like using some form of artificial intelligence. For
            illustration, the following indicators of potential fraud could be detected and reported
            via PAS to authorised BA and POCL staff:

           •     multiple encashments on the same day;

           •     repeated keyed access;

           •     delays in collecting payments (for some benefits);

                               Description of Functional Requirements

            •     repeated use of casual agents (more than twice a month, say);

            •     repeated use of temporary tokens;

            •     repeated foreign encashments.

4.3.6.1.35. In addition, it is desirable to be able to monitor usage of both all cards ever issued to a
            specific customer and a specific card for detection and prevention of abuses to the
            benefit system.

            Payment Enquiries

4.3.6.1.36. The ability to support benefit payment enquiries on CAPS is one of the main business
            drivers behind this programme. Access will be required for all DSS benefit processing
            staff, particularly in response to customer queries. It will be possible to show the
            existence and status of all card-based payments passed to CAPS from the benefit
            systems (both automated and clerical). Payment status will be one of the following:

           •      part of payment string received from benefit system and awaiting authorisation;

           •      payment authorised (passed to PAS) and awaiting collection;

           •      payment encashed;

           •      payment stopped;

           •      payment expired (past expiry date without collection).

4.3.6.1.37. To support these facilities, PAS will report encashments, expiries and stop status back
            to (' t\PS as previously described. However, the ability for CAPS to determine up to
            date payment status on PAS for a particular payment will be required. Therefore, PAS
            will need to respond immediately to CAPS requests for encashment status on particular
            payments responding with either the relevant encashment data or with an indicator that
            the payment has not yet been encashed.

           Payment Monitoring

4.3.6.1.38. End-to-end service monitoring to DSS customers is required in addition to any that may
            be required to support contractual monitoring between the POCL, DSS, and the Service
            Provider. Possible metrics include:

           •     payments not available for collection on due date;

           •     urgent payments not available for collection within specified time (e.g. 30
                 minutes).

 4.3.6.2         CAPS to PAS Interface

 4 .3 .6.2.1.   This section describes the specific transactions required between CAPS and PAS, in
                terms of data content and service levels. Service levels are described in terms of the time
                constraints of each transaction. The Service Provider should regard these as guidelines
                only and should, themselves, consider what will be necessary in the light of the
                requirements defined elsewhere in this SSR

4.3 .6.2.2.     In general, all specified transaction data required from PAS and detailed below should
                be available for use by the DSS at the start of the working day following the transaction.

                Payment

4.3.6.2.3.      The data required for this transaction is as follows:

                          For each authorised payment:
                  1.      Payment Reference identifier
                  2.      Prior Payment Reference ID (required to support encashment in
                          sequence)
                  3.      Beneficiary NINO
                  4.      Payee List (NINO, Payee Role, Declaration Type, Message to
                          the payee)
                  5.      Originating benefit office
                 6.      Payment Description Code (expands to description of each
                         payment for recognition by the customer in the PO - printed on
                         the receipt)
                 7.      Net Amount to be paid
                 8.      Token List (Token Type, Number of Tokens)
                 9.      Due date for payment
                 10.     Payment Expiry date
                 11      Nominated post office (if appropriate)
                 12.     Restricted post office indicator
                 13.     Optional instruction code to the clerk
                 14.     Next Payment Due Date (if available)
                 15.     Next Payment Predicted Amount (if available)

4.3.6.2.4.      The Token List identifies one or more token payments required (such as milk tokens).

4.3.6.2.5.   The Payee List is a list of allowed payees for this payment. This will consist of one or
             more of the following:

             •        beneficiary;

             •        appointee;

             •        permanent agent;

             •        alternative payee.

4.3.6.2.6.   The declaration to be printed on the receipt (along with any optional message) will vary
             with payee and will be specified for each (see section 4.3.6.l 'receipts').

4.3.6.2.7.   Note that the data content is the same for urgent and non-urgent payments.

             Service Level
4.3.6.2.8.   Each payment passed to PAS will have a due date from which the payment must be
             available for collection.

4.3.6.2.9.   It is expected that payments will normally be passed from CAPS into PAS just before
             they are due for collection by the customer. Typically, the lead time might be 48 hours
             although instructions to pay may arrive later (for example, during the night for the start
             of the next day). More notice could be provided for most payments although the number
             of payment stops experienced in the system would be likely to increase as a result.

4.3.6.2.10. Urgent payments will be subject to a very short lead time (of the order of 30 minutes
            from transmission by the benefit system). Such payments must be available for
            collection within this time.

             Stopped Payments

4.3.6.2.11. BA staff may wish to stop payments that have already been passed to PAS for a variety
            of reasons such as change of circumstances or suspected fraud. In such cases, CAPS will
            send a stop request to PAS, containing the following data:

                         For each stop request:
                 1.      Beneficiary NINO
                 2.      Payment Reference identifier of payment to be stopped

4.3.6.2.12. The response from PAS, indicating success or failure should be returned to CAPS
            immediately. It will contain the following data:

                      For each stop confirmation:
             1.       Beneficiary NINO
             2.       Payment Reference identifier of payment to be stopped
             3.       Amount (for audit/reconciliation)
             4.       Stop Result (Success/Failure)

4.3.6.2.13. In the case of failure, it is desirable that PAS will also return immediately to CAPS the
            relevant encashment details instead of waiting for the encashment confirmation to return
            via the normal path.

            Sezyice Level
4.3 .6.2.14. Stops must be effected immediately. The request may be part of an on-line dialogue and
             so the response must also be returned immediately.

           Expiries

4.3.6.2.15. Confirmation of each payment that expires must be sent back to CAPS as a positive
            confirmation (even though the expiry can, of co~e, be inferred from the expiry date).
            The expiry confirmation will contain the following data:

                      For each expiry:
             1.       Beneficiary NINO
             2.       Payment Reference identifier of authorised payment
             3.       Amount (for audit/reconciliation)
             4.       Expiry date


           Service Level
4.3.6.2.16. Payments will expire when the last post office closes on the date of expiry. PAS must
            confirm this (and therefore that the payment has been made void) to CAPS before any
            enquiries are made on this payment (probably before 9 am the next business day).

            Encashments

4.3.6.2.17. A confirmation of the encashment must be automatically sent back to CAPS. The data
            contained within the confinnation will include:

                     For each encubment:
             1.      post office ID.
             2.      post office clerk ID.
             3.      Total amount encashed
             4.      Token List (Token Type, Number of Tokens taken)
             5.      Encashment date and time
             6.      Payee National Insurance Number (including casual agent
                     National Insurance Nwnber, if obtained)
             7.      Casual Agent Flag (set if encashment made by casual agent)
             8.      Keyed flag (implies that the card could not be machine read)
             9.      List of payments encashed (payment reference, Beneficiary
                     NINO)


4.3 .6.2.18. If the Service Provider's Casual Agent procedures include the production of some form
             of non-card identification, the form of identification used may also need to be recorded
             in the encashment transaction.

            Service Level
4.3.6.2.19. When a stop is issued it is important (as part of the stop processing) to determine an
            accurate, up-to-the-minute encashment status for any payment and to make this
            available to CAPS at the same time. For normal purposes, it is desirable that the
            encashment confirmations from PAS to CAPS are passed continuously, but
            asynchronously, to reduce the need to access PAS to answer routine payment enquiries.
            In designing this component of their solution, the Service Provider should ensure that no
            particular hours of working are enforced. In particular, the solution should allow the
            flexibility for varying the length of the business day.

            Personal Details

4.3.6.2.20. CAPS will inform PAS of personal details required to make payments. This will consist
            of the following:

                       For each customer:
             1.        NINO
             2.        Requested Name
             3.        Nominated post office (if appropriate)
             4.        Restricted post office indicator
             5.        Monitor usage flag (indicates that PAS should tell CAPS when
                       any card held by this customer is used)
             6      National Sensitivity indicator

4.3.6.2.21. CAPS will pass this data initially and whenever it changes. CAPS will also indicate
            when the details no longer need to be held:

                    For each notification:
                   I National Insurance Number
4.3.6.2.22. Additional data items to support authentication may also be supplied by CAPS.

4.3.6.2.23. Any personal details required to support authentication, or for other purposes, must be
            specified by the Service Provider in their proposal and agreed with the BA. Information
            regarding proxies may also be supplied via this route.

            Service Level
4.3.6.2.24. Any new or changed personal details must take effect within PAS in time for them to be
            taken into account in any subsequent encashment or enquiry.

            Encashment Problems

4.3.6.2.25. A number of encashment problems will require PAS / CAPS interaction, as described
            below (this list should not be considered exhaustive).

4.3.6.2.26. The Service Provider may consider ways in which card payments made while the post
            office counter clerk was under duress could be flagged in PAS and potentially in the
            encashment confirmation sent back to CAPS, for which an extra flag may be provided,
            as follows:

                    For each encasliment:

4.3.6.2.27. When these transactions are alerted by PAS they may need to trigger additional action
            byPOCL.

4.3.6.228. The Service Provider should also provide the facility to trigger an alarm in PAS system
           when a specified card is used (this feature would be used for security monitoring). If this
           is passed back to CAPS the following transaction will be required:

                     For each use of the specified card:
             1.      Card holder's NINO
             2.      post office ID
             3.      post office clerk ID
             4.      Date and time

4.3.6.2.29. The need to monitor a specified card would be indicated by a flag on the personal details
            data sent from CAPS to PAS.

4 .3 .6.2.30. PAS will also need to inform CAPS if an encashment is attempted which would infringe
              a post office restriction, passing the following data:

                     For each attempted 'restricted PO' infringement:
             1.      Customer NINO
             2.      Restricted post office ID
             3.      Actual post office ID
             4.      post office clerk ID
             5.      Date and time


           Service Level
4.3.6.2.31. Each encashment problem must be notified to CAPS as soon as possible (probably
            within I hour of the encashment).

           Payment Enquiries

4.3.6.2.32. The data flows from CAPS to PAS will consist of:

                     For each payment enquiry:
             1.      Beneficiary NINO
            2.       Payment Reference identifier

                               Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.6.2.33. The response from PAS to CAPS will consist of:

                      For each payment enquiry:
              1.      Beneficiary NINO
              2.      Payment Reference identifier
              3.      Payment Status (unencashed / encashed)


4.3.6.2.34. In the case of the payment already having been encashed, it is desirable that PAS will
            also return immediately to CAPS the relevant encashment details instead of waiting for
            the encashment confirmation to return via the normal path.

            Service Level
4.3.6.2.35. Such enquiries are likely to fonn part of an on-line dialogue. Consequently, the response
            should be provided immediately.

            Change of Nominated Post Office (Requested at Post Office)

4.3.6.2.36. This would require the following information to be passed from PAS back to CAPS:

                      For each change of Nominated post office:
              1.      Customer NINO
             2.       Former Nominated post office
             3.       New Nominated post office
             4.       New Address details (if appropriate)

4.3.6.2.37. If required, changes to nominated post office should be reported back to CAPS in
            sufficient time to allow the DSS to accept the change before the customers next
            payment is due. Therefore return within a working day is likely to be acceptable.

            Request/or Customer Statement (at Post Office)

4.3.6.2.38. If this feature is utilised it will require the following information to be passed from PAS
            back to CAPS:

4.3.6.2.39. To maintain high levels of customer service, the DSS would wish to post the customer's
            statement of account by the start of the working day after its request. Therefore such
            transactions should be passed to CAPS on the same working day as they are generated.

4.3.6.3      POCL Strategic Infrastructure to PAS Interface

4.3.6.3.1.   The Service Provider should maintain a logical separation between the POCL Strategic
             Infrastructure and PAS and define a detailed interface specification to support this. The
             exact flows across this boundary will vary to some extent depending on the Service
             Provider's proposals but would need to support such areas as:

             •     customer identification (via token);

             •     customer authentication;

             •     payment availability;

             •     encashment;

             •     invalid card use;

             •     card alerts;

             •     encashment exceptions;

             •     temporary token use;

             •     changes to nominated post office (if appropriate);

             •     enquiries regarding next payment(s);

             •     requests for DSS Statement of Account.



4.3.7        Card Management Services - CMS

4.3. 7.1     Functional Requirements

             General

4.3.7.1.1.   The card services provided by the Service Provider should span the whole range from
             card production and issue through to resolving DSS card related customer queries. The
             following sections enumerate the core set of such functions.

4.3.7.1.2.   Tne Service Provider should note the requirement that the primary point of customer
             service for card related services is within their domain but, additionally, benefit delivery

                                 Description of Functional Requirements

              and post office counter staff must be able to deliver a high level of service in response to
              any reports and enquiries directed at them.

4.3.7.1.3.    The Service Provider should also consider the needs of the elderly and disabled
              customer groups in their proposals. For example, it may be that alternative card issue
              and authentication procedures are desirable for these groups. However, in this and any
              other aspects of the service, any differential procedures must not be discriminatory on
              other grounds and must be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Social
              Security.

4.3. 7.1 .4. The production, storage, delivery and destruction of cards should be both secure and
             auditable. The Service Provider should, at any time, be able to produce an audit trail of
             all cards and associated collateral documents.

              New Card Issue

4.3.7.1.5.    CMS will issue a card to a customer when:

              •     the customer is entitled to collect a card-based payment but has no current card;

              •     a specific request is made to issue a card to the customer.

4.3 .7.1.6.   The service should issue cards, to customers or proxies authorised by the DSS, with
              minimal delay (and with due regard to cost constraints and the need for personal
              authentication measures) when instructed to do so by the DSS.

4.3.7.1.7.    CAPS will deliver the initial set of customer details to CMS to enable card issue; CAPS
              will also inform CMS of any revisions to personal details that may affect later card
              issues.

              Card Replacement

4.3. 7.1.8. CMS will need to replace cards for customers who report their existing card:

              •    lost;

              •    stolen;

              •    damaged.

4.3.7.1.9.    In all the above cases, the previous card should be invalidated automatically and
              immediately.

                               Description of Functional Requirements

            Card Renewal

4.3.7.1.10. CMS will renew a card when either:

            •     the card bas been in use for a pre-determined period of time and should be
                  replaced (for wear and tear reasons, for fraud reduction reasons, or to make the
                  normal lapsing of card simple); or

            •     the customer changes any detail in use on the card (e.g. name).

4.3. 7.1.11. In both cases a new card will be issued automatically by CMS. Such renewal must occur
             if card payments are still being made to the customer in question (it is possible that
             customers no longer in receipt of card-based benefit payments will not have their cards
             renewed). The service should accept a notification from the DSS when a customer no
             longer requires a card and send no further cards to that customer.

4.3.7.1.12. When a card is renewed in this way, CMS will invalidate the previous card either when
            it expires or when the new one is collected (whichever occurs first).

4.3.7.1.13. To negate the need for unnecessary card issues, the service should be capable of
            updating any chosen security verification details or procedures without affecting the
            customer's ability to collect authorised payments.

4.3. 7. l .14. The Service Provider's proposals on the normal handling and frequency of card renewal,
               based on best industry practice, are invited.

            Card Supply and Collection

4 .3. 7.1.15 . When a payee needs a card for the first time CAPS will send a notification to CMS
               aloii:; with the necessary personal details (CAPS also informs CMS of any subsequent
               changes to these details). This notification implies the customer has an immediate nee~
               for a card. CMS will send a new card to the customer. The method of distribution -
               and the risk therein - is a matter for the Service Provider. However, the network of
               post offices is available for this purpose; the Service Provider should consider sending
               the card to the customer's nominated post office and the 'pick up notice' (PUN) to his
               correspondence address when the card is available. The card would be collected by the
               customer at the post office in return for the PUN. Other delivery mechanisms proposed
               by the Service Provider will be considered on their merits although it is desirable that
               benefit offices are not normally used in the card supply process.

4.3.7.1.16. Where the customer has no fixed abode for correspondence purposes, the current
            arrangement for distributing order books is to send them to either the post office or the
            DSS office where they are collected by the customer. While it may be possible to use
            the DSS office or the post office for distributing cards and their collateral material, the
            Service Provider is encouraged to propose an alternative solution that achieves the same
            level of customer service without exposing a security risk. The Service Provider should
            make clear in their rroposals how the risk of internal fraud is countered, t-e it DSS,
            POCL. Service Provider or sub-contractor.

 BAIPOCL SSR                                                                 RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                 Description of Functional Requirements

 4.3.7.1.17. Note that the card distribution procedures can also be triggered by CMS (rather than via
             CAPS) for normal card renewal cycles, lost/stolen reports or damaged cards.

4.3. 7.1.18. In general, CMS must be able to track the life history of each card in order to both
             validate changes in its state and to trap events which may be invalid or exceptional for a
             card given its state at any point in time. Therefore, as the card is issued this change in
             state must be recorded by CMS.

4.3. 7.1.19. Upon receipt of the card at the post office (assuming distribution of cards via post
             offices, discussed above) it may be desirable to read the card through the reader. This
             will prove that the card can be read and will inform CMS, via the POCL Strategic
             Infrastructure, that it has been received (so that CMS can maintain the card life history).

4.3.7.1.20. Again assuming card distribution via post offices, the post office will hold cards for
            collection by customers for a specified period of time. Upon presentation of the PUN
            (and any required authentication of the individual) the post office will hand over the
            card to the customer in return for the PUN and inform CMS accordingly. The Service
            Provider should give thought to ensuring that the PUN is forgery resistant and is in
            some way uniquely coupled - possibly by printing the unique card ID on the PUN -
            to the card to which it relates.

4.3. 7.1.21. At this point, the card is considered valid for use (i.e. 'activated').

4.3 .7.1.22. CMS will identify any cards that are not collected from the post office within a time
             specified by the Service Provider. CMS will inform the post office holding the card, via
             the POCL Strategic Infrastructure, and the post office should then destroy it in a way
             specified by the Service Provider and agreed with the Contracting Authorities. CMS
             will invalidate this card and will retain a record of the event for BA and POCL audit and
             fraud investigation purposes.

            Invalidation and Suspension

4.3. 7.1.23. Invalidation of a card permanently prevents it being used for encashment of any
             payment at any post office; suspension is under the control of BA staff and temporarily
             prevents a card being used for encashment.

4.3.7.1.24. Two different categories of invalid card are possible:

            •     cards which are known to CMS but that have been explicitly invalidated;

            •     cards which are not known to CMS (such as counterfeit cards).

4.3.7.1.25. The Service Provider should, as part of their proposed exception handling processes,
            define ways in which the two categories should be treated.

                                Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.7.1.26. In general, CMS will invalidate a known card when it expires and whenever an event
            occurs against it which is regarded as exceptional. Specific examples of this are:

            •      when CMS is informed of an irregular card movement (e.g. card issued by CMS
                   but not received by the nominated post office within a specified time limit);

            •      when a card has not been collected by the customer from the nominated post
                   office within a specified time period (any previously valid cards must also be
                   invalidated);

            •     by direct user action (when reported lost/stolen/damaged, on recovery of card, on
                  suspicion of fraudulent use).

4.3.7.1.27. Furthermore, it may be desirable to allow a card to be suspended on CMS, under control
            of benefit staff. This would bar payments being made with that card until the suspension
            was lifted. When such a card is presented in the post office a message would be
            displayed for the clerk asking them to direct the customer to a local benefit office.

4.3. 7.1.28. Notification of invalidation, suspension and lifting of suspension of cards must be made
             available from CMS to PAS as soon as they are received by CMS.

4.3.7.1.29. If an invalid card is presented for encashment, the post office will retain the card.

4.3.7.1.30. If a suspended card is presented, the post office clerk will be informed by their system
            and a message displayed directing the customer enquiry to benefit offices.

4 .3. 7.1.31. The Service Provider needs to cater for the situation where the customer arrives at the
              post office (assuming distribution of cards via post offices) with a valid PUN and for
              some reason the card is not available for collection (e.g. the card could not be read when
              it fi--st arrived at the post office).

            Temporary Tokens

4.3.7.1.32. Some benefit payments need to be made very quickly, for example in the case of crisis
            loans. Where the customer already has a card it must be possible to route the payment
            authorisation through CAPS and PAS within a specified time limit allowing encashment
            via the normal process. However, if the customer does not have a card, it will be
            necessary to issue some form of temporary token which can be used to unlock the
            payment in the post office. It is anticipated that this form of temporary token can only
            be used for a single encashment and will be retained by the post office. It is for the
            Service Provider to define mechanisms for the control of all tokens and documentation
            relating to the Benefit Payment Service and, hence, they are invited to make specific
            proposals relating to 'one-shot' temporary tokens (including format, production,
            distribution, use and retention). However, one solution could be for CMS to supply a
            unique number to the local office printed on a paper notice. Upon presentation in the

            authenti-;ation and hence unlock any payments.

                                  Description of Functional Requirements

 4 .3. 7 .1.3 3. The Service Provider should propose the kind of authentication procedures which would
                 be appropriate in this circumstance. They should also ensure that whatever mechanisms
                 are put in place are 'fraud resistant', for example, that the tokens should not be easily
                 forged.

4.3.7.1.34. Where such urgent payments need to be made outside normal post office hours, BA
            currently has the facility to pay directly in cash. If there is an opportunity to avoid
            making such direct 'out of hours' payments this should be proposed by the Service
            Provider.

4.3.7.1.35 . In addition to the 'one shot' temporary token it may be necessary for the Service
             Provider to make exceptional arrangements to supply cards that are required more
             quickly than their normal delivery cycle. This may happen in circumstances such as
             replacement of lost I stolen cards.

4.3.7.1.36. The service should treat a temporary token in the same way as a permanent card - that
            is, as a means of identifying the customer prior to any authentication checks.

4.3.7.1.37. Issue of a temporary token (that is not of the 'one-shot' variety) should automatically
            trigger the issue of a permanent token to replace it when it expires, assuming it has
            different physical attributes from a permanent token (this will _be subject to the Service
            Provider's proposals).

4.3.7.1.38. In general, the service should minimise the use of temporary tokens.

            Card Return

4.3.7.1.39. Any card returned (at post offices, BA offices or directly to CMS) should be notified on
            CMS and invalidated. Under certain circumstances it should be retained for
            investigation purposes.

            Card Enquiries

4.3 .7.1.40. CMS should support enquiries regarding card status and history (including temporary
             tokens as applicable). Such enquiries will be required for BA investigations as well as to
             answer customers' queries and should be provided to all DSS benefit-processing staff in
             addition to the Service Provider's own customer service staff. For example, the enquiry
             response should show the following card states (with date and time at which each status
             change occurred):

            •     card issued to post office (if appropriate);

            •     card received at post office (if appropriate);

            •     card issued to customer;

            •     card activated ;

            •     card expired;

                                Description of Functional Requirements

             •     card return notified to CMS;

             •     card invalidated (with reason).

 4.3.7.1.41. Note that card invalidation may occur at any stage in the above process in response to
             reports of loss, theft, suspected fraudulent use etc.

 4.3.7.1.42. The service should provide the facility to allow customers to have more than one valid
             card (although it is expected that one card to one customer will be the objective).

 4.3.7.1.43. Exception conditions should also be shown, such as:

            •     card not received by the customer or post office (if appropriate);

            •     card uncollected within the specified time;

            •     card reported lost/ stolen / damaged;

            •     card found;

            •     card suspended (with reason);

            •     card impounded at the post office (with reason).

4.3.7.1.44. State changes must always be positively confirmed to CMS rather than inferred.

4.3.7.1.45. It should be possible to obtain details for previous cards issued to a customer as well as
            the current one. It should also be possible to identify payments that have been encashed
            using a given card.

4.3.7.1.46. An enquiry to determine the customer of a card, given the card reference, may also be
            required (for instance, when cards are recovered/handed in or damaged) . If the
            customer's National Insurance Number is visible on the card then such a need may be
            reduced.

            Card Monitoring

4.3.7.1.47. The movement and use of cards will need to be monitored to detect exception
            conditions and possible fraudulent use (see 'Encashment Monitoring').

4.3.7.1.48. A facility to tag cards which, upon presentation, trigger an alert message at CMS or
            PAS is desirable. This is to support both the Service Provider's and Contracting
            Authorities' security control and fraud detection. Such an alert would not be visible at
            the post office counter.

                                  Description of Functional Requirements

4.3.7.1.49. End-to-end service monitoring to DSS customers is required in addition to any that may
            be required to support contractual monitoring between the DSS, POCL and the Service
            Provider. Possible metrics include:

             •        time taken from initial issue of card request to CMS until receipt of card at post
                      office;

             •        mean time between failure for card (card read failure).

4.3. 7.2     CAPS to CMS Interface

4.3.7.2.1.   This section describes the specific transactions required between CAPS and CMS, in
             terms of data content and service levels. Service levels are described in terms of the time
             constraints of each transaction. The Service Provider should regard these as guidelines
             only and should, themselves, consider what will be necessary in the light of the
             requirements defined elsewhere in this SSR.

             Initial Card Issue Request

4.3.7.2.2.   The following data is contained within the initial issue card request sent from CAPS to
             CMS:

                         For each initial issue card request:
                 1.      Customer National Insurance Number
                 2.      Customer Name (as requested by the customer to be displayed on
                         the card)
                 3.      Correspondence Address
                 4.      Nominated Post Office ID (if appropriate)
                 5.      Card Type (e.g. WPA card)
                 6       National Sensitivity Indicator


             Service Level
4.3.7.2.3.   Any validation or integrity problems ansmg from this request must be returned
             immediately (since the request may be part of an on-line dialogue). In general, the actual
             time taken to issue the card must be as short as possible, with the objective being to
             make the card available to the customer in time for any subsequent payments to be
             collected. The Service Provider must balance this against the need to issue temporary
             tokens (when such a deadline cannot be met) and the subsequent increase in security
             risk that such tokens may entail.

               Change to Personal Details

4.3.7.2.4.     The following data is contained within the change to personal details sent from CAPS to
               CMS:

                             For each change to personal details:
                    1.       Customer National Insurance Number
                   2.        Customer Name (as requested by the customer to be displayed on
                             the card)
                   3.        Correspondence Address
                   4.        Nominated Post Office ID (if appropriate)
                   5.        Card Type (e.g. WP A card)
                   6         National Sensitivity Indicator


               Service Level
4.3.7.2.5.     If a new card is required as a result of this transaction, the same service levels as for
               card issue will apply.

               Customer No Longer Maintained

4.3 .7.2.6.    The following data is contained within the 'customer no longer maintained' notifications
               sent from CAPS to CMS:

                            For each notification:
                   1.      ICustomer National Insurance Number

4.3 .7.2.7.    This change should take effect as soon as possible.

4.3.7.3        Benefit staff to CMS Interface

4.3. 7.3 .1.   The following sections summarise the interface that benefit delivery staff will need to
               support card related business processes. The volumes associated with this interface are
               almost entirely dependent on:

               •         total number of customers;

               •         the Service Provider's approach to and effectiveness in managing cards.

                                      Description of Functional Requirements

 4.3.7.3.2.       This interface, as with all interfaces provided to DSS staff, should be consistent for all
                  users.

                  Card Enquiries

4.3.7.3.3.        The data flows will consist of the input of either a card number or National Insurance
                  Number with output of related card status. If a customer has more than one card, details
                  (as below) must be displayed for each:

                            For each card:
                   1.       Customer National Insurance Number
                   2.       Card ID
                   3.       Card Status
                   4.       Previous Card States (status, date changed)


              Service Level
4.3.7.3.4.    Since this is likely to be an on-line dialogue, details should be displayed immediately.

              Temporary Token Issue

4.3.7.3.5.    The data flow will consist of the input of details required to issue a temporary token.
              The Service Provider must consider what data will be required. Possible details required
              may include those for card issue (see above).

              Service Level
4.3.7.3 .6.   Since this is likely to be an on-line dialogue, confirmation of token issue should be
              immediate. Actual issue of the token must occur in time for the next payment
              encashmentrequired.

              Card Control Transactions

4.3.7.3.7.    The data flows will consist of the input of either:

              •         a customer National Insurance Number, followed by selection of a card from a list
                        displayed, or

              •         a card ID;

              followed by the relevant event identification.

4.3.7.3.8.    The events will include:

              •         card loss;

                                   For each card control transaction :
                     1.            Customer National Insurance Number
                     2.            Card ID
                     3.            Status Change

             Service Level
4.3.7.3.9.   Since this is likely to be an on-line dialogue, confirmation of the status change should
             be immediate. Any control information that leads to a restriction in the use of the card
             (invalidation as a result of card theft, for example) must, ideally, take effect immediately
             and Jrtainly before any further use of the card.

4.3.7.4      POCL Strategic Infrastructure to CMS Interface

4.3.7.4.1.   The Service Provider should maintain a logical separation between the POCL Strategic
             Infrastructure and CMS and define a detailed interface specification to support this. The
             exact flows across this boundary will vary to some extent depending on the Service
             Provider's proposals but would need to support such areas as:

             •                 card receipt at post office (if appropriate);

             •                 card collected from post office (if appropriate);

             •                 card uncollected and destroyed (if appropriate);

             •                 card returned to post office;

             •                 Temporary token ('one-shot') used and retained.

4.3.7.4.2.   The volumes of such interaction will be heavily dependent on the detail of the Service
             Provider's proposals.

4.3.7.4.3.   In their proposals, the Service Provider should describe how their proposed POCL
             Infrastructme could interface to (or migrate to) other Card Management / Authentication
             services if, for example, there is a Government smart card in the futme (see 4.3.5.1).

4.3. 7.5     PAS to CMS Interface

4.3.7.5.1.   The Service Provider should maintain a logicaj separation between PAS and CMS and
             define a detailed interface specification to support this. The exact flows across this
             boundary will vary to some extent depending on the Service Provider's proposals but
             will need to support two way provision of information.

4.3.7.5.2.   From CMS to PAS:

             •     current card status (valid, invalid or suspended);

             •     temporary token issue;

             •     card alerts .

4.3.7.5.3 . From PAS to CMS:

             •     exceptional card use that may require Service Provider defined exception
                   processing (such as authentication failure, card read failure, attempted use of
                   invalid card);

             •    use of 'one-shot' temporary token.

4.3.7.5.4.   Further/ different flows may be needed to support other Service Provider's proposals
             (for example revised "change of nominated post office" (P80MA) procedures).

             Service Leve)
4.3.7.5.5.   Service levels for PAS-CMS interactions are not specified as part of this requirement.
             The Service Provider should, however, indicate how any other service levels impact on
             this interface and design it accordingly.

4.4.1.     The above sections have described the overall process for benefit payments. This
           includes activities in post offices and the following exemplar data flow diagrams show
           how these might be implemented using the five generic functions described in section
           4.2. These diagrams are:

4.5        SERVICE PROVIDER'S RESPONSE

4.5.1      Proposal Content

4.5.1.1.   This chapter has set out the service architecture and the main functional requirements.
           1broughout, a number of areas are specifically indicated where the Service Providers
           are required to make detailed proposals, and offer alternative solutions if appropriate.
           For guidance, Service Providers should structure their proposal in three separate
           sections under the headings of:

           •     Service Architecture;

           •     POCL Strategic Infrastructure Service;

           •     Benefit Payment Service.

4.5.1.2.   In particular, as well as responding to specific requests within this chapter, Service
           Providers should ensure that the following information is provided.

           Service Architecture

4.5.1.3.   A target service architecture was set out in section 4.1 for consideration by Service
           Providers. Service Providers are invited to confirm that this architecture is the basis of
           their proposal, or offer modifications providing justification of their alternative. In
           particular, an explanation of the alternative service boundaries and implications for both
           BA and POCL are requested.

4.5.1.4.   For Llleir proposed service architecture Service Providers should describe the main
           functional attributes of each service element, e.g. the Card Management System (CMS),
           together with performance characteristics and any constraints and dependencies on
           either the BA or POCL. With regard to the service boundaries between the POCL
           Strategic Infrastructure Service and PAS, Service Providers are requested to consider
           whether this could be generic interface common to all types of POCL clients providing
           both batch and real time capability.

           POCL Strategic Infrastructure

4.5.1.5.   Service Providers are requested to set out their approach to the design and development
           of the POCL Strategic Infrastructure Service elements.

4.5.1.6.   In particular, Service Providers should advise on the feasibility and implications of
           adopting the generic approach to the counter interface discussed in this chapter. Service
           Providers should consider whether their approach is equally applicable to the Benefit
           Payment Service at the counter, and indicate if there would be any effect on timescales
           or cost.

CHAPTER 5. STEADY STATE SERVICES


5.1         INTRODUCTION

5.1.1.      This chapter specifies the high level business requirements for the actual provision of
            the "business as usual" or "steady state" services both during and after roll-out. The
            duration of the roll-out programme is not yet defined but may take several years (see
            chapter 7 ) and thus the boundary between roll-out and steady-state will be complex.
            Some of the associated detailed service levels specific to the applications are given in
            chapter 4, others will need to be developed during the contract negotiation stage,
            referred to as stage 3, see chapter 9. Service Providers are asked to confirm that they can
            meet the service performance criteria or to propose viable alternatives, and to provide a
            detailed explanation of their approach to management of these services.

5.1.2.      The steady state services have been broken down into four types. These can be defined
            as:

            (a)   the operational services defined in chapter 4 e.g. the POCL Strategic
                  Infrastructure Service or the Card Management Service (CMS);

            (b)   the support services required by the operational services e.g. the help desk
                  service, the primary route for requesting any service or problem support;

            (c)   the contract management service e.g. the monitoring and review of service levels
                  for the operational and support services;

            (d)   and contract transfer.

5.1.3.      Higi1 level performance criteria have been identified and should be applied to the
            services where appropriate. These are:

            (a)   hours of cover, which identifies the period during which the Service Provider
                  should provide the service;

            (b)   availability, which identifies the minimum percentage of the hours of cover that
                  the service should be operationally available;

            (c)   response times, which identifies the speed of response required to any operational
                  or user request;

            (d)   counter transaction times, which identifies the time the customer is at the
                  counter, measured from the moment eye contact is established between the
                  customer and the clerk to the moment the customer walks away.

5.2          OPERATIONAL SERVICES

S.2.1        Introduction

5.2.1.1.     The complete operational service for an application will be achieved by a combination
             of the appropriate service elements, for example the Benefit Payment Service (BPS)
             requires the POCL Strategic Infrastructure Service, the Card Management Service
             (CMS) and the Payment Authorisation Service (PAS). This is best illustrated by
             reference to the Service Architecture diagram given in chapter 4, figure 4-1.

5.2.1.2.     For the BPS, the requirement is to achieve a consistent end to end service from the input
             service boundary, i.e. the interface with the CAPS system to the PAS and CMS, through
             to the counter clerk at the post office counter and back to PAS and the CAPS interface.
             Hence the service performance criteria for the BPS and other applications, are defined
             on this end to end basis since this is consistent with the overall business objectives.
             However, it is likely that the contract for each discrete service element and the
             associated performance criteria will be specifically agreed with only one organisation,
             either POCL or BA.

5.2.1.3.     The specification of the overall customer service interface, including that for BA
             customers is outside the scope of this procurement. However the services provided by
             the Service Provider must enable POCL to deliver the appropriate level of service and
             not adversely impact on quality standards or customer perceptions.

5.2.1.4.     The Contracting Authorities will require the ability to add further applications to the
             service. The Service Provider should be willing to integrate and operate these via the
             service agreement, provided that there are no valid technical reasons that preclude their
             inclusion in the service.

5.2.1.5.     The following sections summarise some of the business performance criteria for the
             end-to-end operational service as required to be delivered at the customer interface by
             the counter clerk. All payments to the customer should be I 00% accurate.

5.2.2        Counter Interface Service

5.2.2.1.     The performance criteria below are based on post office counter transactions and
             include payment of a benefit as a result of a customer submitting a card. Service
             Providers should note that the service levels should not be compromised.

             Hours of Cover
         ,,,,..-
5.2.2.2.      Service availability will need to be agreed with POCL and would include opening hours
              and use of the service for any additional requirements e.g. audit, accounting, training.
              The majority of post offices are currently open 09.00 - 17.30 (Mon-Fri) and 09.00 -
              13.00 (Sat), but there are significant variations: National Lottery offices are open until
              19.00 on Saturday, and cffi.ces in supermarkets can be open 08.00 to 21.00, and any 6
             hours on a Sunday. Opening hours are subject to change and revision and this needs to
           '--

            be reflected in any proposals. Service Providers are invited to put forward proposals for
            further discussion.

            Availability

5.2.2.3.    A customer expects to receive a payment 100% of the time even when the computer
            service is unavailable or partially available. Service Providers are invited to propose
            their availability for the computer supported counter interface service, indicating various
            levels of manual or partial computer service fall-back, and the implications in terms of
            responsiveness of the service when in fall-back mode. Service Providers must describe
            the fall-back process they suggest for the counter clerk experiencing both full or partial
            system failure and the steps needed for recovery. In certain circumstances, the normal
            service will not be available, due to situations beyond the control of the Service
            Provider, such as fire and flood. The Service Provider should indicate when these
            circumstances would apply and how they would support the post offices and set up
            alternative arrangements.

            Counter Transaction Times

5.2.2.4.    Service Providers should seek to improve on the current counter transaction times. The
            current average counter transaction time for a customer benefit payment, dependent on
            the type of benefit is from 22 to 32 seconds. Service Providers will be required to work
            with POCL to facilitate improvement in counter transaction times and to agree detailed
            performance criteria and measurement methods. Service Providers should indicate
            typical response times from the request to the central system to a response on the screen
            for the benefit payment processing.

5.2.3       Card Management Service

5.2.3.1.    The CMS will issue new and replacement cards and will process the blocking of lost
            and stolen cards.

            Hours of Cover

5.2.3.2.    the service for the notification of lost and stolen cards should be available 24 hours a
            day, 7 days a week. The hours of cover for issuing new or replacement cards should
            reflect those to be agreed for CAPS transfers.

            Response Times

5.2.3.3.    Lost or stolen cards should be blocked immediately and under certain agreed
            circumstances a replacement card issued. A new or replacement card should be received
            at its nominated destination within 2 working days of a request from BA. Service
            Providers should propose alternative response times for the normal bulk issue of cards
            but must include an option for cards reaching their nominated destination within five
            working days and they should clearly indicate any financial implications against each
            option. It is vitally important that cards arrive by the expected date to avoid unnecessary

            and costly time and effort in making follow-up enquiries . Currently it is envisaged that
            BA will distribute any emergency cards and the Service Provider may be required to
            issue these cards to BA offices within 24 hours.

S.2.4       Transaction Management Service

5.2.4.1.    The TMS will interface with other POCL syst~ms and service performance criteria will
            need to be agreed that are no worse than current levels. Service performance criteria
            already exist for the host polling and control service (appendix 4-8) in respect of POCL
            and client interfaces. POCL are looking to the Service Provider to agree standards and
            criteria which maintain or improve current or agreed levels.

5.3         SUPPORT SERVICES

S.3.1       Introduction

5.3 .1.1.   All services rnust be fully supported from end-to-end by the Service Provider. It is
            expected that the focus for all enquiries or problems will be the help desk service and
            these services are described in this section together with their performance criteria.
            Enquiries may cover requests for a range of supporting services that the Service
            Provider will need to provide e.g. training, software support and security management.

            Help Desk Support Services

5.3.1.2.    The help desk support services are logically defined in relation to the type of end-user of
            the service. Support services can therefore be categorised under the following headings.
            The physical design will be for the Service Provider to determine.

5.3.1.3 .   This structure of help desks is not mandatory, Service Providers are invited to propose
            alternatives where they believe this will be beneficial to the Contracting Authorities,
            their clients and customers. It is important to ensure that any help desk receiving an
            enquiry will re-route it to the appropriate help desk, if it is outside the scope of its
            service responsibilities. Service Providers are asked to consider this issue and
            suggestions as to how this might be achieved bearing in mind that problem ownership
            and resolution are essential.

5.3.2       The Help Desk for Customer Enquiries

5.3.2.1.    The Contracting Authorities envisage that this service will be a direct line 'freephone'
            help desk for customers who have a query regarding any card based services e.g. lost or
            stolen cards. The Service Provic!er shJuld also accept local calls that ha·-1e been rl!-
            routed from POCL' s 7 regional helplines, or BA customer helplines. The Service
            Provider is reminded that non English speaking customers will also require help.

                                          Steady State Services

S.3.3        The Help Desk for BA Enquiries

5.3.3.1.    This help desk is the primary BA interface for any problems, advice or action to second
            line support services from BA staff or the ITSA help desk. Fault reporting may be via
            the ITSA Service Delivery function.

5.3.4       The Help Desk for POCL Infrastructure Enquiries

5.3.4.1.    This help desk is the primary interface for any problems related to the POCL
            infrastructure. Post office staff and agents will use this service either to seek advice or to
            action second line support services such as system maintenance for faults and system
            upgrade for changes to the service. Counter clerks and agents will continue to pass any
            other queries to regional helplines.

5.3.5       Underlying Support Services

5.3.5.1.    The Service Provider will need to consider and defme a range of underlying services
            which can be accessed by a help desk and will cover aspects such as:

            (a)    software support service;

            (b)    service upgrade;

            ( C)   training;

            (d)    service administration and maintenance;

            (e)    supply of documentation;

            (f)    configuration management;

            (g)    security management, for example requirements for new agents;

            (h)    counter equipment relocation and network changes;

            (i)    counter equipment removal;

            (j)    change management·

            (k)    incident and problem management;

            (1)    fault diagnosis and resolution;

            (m) customer education and marketing;

            (n)    reference data management.

5.3.5.2.    While not all of these services will he visible to the users of the services they will be
            fundamental to contract transfer e.g. configuration management.

5.3.6        Performance Criteria

5.3.6.1.     Toe performance targets for help desks are specified below:

             (a)   Houn of Cover

                   Toe Customer Help Desk- should be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
                   for the reporting of stolen or lost cards.

                   Service Providers should propose cost effective and efficient hours of cover for
                   the BA and POCL help desks.

             (b)   Response Times - all help desks should normally respond to calls within 3 rings
                   (ten seconds). Where an immediate problem resolution is not achievable, the
                   enquiry should be categorised and prioritised so that it can be actioned and
                   completed within a standard timescale. Service Providers are asked to propose
                   categories, priorities and associated timescales for agreement with the Contracting
                   Authorities.


5.4         CONTRACT MANAGEMENT SERVICE

5.4.1       Introduction

5.4.1.1.    This section outlines the anticipated scope for the contract management service. Toe
            shape of the contract(s) will be agreed during the contract negotiation stage described in
            chapter 9, and the exact number of Contracting Authorities will be decided then.
            However, the Service Provider is required to provide a single point of contact for all
            contract management issues for each contract. Toe scope of the contract management
            function will include:

            (a)    monitoring service performance statistics e.g. help desk service performance
                   statistics;

            (b)    contract authority/service contractor reviews;

            (c)    escalation procedures;

            (d)    charges authorisation;

            (e)    contract change management;

            (f)    service change management e.g. ordering procedures;

            (g)    audit control and access;

            (h)    security;

            (i)    quality management;

BAIPOCL SSR                                                              RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                           Steady State Services

             (j)   monitoring of complaints from customers.

5.4.1.2.    Service Providers are invited to consider the above, define their overall approach and
            make any proposals for additional areas which from their experience should be included
            within the Contract Management Service.

5.4.2       Service Code of Practice

5.4.2.1.    The Contracting Authorities wish to manage the contract both in terms of monitoring
            the service actually received and by inspecting how the service is provided. It is
            expected that the Service Provider will need to develop a range of procedures and
            practices that defines in detail the day to day service, the operational and management
            interfaces and the relationships between the Contracting Authorities and the Service
            Provider. This set of procedures will be referred to as "The Service Code of Practice"
            (SCOP) and they are to be developed by the Service Provider during the operational
            trial period, and formally accepted as part of the operational trial process. The Service
            Provider will also be required to develop customer charters for those services which are
            provided directly to customers and these should be in line with those already produced
            by the Contracting Authorities.

5.4.2.2.    Service Providers are invited to outline the scope of such a Service Code of Practice and
            indicate whether they agree with this approach, or propose an alternative. Evidence of
            how they have established day to day operational and management interfaces and
            procedures for other major service contracts and the success of employing those
            procedures is requested. References should be proposed.


5.5         CONTRACT TRANSFER

5.5 .1.     Service Providers will understand that at the appropriate time the service contract(s) is
            likely to be re-competed and this may result in the need to transfer the service in part or
            whole to another party. This must be achieved without disruption to the services and
            within a reasonable time period. The Contracting Authorities consider this to be a
            critical requirement and one for which the proposal will need to be convincing and
            practical.

5.5.2.      Service Providers are invited to consider from an operational perspective (financial and
            commercial perspectives to be covered in chapter 8) how the service would be provided
            and managed during the transfer period. Also how the transfer of the following elements
            would be achieved if appropriate or contractually required, while still achieving the
            contracted performance criteria:

            (a)    assets;

            (b)    staff;

            (c)    third party software·

            (d)    own software, including bespoke and/or packages;

                                         Steady State Services

            (e)   documentation and procedures;

            (f)   other sub-contract activity;

            (g)   support services, e.g. helplines.

5.5.3.      Service Providers should describe in overview the processes and constraints, including
            timescale, associated with the Contract Transfer Service and should use their past
            experience to identify risks and issues. Where the Service Provider has been party to
            such transfer circumstances, they are requested to give reference site details.


5.6         SERVICE PROVIDER'S RESPONSES

5.6.1       Proposal Content

5.6.1.1.    This chapter has described the Steady State Service requirements and specifically
            indicates a number of areas where the Service Providers are required to make detailed
            proposals, and offer alternative proposals if appropriate. For guidance, Service
            Providers should structure their proposal as follows.

5.6.1.2.    For each of the following services:

            •     Operational;

            •     Support (including the underlying Support Services);

            •     Contract Management;

            •     Contract Transfer;

            the Service Provider's proposal should:

            (a)   describe how the service would be developed and brought into operation;

            (b)   describe how it will operate from the user perspective and give the Service
                  Provider's approach to providing the organisation, processes, and resources
                  necessary to provide the service and meet the service criteria;

            (c)   provide supporting evidence of capability by making reference to past and current
                  experience and, in particular offering hard evidence of capability wherever
                  possible, (e.g. by provision of reference site visits and availability of
                  documentation for inspection);

            (d)   consider the proposed end to end performance requirements and advise on the
                  feasibility of achieving these requirements (alternatives may be suggested but they
                  should be supported by both a rationale and a cost benefit justification);

                                                                                                   POL00028135




    BA/POCLSSR                                                            RESTRICTED- Commercial
                                         Steady State Services

             (e)   for all services, Service Providers should propose performance criteria for the
                   various service elements (e.g. Payment Authorisation Service, which would give
                   the cumulative effect of achieving the overall end to end performance);

            (f)    for all underlying services, Service Providers should identify the scope of the
                   service, state how the service would be developed, introduced and provided as
                   part of the steady state services (include details of the number of people providing
                   the service, their qualifications and where they will be located);

            (g)    Service Providers should also identify and justify any specific constraints, that
                   they would wish to impose , and so underpin their commitment to meeting the
                   performance criteria;

            (h)    consider and confirm the Contracting Authorities responsibilities.

5.6.1.3.    In particular, proposals should include details on exemplar potential problem scenarios
            relevant to the services required, drawing out issues of risk, flexibility, and
            responsiveness in coping with changing situations. These scenarios should also be used
            to illustrate how problems will be identified and resolved, and the impact on the service
            minimised. The Service Provider should included at least one scenario where a post
            office, data network or central system is in a disaster situation e.g. a fire, and also
            scenarios where the service is operating in full or partial fall-back.

5.6.2       Specific Responses

            SRS.l      State any perceived dependencies between service levels that can be met by
            the Service Provider and the service levels of interfacing computer services and/systems
            (e.g. CAPS).

            SRS.2     State the upgrade paths available for the proposed solution within the
            proposed operating environment, clearly indicating the current (as at the time of the
            response) maximum capacity for the service.

I           SRS.3       State how upgrades will be undertaken, whether they can be undertaken in
            the field and the steps in which the upgrade can be made.

            SRS.4       Describe the ongoing development programme to which the service proposed
            is subject, and state how it will provide an appropriate basis for the addition of new
            facilities and technologies.

I           SRS.5      State the service levels that are proposed for the availability and reliability of
            the service at post offices; transaction transfer to and from client systems; and for
            interrogations from BA offices.

I           SRS.6     State the service levels that are proposed for transaction response times and
            demonstrate that these will not adversely impact on current levels of service or business
            for POCJ, clients.

 CHAPTER 6. PILOT PROGRAMME


 6.1         INTRODUCTION

 6.1.1.     This chapter outlines the processes that will be used to prove that Service Providers can
            meet the service requirements. The first phase of the pilot programme, the demonstrator,
            will be used to satisfy the Con~ting Authorities that all the final shortlisted Service
            Providers have a viable solution and can be invited to submit financial proposals. The
            second phase of the pilot programme, the operational trial, will be undertaken only with
            the selected Service Provider as the means to establish readiness for roll-out, and for the
            Contracting Authorities to test and accept the service.

6.1.2.      Service Providers are invited to provide details of their approach to performing the pilot
            programme. These details should include an outline plan, checkpoints, acceptance
            points, descriptions of the deliverables and stages involved, and an estimate of any
            resources needed from the Contracting Authorities. Service Providers will be
            responsible for their own costs and any associated risks for both phases of the pilot
            programme.


6.2         THE DEMONSTRATOR PHASE

6.2.1       Objectives

6.2.1.1.    The objectives of the demonstrator phase are to reduce the risks to the Contracting
            Authorities by giving them firm evidence of the Service Provider's capability and an
            understanding of the underlying technologies of the proposed service. The Service
            Provirier should also give finn evidence during the demonstrator phase that they have a
            viable roll-out strategy.

6.2.1.2.    The demonstrator phase will also provide the Service Provider with the opportunity to
            discuss and understand the business requirements in detail. The demonstrator will
            illustrate aspects of the business process and the underlying functional capabilities, the
            interfaces, (in particular the counter interface) and the technical solutions. The
            Contracting Authorities will also look to the Service Provider to propose and
            demonstrate the available options, so that they can provide guidance on their suitability.
            The demonstrator phase should also be used to show how other POCL requirements
            could be added to the initial service with minimum disruption and cost.

6.2.1.3 .   The demonstrator phase also gives an opportunity for the Contracting Authorities to
            build a working relationship with the Service Provider, and to assess his project
            management and organisational strengths.

6.2.2       Timescale

6.2.2.1.    The demonstrator phase is planned to run in parallel with contract negotiations, stage 3
            of the procurement.

                                           Pilot Programme

6.2.3       The Process

6.2.3.1.    The Contracting Authorities' evaluation team will be based in Terminal House,
            Victoria, London and a separate secure office in this building will be allocated to each
            Service Provider.

6.2.3.2.    The evaluation team will consist of a full time project manager and personnel from
            POCL and BA with IT and business expertise that will include knowledge of
            application requirements and the associated audit functions. Additional persons will be
            drafted into the evaluation team or consulted as necessary, e.g. a training expert, a
            communications expert and representatives from the user population and customer
            groups such as Mencap, Aged Concern, the disablement lobby and ethnic groups. The
            evaluation team project manager will manage the pilot evaluation process for the
            Contracting Authorities, monitor progress against plans, arrange regular checkpoint
            meetings with Service Providers, arrange formal reviews of Service Provider
            deliverables and demonstrations, and manage the evaluation team.

6.2.3.3.    The Service Provider will work closely with the evaluation team in an iterative process
            to assess the different technologies, ranges of platforms and options they propose to
            meet the requirements. Solutions being demonstrated must not be unduly restrained by
            the Service Provider's preference for their own product sets, technology or niche
            expertise. Service Providers are encouraged to provide two or more independent
            solution variants or options. Service Providers will be expected to design and develop
            prototype and "mock up" systems to demonstrate the functionality and suitability of
            their solution, and show that they understand the requirement. These prototypes should,
            as far as is practicable, simulate the use of the service and the component items in a user
            environment. Service Providers should note that all demonstrations should normally be
            held in the UK. The Service Provider will be responsible for the development of test
            data, but, subject to discussion, the Contracting Authorities will provide some
            assistance. Where it is not practicable to simulate the use of the service, the Service
            Provider should propose alternative ways of providing evidence of capability and
            understanding such as visits by the evaluation team to comparable live services or
            systems, or the production of paper-based analysis. During the demonstrator phase, the
            Service Provider will also be expected to present and elaborate upon their proposed
            exemplar roll-out models.

6.2.3.4.    The evaluation team will develop a Risk Register for each Service Provider. The Risk
            Register will be based initially upon the Service Provider's proposal, and will be given
            only to the Service Provider to which it relates. During the pilot programme the
            evaluation team will update the Risk Register as risks are addressed, or new risks
            emerge and will regularly review them with each Service Provider.

6.2.4       The Evaluation

6.2.4.1.    The evaluation team will perform ongoing assessments of the demonstrations, advising
            on the suitability of options from those proposed. The evaluation team will use the Risk
            Register to record any weaknesses found and the Service Provider may also use this
            process as an opportunity to remove or reduce the classification of any outstanding

             risks. At the end of this phase the Service Provider will be required to give a formal
             demonstration and the evaluation team will produce an evaluation report for senior
             management. This report, covering ongoing assessments and assessments of the formal
             demonstrations, and the Risk Register will be a major input into the overall evaluation
             process which concludes at the end of the draft contract negotiation stage, referred to as
             stage 3, see chapter 9.


6.3         OPERATIONAL TRIAL

6.3.1       Objectives

6.3.1.1.    The objectives of the operational trial are to demonstrate that all aspects of the service
            are developed, that they have been fonnally tested, and to achieve final acceptance prior
            to roll-out and implementation.

6.3.1.2.    The scope of the operational trial must be such that the Service Provider is able to
            demonstrate his ability to start the roll-out programme with the functionality,
            procedures, and the delivery mechanisms to provide a successful operational service.

6.3.2       Timescale

6.3.2.1.    The operational trial is planned to run from January 1996 to May 1996. The Service
            Provider should confirm the feasibility of this timescale, or make other
            recommendations bearing in mind the overall timescale of the project given in
            chapter 9.

6.3.3       The Process

6.3.3.1.    The exact nature of this phase of the pilot programme will be agreed during the draft
            contract negotiation stage, stage 3, see chapter 9. It is envisaged that the operational trial
            will run primarily in a simulated environment to provide end-to-end and volume testing,
            and to prove that service perfonnance criteria can be met. At the end of this phase, it is
            currently envisaged that there will be a limited trial in a live environment to test the full
            functionality and customer acceptability of the service. It is expected that further
            refinements to the service will be made during this phase, and that these will be under
            formal change control. The operational trial will not just focus on the testing of the
            applications, but will include testing and demonstration of all supporting services such
            as help desks, training, contract management procedures and roll-out procedures. The
            Contracting Authorities evaluation team will manage this process, and will involve
            other interested parties.

6.3.3.2.    It is expected that any development undertaken during the demonstrator phase will be
            used as the starting point for the operational trial.

 6.3.4        Evaluation and Final Acceptance

 6.3.4.1.    A continuous evaluation process similar to that in the demonstrator phase will be
             undertaken by the evaluation team. The team will also conduct a formal acceptance
             process, the details of which will be agreed with the Service Provider during draft
             contract negotiations, stage 3, see chapter 9. The evaluation will cover all aspects of the
             service and, when completed, will signify the conclusion of the pilot programme.


6.4          THE PILOT PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS

6.4.1        Introduction

6.4.1.1.     An initial indication of the focus for the pilot programme follows. This section is
             subdivided into the various business needs that are to be addressed, and the particular
             business requirements for which the Contracting Authorities will require demonstrable
             evidence. These business requirements are not exclusive, but are to give guidance to
             Service Providers on the scope needed from their responses.

6.4.1.2.     Service Providers should propose bow they would prove or demonstrate their solution to
             the business requirements, and when this could be --accomplished during the pilot
             programme, i.e. demonstrator phase, operational trial phase, or both.

6.4.2        Overall Prime Contractor Capability

6.4.2.1.     The Contracting Authorities will be seeking to evaluate the overall prime contractor
             capability for:

            (a)   project and service management;

            (b)   quality of standards and procedures;

            (c)   understanding of the business and of the service requirements;

            (d)   cultural and commercial compatibility to work within both the BA and POCL
                  business environments;

            (e)   flexibility and responsiveness to cope with change and fast roll-out;

            (f)   technical and logistical competence;

            (g)   speed of implementation.

                                              Pilot Programme

 6.4.3       POCL Prime Needs

 6.4.3.1.    POCL will wish to satisfy itself that the Service Provider will provide:

             (a)   flexible solutions that enable the Service Provider rapidly to take on further
                   applications and / or higher volumes with minimal impact on the counter interface.
                   For example:

                   i.     post office applications, such as stock control,

                   ii.    new business, such as further inpayment and outpayment applications,

                   iii.   the ability to handle post office agents' private business, subject to
                          appropriate security controls that prevent unauthorised access to client data
                          (e.g. benefit payment details),

                   1v.    support systems and reporting;

            (b)    a service which has the capability of being introduced to all post offices,
                   irrespective of size or type, bearing in mind the current minimal range of
                   automation;

            (c)    a secure, accurate and auditable accounting and reconciliation service;

            (d)    compatibility with the existing information systems strategy and interfaces with
                   other POCL systems and methods;

            (e)    a service that will be easily understood by counter clerks;

            (f)    an approach that does not undermine customer trust in POCL, and improves on the
                   quality of service to clients and customers;

            (g)    an approach that allows for the migration of existing systems with the minimum
                   disruption.

6.4.4       Benefits Agency Prime Needs

6.4.4.1.    BA will wish to satisfy itself that the Service Provider has:

            (a)    the ability to provide a reliable and consistent 'end-to-end' service for the payment
                   of benefits via post offices;

            (b)    the ability to supply and manage a large scale card issue and management
                   operation;

            (c)    a migration capability, in particular from the current benefit payment service to a
                   card based service;

            (d)    proven methods for fraud reduction that are practical, politically and publicly
                   acceptable;

            (e)   a secure, accurate and auditable accounting and reconciliation service.

6.4.S        Customer/ Clerk Needs

6.4.5.1.     POCL will assess the impact of the service on the counter clerk and the customer. In
             particular, the Service Provider must demonstrate that:

            (a)   the solutions will cope with a variety of post office accommodation (for example
                  acknowledging space limitations and environmental conditions current in many
                  small post offices);

            (b)   the proposed payment method is acceptable to customers, including the elderly,
                  disabled and non English speaking claimants;

            (c)   the service can cope with a wide range of exception situations (for example lost or
                  stolen, and damaged cards);

            (d)   there is contingency fall back in the case of full or partial system failures;

            (e)   the migration options in roll-out are acceptable to customers.

6.4.6        Training and Documentation

6.4.6.1 .   The Contracting Authorities will assess the Service Provider's training and
            documentation. In particular, the Service Provider must demonstrate:

            (a)   its capability for providing effective training for both the Contracting Authorities'
                  staff and agents;

            (b)   the quality and standards of the documentation that will be provided;

            (c)   that it can provide effective documentation of the service for users, counter clerks
                  and staff;

            (d)   its ability to integrate with existing systems and documentation.

6.4.7       Service Delivery

6.4.7.1.    The Contracting Authorities will assess the ability of the Service Provider to deliver the
            service. In particular:

            (a)   that operational services can meet the full functionality requirements, with
                  particular reference to the availability, audit, and responsiveness requirements;

            (b)   that the associated roll-out and support services are comprehensive, and that the
                  interfaces are clearly defined and meet the availability and responsiveness
                  requirements:

                                            Pilot Programme

            (c)   that there are effective project and contract management procedures, for example
                  change control procedures, service performance monitoring, and planning;

            (d)   that plans exist for contingency, fall-back and recovery;

            (e)   that the interfaces to the PAS, CAPS and POCL systems are accurate and
                  auditable;

            (f)   that procedures exist for developing future requirements into a service;

            (g)   the Service Providers commitment to quality assurance, both prior to award of
                  business and upon agreement throughout any contract period. In particular they
                  must demonstrate to the Contracting Authorities their commitment relating to the
                  quality of their procedures, processes, controls (including change control and
                  quality control), manpower, software and equipment, e.g. in areas such as
                  production, assembly, final inspection, dispatch/distribution. Contracting
                  Authorities should have the right to conduct reference site visits to Service
                  Provider sites in order to confirm quality assurance procedures.

6.4.8        IT Infrastructure

6.4.8.1.     The Contracting Authorities will assess the proposed IT infrastructure. In particular,
             that:

            (a)   the technology has the capability to cope with increased volumes or increased
                  functionality, for example adding peripherals such as CD-ROM and OCR;

            (b)   the solution adheres to industry and Health and Safety standards and is compatible
                  with the Contracting Authorities' IT/IS strategies;

            (c)   the IT infrastructure can handle technology refresh and change without disruption,
                  for example rate changes, new releases of software, and hardware upgrades;

            (d)   it has appropriate security;

            (e)   there is a workable configuration management service;

            (f)   measures have been taken to ensure data integrity and resilience.

            Commercial Aspects

6.4.8.2.    The Contracting Authorities will review any changes or options which may occur
            during the pilot programme that may have commercial implications. All the services
            that are contracted for must represent optimum value for money.

                                        The Roll-Out Programme

 CHAPTER 7. THE ROLL-OUT PROGRAMME


7.1         INTRODUCTION

7.1.1.      This chapter sets out the broad scope of the roll-out programme, identifying the key
            business imperatives from both the Contracting Authorities' perspectives. Service
            Providers are invited to propose and describe a number of exemplar roll-out strategies
            and implementation services, setting out any of their own constraints and dependencies
            which will impact the roll-out programme. The final roll-out strategy and detailed
            implementation approach will be decided in discussion with the Service Providers
            during the negotiation stage of this procurement.


7.2         TIMESCALES

7.2.1.      Current plans indicate that the pilot programme should complete with a formal
            acceptance procedure by May 1996. The Service Provider would then enter the roll-out
            programme. It will be a formal project-based activity with an agreed final acceptance
            procedure, but it is accepted that there will be a need for a progressive number of staged
            acceptances throughout the roll-out programme. The actual priorities for roll-out of
            service will be agreed with the Service Provider. However it is anticipated that there
            may be benefits to the Service Provider in separating physical roll-out of infrastructure
            from that of the operational service. Hence there is scope for the Service Provider to
            offer to complete early implementation of the physical infrastructure well within 3 years
            from the successful conclusion of the pilot programme. Service Providers will realise
            from the objectives below that the Contracting Authorities place considerable potential
            value on the infrastructure roll-out being completed as early as possible.

7.2.2.      Service Providers can assume that sufficient functionality of the CAPS system will be
            available by May 1996 to provide the primary input to the BPS. However the full range
            of customer claimant details for all benefits cannot be assumed, and priorities will need
            to be agreed with the Contracting Authorities.


7.3         OBJECTIVES

7.3 .1.     The objectives for the roll-out are identical to those given in the introduction, chapter 1
            section 1.2. It will also be vitally important that any roll-out programme has the
            flexibility to cope with change, bearing in mind actual experience, and changing
            political and market drivers. Having the physical infrastructure in place early could, in
            itself, help achieve the desired flexibility. The ability of POCL to offer a nationally
            available and consistent automated network of counters could significantly add to its
            ability to attract new clients and services. The need for flexibility is further illustrated by
            the range of business imperatives discussed below. These business imperatives will also
            shape the roll-out programme.

                                       The Roll-Out Programme

7.4          CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ROLL-OUT STRATEGY

7.4.1        The Contracting Authorities' Business Imperatives

7.4.1.1.     The business imperatives which must be taken into account in determining the roll-out
             strategy are summarised below.

            POCL Business Imperatives

7.4.1.2.    The major business imperatives for POCL are:

            (a)   the importance of implementation of the infrastructure to all post office outlets
                  (currently over 19,700) and the resultant advantages of being able to offer the
                  benefits of a totally automated counter network to clients;

            (b)   that the roll-out programme is acceptable and easily understood by POCL staff
                  and agents and is seen to be supporting the government policy of a national
                  network of post offices;

            (c)   to protect and maintain the security of POCL staff, outlets, cash and value of stock
                  before, during and after roll-out in accordance with agreed standards;

            (d)   to minimise the length and degree of disruption to current operations, systems,
                  other POCL clients and processes. Account should be taken of the local trading
                  pattern and surveys; equipment installation etc. should try to avoid busy periods
                  such as Christmas and month ends; and installation should be co-ordinated with
                  other initiatives;

            (e)   the migration or replacement of existing systems such as ALPS, ECCO+, APT,
                  Capture and CRISP; in a way which ensures value for money as far as POCL are
                  concerned;

            (f)   the success of the early roll-out in the area of customer and client satisfaction and
                  presenting a positive image;

            (g)   satisfying the requirements of clients including BA and ensuring the appropriate
                  prioritisation and development of other existing and new services;

            (h)   ensuring that the wide range of agency post offices are taken into consideration in
                  determining roll-out plans;

            (i)   balancing the geographical implications with all the business imperatives given
                  above;

            G)    to ensure that the infrastructure can support the m1rnmum application
                  configuration at each post office (i.e. automated payments (migrated form APT),
                  benefit payments, EPO8 (migrated from ECCO+)) and connectivity to the
                  remainder of the requirements;

                                      The Roll-Out Programme

            (k)   to ensure no adverse impact on quality of service forecasting or on service
                  standards for clients.

            BA Business Imperatives

7.4.1.3.    The primary BA business imperatives are:

            (a)   the fastest possible roll out of BPS consistent with operational reliability and
                  customer acceptability;

            (b)   the need to consider whether roll-out of the operational service should cover more
                  than one type of benefit, whether it would be confusing for the customer to receive
                  some benefits by an automated payment service and some by existing means and
                  also to consider the advantages of a roll-out plan that converts groups of benefits
                  that are often claimed together by the customer;

            (c)   consideration of the stability of legislation associated with particular benefits,
                  including the likelihood of changes in legislation having a significant effect on the
                  application, the timing of any such potential change and the ease with which it can
                  be made, as these are obviously critical from both a business and political
                  perspective;

            (d)   the mobility of customers and the importance of their being able to use more than
                  one post office for claiming benefit will also impact on any decisions on a
                  geographical roll-out plan;

            (e)   the need to maximise the reduction of fraud, considering which benefits and/or
                  geographical areas are most at risk and the effectiveness of interim measures to
                  combat fraud such as the ALPS project;

            (f)   the need to minimise duplication of costs during the transitional period by reducing
                  the period:

                  •     when order books for each of the major benefits are in issue i.e. there will be
                        advantage in terminating all order books for a particular benefit;

                  •     between issue of benefit payment cards and commencement of their
                        operational use (thus minimising nugatory work on losses, change of
                        circumstances, etc.).

7.4.2       Service Provider's Business Imperatives

7.4.2.1.    It is accepted that Service Providers will also have certain business imperatives and
            constraints, some of which must be taken into account in developing a feasible low risk
            roll-out programme. In this context Service Providers are asked to set out their business
            imperatives and constraints, explaining why they should be taken into account together

7.5          SERVICE PROVIDER'S RESPONSE

7.5.1        Proposal Content

             Roll-Out Programme

7.5.1.1.     Having discussed above the business imperatives from all perspectives, Service
             Providers will now appreciate the flexibility that will be required of a roll-out
             programme to support the main business drivers.

7.5.1.2.     Service Providers are requested to provide an overview of their roll-out strategy and
             should justify the feasibility of their approach and the timescales. Service Providers
             should base their proposals on a range of appropriate exemplar roll-out models and
             plans, identifying the relative benefits, cost implications, risks and constraints
             associated with each option. In particular, Service Providers should outline the
             implications for a minimum timescale on the infrastructure roll-out, paying particular
             attention to their own constraints such as availability of engineering resources. It is
             important for Service Providers to identify and state all assumed dependencies with
             regard to both Contracting Authorities for each exemplar put forward within their
             proposal, particularly as it is envisaged that the Contracting Authorities' and Service
             Providers' roll-out teams will need to work in a collaborative way.

7.5.1.3.     It is not expected, at this stage, that roll-out strategies will be definitive, but offer a basis
             for evaluation of the Service Providers' capabilities. The strategies will provide a sound
             framework for more detailed discussions throughout the course of negotiations. During
             these discussions the assumptions and commitments of both parties will be agreed and a
             practical roll-out programme and definition of roll-out services will be embodied within
             the contract.

            Roll-Out Services

7.5.1.4.    Within the context of the overall roll-out programme it is envisaged that a number of
            defined services will be required including:

            (a)   site surveys;

            (b)    cabling;

            (c)    installation of hardware;

            (d)   ordering of infrastructure and operational services;

            (e)   installation and acceptance of infrastructure and application;

            (f)   acceptance of new customers and applications onto the help desk service;

            (g)   management of change services including:

                  i.    training requirements for users, the Contracting Authorities' staff and agents,

                      ii.    customer awareness processes, particularly for special needs customer groups
                             as required by the overall Communications Strategy project,

                      iii.   introduction of new application services,

                      iv.    major change to existing services and infrastructure.

    7.5.1.5.    Service Providers should define the roll-out programme around a range of discrete but
                inter-related services. Each service should be described in terms of scope and functional
                capability.

                Experience and Capability

    7.5.1.6.    Service Providers should provide a description of how they would organise and manage
                the delivery of such services, explaining the underlying processes of each service. Past
                and current experience of developing and delivering similar services should be
                provided, particularly in environments having similar scale and, where possible, in retail
                or financial services. References should be provided where Service Providers can
                demonstrate through reference site visits such experience and capability.

    7.5.2       Specific Responses

    I           SR7.1       State any deviances from the requirements given in chapters 4 and 5 relevant
                to the services to be provided during the roll-out.

    I           SR7.2      State roll-out arrangements for the provision of benefit payments and other
                POCL services to customers who may choose to use more than one outlet, some having
                the service available and some not.

                SR7.3      State roll-out proposals for the provision of training giving details of the
                types, duration and target audience of the training that Service Providers consider will
                be needed at each stage of the roll-out.

    I           SR7.4      State roll-out proposals for the provision of documentation giving details of
                types, quantities and potential users of the documentation that will be needed at each
                stage of the roll-out.

    I           SR7.5      State the level of project support that will be provided during the roll-out
                period, in terms of the number and qualifications of people assigned to the project, the
                proportion of their time which will be devoted to the project, and where they will be
                located.

    I           SR7 .6     State any differences between proposed service levels for the steady state and
                roll-out period;

                SR7.7        State roll-out proposals for post offices.

                                Commercial Policies and Relationships

 CHAPTER 8. COMMERCIAL POLICIES AND RELATIONSHIPS


8.1          INTRODUCTION

 8.1.1.     This chapter sets out the Contracting Authorities' approach to the development of the
            commercial relationship with the Service Provider. It describes models which would
            meet the Contracting Authorities' requirements and in addition invites Service Providers
            to suggest other options. It is expected that extensive discussions will be required
            between BA, POCL and the Service Provider to develop appropriate commercial
            frameworks.


8.2         COMMERCIAL PRINCIPLES

8.2.1.      The following principles will be applied by the Contracting Authorities in assessing
            proposals from potential Service Providers and in helping to prepare business cases.
            They are in no particular order and the list is not exhaustive.

8.2.2.      A main objective of the development is to minimise the overall cost to the public sector
            as a whole, taking an end-to-end view and assessing the impact on public expenditure.

8.2.3.      The service must offer the Contracting Authorities, and also allow POCL to offer all its
            business partners (clients, agents and franchisees), a high degree of integrity, probity,
            financial control and confidentiality for both clients and customers.

8.2.4.      The Service Provider's charges must be reconcilable to the services provided, so that
            POCL can take this into account when pricing particular products and client services,
            and so that BA can fully account for expenditure and price their services. The
            Contracting Authorities will require a mechanism for ensuring that agreed pricing
            formulae for the contract(s) are being correctly applied; and that there is no cross-
            subsidy between different elements of the service.

8.2.5.      The Contracting Authorities will require the ability to add further applications to the
            service. These may be sourced from third parties or from the Service Provider. The
            Service Provider must be willing to integrate and operate these via the original service
            contract( s).

8.2.6.      Without prejudice to BA's right to market the benefit payment service at post offices,
            POCL will control the rights for using and marketing the services offered through the
            facilities provided by the Service Provider in post offices, i.e. the Service Provider will
            not contract directly with agents or other third parties for use of these facilities. It is
            expected that the Service Provider will assist in identifying, suggesting and helping
            develop new services to use these facilities. POCL must be free to use the service to
            transact business for any existing or future client (even if that client is a competitor to
            the Service Provider or to a member of a supplying consortium), subject to full security
            and service delivery safeguards for existing clbnts.

                                   Commercial Policies and Relationships

8.2. 7.         It is Government policy to:

                •     provide choice in the method by which customers can receive their Social Security
                      payments; namely through the banking system, or by collection from a post office;

                •    maintain a nationwide network of post offices.

8.2.8.          Contract(s) under this procurement will not be written so as to constrain development of
                government policies in respect of payment or a nationwide network of post offices.


8.3         CONTRACTUAL MODELS

8.3.1       Introduction

8.3.1.1.    The Contracting Authorities wish to consider options under which their business
            requirements can be met by a service contract or contracts which conform to the
            requirements of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). In addition, the Contracting
            Authorities wish to obtain sufficient information in response to this SSR to enable them
            to compare any privately financed procurement option with more conventional public
            sector procurement alternatives and have the option to contract for some or all of the
            services on these alternative bases. Comparison of all such options will be on the basis
            of the overall economic advantage of the total package, taking account of costs, benefits,
            and the extent to which risk is reduced and transferred to the Service Provider.

8.3.1.2.    Accordingly, the Service Provider must submit proposals on the basis of a privately
            financed contractual model, and must show these separately for the various components
            of the system, e.g. CMS/ PAS/ Counters Infrastructure, on the following lines:

            •        the Service Provider will buy the assets required to provide the service using
                     private capital and will own and operate them, charging the Contracting
                     Authorities fees, related to the usage of the service, for the services they each
                     receive;

            •        other privately financed contractual models might be suggested also. See sections
                     8.3.3 to 8.3.6 below.

8.3.1.3.    In addition, the Service Provider must indicate the financial and other implications of
            alternative proposals on the basis of a more conventional public sector contractual
            model, and must show these separately for the various components of the services e.g.
            CMS/PAS/Counters Infrastructure on the lines of:

            •        The Service Provider will design, build and operate the service. The capital assets
                     required to provide the service will be funded and owned by the Contracting
                     Authorities for their respective requirements. The Service Provider will then
                     charge an operating fee for running and maintaining the service;

            •        See sections 8.3.7 and 8.3.8 for further discussion of this non-PFI approach.

                                Commercial Policies and Relationships

 8.3.1.4.   The Service Provider may also offer hybrid proposals in which different parts of the
            service are provided on different bases of financing. In evaluating such hybrid
            proposals, the Contracting Authorities will look at the economic advantage of the
            overall package.

8.3.2       Contract Structures

8.3.2.1.    Elements of the service may be contracted with either Contracting Authority or both at
            the discretion of the Contracting Authorities.

8.3.3       Supply of Services under the PFI

8.3.3.1.    Service Providers are reminded of the principles of the PFI which were set out in
            Chapter 6 of the prospectus issued to them on 5 October 1994.

8.3.3.2.    The Service Provider must put forward a proposal to meet all requirements under the
            SSR. That is, where the Service Provider designs, develops, implements and
            subsequently enhances, operates and maintains, the respective parts of the service for
            the sole use of the Contracting Authorities. Under such contract(s), the Contracting
            Authorities would pay to use the service according to a pre-determined tariff, with
            payments largely based on usage but which may also include other elements such as
            service performance related payments or payments related to growth.

8.3.3.3.    Under such a service supply arrangement, POCL would lead in developing new
            business to utilise the infrastructure and counter service facilities provided, developing a
            number of "partnerships", possibly taking the form of joint ventures, with existing and
            new clients. POCL may also invite the Service Provider or individual members of a
            service- providing consortium to take part in some of these business development
            partnerships, and proposals should indicate whether or not, and on what basis, the
            Service Provider would wish to participate. In developing the use of the service, POCL
            will wish to use the best products available from the market place and will want to
            ensure that the service supply contract(s) facilitates this, including cases where the
            solution for a particular application involves a different supplier being used. Thus
            adherence to open technical standards and a corresponding contractual framework are
            both highly desirable.

8.3.3.4.    The Service Provider is also invited to propose arrangements under which it and POCL
            jointly market products using elements of the infrastructure and counter service and
            share the profits from this. The Service Provider may wish to consider such
            arrangements, including joint ventures, which cover the whole service to POCL (i.e.
            provision and operation of the service and its further commercial exploitation).

8.3.3.5.    The Service Provider may also propose arrangements under which it retains the rights to
            use and market hardware or software or facilities developed for this service for other
            applications. Such proposals should show whether this would result in lower prices for
            services to the Contracting Authorities, either through an initial lower price or via
            agreed formulae for price reductions related to such other uses. In considering such

 BAIPOCL SSR                                                              RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                  Commercial Policies and Relationships

                commercial and operational interests are not damaged. These safeguards may take the
                form of contractual terms based on Intellectual Property Rights, which define the
                geographical areas and markets in which the Service Provider may do this, and/or by the
                Contracting Authorities having the right to vet individual cases.

 8.3.3.6.       The Service Provider may also propose any other commercial structure which it
                considers may be of benefit to all parties.

 8.3.4          Funding of Services Provided

 8.3.4.1.   The Service Provider must set out its preferred approach to funding the services within
            the terms of the PFI. The proposal must indicate whether the Service Provider will fund
            them from its own resources. If the Service Provider proposes using an external source
            of finance the proposal must set out how this will be arranged and the contractual
            relationships which are envisaged between the Service Provider, the capital funder and
            the Contracting Authorities.

8.3.5       Charges for Services Provided under Privately Financed Options

8.3.5.1.    The proposal must explain the charging structure which the Service Provider envisages
            for each of the contractual models included in the proposal. Service Providers may
            present options, but must include at least one charging structure with volume/usage-
            related prices as its major element for each component of the service (e.g.
            CMS/PAS/Counter Infrastructure). Responses should include the Service Provider's
            approach to pricing for the development and operation of additional services which
            either or both of the Contracting Authorities may wish to add to the service, as
            described at section 8.3.3 above. This should take account of the need to allow for future
            implementation of requirements which are not part of the initial go-live service
            requ:.-ement, but which are currently known, and also the need to accommodate new
            requirements which are identified during the course of the contract(s).

8.3.5.2.    The Service Provider may propose other charging mechanisms.

8.3.6       Risks Transferred to the Private Sector under Privately Financed Options

8.3.6.1.    In procuring this service under the PFI, the aim will be to minimise risk and place it
            where it can most effectively be managed. This means that the total risk left with the
            Contracting Authorities must be at a minimum commensurate with value for money,
            and that significant risks must be borne by the Service Provider. Such risks could
            include:

            •       cost and timescale of service development and delivery;

            •       operating cost and service performance;

            •       consequential costs of service performance.

                                 Commercial Policies and Relationships

 8.3.6.2.     The payments to the Service Provider must, to a large part, depend on the usage of the
              service. Proposals must demonstrate how charging mechanisms for each major
              component of the service depend on throughput (service providers to define their
              throughput metrics) and must indicate the nature of minimum volumes required, if any.

 8.3.6.3 .   Proposals must show how the service will eliminate fraud and how the Service Provider
             would take responsibility for this being achieved. Service Providers must undertake
             responsibility for fraud losses which result from errors in their design, implementation
             or operation of the service, including unauthorised actions by their staff or sub-
             contractors.

 8.3.6.4.    Proposals should include the extent to which Service Providers will accept the transfer
             of risks associated with the Contracting Authorities' operation of the service, risks
             associated with the copying, forging or alteration of cards, and risks associated with
             "hacking".

8.3.6.5.     Where the Service Provider is proposing a joint venture approach for part or all of the
             service to POCL (as in section 8.3.3 above), its proposals should show the extent to
             which the commercial risks of such a joint venture lie with the Service Provider.

8.3.6.6.     Proposals should show any other areas in which the Service Provider would accept risks
             currently managed and borne by the public sector.

8.3.6.7.     Proposals must show the Service Provider's approach to managing the risks for which it
             is undertaking responsibility. This must include contingency plans and must
             demonstrate that the Service Provider has the financial resources available (in-house or
             through an insurance arrangement) to meet any resulting liabilities.

8.3.6.8.     Proposals should set out a number of options for the level of risk which the Service
             Provider would accept and the effect of these on costs. Each option should show the
             risks for which the Service Provider would accept responsibility and their approach to
             risk management.

8.3.7        Development and Operation of a Publicly Owned Service

8.3.7.1.     In addition to their privately financed options, Service Providers must set out their
             approach to publicly funded bases for each component of the service, e.g.
             CMS/PAS/Counters Infrastructure. This would be on the basis of separate but linked
             arrangements as follows:

             (a)   The Service Provider designs, supplies and builds a turnkey system(s) (including
                   roll-out) to meet the business requirements, technical standards and policies set
                   out in this document and to be amplified and agreed during subsequent
                   discussions;

             (b)   The Service Provider runs the service on a facilities-management basis.

8.3.7.2.     The Service Provider should set out its approach to charging for the development and
             operation of the service. This should state whether it is proposing a single

BA/POCL SSR                                                               RESTRICTED- Commercial
                                Commercial Policies and Relationships

            reimbursement of capital costs on delivery and acceptance of a working, turnkey
            service, or whether it would require any staged payments during development.

8.3.7.3.    The Service Provider should set out its approach to charging for facilities management.

8.3.7.4.    Responses must include the Service Provider's approach to pricing for the development
            and operation of additional services which either or both of the Contracting Authorities
            may wish to add to the service, as described at section 8.3.3 above.

8.3.7.5.    The Service Provider may propose other approaches to public-sector owned solutions
            and their charging mechanisms for them.

8.3.8       Risks Transferred under Publicly Funded Options

8.3.8.1.    The Service Provider should set out the extent to which it is prepared to accept the risks
            associated with the development and operation of the service (as outlined in section
            8.3.6). It is required that the Service Provider accept responsibility for risks in all areas
            under its control.

8.3 .8.2.   Under the design and build contract, the Service Provider must accept all risks
            associated with timescale and cost over-run in developing an agreed turnkey service.

8.3.8.3.    Under the facilities management approach, the Service Provider must provide
            guarantees of service performance and indemnify the Contracting Authorities against
            costs caused by failure to meet agreed service levels.


8.4         INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) AND DATA OWNERSIDP

8.4.1.      In r:-der to safeguard their services to the public and their commercial interests the
            Contracting Authorities will require appropriate arrangements with the Service Provider
            covering IPR and Data Ownership.

8.4.2.      Arrangements for the provision of this service will not give the Service Provider rights
            to ownership or use of the data in other applications except by explicit agreement of the
            relevant Contracting Authority. In particular the Contracting Authorities will require
            confidentiality undertakings from the Service Provider both to ensure the confidentiality
            of personal information about customers and to ensure that the security of the system is
            not compromised.

8.4.3.      The Contracting Authorities will require an agreed framework for Intellectual Property
            Rights in the systems developed to provide this service, which safeguards both the
            Contracting Authorities' operational requirements and commercial interests during and
            after the contract(s).

8.4.4.      The Contracting Authorities will require contractual arrangements which safeguard
            continuity of service, including rights to acquire source code of any licensed software
            necessary to provide the service and rights to take over licences to any third party
            software in the event that the Service Provider fails to provide an adequate service.

                                Commercial Policies and Relationships

 8.4.5.      POCL will require the exclusive right based on IPRs to use the facilities which the
             Service Provider installs in post offices. In exercising this right, POCL will seek to
             maximise benefits from the services available from the Service Provider.

 8.4.6.     Either or both of the Contracting Authorities, as appropriate, require the right to control
            the use of cards or other tokens issued to the public for benefit payment or other
            transactions at post offices. In particular, the Service Provider must not itself offer
            services which would use such cards at other locations. The use of the National
            Insurance Number will be controlled by the Secretary of State for Social Security.

8.4.7.      Either or both of the Contracting Authorities may require the IPR and source code of
            any bespoke software developed to provide the service. Should the Service Provider
            wish to market such software, then subject to satisfactory safeguards on system security,
            the Contracting Authorities would wish to consider this in return for agreed lower costs.

8.4.8.      The Service Provider may propose arrangements under which it can exploit software
            developed for this service in other contexts, to the mutual advantage of the Service
            Provider and Contracting Authorities. The Contracting Authorities will wish to
            encourage such arrangements provided that they are compatible with their commercial
            interests and operational requirements including security.

8.4.9.      Either or both of the Contracting Authorities will require Intellectual Property Rights
            covering the design, branding and procedures associated with the benefit payment
            process, and POCL (with its other clients in some cases) will require similar rights
            associated with other products transacted at post offices. Service Providers should note
            that the Contracting Authorities will not allow any unauthorised use of any POCL or
            Post Office, nor of any BA, DSS or other government trademarks, brands, logos etc. in
            any advertising, PR, or promotional material either in the UK or in any other country.

8.4.10.     Where the Service Provider proposes developing facilities for the delivery of the system
            which may be applicable in other contexts and are not specifically related to the BA
            and/or POCL business requirements, then it would be appropriate for the Service
            Provider to exploit those facilities for other business and the proposal should state this
            and indicate the extent to which the Contracting Authorities can expect lower costs as a
            result of it. This may be expressed as a lower initial price or as an agreed price reduction
            formula


8.5         RE-TENDERING, RESIDUAL VALUES, AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS

8.5.1.      In order to ensure continuing value for money, the Contracting Authorities may wish to
            re-tender for the supply of all or part of the service after the initial contract period.

8.5.2.      The Service Provider should respond on the basis of a contract(s) lasting five years from
            the contracted date of completion of the implementation of the service.

8.5.3.      In the event that the initial Service Provider did not wish to continue providing the
            service after the contract period, or was unsuccessful in re-tendering, the Contracting
            Authorities would wish to ensure the smooth transfer of a "going concern" service to

BA/POCL SSR                                                              RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                Commercial Policies and Relationships

            another operator or operators or in house. The Service Provider must set out its
            proposals for how this could be achieved from a commercial viewpoint. (See also
            Chapter 5 which sets out requirements from an operational perspective.)

8.5.4.      As a consequence the Service Providers should develop its responses on the basis that it
            will not recover all its costs from service charges during the initial contract and that
            residual values will be reflected in a terminal charge dependent on performance. Service
            Providers' proposals should consider approaches which include pre-determined
            formulae for calculating the transfer values of assets to a subsequent contractor, or in-
            house, and approaches under which the assets are vested in a company created for the
            purpose which could itself be transferred to a subsequent contractor or in-house. Cost
            areas where full recovery of investment during the initial service period would be
            inappropriate include, for example:

            •     major bespoke software development for central services and communications;

            •     hardware with more than 25% of its expected operational life outstanding at the
                  end of the contract(s);

            •     new developments and upgrades to the service introduced within 3 years of the
                  end of the contract(s).

8.5.5.      For reasons of operational feasibility, the Contracting Authorities will require the right
            to have all the hardware and licences to use package software in post offices or
            elsewhere transferred to a subsequent contractor or to the Contracting Authorities
            themselves at the determination of the contract(s).


8.6         EARLY TERMINATION OF CONTRACT

8.6.1.      The Contracting Authorities will require reserved rights so that if the Service Provider
            fails to provide the contracted service or gives other grounds for early termination of the
            contract, then the Contracting Authorities will take over the operation of all or part the
            service, or appoint a third party to operate it on their behalf, including all hardware,
            software, communications facilities, and infrastructure which they deem necessary for
            the operation of the service.

8.7          SERVICE PROVIDER'S RESPONSE

8.7.1       Proposal Content

8.7.1.1.    The Service Provider's response should adopt the same section headings as 8.1 to 8.6
            above.

8.7.2       Financial Information

8.7.2.1.     Service Providers are required to provide indicative financial information, but not final
            prices, in their proposals. Such information will not constitute an offer by the Service
            Provider but will assist the Contracting Authorities to review thoroughly the investment
            aspects of their business case(s) and at a later date facilitate further discussion with the
            Service Providers over the strategic direction of proposed solutions, particularly in
            relation to the efficiency and overall viability of the project. In the final stages of the
            procurement, price and overall costs to the Contracting Authorities will be highly
            relevant factors. Therefore in providing the information Service Providers should take
            note of the objectives of the programme detailed in Chapter 1, particularly those relating
            to:

            (a)   reducing administration costs of the benefit payment system;

            (b)   eliminating fraud and controlling residual liabilities;

            (c)   improving overall efficiency and cost effectiveness for POCL and its clients;

            (d)   at least maintaining, if not improving, overall customer service.

8.7.2.2.    The investment appraisal aspects of BA' s business case will examine the current
            administration costs of the end to end system for making payments through post offices
            against the costs of an automated service through post offices. Savings of Social
            Security benefit payments arising from the elimination of fraud are unlikely to be
            included in the basic assessment of net costs or benefits though remaining opportunities
            for fraud or potential new areas for fraud will be included in the review of risks.

8.7.2.3.    Indicative financial information should cover:

            (a)   proposed approaches to charging structures for components of the service (i.e.
                  CMS / PAS / TMS / Counter Infrastructure), for both private and publicly funded
                  options. Within the response the Service Provider should assume that the
                  Contracting Authority for the CMS will wish to own (i.e. purchase) the benefit
                  payment card, as part of the contract arrangements. If a Service Provider sees any
                  difficulty with this approach the problem(s) should be identified within their

            (b)   differences between a service based around minimum requirements of the BPS,
                  EPOS/ECCo+ and automated payment functionality and a service based on a
                  generic approach. Any additional (costed) alternative approaches would also be
                  welcome;

            (c)   indicative financial infonnation (one-off and running costs) by major cost element
                  for each component, e.g.:

            •     hardware;

            •     software development and licences;

            •     telecommunications;

            •     consumables;

            •     other, e.g. training and help desk facilities;

            (d)   preferred approach to funding the service;

            (e)   the financial resources available to meet liabilities for the assumption of risk.

9.3         PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND TIMETABLE

9.3.1       Procurement Process

9.3.1.1.    Of the five stages identified for procurement in the Request for Statement of Capability,
            Stage 1 Establish Playing Field is now complete. The remaining stages are set out
            below with indicative timescales.

            Stage 2 - Innovation and Clarification                               (Nov. '94 -May '95)

9.3.1.2.    This is the current stage. Its objective is to assess the viability of Service Providers'
            approaches by evaluating their detailed proposals for development, technology, service
            provision, management, resourcing etc. The stage will set the basis for the contract
            negotiations and involves the issue of this SSR to which Service Providers are to
            respond with written proposals. This stage will finish with a review of the architecture
            and standards requirements, taking into account industry input. Shortlisted Service
            Providers will be invited to enter into contract negotiations in parallel with undertaking
            their demonstrator programme.

            Stage 3 - Contract Negotiation I Pilot Commencement                      (Jun. - Oct. '95)

9.3.1.3.    The objectives of this stage are to agree draft contracts and to develop the tender
            evaluation model. This stage will involve meetings to discuss the draft contracts and
            model workloads to be used in the evaluation model. Demonstrations of proposed

            solutions based on a Demonstrator programme and reference site visits will occur in
            parallel with the negotiations. This process is aimed at evaluation and risk assessment of
            the potential solutions and is part of the overall procurement risk reduction process.

            Stage 4 - Evaluation and Selection                                        (Nov. - Dec. '95)
9.3.1.4.    During this stage Service Providers will be asked to submit financial proposals on the
            basis of the agreed draft contracts . .These will be evaluated, and at the end of the stage
            the prime contractor(s) will be selected.

            Stage 5 - Operational Trials                                                         (1996)
9.3.1.5.    Following selection of the prime contractor(s), the operational trials will commence
            (details of which will have been agreed during Stage 3 Contract Negotiation) to refine
            and prove the final solution for the service provision, to establish the detail of the roll-
            out programme and associated change management processes. The timescales are to be
            agreed during Stage 3 Contract Negotiation.

9.3.2       Timetable

9.3.2.1.    The following table provides the indicative timetable following the issue of the SSR.
            The Contracting Authorities will use all reasonable endeavours to comply with this
            timetable and with any revision thereof which may subsequently be notified to potential
            Service Providers during the course of procurement. However, neither this timetable nor
            any subsequent revision thereof shall be taken as constituting a contract, agreement or
            representation that the procurement will be conducted in accordance therewith, and the
            Contracting Authorities accept no responsibility for any delay in meeting this timetable
            (or any subsequent revision thereof) or for any costs that may be incurred by potential
            Service Providers as a result of such delay or otherwise.

9.3.2.2.    The above timetable covers the activities up to the end of Stage 4. Following this, the
            selected prime contractor(s) will then undertake Stage 5 Operational Trials in
            accordance with the timescales agreed during the negotiations, the basis for which is set
            out in chapter 6.


9.4         EVALUATION

9.4.1       Evaluation Approach

9.4.1.1.    This section describes the evaluation approach for Service Providers' proposals and the
            implications for their content. Toe approach is based on the use of predetermined formal
            evaluation criteria against which each proposal will be scored. These scores will then be
            combined by a pre-specified formula to position the proposals on an evaluation grid, in
            a similar way to the Statement of Capabilities, and the results used for the shortlisting
            decision. The grid and the evaluation criteria are described further after the next sub-
            section which discusses the three types of information required in proposals.

9.4.1.2.    The proposal evaluation will be based upon the written responses from Service
            Providers. While some minor clarification may be undertaken following receipt of
            proposals, failure by the Service Provider to document his proposal clearly is likely to
            result in a poor rating in the evaluation.

9.4.2       Information in Proposals

9.4.2.1.    The evaluation will be looking for three types of information in Service Providers'
            proposals. These are:

            •     "what"

            •     "how"   ~ Characteristics as seen by service users
                  "proof' ~
                            Evidence of viability as seen by experts
            •
9.4.2.2.    It is important that the Service Providers understand the distinction between these types
            of information and how they support each other, so that they are included in the
            proposals. Hence these are explained further below.

            "What" and "How"

9.4.2.3 .   Information about the "what" and "how" relates to the service boundary as shown in
            Figure 9-1 The Service Boundary.

                                   Figure 9-1 The Service Boundary

9.4.2.4.    Information about the "what" is above the service boundary and describes what services
            are to be delivered by the Service Provider from the perspective of the user of the
            services and the Contracting Authorities. Information about the "how" is below the
            service boundary and describes "how" the service provider will undertake the
            development and provision of the services.

9.4.2.5.    Following the award of any service contract(s), "how" the Service Provider undertakes
            the service provision and his internal management and control processes should be a
            matter for the Service Provider' s management team. This is on the basis that "what"
            services are delivered meet the contracted specifications. However it is important for the
            Contracting Authorities to understand "how" Service Providers propose to develop and
            deliver their services to enable proposals to be evaluated and for possible inclusion in
            any contract(s).

            "Proor
9.4.2.6.    In addition to information about "what" services are to be delivered and "how" they are
            to be provided, it is important that Service Providers provide "proof' that their
            proposals are feasible. In the evaluation of Statement of Capabilities, the "proof'
            focused primarily upon track record. For the proposal evaluation, "proof' is extended to
            consider the overall feasibility of the proposal which will not only consider relevant
            track record, but also factors such as relevant references, examples of where similar
            approaches have been successful before, formal certifications and approvals.

 9.4.3      Evaluation Selection

 9.4.3.1.   While the preceding sub-section covered the type of information required in proposals,
            this one addresses how the sbortlist is to be identified. As mentioned above, the
            proposals will be scored against formal evaluation criteria and the results plotted on an
            evaluation grid. To do this, the evaluation criteria are divided into two categories:

            •     Characteristics, and

            •     Viability.

9.4.3.2.    The "characteristics" of a proposal will be assessed on "what" services are proposed
            (e.g. their structure, content and performance criteria) and certain aspects of "how" these
            are to be provided. The relevant aspects of "how" will be those where the Service
            Provider has explained the implications of a particular approach or solution for the
            service users (e.g. implied functionality and flexibility, speed of implementation).

9.4.3.3.    The "viability" of a proposal will be assessed on the evidence that the Service Provider
            provides to prove that his proposal is feasible and _his proposed services can be provided
            as he has described them. This category will be assessed on the "proof' type
            information in the proposal (e.g. evidence of having done it before) and certain aspects
            of "how". In this case, the relevant aspects of "how" will be those where it provides a
            logical explanation underpinning the services to be delivered, such that this would be
            convincing to an expert. For example: describing the design approaches to show how
            aspects of functionality and flexibility would be achieved; offering exemplar plans
            illustrating resources and timescales to achieve specific deliverables; describing the
            processes and organisation that would be used to manage and deliver service. Where
            "viability" cannot be fully shown in writing, then the Service Provider will need to
            explain what actions would be taken to prove his approach following shortlisting (e.g.
            by references and demonstrations).

9.4.3.4.    The scores for each evaluation criteria will be combined by pre-specified formulae and
            weights into a score for "characteristics" and a score for "viability" for each proposal.
            These scores will then be used to plot the position of each proposal on a proposal
            evaluation grid. An example of this is shown in Figure 9-2 Proposal Evaluation Grid.

9.4.3.5.    A proposal may fall into one of the four boxes as follows:

            (a)   Reservations about Viability

                  This indicates the proposal, while overall a good fit to the requirements, has
                  insufficient evidence to substantiate the proposed solution (or that the services
                  could not be implemented as described).

            (b)   Reservations about Solution

                  This indicates the proposal docwnent has been well constructed and the proposed
                  services shown to be viable; however the proposed services do not provide a good
                  fit to the requirements.

            (c)   Viable Contender

                  This indicates the proposed services both provide a good fit to the requirements
                  and are shown in the proposal to be a viable option.

            (d)   Unacceptable

                  This indicates an unacceptable set of services not properly substantiated in the
                  proposal.

9.4.3.6.    The natural choice for the negotiation shortlist is for Service Providers whose proposals
            fall into the "Viable Contender" box. However there are associated factors that will be
            taken into consideration, for instance the m.L'llber on the shortlist (if too many or too few
            Service Providers fall into this area), and the specific strengths and weaknesses of each
            proposal.

 9.4.3.7.    In addition, a separate evaluation of the Service Provider's commercial response to
             chapter 8 will be undertaken to assess whether his initial proposals offer a reasonable
             basis for further discussion. Any costs provided in response to the SSR will be treated as
             indicative and will be used for budgetary and business case purposes only.

 9.4.4       Evaluation Criteria
 9.4.4.1     Throughout the procurement, the Service Providers and their proposals will be assessed
             against objective evaluation criteria to select the most economically advantageous
             solution. These evaluation criteria relate to how well these proposals support the business
             objectives for the overall programme. These were introduced in the prospectus and the
             Request for Statement of Capability, and a comprehensive set of objectives is provided in
             chapter 1.

9.4.4.2     The evaluation criteria for proposals are based upon the requirements set out in chapters 4
            to 8. These reflect the business objectives which are also used to set the relative
            importance of the criteria. The generic headings under which evaluation shall take place
            include, but are not limited to, the bullet points shown in Figure 9-1 The Service
            Boundary. The Contracting Authorities will also have regard to all other shortlisting
            criteria to which reference is permitted under EC/GATI procurement rules.


9.5         PROPOSALFORMATANDCONTENT

9.5.1       Proposal Structure
9.5.1.1.    This section describes the required format and content for the Service Provider' s
            proposal.

9.5 .1.2.   The overall structure of the proposal shall be as follows :

                                                                                      Indicative size

9.5.1.3.    The indicative sizes shown for proposal sections are not expected to vary by more than
            about 10%, and the overall length of the proposal should not exceed 430 sides of A4
            paper. The sizes of the annexes are not included within the indicative page count;

              however the Contracting Authorities cannot undertake to read all annex material for the
              proposal evaluation.

 9.5.1.4.     The proposal sections 1 to 3 are explained in 9.5.2 to 9.5.4 respectively.

 9.5.1.5.     Proposal sections 4 to 8 (the responses to Chapters 4 to 8) are explained in 9.5.5 below.

 9.5.1.6.     The annexes are explained in section 9.5.6 below.

              General Points

 9.5.1.7.    Each section of the proposal should start on a new page and the proposal should be
             constructed so that, if necessary, any section can be separated from the body of the
             proposal and given to specific readers.

9.5.1.8.     Section 8 containing the commercial information must be bound separately from the
             other sections for reasons of confidentiality. Any indicative cost information should be
             provided separately from the main body and section 8 of proposals, and will not be used
             in the proposal evaluation.

9.5.1.9.     Proposals should include financial implications for proposed options where this helps
             explain the Service Provider's proposal. The Service Provider may describe any
             innovative or other options in addition to the Service Provider's main proposal, provided
             these are justified.

9.5.1.l 0.   The Service Provider is requested to use any estimates, assumptions and volumetrics
             shown in the SSR. The Service Provider may present additional sizings/costings based

9.5.1.11.    Whilst every endeavour has been made to give Service Providers an accurate description

                                        Procurement Requirements

9.5.4           Proposal: The Service Provider

            The Service Provider should explain the make-up of his consortium, how it would provide
            the range of proposed services and provide for a stable long-term business relationship.
            This description must clearly identify the separate contributions and responsibilities of
            each organisation.

            The Service Provider must provide the financial infonnation requested in the Request for
            Statement of Capability, where organisations are proposed as consortiwn members or
            major sub-contractors and this information has not been provided before.

9.5.5       Proposal: Responses to SSR Cbapten

9.5.5.1.    Sections 4 to 8 of the proposal will respond to chapters 4 to 8 of the SSR respectively.
            Each section shall have a similar structure as described below.

9.5.5.2.    Each section shall provide the information as requested at the end of the respective
            chapter under the heading "Service Provider's Response". These ask for a narrative
            description of the Service Provider's approach taking full account of the information
            within the main body of the respective SSR chapter (particularly where the Service
            Provider is asked to provide specific comments).

9.5.5.3 .   Many of the chapters also ask for "Specific Responses" set out in a sub-section within
            that for "The Service Provider's Response". These responses should be provided with
            the respective proposal sections following the narrative description. The format for
            these responses is described below.

            Format of Specific Responses

9.5.5.4.    Where a chapter includes a sub-section at the end titled "Specific Responses", a series
            of paragraphs are set out for response by the Service Provider. These are categorised as:

                       "C"      for standards conformance; or

                       "I"      for request for information.

9.5.5.5.    Service Providers are to respond to each paragraph and reproduce the paragraph
            reference and text (e.g. in italics) before the response.

9.5.5.6.    A simple statement that the request will be met is not sufficient. For each paragraph the
            Service Provider should:

            •       provide the information requested (in response to "I") or describe what
                    applicability the standards identified have to the proposal (in response to "C");

            •       describe any options available and state the implications.

9.5.5.7.    Responses must be limited to providing information which is directly relevant.

3.1          Objectives

            Departmental security standards, which the Department and its agents are obliged to observe, ensure
            compliance with Departmental security policy by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability
            of Departmental data and services by minimising the risks of:

             •      unauthorised access/disclosure

                   the unauthorised access to or disclosure of information;

            •       modification

BA/POCL SSR APPENDIX                                                                       RESTRICTED - Commercial
                                              DSS IT Security Standards

              (a)    The Departmental Security Instructions (OSI) covering personnel, document and physical
                     security, which are the responsibility of the Departmental Security Officer (DSO);

             (b)     The Dcpartmcntal IT Security Standards (ITSS) covering IT security, which are the responsibility
                     of the Departmental IT Security Officer (DITSO).


        The Service Provider will be expected to:

             (a)    comply with all applicable standards defined in current and future DSI and ITSS requiring
                    positive action on its part, except where agreement to the contrary has been reached with the
                    DITSO in accordancc with this provision in the ITSS;

             (b)    cooperate with the Department, as required, in order to assist the Department in complying with
                    those applicable standards, which arc not complied with at the time of the awarding of contract;

             (c)    not knowingly do anything that would prevent or hinder the Department in complying with
                    standards.

             Relevant extracts of the OSI and ITSS will be made available upon request. Both arc evolving
             documents and whilst revisions are planned, major change is not envisaged. Changes to ITSS are
             approved by the Departmental Change Control Board.

             Departmental security standards will apply to services and data provided outside Departmental premises.

             Throughout the term of any contract with the Service Provider, and afterwards, all information relating
             to the Department's services will remain the property of the Department and its successors. The
             Department's information must be classified in accordance with security standards and must not be
             disclosed by the Service Provider to a third party without prior written consent of the DSO or the
             DITSO.


4.           ACCESS

             The Service Providers, and any of their sub-contractors, will be expected to grant DSS and its authorised
             agents access to staff, data, and installations at all reasonable times, and to inspect and take copies from
             all documentation relevant to the service provision. All reasonable assistance should be provided at no
             extra cost for the purposes of allowing DSS to obtain such information as is necessary to:

             (a)    fulfil DSS' s obligations to supply information for parliamentary, governmental, judicial or other
                    administrative purposes;

             (b)    cany out an audit of the providers compliance with the obligations with respect to the security
                    and confidentiality of data, computer integrity and other security requirements;

             (c)    investigate any suspected impropriety if the DSS has a reasonable suspicion that the impropriety
                    has taken place.

                 BENEFIT PAYMENTS - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

1.          INTRODUCTION

            Under the provisions of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, regulations (Claims and Payment
            regulations) provide that benefit shall be paid in accordance with an award as soon as is reasonably
            practicable after the award has been made.

            In order to ensure that payments arc made when required the Benefits Agency (BA) has evolved a series
            of procedures designed to enable the continuation of payments of benefit during a period in which
            normal proccdurcs arc not available.


1.1         Emergency Situations

                 1.   local disasters·




2.          LOCAL DISASTERS

            A local disaster occurs when all ACCs and postal delivery services arc functioning normally but a single
            or number of District Offices (DOs) arc unable to provide a normal service. In each case the initial
            action is to undertake an assessment of the nature and scale of the problem. Table I below indicates the
            assessment of the impact on the service which is undertaken (with reference to each disaster type). Table
            2 indicates the contingency options open to DSS staff to ensure the continuing provision of a payment
            service.

                          Arrangements can be made for a local authority to make interim payments to BA customers on

2.1          Emergency Payment Dialogue

            ISCS contains a dialogue (IS 899) which can be used in emergency situations to make payments by
            girochcque via the ACCs.


2.1.1       Payment

            Although using ISCS to generate the payment award, payments made in this dialogue arc intended (and
            classified) as interim payments only. They are made as the result of an entitlement to any benefit
            requiring payment.

            This dialogue generates payments by girocheque, made as normal through the ACCs. Payments may be
            for amounts between £1.00 and £999.99. The amount to be paid is calculated off-line using either an
            interim or emergency rate or the actual amount due for payment where this is known/accessible.

            The serial number imprinted on the girocheque is taken from the batch of numbers allocated to the host
            office.

            Additionally a customer notification is produced via the Common Payments Package (CPP).

            Computer systems arc not automatically updated with the information concerning payments made via
            this procedure. The process has therefore to be repeated either weekly or fortnightly, dependent on
            payment period, until the emergency has ended.

                                     Benefits Payments - Emergency Procedures



2.1.2        Returned Girocheques

             If a girochcque issued in accordance with this procedure IS 899 is returned (either cashed or uncashed)
             to the office, it is treated in the same way as a clerical girocheque which has not been recorded on the
             system.


2.1.3        Reconciliation

             Following the issue of interim or emergency payments using this procedure there is a reconciliation
             between the amount of benefit paid during the period of the emergency and the entitlement. It is
             established whether an over or under payment has occuncd. Balances due to the customer arc paid,
             accompanied by a notification advising the customer on how payment has been calculated.
             Ovcrpaymcnts of benefit are calculated and consideration given to their recovery from benefit payable.


2.2          District Processing Facility

            The District Processing Facility allows staff at any site within a district to process work from other sites,
            without moving location or having to transfer ownership of a case. This enables work to be processed as
            normal without the need to make interim payments or take any necessary subsequent recovery action. A
            District Processing Facility can also be used to process recovery work if interim payments were made
            during the emergency period.


2.3          Local Emergency Centre (LEC)

            If an office becomes unusable or is only able to provide a limited service as a result of the disaster, it
            may be necessary to set up a Local Emergency Centre (LEC). This is a centre set up to provide clerical
            payments, and/or caller facilities for BA customers. Its availability would be dependent on the
            availability of suitable accommodation and staffing.

            The LEC may be set up within the affected office itself, (if still usable) or in temporazy premises in the
            location. The LEC may be used:

                 l.   throul!hout the emcr~encv neriod·
             .2~"·'   until alternative system processing arrangements can be made from an Emergency Processing
                      Centre CEPC - see 2.4)·
                 3.   in coniunction with an EPC.

            An LEC can be used to perform a number of different business functions . Its actual functionality is a
            management decision which must take into account a number of factors, the major ones being listed
            below:

                 1.   the nature and severity of the disaster affecting the office i.e. the extent to which computer
                      svstcms can be accessed and the availabilitv of accommodation/staff:
                 2.   whether the business has to be conducted at temporary accommodation - in this case factors
                      such as transportation of necessary staff/equipment and security of the premises has to be taken
                      account of;
                 3.   whether the LEC is being used in conjunction with the affected office and/or an EPC.


2.3.I       Semce Levels Offered by an LEC

            The level of service offered by an LEC is individually determined by the tasks it is able to carry out
            (having taken the above factors into consideration), this can vary considerably, however examples of
            services which may be provided arc:

2.4         Emergency Processing Centre (EPC)

            An Emergency Processing Centre (EPC) is a facility that can be used when one or more offices are
            unable to process work. The EPC becomes the link to the computer systems and processes work on
            behalf of the offices.

            An EPC is established by connecting a communications controller (at a designated site) to the required
            computer service or services. Other essential requirements (e.g. staff, budgetary control) arc also decided
            and provided. Payments arc generated through the computer systems and issued as normal. The work to
            be undertaken by the EPC is decided at the outset of the emergency. This is dependent on the nature of
            the damage to the affected office(s), and whether any work can be undertaken at LECs. Options
            available arc:



                 3.:      all work sifted and classified at the EPC with non-urgent work being returned to the office or
                          LEC for eventual
                 4.       work of a certain type, generally that requiring payments to be awarded, is selected for
                                      at the EPC e. . new or       t clai        e of circumstaru:cs.


2.4.1       Returned IOPs

            Where IOPs are returned to the EPC and it is unable to cater for the receipt, storage or disposal of the
            IOP. The EPC issued with clerical forms enabling the returned IOP to be recorded and destroyed.

            Where IOPs are returned to the office and it still has access to computer systems nonnal procedures for
            returned IOPs apply.

             If the office has no system access or post is being diverted to an LEC, arrangements are made to record
             returned IOPs on an appropriate system which is developed by SIS in any emergency. Detailed
             ammgements depend on the availability of secure accommodation at both the Emergency Caller Centre
             and theEPC.


2.5          Interim Awards

            An interim award of benefit can be made dming            an
                                                               emergency. Such an interim award is a payment,
            which would nonnally have been via one of the computer systems, made clerically during an emergency.
            There arc several means by which interim payments may be made:

                 !:IUH                                  and issued at an office site either office LEC or EPC •

                                                            • on behalf of BA.

            The person making a claim for an interim award need not be an existing customer, however in this
            instance a new claim must be made before payment can be considered.


2.5.1        Interim Payments

            Interim payments:


                            carry no right of appeal against; the basis of the decision to make payment, the rate of payment
                            or a decision not to
             :~~It          can be for any reasonable amount which any authorised agent of the Secretary of State considers
                            appropriate. This may be for the exact entitlement to benefit (where this is known) or can be for
             •·•········:•· a reasonable amount to cover the customer's irnrncrli.ate needs·
             'AC/' can be offset or rccovercd if the customer is given notification that the payment is recoverable
                    .. .. before or at the same time as           t is made.

            If the entitlement to benefit is exceeded during the emergency period the excess can be recovered from
            most benefits as overpayments.


2.5.2       Methods of Payment

            Once an interim award of payment has been confirmed and calculated there are a number of methods by
            which payment may be made.

            Payments by Girocheque

            Girochcques will be is.rued as normal through the computer systems where this is possible (e.g. where
            a ~ to the systems is still obtainable or through an EPC). Where it is not possible, they will be issued
            clerically from the issue point (office or LEC). Where a customer is in receipt of benefit. payments are
            made on their normal pay-day if possible. Payments in respect of new claims are paid on their future
            pay-day if this can be established.

            A central control record of all payments is kept to help:

             ·:i. '; respond to enquiries either during the emergency or concerning payments made during the

                 2:'"=''' with rccoverv action in the event of anv           ts of benefit.

             Cash Payments

             In certain circumstances it may be possible to make emergency payments to customers in cash. There is
             a regular 'out of hours' service run by officers of the DSS and accessible to customers outside ofbusiness
             hours in an emcrgcncy from whom small amounts of cash may be obtained. Designated emergency
             offices are able to obtain cash outside nonnal banking hours and certain nominated officers can draw up
             to £5,000 in cash from banks in an emergency. Cash payments are primarily made in the following
             emergency situations:

                                             of a lar e number of • os·
                     in a    e scale em.er  that the 'Out of Hours' service can not a        handle·
                     cash payments may be made at the beginning of an emergency period until other arrangements
                     have been made.

             The amount payable is at the discretion of management who can determine it by using either a set
             amount for all customers or by paying on a sliding scale according to numbers of dependants etc.

            The "out of hours" service is provided by BA to customers who need money urgently outside nonnal
            office hours. Emergency telephone numbers are provided for the Police, Social Services etc. to provide a
            contact point within BA. The service is operated by BA staff.

            The call is initially answered by a BA officer who makes a decision as to whether to visit the customer.
            If a visit is suitable, a visiting officer is sent to the address. The second officer makes a discretionary
            decision as to whether a payment should be made. Most payments are made in cash, and all are
            rccovcrable.

            Order Book Based Payment

            In an emergency it is poSSil>le to use expired order book covers and payment foil counterfoil stubs to
            make payments of benefit to those customers currently paid by book. To assist in such a procedure the
            back cover of an order book is printed with ten boxes. Post office clerks use these to record any
            emergency payments made.

            Should BA (in agreement with POCL) authorise payment to be made in this way, customers are advised
            to continue attending post offices for payment of benefit following the encashment of the last payment
            foil in their book.

            (a)    Periodicity of payment

                   Where possible the customer will continue to be paid at the usual frequency i.e. at the rate
                   (generally weekly or four weekly) shown on the order book. The paying clerk stamps one box for
                   each payment made, with the customer being required to confirm receipt of the payment by
                   signing a schedule.

            (b)    Rate of Payment

                   Where possible the customer will continue to receive their correct entitlement to benefit. The
                   normal amount paid is ascertainable from infonnation printed on the front cover of the order
                   book. The rate of benefit payable may however be adjusted by authorised staff at a BA office with
                   the adjusted rate being marked in an 'adjustment box on the back cover'

            (c)    Receipt of renewal book

                   When a renewal order book is received at a post office it is issued to the customer in exchange for
                   the expired order book. The details of payments made during the emergency period are examined

            Tbcrc arc arrangements with local authorities which enable them to make interim payments to BA
            customers in an emergency. This is cxpcctcd to provide a short-term solution in cases of real need
            pending BA bringing its own emergency payment arrangements into action. The authority claims
            reimbursement by forwarding completed application forms which act as the customer's
            acknowledgement of receipt of the payment

            The batch of applications is checked to ensure that the amount claimed is the total of the payments
            made. The application forms are then filed and retained for eighteen months and where necessary
            overpayments are considered for rccoveiy.

            A long term loss of access to this system action will be the same as above except that staff arc not
            advised to resist making payment unless serious risk will occur.


3.4         Arca Computer Centres (ACC)

            The complete long term loss of a system is an extremely remote because benefit applications arc housed
            between the 4 ACCs. If an application fails within one ACC then that system's backup tapes arc sent to
            an alternative ACC until ncccssary repairs have been made.

            It is more likely that local access to an application may be lost and in this event measures arc taken to
            establish the cause of the loss. Local office management then refer to the options available to them and
            detailed within section 2 (Local Disasters).


4.          DISRUPTION TO POSTAL DELIVERY AND COLLECTION SERVICES

            A disruption to Royal Mail delivery and collection scrviccs will have a substantial effect primarily on the
            IOP issuing centres i.e. the ACCs.


4.1         Areas of Impact


4.1.1       Payment Issuing Offices

            The collection of outgoing girocheques, order books and customer notifications from ACCs, and payable
            orders from NFCO and their subsequent delivery to customers will be affected. Additionally, dependent
            on the nature and scale of the disruption, all mail normally issued from a local office may be affected.

            The courier services which normally operate between ACCs local offices and ES offices will however
            continue. This service can be used to send outgoing mail, which would normally be sent through the
            postal system, from the ACCs and NFCO to the local offices.

            Output B1111dling

            The ACCs and NFCO have three main options available for handling their output in the event of any
            disruption in the postal service:




                 3.   a combination of the above, retaining some output and delivering that with priority status by
                      alternative means.

            Usually ACCs are directed to retain output during the initial stages of any disruption, pending
            alternative means of delivery being found for (in order of priority):

              1.       IOPs·
             .2:       navment stoo an1 C'lnccllatinn notices·
              3. .     other customer notifications.

4.1.2        Local Offices (LO)

            The impact on local offices is felt in numerous areas. In order to maintain ll reasonable level of customer
            service local offices may do all or some of the following:


                                                     ts for IOPs within the office·
                             for staff deliveries of IOPs to those customers who arc unable to collect th

5.          CROWN POST OfflCE DISRUPTION

            If the service provided by a Crown post office is disrupted customers arc advised to use a nearby sub post
            office.


5.1         Post Office Action

            POCL will immediately arrange for:

                 .L        customers to have the facility to cash order books normally payable at Crown offices at
                                                                       normal chan           nTn,-i,imes·

            BA customers will be informed which sub-office will hold any order books awaiting collection during
            the dispute, and which offices they may use for encashmcnt purposes. Initially customers arc able to cash
            their books at any of the specified sub-offices without being required to follow the normal change of
            office procedures. This position may change if the disruption at the Crown office is long-term. Any
            change in procedures is determined by agreement bctwccn POCL and BA.


5.1.1       Order Books bsued During the Disruption

            At the outset of the dispute the BA Emergency Co-ordination Team liaises with POCL and the local
            office to establish which sub-office is to receive the redirected order books. When this has been agreed,
            BA advises the relevant ACCs so that any new order books may be redirected to the specified sub-office.

            POCL is responsible for ensuring that if any mail has been sent from the ACCs (before the above
            decision has been made or communicated) to the affected Crown offices during the dispute it is retrieved
            and redirected to either:

                 I.       the socci.fied sub oost office for collection and cncashmcot;
             ·2.          returned to the aooronriate local DSS office·
              3.          returned to the appropriate Central Benefit Unit (which issues order books relating to centrally
                          administered benefits e.st Child Benefit).

5.. 2        Local Office Action

            Should an order book become 'trapped' at a Crown post office the local office is responsible for issuing a
            rcplac:cment order book to the custopicr at a specified sub post office. If the customer is unable to get to
            this office then four options are open to the local office:

             dlH\ to a               with the customer that            can wait until the conclusion of the

6.           FAILURE OF DEPARTMENTAL CENTRAL INDEX

            The Departmental Central Index (DCI) is a national c:omputcr system which stores certain personal and
            benefit related infonnation of UK residents who have been allocated a National lnsurancc number.

            If DCI fails payment of benefit is not affected immrtliatcJy, however after a short period of time benefit
            payment related problems emerge.

            To avoid this situation a contingency plan is in cxistc:nce. In summary this entails a standby backup DCI
            system at a remote location which is updated with daily live journals from the main DCI system. In the
            event of the main system failing, the standby system is upgraded so that the information contained on it
            is that which was on the main system at the time of failure. Once updated, the network connections are
            enabled and all user access is switchrtl to the standby system. It is required that this transition roust be
            completed within 72 hours, to ensure a continuation of normal service levels.


7.          FAILURE OF AREA COMPUTER CENTRE COMPUTER SYSTEMS

            In the event of failure at one or more of the 4 ACCs contingency planning switches IOP production to a
            remote ACC even to the extent that payment requests can be collected from machines in all 4 ACCs and .
            tOPs produced centrally at one.

             In common with BA's IS/IT strategy the aim of the Security Strategy is to deliver good customer service
             alongside value for money by supporting the BA's core business aim of paying the right benefit to the
             right customer at the right time. Part ofBA's remit therefore is to detect. investigate and stop fraud and
             abuse of the benefit process and payment systems.


2.           CURRENT BENEFIT SERVICE FRAUD RISK

             The DSS employs a number of staff engaged in formulating security policy and strategy. Additionally
             numbers of operational investigators conduct the investigation of suspected fraud and (together with
             Solicitors Branch) any subsequent prosecution of offenders. Despite the success enjoyed by these staff,
             the mainly tactical. reactive and organisational measures carried out by the investigators currently
             perform a containment function only.

             Fraudulent attacks on the benefit system can be categorised into four types and relative magnitudes
             attnouted from the current estimated total stock of fraud - illustrated in the table below. Additionally,
             this table shows the areas in which future risk, subject to negotiation, may be transferred to the Service
             Provider.

2.1          Definition of Fraud

            Within each type of fraud risk outlined above, there may be areas of greyness relating to the definition of
            an act as fraudulent. There are primarily four definitions covering acts which have resulted in the
            obtaining of a benefit payment to which there is no entitlement:

             1.     Fnud                   an act motivatt.d by a deliberate intent to obtain benefit to which the customer
                                           knows they are not entitled. In this category benefit is gcncrally obtained through
                                           a mislqnesentation of facts which may be:
                                                          (a)    premeditated or planned fraud on a large or small scale;
                                                          (b)    opportunistic fraud resulting from an unreported change
                                                                 in personal circumstances.

3.           VISION

             The vision for the future is of a secure benefit dclivcty system, administered by staff for whom security
             consciousness is an integral part of their worlc and behaviour, on behalf of an organisation for which
             security is a central focus, for customers who understand and aa:cpt their rights and rcspoDS1bilities.

             1n order to attain this objective the following need to be achieved:

             (a)      security has to be integrated within the wider context of the BA operation, enabling and
                      supporting better customer SCIVicc and value for money;

             (b)      the cod-to-end benefit delivery p ~ have to be made secure at all points so that, in the
                      future, the security focus shifts from detection to prevention and dcterrcncc; and

             (c)      three distinct groups of people;

             •        Staff;

             •        Customers; and

             •        Business Partnets

            must have confidence in the integrity of the benefit system.

            A key factor in the achievement of the above objectives relates to the behaviour of the three groups
            identified above, so that:

            (a)       staff have the motivation and pos~ the skills to identify, prevent and pursue fraud, whilst
                      maintaining and developing a professional service to customers;

            (b)       customen arc confident that benefits are going to the right people at the right time, in the right
                      amounts; acc:cpt that they must comply with existing regulations in their applications for benefit,
                      recognising equally their rights and responsibilities; and

            (c)       business partnen of BA are identified, and co-operative partnerships developed.


4.          STRATEGY

            The Security strategy encompasses a series of integrated but distinct projects which over a period of five
            years will move BA significantly closer to achieving the vision and a reduction in losses through fraud.
            The five year programme will encompass:

        THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
           STRATEGY STATEMENT OF THE BENEFITS AGENCY

l.           INTRODUCTION


l. 1        Primary Function

            The primary function of BA is to deliver benefits in accordance with the law and to the satisfaction of
            ministers and customers. The aim of BA is to fulfil this function economically, efficiently and effectively
            with due regard to the varying needs of its customers.


1.2         Objective

            The objective of the IS/IT Strategy is to provide the framewotk for planning the enhancement and
            development of information systems to support BA1s business aims, objectives and core values for the
            next 10 years or more.


1.3         Content

            This appendix provides a high level and concise statement of the BA's business vision, strategic aims
            and objectives, and show how they in tum define the IS Strategy and the necessaiy IT support.


2.          BUSINESS VISION


2.1         One Stop Service

            BA's vision is to provide an efficient "one stop" benefit service that offers reliable advice and pays the
            right money to the right person at the right time. The vision will be delivered in accordance with the
            four core values:

            (a)    customer service;

            (b)    value for money,

            (c)    bias for action;

            (d)    caring for staff.

            BA seeks to achieve this by providing a customer centred service delivered in an environment which
            encourages innovation and excellence and is administered in an accurate, secure and cost effective way.

            Custo~ will be provided wth more choice: BA will dfer flexibility in how, where and when
            customers make contact; customers will have the choice of how they arc paid and how they make their
            claims.

             This choice will be given by motivated, well trained and skilled staff through processes that allow
             flexi"bility but ensure that security, accuracy and integrity of information are maintained.


2.2          Strategic Business Objectiva

             This Business VISion defines a number of strategic business aims and objectives, which are summarised
            as:

            (a)    deliver benefits promptly and accurately;

             (b)   deter, prevent, detect and investigate internal and external fraud;

            (c)    improve customer service by the successful delivery of a One Stop Service;

             (d)   improve quality by getting payments right first time and asking for information from customers
                   only once;

            (e)    develop systems with the tlexi"bility to support local needs; ministerial and policy requirements;
                   and cbangjng work patterns and organisational structures;

            (f)    provide staff with the tools, training, support and motivation to achieve a recognised standard of
                   excellence in a demanding but satisfying environment;

            (g)    provide best value for money and drive out inefficiencies in both administrative and programme
                   expenditure.


3.          ~/IT STRATEGY

            Information Systems and the supporting Information Technology are key enablers to the achievement of
            BA's ~ aims and objectives.


3.1         Strategy

            The strategy recognises that there will be a continuing need to enhance existing systems and respond to
            legislative and ministerial requirements. Changes to support the future business of BA must therefore be
            evolutiOilal}', rather than revolutioll81j'.

            Set in the context of Agency business strategies such as the Security Strategy, Market Testing and
            Personnel, the IS/IT strategy seeks to move BA forward by providing IS/IT support that:

            (a)    makes advice and infonnation more readily accessible to staff and customers;

            (b)    m~ towards more consistent benefit processing systems;

            (c)    exploits more modern and secure methods of payment;

            (d)    bears down on fraud and abuse;

            (e)    improves financial controls and management information;

            (f)    provides the services and tools that staff need to support them.

                                                   IS/IT Strategy



3. t. l      Advice and Information

             Systems will be implemented which provide benefit advice and information. Initially available to staff to
             support them in their contact with customers. some of the functionality, such as data input and advice
             seeking, may over time become directly available to customers thcmselvcs. This supports the customer
             service core value, and the business objectives ofimproved customer service and support for staff.


3.1.2        Common Information

             Separate benefit systems will gradually be migrated to benefit processing systems built with generic
            modules which can be easily replicated. They will be built on a common repository for all customer
            information, and a common repository for all payment details. This supports customer service, bias for
            action, and value for money core values, and the business objectives of improved customer service,
            flexible systems, value for money, and fraud prevention and detection.


3. 1.3       Methods of Payment

            New methods of payment will be introduced, which provide more modem and secure instruments of
            payment than existing paper based systems, offering benefits to both customers and BA. This supports
            the customer service core value, and the business objectives of improved customer service, prompt and
            accurate benefit payment, and fraud prevention and detection.


3.1.4        Fraud and Abwe

            Existing systems to detect and prevent fraud and abuse will be extended, and focus on allowing BA to be
            more proactive in recognising patterns of fraud and effectively targeting resources to combat it. This
            supports the value for money core value, and the business objective offraud prevention and detection.


3.1.5       Management Information

            Management information will be enhanced and systems will be developed to improve financial control,
            accountability and resource management. This supports the bias for action core value, and the value for
            money core value and business objective.


3.1.6       Communications

            A range of communications, administrative, and support systems will be introduced to increase the
            efficiency and cffcctivcness of all staff. This supports the value for money, bias for action. and caring
            for staff core values, and the business objectives of flexible systems, support for staff. and value for
            money.


3.1. 7      Common lnfrutnicture

            These systems will be supported by a common infrastructure and, eventually, a single workstation per
            desk which will also provide the platform for enhanced local services, including personal productivity
            tools. This supports the value for money and caring for staff core objectives, and the business objectives
            ofsystem flexibility, support for staff. and value for money.

3.1.8        Secure Accountable Framework

             This must all be achieved within a framework that ensures systems are secure, maximise the detection
             and prevention of fraud, provide full benefit accounting information, and provide a common look and
             feel through the use of uniform screens and dialogues. This supports the value for money and caring for
             staffcore objectives, and the business objectives offlexible systems, staffsupport, and value for money .


3.2          The IS/IT Strategy Framework

             The IS/IT Strategy sets out the business, technical and managerial framework to achieve these
             objectives. The main elements of the framework are as set out below:

             (a)   all IS developments will be b ~ driven, will be determined by the business strategy and will
                   fit with the BA strategic direction;

             (b)   developments will build upon the existing systems and consist of an evolutionary approach to
                   change;

             (c)   all developments will be built in a secure manner, ensure secure benefit delivery, contain
                   comprehensive audit trails, and ensure full administrative and programme accountabilitr,

             (d)   developments will conform to agn:ed technical standards, and run on a common infrastructure
                   built of strategic components;

             (e)   IT developments will comply with common data standards, be built with generic components and
                   have a common look and feel;

             (f)   all inv~ent in IT systems will be spent in accordance with this strategic framework;

             (g)   the management and control of the IS/IT Strategy and the consequent work programme will be by
                   a series of processes and procedures owned by BA Management Team (BAMI) and agreed and
                   operated through its sub-committee BASCIS and the business areas concerned.


3.3          Implementation of the IS/IT Strategy


            The delivery of the IS/IT Strategy will be by the implementation of an agreed and co-ordinated work
            programme, which integrates the IS/IT requirements of BA business strategies and encompasses all
            IS/IT projects within BA.

            A 10 year programme sets out the IT developments needed to achieve the strategic aims and objectives.
            This long term programme and associated strategic business case are supplemented by a detailed 1-3
            year implementation plan and business case that are rolled forward on an annual basis. These also
            inform the current years work programme, at any given time, feed into the strategic planning process,
            and act as the base environment for negotiating resources with Treasury through the PES process.

            The programme will be implemented and adapted within the constraints of:

            (a)    the need to provide a continuous uninterrupted service;

            (b)    the need and desire to conform to legal obligations;

            (c)    the availability of reso~;

            (d)    operational priorities.

                           DSS COMMON AUDIT TRAIL MODEL

1.           INTRODUCTION

             The DSS bas in place an agreed Common Audit Trail model. The standards imposed by this model are
             controlled by the Departmental IT Security Group.

            The DSS IT Security Standards (ITSS) require IT systems to provide an audit trail. It is a requirement
            that the service operate in conformance with these standards which are reinforced by the legislative
            requiiemcnt imposed by:

             •     The Data Protection Act 1984; and

            •      The Computer Misuse Act 1990.


1.1          Audit Tnil Objectives

            The primary purpose for maintaining audit trails is one of accountability. Agencies must be able to show
            that their business is conducted with fiscal propriety and in conformance with the law and relevant
            Government policies. In the case of IT applications this requircmcnt is reinforced by: the Departmental
            IT Security Standards (DITSS) and the legal rcquircmcnts contairu:d in relevant legislation (e.g. Data
            Protection and Computer Misuse Acts).


1.1.1       IT Transactions

            IT transactions arc of a transitory nature and the IT audit trail may be the only way open to agencies to
            demonstrate propriety, conformance to the law and to police its operations. The audit trail should
            provide the means to establish the event or events which have led to questions arising as to the propriety
            or legality of a transaction, or the compromising of the integrity or confidentiality of any system or data.
            It should also be the means by which an agency can prove that it bas petformed certain specific
            transactions. (The word transaction as used here means a set of consecutive actions, normally between a
            user and the IT system, which results in access or a change to data held on the system).


1.1.2       Retention and Retrieval of data

            The Common Audit Trail Model defines the minimum requircmcnt for data retention and retrieval
            issues. This requirement applies to all systems which hold, process or provide access to personal data or
            which issue payments of benefit.


1.1.3       Management Information

            There may be other uses for the data collected in connection with audit trail purpo~. It may be used to
            provide management information statistics or to collect or substantiate financial control data.

                                          DSS Common Audit Trail Model



1.2.1        Agency Tuks

            The objectives defined in chapter 1.1 map onto identifiable tasks which the agencies either must, or may
            be required. to perform. They include:

             (a)   identification ofa user who has carried out a suspect transaction (i.e. one suspected of breaching
                   confidentiality or integrity;

             (b)   examination of transactions carried out by a specified user;

             (c)   examination of all transactions carried out on individual accounts;

             (d)   provision of supporting evidence in relation to criminal or civil proceedings;

            (e)    provision and support (through security checking and other forms of analysis of audit trails) of a
                   means of detecting and deterring iotemal fraud or abuse, or of providing assurance in relation to
                   levels of iotemal fraud or abuse;

            (f)    provision of protection to individual users (i.e. the identification of one officer breaching
                   confidentiality or integrity rules in a case where another officer has prima facie responsibility);

            (g)    provision of information to assist in the resolution of administrative queries relating to an
                   individual customers account and ensure that proper action bas been taken.

            Where developments involve direct customer intcrfa.ce with systems, audit trails take on a greater
            significance.


1.2.2       Relevant Transactions

            The requirement for audit trails is to retain details of user and other transactions necessacy to support the
            tasks outlined in section 1.2.1. Relevant transactions comprise user activity leading to any of the
            following:

            (a)    a change to personal data;

            (b)    access to personal data;

            (c)    access to records held for security management purposes;

            (d)    the issue or prevention of issue of a payment;

            (e)    the recording of a returned payment;

            (f)    the issue, or suppression of the issue, of a notification to a customer;

            (g)    the setting-up or deletion of customer accounts.

            A user transaction with one system may result in changes to data held on another system or involve
            ~ to data held on another system. The requirement is that the causes and effects of a suspected
            breach of system integrity or confidentiality can be established with certainty even where these take
            place through different systems which interface with one another.

1.2.3        System Output (excluding payments)

            In addition to output to a user's VDU, system output may be: by printed report, electronically to other
            systems or by other means. Wbcrc this output contains customer related information, or data produced
            for the purposes of controlling system security, the circumstances surrounding its production (or in
            certain circumstances, suppression) must be written to the audit trail. This requirement may be modified
            in the case of routinely generated reports.


1.2.4       System Output: Payments

            There is a general need, consistent with an agency's accountability objectives, to prove (or refute) the
            issue of specific payments or instructions to pay. An agency may also routinely provide witness
            statements relating to the issue of payments for use in prosecution cases.


1.2.5       Data Retrieval

            Retrieval of audit trail data (or sets of data) must be in an agreed format and context This format should
            be consistent with supporting the various uses to which audit trails may be put.


1.2.6       Audit Trail Integrity

            The integrity of audit trails must be assured. This requirement follows from the overall accountability
            objective and from the implications for individual system users of the various uses to which audit trails
            maybe put.


2.          SCOPE

            This model applies to all IT systems holding or processing customer information or issuing benefit
            payments.


3.          RELEVANT TRANSACTIONS


3.1         Transactions

            The audit trail must record all transactions leading to:

                 I.       Ol1lpUt of all or part of a customer record (this docs not include the output of routine reports, such as
               .. Hi reoortsfor              information);

3.1.2       Payments

            NB. The issue of a payment is itself a transaction which must be recorded whether or not directly
            prompted by user action.


4.          INFORMATION TO BE RECORDED


4.1         User Transactions

            The information required from the audit trail in respect of each relevant user transaction is:

                                          DSS Common Audit Trail Model



6.           RETRIEVAL

             Audit trails should always be aca:sstl>le, by designated users, as printed output. It is also nee:essaiy to
             have automated access to an audit trail to allow local interrogation (via PC) and printing. This output
             may be limited to a period or periods within the 18 month retention span where this is specifir.d by the
             user accessing the audit trail. To support the requirements of both security checking and investigation,
             data should be available by NINO, by user ID, by terminal ID and by office ID. The requirement is that
             the user of audit trail data can either:

             •      start with a specific record (nonnally dcfinr.d by NINO) and establish which user action created
                    or changed a given data item within that record or convcrscly;

             •      establish which data items were input by a particular user, or which records or dialogues a user
                    had accessed

            This requirement appMS equally where more than one system is involved. For example, access may be
            through one system to data held on another, or a change to data on one system may affect data or
            generate output on others.


7.          AUDIT TRAIL SECURITY

            Audit trails in themselves must be secure and should remain inviolate at all times. Information written
            to an audit trail must have a level of security such that it cannot be alterr.d or deleted by anyone with
            access to the system.

     Section I:        Information Systems Strategy Context
1.   The Information Systems Strategy of Post Office Counters Ltd is made up of 2 main
     components:
     •         the Technical Infrastructure, which describes how various pieces of technology
               fit together.
     •         the Applications Portfolio, which describes what systems are required to
               support the mission and vision of the business.
2.   The Technical Infrastructure is described in a separate document held by the
     Information Systems Strategy Unit.
3.   The Applications Portfolio for Post Office Counters Ltd focuses on the underlying
     business processes which will continue to support the operation of our business,
     irrespective of organisational or product detail changes. There are 5 key processing
     areas which make up the core business of Post Office Counters Ltd., known as the
     'Business Value Chain'. They are shown in Diagram I below, together with the key
     data flows that link them together, and comprise:
     •        Clients: who influence the shape of the transaction
     •        Post Offices: which deliver client transactions to customers
     •        Value Added Processing: which allows a small number of clients(< 200) to
              communicate with a large number of Post Offices (> 19 000), and in tum, allows
              the Post Offices to send relevant transaction information back to them.
     •        Distribution: this includes the planning and physical distribution of cash and
              stock across the business, and the balancing of the ' pipeline'.
     •        Financial Administration: which is concerned with the reconciliation of client
              transactions and the settlement of client monies, as well as statutory accounting
              and treasury functions.

     Section II: Post Office Counters Applications Architecture


1.   This document describes the applications architecture which bas been adopted for use
     in Post Offices and devised by the Information Systems Strategy Unit of Post Office
     Counters Ltd. It fonns part of a set of documentation which together descn"be the
     overall Infonnation Systems Strategy for Post Office Counters Ltd. All future systems
     work in Post Offices will comply with the principles outlined in this document.

2.   In addition to this section, the document comprises of the following:

     •    Section III: Sets out the objective of the applications architecture, and describes
          the scope and boundaries of the applications for Post Offices, and summarises
          the applications architecture.

     •    Section IV: Outlines the process that has been adopted in defining the
          architecture

3.   These sections are supported by annexes which bold more detailed infonnation about
     the activities undertaken by Post Offices, high level data entities which need to be
     supported, application descriptions, and data flow diagrams to support them.

     Section 111: The Applications Portfolio for Post Offices
1.   The applications portfolio for Post Offices descnl>es all of the systems which should be
     found in an automated Post Office, together with their key data flows and interfaces.
2.   The Applications Portfolio bas been designed to:
     •     Support the existing lines of business performed by the Post Office, future lines
           of business as identified by the Commercial Strategy of Post Office Counters
           Ltd., and the sub-postmasters private business.
     •     Encourage the use of standard, packaged software wherever appropriate, and
           discourages tightly integrated and inflexible solutions.
     •     Be implemented on industry standard. 'open', hardware and software platforms.
3.   The applications within the portfolio have been summarised into three groupings (or
     tiers) based upon the function that they provide within the Post Office. The three tiers
     are:
     •     Basic Trading Systems: These are the applications which are needed in order to
           transact Post Office business. The Basic Trading Systems are represented by the
           middle tier on the model which can be found in Annex I.
     •     Back Office Processing: These are applications which give administrative
           efficiency to Post Offices. These applications are represented by the top tier on
           the model which can be found in Annex I.
     •     Reporting & M.I.S : These are applications which are needed to report back to
           the Post Office hierarchy (and in some cases Clients), and which enable Post
           Office staff to identify business improvement opportunities. These applications
           are represented by the bottom tier on the model which can be found in Annex I.
4.   The model in Annex I gives a complete picture of all the applications that are
     ultimately required to support a Post Office, together with an indication of the way in
     which they interface with each other. Those applications which require greater
     definition have been amplified in the schedules which appear in Annex Il. These
     include:
     •     Personal Details Capture

     •     In-Pay
     •     Out-Pay
     •     Basic EPOS transaction
     •     Token Management

     •     Purchase Order Management
     •     Information Provision

     •     Stock Management

     •     Staffing
     •     Financial Accounting

                                                                                                 POL00028135




                                                                                         Page5


5.   In addition, the Reporting and M.I.S applications are likely to be delivered through a
     set of data delivery, or EIS tools which cover:
     •     Regular reporting: These are reports that will be delivered through standard
           screen or paper based reporting tools which give the user a limited set of
           parameters to report by.
     •     Story-book reporting: These are screen based reporting tools which generate
           updated information on a regular basis (m text and graphical fonnat), but the
           sequence of the 'reporting pack' is fixed.
     •     'Slice & Dice' reporting: These are screen based reporting tools which allow
           users to view data, or summarise it, in a user definable ~exible way.
     •     Data Driven reporting: These are screen based reporting tools within which
           there is a set of rules, such that the system analyses the data and only reports on
           data which meets the user defined rules (e.g. exception reporting, Top 20,
           changes in contnoution etc.)
6.   Finally, the applications portfolio is a dynamic tool, and will be updated to reflect
     additions, as they become known.

2.   In addition to this introductory section, the document comprises of the following:

     •     Section II: Sets out the objective of the applications architecture, and descnbes
           the scope and boundaries of the applications for Value Added Processing, and
           summarises the applications architecture.

     •     Section III: Outlines the process that has been adopted in defining the
           architecture

3.   These sections are supported by appendices, which hold more detailed information
     about the activities undertaken by the Value Added Processing function, high level
     data entities which need to be supported, application descriptions, and data flow
     diagrams to support them.

                                                                                Page46


Section II: The Applications Portfolio for Value Added Processing

1.    The applications portfolio for the value added processing function describes all
      of the systems which should be found in the function which enables a small
      number of clients to send data to post offices, and in tum passes relevant
      information from post offices to clients. It also descnl>es their key data flows
      and interfaces.
2.    The Applications Portfolio bas been designed to:
      •      Support the primary process of turning post office data into accurate
             and consistent information which can be used to meet the financial,
             costing, marketing, and client requirements of Post Office Counters
             Ltd.
      •      Ensure that where particular functions are not directly managed by Post
             Office Counters Ltd., adequate controls are highlighted and put in
             place.
      •      Encourage the use of standard, packaged software wherever
             appropriate, and discourage tightly integrated and inflexible solutions.
      •      Be implemented on industry standard, 'open', hardware and software
             platfonns.
3.    We have separated the applications contained in the Applications Portfolio into
      three tiers:
      •      Basic Operational Systems - these are the systems that that will perform
             the day-to-day processing and include:
             i)       the data collection systems (such as polling, real time data
                     capture, data keying, and document processing)
             ii)    the data flow matching systems (which ensure that supporting
                    documents and complementary data items are properly
                    matched)
             iii)    data reconciliation systems (such as stock balancing and 'cash
                     account balancing')
             iv)    data delivery systems (which pass the data to internal
                    management information databases, client host systems, and
                    internal accounting systems)
      •      Operational Support Processing - these are the systems which support
             basic operational systems by taking clerical and semi-automated
             activities out of the fully automated cycle. They include systems to
             assist in :
             i)      The maintenance of the standing and reference data
             ii)     The investigation and resolution of errors
             iii)    Calculation of sub-postmasters remuneration
             iv)     Preparation ofledger postings

                                                                                        POL00028135




                                                                               Page 47


            v)      Management of company resources
     •      Reporting and Management infonnation systems - these systems will
            use the operational data to support internal sales, marketing, and quality
            of service reports.
4.   The model in Appendix I gives a complete picture of all the applications that
     are required to support the Value Added Processing function, together with an
     indication of the way in which they interface with each other. Those
     applications which require greater definition have been amplified in the
     schedules which appear in Appendix Il. These include:

     •      Perfonn Data Collection

     •      Perfonn Data Flow Matching

     •      Perfonn Reconciliation
     •      Perfonn Data Delivery

     •      Maintain Standing Data

     •      Error Correction
     •      Perfonn Postmaster Remuneration
     •      Prepare Ledger Postings
     •      Quality of Service

     •      Sales and Marketing
     •      Value Added Reporting
5.   In addition, the Reporting and MIS applications are likely to be delivered
     through a set of data delivery or EIS tools which cover:
6.   Regular reporting: These are reports that will be delivered through standard
     screen- or paper-based reporting tools which give the user a limited set of
     parameters to report by.
     •      Story-book reporting: These are screen-based reporting tools which
            generate updated information on a regular basis (in text and graphical
            format), but the sequence of the 'reporting pack' is fixed.
     •      'Slice and Dice' reporting: These are screen-based reporting tools which
            allow users to view data, or summarise it, in a user-definable flexible
            way.
     •      Data Driven Reporting: These are screen-based reporting tools within
            which there is a set of rules, such that the system analyses the data and
            only reports on data which meets the user defined rules (e.g. exception
            reporting, Top 20, changes in contribution etc.)
7.   Finally, the applications portfolio is a dynamic tool, and will be updated to
     reflect additions as they become known.

Notes:
         Within the definition of 'office'. Post Office Counters Ltd. includes their own Document
         Processing Ccnuc, their OWD Data Preparation Centre, and their own distribution centres which
         send data to the Value Added Processing function

         The list of offices to be polled, together with an indication of the type of data-to be IDOYCd, and an
         appn,ximate sizing of the dala will be provided to the private sector contractor, through the
         st•ocSiq data function which will remain within POCL 's di.n:ct control.

         (Document Processing Centre and Data Prep Centres will need to be polled to pull in the
         transactions read from machine readable code lines, or keyed in, and which complement the
         transactions from post offices and disbibution centres).

         The private sector operator may be rcquircd to send data polled from the offices dirmly to clients,
         in addition to sending it to Post Office Counters Ltd. for further processing. This requirement will
         be confirmed on a client by client basis.

A        Real Time Authorisation: We would expect the design of the authorisation system to be
         sufficiently flexible to suppon:
1.       Batched authorisations being held at nominated post offices, or
2.       Batched authorisations being held centrally within the operators polling system, or
3.       Batched authorisations being held centrally within Post Office Counters Ltd's Value Added
         Processing Systems. or
4.       Authorisations being held in the Client Host Systems.

         The authorisation $')"Slclll must be able to support all of the authorisation methods mentioned
         above. The exact method used for a particular client will be confirmed on a client by client basis.
         However, it must be p0SS1"ble to change the authorisation approach merely by changing the
         location of the authorisation files (and system parameters) but without re-writing the systems.

B.       Data Capture and f\ocnrneot Processing: At present, it is not envisaged that the private sector
         operator will take on the wodc cumnt1y done by POCL' s Data Capture or Document Processing
         units. However, the operator may decide that he requires similar functions to provide

Objectives
      To match transac:tions details obtained from the outlets to relevant data gathered from other
      sourccs and to prc:parc data into a matched form for ledger posting purposes.


Processes

      1.     Transactions. Cash and Stock accepted from outlets arc input to the matching process.

      2.     The following arc matched and c:nors logged :

      •      Outlet transactions arc compared to other data streams, i.e. Doc:umcnt Processing centre
             and Data Pmcessiog Unit

      •      Client authorisations stored at the time of the uansaction arc retrieved and matched
             against the appropriate transaction detail supplied by the outlet

      3.     A file of succ:cssfu1ly matched transactions and transactions not requiring a match is
             cm1tcd and this is delivered to the Prepare Ledger Postings process.

      4.     Misrnarcbcd transactions arc dclivcrcd to the error rcc:onciliation process.

      S.     Unmatched items arc held over so that a further attempt at matching can be made when
             morc data is available.

2.3   Data Entry/ Key Featura

      Data is captured by the use of standard retail peripheral units such as bar-code readers or by data entty by the
      operator.

      The system is designed to ensure that:

               a) data cntty can be made with the minimum nwnbcr of keystrokes.

               b) opc:rators are able to verify any input they have made

               c) for any transaction entered into the system the operator is able to:

                  •      suspend input before completion without losing any data already captured
                  •      resume input to a previously suspended transaction set from the point where it was left
                  •      review any input made previously, whether partially or fully completed
                  •      correct any previous input at any stage prior to the generation of the weekly office summary
                  •      cancel an individual transaction within a transaction set
                  •      access data for the previous week on screen or to print, without the ability to amend

            the customer is no longer able to act for themselves, on their behalf by someone authorised to act for
            them. Additionally in some circumstances the DSS can appoint an agent or appointee to act on behalf of
            a customer.

            start of any claim to benefit of the post oflic:e at which they wish to rcccivc payment of that particular
            benefit. The nomination of post office is per benefit, customers rccciving more than one benefit c:urrent1y
            have the option to nominate different post offices. IOPs subscqucntly issued to customers will be made
            payable at the post office so Jlfflllioated lo the case of order books the vast majority are actually issued to
            that post oflic:e for custODICI' collection.


3.1         Temporary Change of Post Office

            Customers are currently given the facility to make up to two encashmcnts during the life of any
            individual order book at a post office other than their home post office. This service is offered primarily
            to cater for periods when customers may be away from home for short periods e.g. when they are on
            holiday.


3.2         Permanent Change of Post Office

            Customers also bave the facility to permanently change the post office at which they wish to receive
            payments of benefit:

                     during the life of a claim there is a mechanism referred to as a PSOMA procedure by which the
                          office of        cot can be chan
                     at the initial stages of a repeat claim to benefit customers can elect to have their benefit paid at a
                     different       office to the one used them in a revious claim.

3.3.1        Temporary Change of Post Office

            Customers are able to rcc:eive two payments of benefit away from their home post office. Counter clerks
            at the foreign post office, on realising that the book presented is not normally cashed at their office,
            examine the inside front cover of the book. In partic:ular they examine the boxes (a) and (b) to see if the
            temponuy agent proc:edwc bas already been used. If one or both of these boxes are empty then this
            facility is still available to the cu.runner. Standard proc:cdurc:s are followed and in addition the counter
            cletk imprints the post office autbcnticatfon stamp in box (a) or (b).

            Once all the above checks have been made the standard payment procedure is followed. If boxes (a) and
            fl:>) have both been date stamped and the customer still requires payment they must request a permanent
            change of post office.


3.3.2       Permanent Change of Post Office

            In order to achieve a permanent change of post office of encashment the customer must follow a defined
            procedure. They arc required to complete a form P80MA, an example of which is shown at figure 5:.
            The DSS may, for security or admiDistrativc reasons choose to restrict the customer's ability to encash
            their book at one post office only. All restricted order books arc endorsed on the front cover with "No
            change of Post Office allowed".

            This form is obtained from the 'new' post office, completed by the customer and returned to the DSS,
            via the post office, for their information. Counter cletks then complete the post office address details in
            manuscript in box (c) of the inside front cover of the order book (see Figure 4) and in confirmation of
            the change of post office imprints his authentication stamp in box (d) of the inside front cover (see
            Figure 4). Additionally the counter clerk amends the post office and, if appropriate, the customer address
            details on the front cover (see Figure 3).

                             EXISTING OUTPUT HANDLING DEADLINES

1.          INTRODUCTION

            The majority of Instruments of Payment (IOP) and customer notifications (including order book pick-up
            notices) arc currently produced at four Arca Computer Centres (ACC) located throughout the UK. These
            arc presently managed by the Service Delivery clement of ITSA (this function is currently the subject of
            an outsourcing exercise ["FOCUS 95'")). Generally each ACC houses a number of benefit applications
            and provides a service for a number of specified DSS local offices. Some benefit applications (e.g. Child
            Bendit) arc however currently housed in their entirety at ODe ACC. The negotiated output handling
            deadJincs apply to each benefit application no matter where it is housed These deadlines di1fer both
            between and within applications the reason for these di1ferenccs arc dependent primarily on:

1.1         Deadlines

            The tables below show, by benefit application, the relevant existing agreed output handling deadlines.
            Each of which arc the subject of audit trails and management information. The tables show the
            following information:




                                                                                                         service.

1.2         Delivery Addreues for Order Books and Girocbeques

            There arc three types of address to which ACCs may issue order books or girocheques:

            (a)         a post office nominated by the customer at which the IOP is held for their collection (this option
                        is available only for Order Books)

            (b)         the customers home address

            (c)         a DSS I>mrict Office for a,llcction by or onward isme to t h e ~-

            Each payment award notified to the ACC by the Benefit Systems contains a dispatch code which dictates
            the address to which the IOP is dispatched. The decision as to the choice of the delivcJ}' address is
            primarily the customer's, however in some instances (for security or administrative reasons) the DSS
            can dictate to which address IOPs will be issued.

                     BENEFIT PAYMENT SERVICES - VOLUMES
1.          INTRODUCl10N

            This appendix provides information and rclewnt volumes relating to matters associated with the benefit
            payment service currently offered by the Contracting Authorities. The intention is to provide prospective
            Service Providers with:

            {a)    background information, allowing the Service Providers to obtain a view as the scale of the
                   bc::nefit payment service teqUircd in terms of customers and complexity (Section 3 Customers and
                   Bcndits);

            (b)    the vol~ of Instruments of Payment and subsequent relevant benefit payment transactions
                   generated by the existing benefit payment service {Section 4 Benefit Payments);

            (c)    indicative forecasts relating to the antic:ipatcd scale of the benefit payment service in the future
                   {Section S Future Volumes);

            {d)    existing enquiry dialogue ~ generated by customer or staff action within the existing
                   benefit payment system {Section 6 Enquiiy dialogue Volumes).


2.          BUSINESS VOLUMES

            The Business volumes outlined in the following sections are intended to give an overall context for the
            Bendit Payment Service. They are by definition, subject to significant change over time due to a wide
            range of factors such as legislative imperatives {e.g. the introduction of new benefits) and operational
            changes {e.g. the introduction of new methods of payment). The Service Provider should therefore, in no
            way, take the following volumes to be definitive or guaranteed levels of business.


3.          CUSTOMERS AND BENEFITS

            The DSS currently administer the payment of more than 30 individual benefit types which are grouped
            under some 19 generic benefit groups. The exact number and types of benefits payable, together with the
            numbers of customers to whom they arc payable, are subject to frequent change as new benefits are
            introduced or old benefits withdrawn. The introduction or withdrawal of benefit types may be further
            complicated by the fact that not all customers may be simultaneously affected by a change. As an
            example Disability Living Allowance {introduced in April 1992) took over all previous Mobility
            Allowance customers but only some Attendance Allowance customers (those aged under 65). The
            picture is further complicated by the fact that many customers arc in simultaneous rcccipt of more than
            one bendit. The present benefit system docs not generate individual customer accounts, relevant
            management information is therefore difficult to obtain.


3.1         Bendit Types

            The table below (Figure 1) lists the generic benefit groupings and provides indicative numbers of
            customers per benefit group. This information is illustrative only, having been obtained as a 'snapshot'
            of the customer base in August 1994. The table also provides an indication of the numbers of customers
            ~ bcnc:fit grour who receive their benefit paymrnts by either order book or girochequc. It mu.irt be
            stressed that customers may be in rcccipt of more than one benefit simultaneously and that no account of
            this overlapping bas been taken when compiling these figures.

            The estimated customer base for calendar year 1993 is shown below in Figure 2 to provide indicative
            figun:s in rdation to the possible numbers of card-carrying customers. The numbers will change over
            time doe primarily to economic factors. In addition the relative use of automated credit transfer can be
            expected to increase.

            The, nt:.mbers above represent the estimated cascload at any one time. Due to the fact th.9• som~
            customers will claim intermittently, numbers of card holders may be somewhat higher than those
            eligible to collect benefit at post offices (25,100,000 in the above table).

            The nmnber of new customers notified to CMS/ PAS will clearly be at its highest during the initial roll-
            out period and will, to a large extent, be dependent on the Service Provider's proposals.


3.2.1       Changes to Cmtomer'a Personal Detail,

            During the life of their claims to benefit customer's personal details may change. Some of these changes
            may be relevant to their payment of benefit. others may not. The Service Provider should note that not
            all change information will be passed on to them. For example in the case of changes relating to
            customers who are not paid by the card-based method of payment.

            The cmrent levels of changes to relevant personal details a.re as shown below in F,pre 3. through to

            The Service Provider should note that 3,300,000 of these change of address notifications originate from
            the National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) and are not, in general, limited specifically to benefit
            recipients. A Dead Letter Office (DLO) address is one which the DSS held as the customer's address
            following a claim to benefit, however there is information available (e.g. an unsucccssful attempt to
            make a home visit) which indicates that the customer is no longer resident.

4.2          Benefit Payment Transactions - Order Books

             This section deals with current volumes of benefit payment transactions relevant to this procurement i.e.
             those conducted at post offices where the method of payment is by order book or girochcque. In 1993/94
             over 90% of all such benefit payment transactions conducted at post office counters was order book
             based (this calculation excludes associated payment transactions such as Welfare Food tokens,
             Christmas bonus payments etc.).


4.2.1        Transactions by Benefit Type

             The table at Figure 1 shows the relationship between benefit types and benefit group nwnbcrs. Figures
             10 and 11 below illustrate the number of benefit payment transactions which occurred in 1993/94 in
             respect of each type of benefit.

            will occur due to the nature of the benefit process. For example, Cold Weather Payments are issued in a
            locality if the temperature, as measured at the local weather station, falls below certain levels for a
            specified period of time. There are a total of 3.3M customers who are deemed to be eligible for Cold
            Weather Payments. The maximum nmnbcr of additional payments (throughout the UK) in one -week is

            The Service Provider should note that transactions associated with payment by order book, such as
            payment of Christmas Bonus, do not currently affect overall numbers of transactions since they are

            The existing benefit payment service does not provide a detailed breakdown of 'fotcign • (those made
            away from the nominated post office) or 'casual agency' (those where payment is rcceiwd by an ad hoe

4.3         Benefit Payment Transactions - Girocbeques

            Girocheques comprise between 9°/o and 10% of all benefit payment transactions at post offices made
            during the year 1993/94.


4.3.1       Urgent Payments

            Clerically issued girocbeques arc often (though not always) used as the medium to provide for urgent
            and/or one-off payments to be made to customers. SCIVice Providers should be aware that an indicative
            worst case scenario for the number of urgent payments per year can be assessed from the level of
            clerically issued girochcques per year. The figures below are per annum:




                                                                                             700 000

4.4         Order Book and Girocbeque Post Office Notifications

            Within the existing benefit payment sCIVicc proc:csscs a post office notification procedure (designed to
            prevent the encasbment ofan IOP and called a 'Stop' notice) may be used both to:

            •         revise entitlement to or re-rate payments due to changes in customer circumstance; and

            •         stop lost and stolen order books and Girochcques.

            In the former process a notification is also sent to the customer requesting that they return their order
            book, and stating the reason The overall use of this mechanism is highly dependent on the
            characteristics of eacb benefit. Income Support, which is a volatile be:ocfit, has a high percentage of stop
            notices issued in respect of all IOPs that it issues whilst Retirement Pension, a relatively stable benefit,
            has far lower levels. The table below gives indicative percentages of Stop notice issues against IOP
            issues:

            The percentages imply that. of approximately 50 million order books and 20 million giroc:hcqucs within
            the above survey (it excludes 70 million Unemployment Benefit girochequcs). around 3 million are
            stopped. Of that 3 million, reported order book loss is approx:imatcly 300,000 per annum. Various
            intemal DSS reports indicate that the actual level of loss may be higher than this The Service Provider
            should also note that. of the SO million order books issued, at least 10.2 million are rcc:alled for various
            reasons. If there is no response to the recall notice within six days. a stop notice is issued to the post
            office.

            A new card-based MOP should enable benefit staff to make revisions to future payments without
            necessarily recalling an issued lnst:rament of Payment. Thcrcfore the volumes of stops received by PAS
            should be considerably lower than cmrcnt levels.

            Some of the current losses of order books and girocheques are due to the fact that they have value in
            themselves and are therefore attractive items to potential fraudsters. It is anticipated that any future card
            or token would have no inherent value, as a result overall losses should correspondingly be somewhat
            lower.

6.2         Enquiry dialogues

            The information provided below shows indicative volumes relating to the number of occasions on which
            enquiry dialogues were accessed during the year 1993/94 and an indication of the numbers and types of
            the most common form of accesses via these dialogues.

            In a future automated benefits payment system some of these enquiries, subject to negotiation, may
            require access to data held on the Service Provider's computer systems. The number and nature of such
            enquiries will depend on the nature and scope of the service provided. Potential Service Providers should
            assess for themselves the likely number and nature of enquiries they may expect to have to deal with.
            The following information is provided only for guidance.

            Information related to enquiry dialogue accesses is collated based on the 14 most used dialogues within a
            year. The tables below therefore refer only to relevant (i.e. enquity) dialogues which amongst the 14
            most used dialogues logged, per benefit system, during the year 1993/94.

                     SECURITY POLICY

                                 FOREWORD


POCL's systems for processing information are becoming more complex and
are subject to new and changing risks with the introduction of new technology
and new business services to clients and customers. The value of information is
growing rapidly as businesses depend increasingly on up-to-date facts about the
environment in which they are operating, within POCL and outside. The need
for adequate security protection of our assets is more important than ever.
However, we must ensure our security is efficient and reliable while being
provided at acceptable cost.

As new services are introduced, clients are increasingly asking for evidence of
security assurance on information systems and services. To support the
Customer First principle, POCL needs to demonstrate to staff, agents, clients
and customers its commitment to information systems (IS) security.

This document sets out POCL's policy for the protection of its information
assets, including hardware, applications, networks and databases against loss of
any of the following:

       confidentiality
       availability or access to the information
       integrity of the information's content.

Its primary aim is to achieve a comprehensive and consistent approach to IS
security in POCL's operations and business services.

POCL is committed to preserving its reputation for high standards and quality
of service, and preventing the loss of assets.

The Policy therefore requires each business unit and their sub-contractors and
agents to adopt the Post Office Information Systems Security Code of Practice
to implement appropriate measures to protect IS assets commensurate with
relevant business and technology risks.

       incidents.

       This lnfonnation Systems (IS) Security Policy forms part of the overall
       Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL) approach to security and falls within
       the umbrella framework of the Post Office Security Policy.

1.1    What is Information Systems Security?

       Managed effectively, Information Systems (IS) security provides an
       essential component of an enabling mechanism for infonnation
       sharing, which ensures the protection of information and computing
       assets.

       Business is becoming more competitive and customers and clients are
       making more demands in levels of service. Good security will help to
       underpin the availability of information systems to meet the service level
       expectations of customers and clients.

       Increasingly the market trend is towards closer vertical integration of
       POCL's and client systems to meet client needs and win new business.
       To maintain a consistent level of protection for information and
       computing assets from end to end, there needs to be a common
       understanding that the responsibilities for implementing and managing
       security controls must be shared by all parties concerned.

       The infonnation systems security policies of clients, agents and sub-
       contractors must be compatible with those of POCL to protect the
       sharing of information. The same applies to other POCL security
       policies and standards in force.

       Information Systems security management has three basic components:

       Confidentiality:      protecting sensitive information from
                             unauthorised disclosure

      . Integrity:            safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of
                              information and computer software

       Availability:          ensuring that information and vital services are
                              available to users when required

            assurance that POCL's practices properly reflect the policy, and the
            latter is feasible and effective.

            The audit findings of security implementations in POCL's client services
            may be made available to specific clients if appropriate.

      Systems must be independently reviewed to ensure compliance with
      POCL's security policies and standards. The reviews must be carried
      out on a regular basis.

      Each business unit should conduct or sponsor regular reviews of the
      compliance of its systems with POCL's security policies, standards and
      other security requirements.

       The Po.:;t Office Information Systems Security Code of Practice should
       be refe"ed to for guidance when implementing the key controls.

INTRODUCTION



Purpose


The purpose of the Code of Practice is twofold:

•   csumUsbrneot of a baseline with which Post Office Businesses ran implement, develop and
    monitor common and effective information security management practice and proccdnrcs.

•   provision of a global reference standard for inter-business trading, sulH:ontracting and the
    procnremcnt of all Infonnation Systems {IS) services and products.



Focal Point

This Code of Practice is intended as a focal point for use throughout the Post Office by Managing
Directors, Business Systems Directors and employees who arc respons1"ble for initiating,
impJementing and maintaining IS security within their respective organisation.

This publication has been produced by the iT Risk Management Group as the recommended Code of
Practice for the management of Post Office Information Security.

The Code of Practice is based upon the Draft BSI Code of Practice for Information Security
Management provisionally allocated BS7800.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY MANAGEMENT



Introduction


Managing IS security requires the selection and implementation of appropriate security m ~ and
a programme of continuous monitoring and control to ensure an acceptable level of security is
maintained.

This section outlines the strategies each Business should aim to achieve.


Scope


The guidelines enable businesses to quickly assimilate the processes of IS security and ensures a
baseline c:ovcrage across the Post Office. It provides an overview and model of the code of practice for
IS directors, managers and users. The guide enables the reader to quickly appreciate the strategic role
of IS security and its implementation.


Establishing a Baseline Level of Security


The majority of security controls documented arc recommended as good standard practices for all
situations and should provide an appropriate baseline level of security.

•   Information Security Policy
•   Allocation of Security Rcsponsi'bilities
•   Business Contingency Planning
•   Vuus Controls
•   Personnel Information Security Awareness
•   Security Incidents Reporting P r ~
•   Data Protection Legislation
•   Proprietary Software Control
•   Computer Misuse
•   Safeguarding Post Office Records

~ controls are esseutial Uld provide the cornerstone for IS security. Their implementation is,
tbcrcfore, primary in any security infrastructure.

INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURfIY KEY CONTROLS


A number of controls in this Code of Practice arc critical requirements for IS security. These controls,
which are mandatory, apply equally aero~ all Post Office Businesses aru:l environments, forming the
IS security policy for the Post Office:


Post Office IS Security Policy




The Post Office Infomation Systems Security Policy provides general guidance on the allocation of
security roles and rcspoDSll>ilities. However, these should be suppJernCD1M with a more detailM local
interpretation for individual ~usinesses Each Business should explicitly define responsibilities for
individual assets and security processes (e.g. business continuity planning).

To avoid any misurulerstaJUt about respective rcspoDS1l>ilities, it is essential that the areas for
which individual managers arc rcspoDSll>le arc clearly defined.
••••••
M1111oganart Direcaon

Management direction is providM by the Group Technical Policy Committee (GTPC) which ensures
that there is clear management direction and visll>le senior management support for security
initiatives.

The GTPC addresses the following items:

•   Reviewing and approving Post Office IS security policy and responsibilities.
•   Monitoring exposure to major threats to Post Office IS assets.
•   Initiating work to enhance IS.
•   Reviewing the effectiveness of IS security policy, standards and procedures.
•   Approving specific methodologies and processes for IS security (e.g. risk assessment,
    classification system).

lnfomultion Sea,rity Co-ordinotum

A aoss functional security group should be establishM within each Business to initiate and control
the implementation of IS security.

The security group should address the following items:

•   Implementing and supporting Post Office wide IS security policy and initiatives.
•   Implementing and maintaining IS security awareness programmes.
•   Reviewing and monitoring IS security incidents.
•   Agreeing and implementing IS security policy, standards and procedures.
•   Monitoring and reviewing IS security amm.gemcnts to ensure that policy, standards and
    procedures remain relevant
•   Agreeing and implementing specific roles and rcsponsll>ilities for the protection of individual IS
    assets (both physical and information) and for carrying out specific security processes.

Independent review ofIS security.

Implementation of IS security should be indcpendCDtly reviewed.

The Post Office Information Systems Security Policy sets out COIJ>Oratc responsibilities and policy for
IS security. However, each Business should ensure that the practice of IS security is reviewed
independently, through internal or cxtcmal audit teams, to provide assurance that business practices
properly reflect the policy and that the policy and controls arc feasible and effective.

lwkllniew

Business risks and IS sccority management controls should be regularly reviewed to address changing
business rcquircmcnts and priorities.

In overview, the assessment of risk takes into account the following factors:

•        the nature of the business information and systems

•        the business pmposc for which the information is used

•        the environment in which the system is used and operated

•        the protection provided by the controls in place

A risk assessment should identify exceptional business security risks beyond those controlled through
the measures prcscn'bcd by the baseline standard.

Security Responsibilities

Throughout the code of practice and other security guidelines, it is appropriate to suggest a model for
the identification of generic rcspmwbilities throughout the business. The model presented in Fig I
provides a model specifically to indicate the depth and breadth of security administration and policy
review at each clcmcntal stage and to categorise four information system roles.

The following descnbc the key roles and rcspons1bilities of employees with reference to the context of
the ten key security controls applied to the PO business.
Every empl~ coming into contact with any information system whether automated or not, should
adopt the minimum role identified as USER. All the csscntial key controls arc allocated as a guideline
through each identified role. Reference should be made to the key control chapters to the detail
processes involved and required of the role.

As part of the educational and training rcquircmcnt of the IS Security Policy, specific single sheet
leaflets should be produced for each of the IS roles below and distributed to the relevant employees.
The sections below only mention those added responsibilities considered the delegation of the overall
Post Office IS security management policy.


Sponsor

A sponsor is any person who has the role to manager business resources, including information,
strategically. Project sponsors should afford a policy based approach to prescribing IS security.

A sponsor should fimdaroeotaJly act in the following manner with respect information security:

• Encourages
• Endorses
• Progresses

A sponsor should have the key business responsibility for the following key controls:

•   Business Continuity Planning Process
•        Compliance with Data Protection Legislation

A developer is any person who bas the role to advise and construct the mechanisms for information
access using appropriate information technologies. Developer should ensure a system wide approach
to developing products which adhere to a secure and practical ~ practice.

A developer should fundamentally act in the following manner with respect information security:

•   Builds

Business Contingency & Continuity Planning




There must be a business continuity planning process to develop aiut maintain appropriate recovery
plans fro critical business processes and services. The objective of business ccmtinuity planning is to
ensure that the Post Office's critical business activities arc restored anti maintained as quickly as
posS1l>le following any major disaster or failure that a1fccts essential scrvic:cs or facilities.

Business Contingency rcquircmcnts should be prcdctcnnined, co-ordinated, fully up to date, test
proven and regularly reviewed.

A contingency plan is an cmergcncy fallback facility which provides an altcmativc, temporary means
of continuing processing in the event of any damage or failure of equipment.

Information resource and clistnbution managers should ensure that appropriate contingency
arrangements arc established for each IS service.

Contingency rcquirc:ments for individual systems should be specified by the business application
owner, based on a business continuity planning process. Service providers will need to co-ordinate
contingency requirements for shared services, and draw up an appropriate contingency plan for each
service.

Buinas continllity planning process

There must be a managed process in place for developing and maintaining business continuity plans
within each Business and subsicliaiy of the Post Office.

Business continuity planning involves identifying and reducing the risks from deliberate or accidental
threats to vital services. Plans arc developed to enable business operations to be maintained following
failure or damage of vital services or facilities.

The planning process should focus primarily on keeping critical business processes and services
ronning (including sta1f and other non-computing requirements) rather than just focusing on the
contingency arrangements for computer services.

Businas etmtilulity pllllfningframnvork

A consistent framework of business continuity plans should be maintained.

A single framework of corporate plans should be maintained to ensure that all levels of plan arc
consistent, and to identify priorities for testing and maintenance.

Each business continuity plan should need to specify clearly the conditions for activating the plan.
New plans need to be consistent with established emergency procedures (e.g. evacuation plans) and
existing contingency arrangements for computer services, telecommunications and accommodation.

Different levels of plan are required, because each level should have a different focus and may involve
different recovery teams.

The model business continuity plan has four main components:

•   Emergency procedures - which describe the immediate action to be taken following a major
    incident whichjcopardiscs business operations or human life.

•   Contingency proc:cdures - which describe the action to be taken to move essential business
    activities or support services to alternative temporary locations.

•   RccovCIY procedures - which describe the action to be taken to return to nonnal full business
    operations, usually at the original site.

•   Test schedule - which specifies how and when the plan should be tested.

Each lcvd of plan, and each individual plan. should have a specific custodian. Emergency procedures,
manual contingency plans, and recovery plans, are the ~ i l i t y of the appropriate business
p ~ owner. Contingency ammgcmcnts for alternative technical services, such as computers and
communications, are the responsibility of the service provider.



Business Impact Assessments should be performed prior to the creation or development of any
business continuity planning, but the information obtained from them should also be used to ensure
that the degree of risk reduction, acceptance and transfer are appropriate for the system(s) under
review.

Business Impact Assessments identify the individual components required for the performance of
specific business operations and establish the value and criticality of assets and data used within each
function and for the overall processes.

A Business Impact Assessment should be performed, with the aid of specialist advice, prior to and in
conjunction with, or after Risk Assessment However, a joint assessment should always be perfonned
in cases of new installations.

Tating business continllity plans

Business continuity plans should be tested.

Many plans fail when tested - often because of incorrect assmnptions, oversights or changes in
equipment or personnel. The effectiveness of a business continuity plan cannot be determined without
regular testing. Such test also ensure that the plan is fresh in the minds of all members of the
recovery team, and other relevant staff.

A test schedule for the business continuity plan should be drawn up. The schedule should indicate
how and when each element of the plan should be tested.

A phased approach to testing is recommended, based on frequent tests of individual components of
the plan. This ensures that the plan is kept alive and up-to-date throughout the year. It also reduces
the dependency on (less frequent) all-out tests of the full plan.

Up41,ting businus corrturllity plans

Business continuity plans should be updated regularly.

Business continuity plans quickly become out of date because of changes in business or organisation.
Regular updating is essential to protect the investment in developing the initial plan, otherwise the
cffcct:ivcness of the plan should be degraded

Personnel Information Security Awareness


Awareness programmes should be developed to maintain a consistently high understanding of the
need for security. A positive attitude should be engendered throughout the organisation. There must
be an understanding of the need for the identification and aa:eptance of common purposes within
each level

Users must be given adequate IS security and technical training.

Users should rcccivc appropriate training in IS sccmity policies and procedures, including security
requirements and other Business controls, as well as training in the correct use of IS facilities before
access to IS services is granted.

The authority for and scope of their access rights, including any restrictions imposed, must be
formally written.

These measures arc ncccsmy to ensure that security procedun:s arc correctly followed, and to
minimise possible security risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and services
through user error.

This policy should be applied to both Post Office employees and third party users.

Recrvitmmt Seauity

Security should be addressed at the recruitment stage and included in job descriptions and contracts.

Job descriptions should define security roles and respons1l>ilitics.

Applications for employment should be screened if the job involves access to Post Office IS facilities
band)ing sensitive information.

Staff with access to clasmied or sensitive information should be required to sign a confidentiality
undertaking.

Virus Detection and Control




The basis of protection against viruses should be based upon staff awareness. appropriate system
access controls and the following specific guidelines:

•   Users should be reminded that prevention is better than cure.

•   Staff: subcontractors and agents of the Post Office must be required to comply with the Post
    Office Software Policy

•   approved anti-virus software should be used

•   software and data content of systems supporting critical business processes should be rtlgularly
    reviewed. The presence of any spurious files or unauthorised amendments should be formally
    investigated

•   personal software, free or unsolicited software (including games) must never be used

•   all diskettes must be checked for viruses befortl use. Management procedures and rcspoDSioilities
    must be established for the reporting of and recovering from virus attacks

•   procedures of actions to be taken in the event of a virus attack being discovered should be
    developed, documented, known by staff and available for use

•   appropriate recovery arrangements should be established for virus attacks, including all necessary
    data and software back-up facilities.

These measures are espccially important for network file servers supporting a number of workstations.

Protection from Malicious Software




Information resource software is vulnerable to unauthorised modification. A range of malicious
techniques have been developed to exploit this wlnerability, including 'computer viruses', 'network
worms', 'Trojan horses' and 'logic bombs'.

Managers of IS facilities should be alert to the dangers of malicious software and should consider the
need for special measures to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious software. In particular, it
is essential that precautions arc taken to prevent and detect computer viruses on personal computers.

Software Copyright


By virtue of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 a computer program is classed as a 'literary
work' and is thus afforded the protection of t1ic law of Copyright.

Copyright proluoits the unauthorised copying of copyright work, irrcspcrovc of the medium on which
it is held Therefore, if the same software is, (contrary to the terms of licence), installed onto more
than one processor, there will be an infringement of copyright.

It is the rcsponst'bility of each Post Office Business to ensure that its employees do not infringe the
rights of the owner of the copyright software.

Each Business should:

•    comply with the Post Office Computer Software Policy
•    conduct software audits on a regular basis
•    establish and maintain a software purchasing and distn'bution procedure
•    register all software as an asset
•    implement and maintain a software policy
•    implement and maintain a staff training programme on the legal use of software



The increasing dcpcndcncy on computer systems for business and operational solutions makes it
essential that the software deployed on systems can be restored if circumstances demand it.

All system and application software should be backed up in compliance with the system ~
guidelines.

All Systems and application software should have a nominated "owner" which shall be a named
person or group.

Legal Complu,nce

Each Business should take the ncccssazy precautions to avoid risking a breach of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 1988.

The application of approved "off the shelf' software MUST comply with the conditions of the Licence
from the issuing authority. Adequate notice should be posted to warn personnel against the
contravention of the conditions.

Penalties for breach of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 arc particularly severe for
offences concerning software.

Each Business of the Post Office should establish and maintain procedures to ensure compliance with
the relevant UK Legislation and Post Office regulations.

All line managers should ensure that employees arc aware of relevant UK legislation and Post Office
regulations and their responsibility to comply. Additionally, line managers should ensure that staff
arc aware of the disciplinary consequences if legislation or Post Office regulations arc breached.


Breacl,a of Legislation

Any breach of legislation could result in a criminal prosecution being brought against Post Office
employees. Employees who infringe legislation may be guilty of a serious offence under the
Discipline Code and may be dismissed as a result.

elements will be addn:ssed separately. Refer to Fig. 2.

Information Resources


lnfonnation Rcsourccs arc defined as those elements of the corporate infrastructure that offer shared
processing resources as well as shared information repositories containing certain levels of corporate
information.

Information Distriblltion

Information Distnbution is defined as that part of the infrastructure that handles the
intercommunication between applications as well the tr:msmission of information from and to the
information resources. The administration of ac:c:css to all parts of the system is controlled through
this system.

WorkGrollJ1S

Work groups arc defined as local resources enabling users to utilise local processing resources through
workstations or personal and single user applications.



There are specific security processes relevant to users identified in this category relevant to the
temporary assimilation of data.

The IS Distributed Data/Processing Model


The above elements arc combined to institute the distributed data/processing model as represented in
Fig.3.

The model can furnish various configurations i.e. client/server, host based, distributed processing as
well as provide a baseline for all security issues across the businesses no matter what level of
application access, process or data usage is made.

The model dcxribes and rerrcscn:s th-: naturally distrit>.rtcd a-chitecturcs in use by the Post Office
b ~: information resources and work groups can be placed anywhere around the information
distnbution system.

The IS Network & System Models

Information Systems can be represented by the combination of the system model (as the basis of a·
typical application) and the ISO OSI network model By rq,rcscnting each element of an information
system in this way, all the security aspects of the delivery and provision of information pmcessing and
storage can be addressed.

Systems consist of primarily hardware, operating systems, databases (as RDBMS's) and front end
applications and tools. This representation is a generically manageable one because no regard to the
specific problems of interconnectivity and portability need be addressed.

GENERAL IS SECURITY GUIDELINES




Security countermeasures are generally more effective and substantially cheaper when incorporated in
the specification and design of application systems. All security requirements (including the need for
contingency mangemcnts) should be identified, justified, agreed and dor.nmentcd at the
requircmcnts phase of the project as part of the overall business case.

This should also be applied to the processing of business critical and sensitive information through the
use of word processors, da1abascs and sprtadshcds.


Security Requirements Analysis and Specification

An analysis of security requirements should be carried out at the requirements analysis stage of each
development project and before the use of any new software products.

Business requirements statements, compiled through consideration of the infrastructure, for both
new systems and ~bana:ments to existing systems should include rcquircments for secmity controls.

Although such specifications are usually directed at the automated controls to be included in the
system, the poss1l>le need for supporting manual controls should not be overlooked.

These considerations should also be applied when ewloating software packages for business
applications.

Security rcquircments and controls should be based on both the business value of the IS assets
involved, and the potential business impact which could be expected through the absence of security
mechanisms or through failure of countermeasures.

Two aspects which should be borne in mind when analysing the requirements for security are:

•   consideration of the need to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of IS assets

•   identification of opportunities to use different types of controls to prevent, detect and recover from
    major failures or incidents.

In particular, the analysis should consider any need to:

•   control access to IS and services, including any rcquircments to segregate facilities and duties

•   produce audit trails of important events for both routine controls and special investigation
    pwposes, including evidence in contractual or other negotiations

•   verify and protect the integrity of vital data at all or selected stages of processing

•   protect confidential data from unauthorised disclosure, including the possible requirement for the
    use of data encryption in special circumstances

•   comply with regulatory, legislative and contractual requirements

•   take back-up copies of essential business data

•   recover from fail~ cspecially for systems with high availability requirements

•   protect the system against unauthorised amendment or modification

•   enable the system to be operated and used securely by suitably trained non-specialist employees

•   when. apptoptidte, enable the system to satisfy the requirements of the external auditors, such as
    through the use of embedded software routines for sampling, and independent software to repeat
    critical calculations.

Security controls should be explicitly defined in all relevant documentation to safeguard against
inadvertent compromise by IS support staff and users who arc not aware of them


Security in Application Systems



The design and operation of IS systems should attune to generally accepted indusuy guidelines of
good security practice which meet all relevant contractual and legislative requirements. However,
additional c:ountenncasurcs may be required for valuable or critical business assets and systems
which process (or interface with others which process) sensitive data. Such measures should be
determined on the basis of specialist advice, taking account of identified security threats and their
possible business impact.

Sec,uity ofApplication System Files



Access to system files should be controlled.

Maintaining the integrity of applications systems is the responsibility of the user function or
development group to whom the application system or software belongs.

Syst~ Development

All Post Office IS systems should be developed in accordance with formal guidelines and procedures.
The approval of the user and IS manager must be obtained before new systems are accepted. The
respcctivc internal and external audit organisation should be informed of all new systems as part of
the IS planning and concurrence process.

Data &ch1111ge




Exchanges of business data and software within the Post Office, and between the Post Office and other
organisations, should be carried out on the basis of formal agreements and in accordance with
legislative restrictions. Procedures and guidelines to protect media in transit should be formally
established through the performance of risk assessment and the requirement for controls should not
be merlooked waen considering tltt. securit} o.ud busines. i.4lications as.il.=iated with COi and
electronic mail exchanges.

Security of Work Group Systems
Work Group systems are information rcsou:rce based systems designed for office tasks. It may involve
the use of electronic filing systems, WP systems, databases, computer graphic systems, Email and
telec:onfcrcncing systems.

Electronic office systems provide the means for efficient. faster and more widespread dissemination of
business information. However, security and business implications must be considered at system
development stage to ensure control of associated business and security risks, and to enable
appropriate policies, procedures and guidelines to be made available to users.

Information Resource & Distribution Management




Management and operational respons1"bilities for information resource and network facilities most be
clearly defined and supported by appropriate operating instructions and incident response procedures.
The principle of segregation of duties should be applied, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of
negligence and dclibc:ratc system misuse.

Procedures for the operation of all information resource systems should be fully documented and made
available to staff.

Operational Proca:sa

The following operational procc.ucs should be considered:


Operating Procedma Documentation
Clear operating procedures should be prepared for all operational information resource systems to
ensure their co.rrcct and sec:urc operation. nocurnented proccdurcs should also be required for system
development, rnaiDlenancc and test work, cspccially if this requires the support or attention of other
organisational functions such as information resource operations.

Docurnentrn proc:edmb; should also be prepared for system housekeeping activities associatrn with
information resource and distn"bution management, such as computer start-up and close-down
proccdurcs, data backup, equipment rnaiD!cna»cc, computer room management and safety.

Operating procedures should be treated as formal documents and kept secure. Any changes to the
documcr must be controllrn and approved by authorised management.

Incident Mm,agemad Procedures

Rcsponst"bilities and proccdurcs for incident management should be establishrn.

Segreglllion ofDutw

For sensitive data or activities the risk of negligence or dch"bcrate system misuse is rcdUCM through
the segregation of duties.

Consideration should be given to separating the managcmcnt and cxccution of certain duties (or areas
of responsibility) in order to reduce opportunities for unauthorised modification or misuse of data and
services. This control is particularly important for information resources supporting financial
applications.

Small divisions may find this control difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applirn as far as
it is posst"ble and practicable.

Development and testing activities may cause unintended changes to software and data which is
sharing the same c:omputing cnvironmcn1. Segregation of development and operational facilities is
desirable to reduce the risk of aa:idental changes or unautboriscd access to operational software and
business data.

Operationol Change Control

Changes to IS facilities and systems should be controlled.

Common causes of system and security failures can be attnl>uted to inadequate control of changes to
IS facilities and systems. Formal management responsibilities and procedures are necessary to ensure
satisfactory control of all changes to equipment. software or procedures.

Planning Procases

The following planning processes should be considered:

Systan Planning ad Accqtance

Advance planning and preparation is required to ensure the availability of adequate capacity and
resources.

FUt1ll'C capacity projection requirements should be made to reduce the risk of system overload. The
operational rcquircmcnts of new systems should be established, documented and tested prior to their
acceptance. Fallback requircment.s for services supporting multiple applications should be co-
ordinated and regularly reviewed.


CopacityPlanning11ndSystonAcceptanu

The criteria for new systems should be established and sui~ble tests conducted prior to them being
commissioned.                                             ·,

Information resource managers should ensure that the requirements and criteria for acceptance of new
information resource systems are clearly defined and agreed, documented and tested.

The operations function should be consulted throughout all stages in the development process for
major new developments, so as to ensure proper operational efficiency of the proposed system design.

Appropriate tests should be carried out to confirm that all aspects of the acceptance criteria are fully
satisfied.

Information distribution management


Special attention should be given to the security management of Ddworlcs, particularly if they span
organisational or corporate boundaries. A rislr: assessrncot i:bould be carried out to dctcnnine the
level of security n:quircd to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of data passing over
networks.

The managers of lnfonnation Distnbution arc rcspoDS1l>le for the documentation of the network. This
includes a full asset register of all cquipmen1, fully documented connection diagrams and, where
possible, cabling diagrams. Two up-to-date copies arc to be kept, one within the information
distnl>ution management group and another at a scaue off-site location.

Where tnmsrnimon equipment relics upon data programmed into a piece of hardware, information
distribution management should ensure that backup copies of the configuration data within these
items arc taken and arc kept at a scc:mc off-site location.

Network Security Controls

The security of computer networks requires a range of controls. This covers all types of networks i.e.
communication networks, Local and Wide area networks and distnbuted computing systems.

Information distribution managers must ensure that appropriate controls arc established to protect
data in networks and connected services from unauthorised access. In particular, the following items
should be addressed:

•     where possible, operational rcspoDSlbility for networks should be separated from information
      rcsourcc operations

With respect work group management:

•     responstbilitics and procedures should be established for the management of remote equipment.
      including that in user areas

With respect to information distribution management:

•     special controls, such as data cru:ryption, message authentication or remote access controls should
      be considc.rcd to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data passing over the
      networks and the connected systems

•     communications network equipment of critical IS arc to be kept in a secure environmcnL


overall close co-ordination should be applied to information resource and distribution management
activities so as to ensure that security measures arc consistently applied across the IS infrastructure
and service to the business is optimised

Communications Information distribution management

The level of detail and formality of procedures required to manage and operate information resource
and network facilities should vuy considerably according to the circumstances and the nature and
sensitivity of the business applications. For example mainframe computers and specialist operations
functions require a more extensive set of proccdurcs and controls than a department using office
technology. But in principle the same security processes should be applied with appropriate
interpretation.

Jnfomudion Accas Policy

Business requirements for access control must be defined and domrneotl"d.

In order to implement and maintain an cft'cctive level of control of access to IS services and data
service providers must be given a clear statement of the business rcquiremcnts for system ac:ccss.

Each business 'application owner' should establish a clearly defined access policy statement, which
specifics the aa:css rights of each user, or user group. Such policy should take account of the
following:

•   the security requirement-: of individual applications
•   business and departmental dircc:tives for information dissernioatin'l and entitlement
•   contractual and legal rcquircmcnts to protect access to data, information and services.

It is recornrneoderl that the minimal requirement for control of access to computer services (including
standalone PCs and file servers is an effective computer gcru:rated ~ system which can not be
bypassed. Where posslble the system should automatically require the user to change the password on
a regular basis.

A defined acccss policy should govern users access to data and application system functions. This
policy should be based on individual business application rcquiremcnts, and be consistent with
corporate and/or business information access policy.

Application of the following controls should assist in supporting access policy rcquircments:

•   where access controls arc installed which allow user access to be restricted to particular data and
    applications they should be activaterl and used

•   user documentation should be tailored to assist in restricting user knowledge of data and
    application system functions to areas to which they arc authorised ac:ccss. However, this may not

Monitoring System Acca.s and Use



Service pruvidc:rs and system 'owners' should establish a process for monitoring system access and use
to establish the effcctivencss ofmecbaujsms which are demgne.d to ensure compliance with the
information rcsourcc access policy.

Security of Network Savica

Prior to using a network service the associated risks should be established.

Jfflsiresscs '1Sing network services should ensure that their network provider gives a clear description
of the security attributes of all services used. and should establish the security implications for the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of business applications.

•   Computer DdWOiks withln the Post Office are increasingly being cxtcndcd beyond traditional
    organisational and corporate boundaries, with Business partnerships requiring the. intcrconnection
    and sharing of computer and network facilities.

•   Such extensions increase the risk of unauthorised access to existing computer systems that use the

    sensitivity or criticality.

•   ln such cirannstances, controls should be introduced withm the network to segregate groups of

•   Scauity control of large networks should be established by dividing them into separate logical
    domains, each prote.cted by a defined security perimeter and a network gateway. Access between
    domains can then be controlled by the secure gateways, incorporating appropriate routing and
    conn--:tion<apability controls.

•   The criteria network domain segregation should be based on business access control policy and
    requirements, whilst taking account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating
    suitable network routing or gateway technology.

•   An assessment of risk and business impact may be required to determine the correct criteria.

Project Development Security Requirements


Introduction.

Drawing up a Security R.cquircment at the development stage of any IS project is an essential part of
the Risk Management process by ensuring that it is implemented as a planning activity and a
prerequisite to establishing the true cost of developing and producing a system. In the long run it is
likely to lead to cost savings.

Each Post Office Business must ensure that pruc:tdwes arc in place to enable security requirements to
be addressed at the development stage of all IS projects.

Physicol & Environmortol Security

Physical security is an esscotial ingredient for the protection of assets and information in all areas of
computerisation. The application of appropriate physical security facilities provides the means by
which identified levels of risk exposure are reduced to an acceptable level and creates the mechanism
to enable management to maintain control of the environments once secured.

The primacy objectives of applied physical security measures arc to:

•     reduce the likelihood of a threat impacting the computer systems or business operations

•     detect and indicate immediately in the event of a threat penetrating the applied protection

•     directly counter some types of threat in the event of the protection being penetrated.

Physical security requirements should vmy throughout the Post Office depending on the local
circumstances, the scale and organisation of IS services provided as well as the sensitivity and
criticality of the data and business activities. A data-centre should require a much higher degree of
security protection for its IS facilities than office accommodation. However, the concepts of secure
access controlled areas, controlled perimeters, and general security mechanisms are universally
applicable when applied with appropriate interpretation.

Businesses with expanding IS operations should ensure that physical security measures can be
expanded to serve the needs of likely future requirements, especially as such measures may be costly
and difficult to apply retrospectively.




 IS facilities supporting classified, or critical or sensitive business activities should be housed in secure
 areas.

 IS facilities should be protected by a defined security perimeter, incorporating a balance of protection
 barriers, access control facilities and detection mechanisms . A clear desk policy should be put into
 place to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to or damage to paper and media.

Asset Registration & Control


All IS assets should be accounted for and have a oornioattd 'owner'.

'Owners' should be identified and mgncd rcspoDSll>ility for the maintenance of appropriate security
measures. Responsibility for implementing ~ rncasurcs may be delegated - though
accountability should remain. with the nominated owner of the asset.

Jm,entory ofAlub

Registries should be majntaiocd of all major information and IS assets.

A registry should bi'! maintained of the major assets associated with each IS. Each asset should be
clearly identified and its •ownership" and security classification agreed and dor.nmentcd

Assets associated with IS include the following:

• Information assets - databases J.Dd data files, system docurnentation, user manuals, training
  materials, operational or support pructdwes, contingency and disaster recovery plans, baclcup and
  recovery arrangements.

•    Software assets - system software, application software, development tools and utilities.

•    Physical assets - computer and colDIDUDications equipment, magnetic rntdia (tapes and disks),
     specialist technical equipment (power supplies, air conditioning units), furniture,
     accommodation.

•    Staff Assets - skilled personnel required to operate, develop, maintain and use the IS.

Information Privacy Markings

Security and/or privacy markings can be used to indicate the need and priorities for security
protection.

Security and privacy markings arc used by the Post Office to identify information which requires more
than normal protection from unauthorised access. The markings to be used depend on the estimated
degree of damage that disclosure to unauthorised sources may cause to Her Majesty's Govcmmcot. or
the Post Office in terms of its CODUDCrcial dealings, standing in the colDIDUDity or in its relationships
generally. Although the application of security and privacy markings gcncrally rests with the
originator of the information Risk Assessments can be carritd out to dctcrrninc the required marking.


 Seauity tDUJ Privacy Marking GIIUhli,ea

 The protection applied to classified, sensitive and personal information should be consistent with
 business and legislative rcquircmcnts.

 Security and privacy measures for business information should take account of the needs for sharing
 or restricting information, complying with legislation (e.g. The Data Protection Act), and take
 account of the business impacts associated with unauthorised access or damage to the information. In
 partic:ular, consideration should be given to the following requirements:

                                       DISTRIBUTION
    This appendix describes the requirements for the interface with the POCL distribution
    function. The systems required to support the distribution function are currently being
    reviewed and it is likely that a nwnber of interfaces will be required.

    1.        OVERALL PRINCIPLES

    Distribution systems will cover:

    •     cash
    •     value stock
    •     transaction stock.

    Value stock is defined as all value and security items.

    All cash remittances and orders are to be broken down by denomination and, if
    possible, series. OverNight Cash Holding (ONCH) data is to be split note and coin.
    Receipts and deposits are to be summarised to provide end-of-day totals for cash and
    cheques.

    Value stock data is to be broken down by item code and sub-set (e.g. special issue
    stamps).


    2.       INFORMATION AREAS

    2.1      .:;tock Holdings and Flows for Inventory Management Purposes:

    ONCH - end-of-day cash holdings daily by note and coin.

    Payments and receipts broken down by cash and cheques with minimax. holdings of
    cash during the day - daily.

    Value stock holdings by item and sub-code daily.

    Transaction stock - weekly summary of stock on hand (possibly just a sample of
    items).

    Possible requirement: enquiry on cash holdings during the day.

                                      DISTRIBUTION

2.2       Order Information - for Automated Order Processing

These need to be sent via an interface to the distribution centre system at the time of
input for:

•     cash orders
•     value stock orders.

Transaction stock would probably be acceptable overnight, although 'as input' might
be preferred. This interface is most likely to be to Swindon or another separate
system.

2.3      Remittances and Returns.

1bis data is needed for accounting, reconciliation, monitoring, to avoid data re-input
at cash centres, and for service monitoring.

1bis should cover contents by denomination (and series if possible) for cash; by item
and sub-set for value stock. Exact times and dates should be recorded and there
should be a quality check measure.

The information is required to be sent when the remittance is received or the return is
passed to the carrier for both cash and value stock remittances. This will allow the
distribution centre system to ensure the integrity of the end-to-end process and will
avoid losses and the need for re-input of data, and provide a more secure audit trail. A
facility could also be included to relate remittances to orders in the outlet and
eventually to accept information from the distribution centre system on remittances to
outlets for audit purposes and avoiding data re-input in the outlet.

[Transaction stock remittance requirements are not fully defined at this stage./

2.4      Transfer of Data

A direct and immediate interface to the distribution system(s) will be required for
InPay and OutPay transactions performed within cash centres. This interface will
need to transfer transaction data by denomination, series and state/fitness status (e.g.
ATM fit).

There may also be further specific requirements for data on other transactions
performed within cash centres to be transferred to the distribution system(s) (e.g.
Postal MVL applications).

2.5      Remittance Marking

There will be a requirement to consider the possibility of marking remittances in some
machine read.abl~ form, possibly bar-coding, in orde1 to make these interfaces easier
to operate.

                                 I: INTRODUCTION


1. INTRODU CTION

  IT in The Post Office

  The Post Office increasingly relies on infonnation technology (IT). As the cost
  effectiveness of IT improves. and as new means to capture data or present information
  becomes available. the technology becomes more pervasive. More and more computer
  systems are being deployed throughout the organisation.

  As more application systems are deployed. they address a growing proportion of business
  activity. In so doing, these systems are imponant not only in their own right. but also in
  terms of their interf'aces to one another. One provides data to another, two systems may
  share common data.

  Moreover. more and more personal computers and local area networks are now being
  deployed as local initiatives. but will ultimately require access· to systems at a regional and
  national level.

  Unfortunately. getting computers to communicate with one another effectively is often far
  from straightforward. Managers of ten wonder

       why is it difficult to consolidate staff costs?
       why is it complex to connect our purchasing systems to our suppliers?
       why do people need to re-key data from one system into another?

  The i>'lswer to these questions is usually that, in the past. systems have sometimes been
  developed on a project-specific basis without a common technical or application
  framework to suppon interaction between systems and departments.

  Pan of the resolution to the problem lies in the design of the individual computer
  applications and. panicularly. the steps taken to ensure consistency of data. Equally
  important is the need to establish a planned set of computing and communication facilities
  that can provide the flexibility and connectivity required. This is known as the Technical
  lnfrastructure.

  How a Technical Infrastruc ture Works.

  Instead of separate "islands of infonnation", it is becoming important to have complete
  inter-operability of systems and staff. To address this need. the vast majority of PCs, minis
  and other equipment are being interconnected. Cabling is being used to link together all
  equipment within a building. Telecommunications links are being used 10 link buildings
  together. With appropriate software data can be quickly and accurately transferred from
  one system to another. The ultimate aim is to enable any PC or terminal 10 give access to
  applications and data on any computer, subject to appropriate security controls.

  This assembly of computers. devices. cabling and link represents an infrastructure. This
  document is a framework that defines the components of this technical infrastructure and
  how they fit together. We refer to this framework as an architectu re.

  Post Office Technical Infrastru cture Policy

  It is Post Office Policy that all IT investments should be made within such a framework.
  This framework is defined by the Group Technical Policy Unit (TPU), under the auspices
  of the Group Technical Policy Committee. All Post Office Businesses are represented on
  this committee, which sponsors a research programme to keep this architecture and
  associated standards and policies up to date.                   •

  This Policy Document is published annually. It is supplemented by a list of approved
  hardware and software products, which is updated regularly in line with decisions made by
  the Group Technical Policy Committee (GTPC) and its subcommittees. More detailed
  reports are produced on individual research projects and are available from the TPU.

  The format of the document has evolved over the years in line with changes in technology.
  Whereas at one time architectural definitions revolved around host computers, the arrival
  of client server computing, along with the widespread proliferation of interconnected PCs
  and LANs has made life a lot more complicated. New layers of software are having to be
  introduced, spread across all the components of the infrastructure to enable them to
  communicate with one another effectively. This includes the provision of tools to enable
  technical problems to be isolated and to deal with information security.

  This issue of the Infrastructure Policy has been structured to recognise this trend, although
  the relevant software products and related standards are, in many cases, only just starting
  to appear in the market place.

  Structur e

  Section 2 provides an overview of major developments and trends in the IT industry which
  will have an impact upon the Post Office.

  Section 3 outlines the architectural framework within which the standards and policies for
  the various hardware, software and telecommunications will be defined.

  Section 4 provides guidance on how to select the appropriate platfonns for client server
  systems, and also provides an overview of the 5 major client server models.

  Sections 5-12 define the standards for the various components, including the cross
  platform software elements, as outlined above.

  For more detail on current standards the reader is recommended to refer to the Post Office
  Strategic Products Catalogue, soft copies of which may be obtained from iT/fechnical
  Assessment Services. The catalogue has the added value of being maintained as current, in
  line with changes in Technical Architecture, whereas this document will be revised once,
  or at most twice, each year.

  Section 5, apart from defining current standards, also identifies strategic directions, where
  they have been defined. These are contained within 'Directio nal statements'.

   Authority

   The Technical Infrastructure Policy is formally authorised by the Post Office Executive
   Committee (POEC) on the advice of the Group Technical Policy Committee CGTPC). It is
   the responsibility of the Group Director. Information Technology in the role of strategic
   adviser to the Post Office Board. to maintain it and be responsible for the authorisation of
   any deviations from it through the process of Technical Concurrence. This responsibility
   may be devolved to individual units for sub MaPEC projects in accordance with agreed
   procedures GTPCU ... <CReO. (See GTPC file))

   Benefits

   The Technical Infrastructure Policy identifies specific hardware. software and
   communications systems which will deliver accurate. secure. cost-effective and
   appropriate func1ionali1y and inter-operability. at minimal risk.

   The main benefits to be gained from a defined Technical Architecture include:

• lower technology evaluation and procurement costs. because hardware and soflware
  evaluation is carried out against generic requiremer.ts, instead of being repeated for every
  project~
• lower prices. because the strategic products can be procured in larger quantities:
• more flexible in staffing and lower retraining costs, because fewer technical environments
  have to be supponed;
• greater levels of in-house expenise, through concentration on fewer targets:
• less need to develop or purchase special conversion and communications software to
  bridge between incompatible environments:
• faster and cheaper application development. because a mature high function environment
  can be selected and staff made familiar with it;
• greater opponunity for standardisation of the user interface;
• matching infrastruc1ure componen1s 10 business demand:
• reduction of training and suppon costs through standardisation:
• cheaper connec1ivity:
• the opponunity to develop close relationships with manufacturers and suppliers.

                     2. INDUSTRY TRENDS OVERVIEW

       This section outlines some of ,lie major trends within the IT indus1ry, in order to sc1
       the context within which Post Office technical infrastructure policy and architecture
       has been defined.

2.1    CENTRAL COMPUTING

       Pressure con1inues to mount on the mainframe and the traditional .. Glasshouse"
       approach to computing. This pressure is largely due to organisational re-engineering,
       which has empowered the expectations of users who have been seduced by the
       attractions of G~phical Interfaces (GUI) to their PC systems; the industry shift to the
       new paradigm of Clienl Server, and the increasingly positive price/performance
       equation offered by mid-range computers.

       The pressure has resulted in the major player in this market space, IBM. recording the
       largest losses in corporate history and laying-off huge numbers of staff in a world-
       wide re-structuring program. The result will be a new IBM which will encourage
       internal compelition and no longer protec1 its mainframe business from products such
       as the RS6000. IBM will increasingly e111er the Consultancy, Systems Integration and
       Outsourcing markets in order to broaden and strengthen its portfolio.

       During this period. the OEMS such as HDS and Amdahl have been hit equally hard.
       In essence their market space has become un1enable and they are seeking to position
       themselves as Value Added Compatibles (VACs) and move into other ranges by
       means of alliances and pannerships. II remains 10 be seen how, and if. they will
       achieve this shift.

       In parallel with 1his ac1ivi1y, manufac1urers considered 1radi1ionally 10 be in the Unix
       midrange, market are ex1ending upwards wilh ever more powerful RISC-based
       processors such as 1he HP TSOO range. These processors are becoming credible from
       a price/performance viewpoint bu1 are still imma1ure from a systems managemen1
       angle. They are no1 ye1 a true ahemative mainframe for organisa1ions such as the
       Post Office which balances massive daytime OLTP Workload with complex
       schedules of overnight ba1ch processing.

      The next five years will wi1ness 1he dealh of traditional ECL based mainframe
      technology. As early as 1996, all mainframe manufac1urers can be expec1ed 10 have
      low-cost CMOS versions of lheir produc1s. These will begin 10 approach the price
      levels of 'Unix' processors but enjoy the management structures normally associa1ed
      with mainframes.

                                                                                                POL00028135




       In a similar timescale, all mainframe manufacturers can be expected to include
       parallel processing technology in their ranges. Some, like IBM, have already
       announced steps along this route with attached processors to handle large volume
       OLTP and decision suppon. These processors will be faster, smaller and cheaper
       than traditional equivalents.

      Massively Parallel Processing architectures (MPP) will begin to move out from the
      scientific market where, already, too many vendors are chasing too few opponunities,
      and address the commercial computing world. New vendors, such as KSR, Meiko
      and NCube will appear in this market alongside established vendors such as IBM,
      Tandem and NCR. There will be significant challenges, however, to the success of
      MPP in the commercial arena. There are very few skilled people available to develop
      the applications which exploit this technology. There are very few tools available to
      assist .with processes like database design and no real production management
      systems. At the same time the reliability and security demands of the commercial
      market are very different to those of the scientific. MPP will have a niche-role,
      commercially, until those questions of management and development technology
      have been addressed.

      There is a new role emerging for large central computers. As well as being effective
      servers for high volume transaction processing and the management of large
      'enterprise' databases, they are ideally placed and suited to provide baclc-up and
      archive management services for distributed enterprise data.

      In order to survive, it can be expected that selling prices for mainframes will plummet
      and previously proprietary manufacturers will embrace open systems technology. In
      the latter half of the decade, alternative mainframes such as MPP will take a
      significant share of the large systems market particularly in the decision support and
      OLTP areas. It can also be expected that the power of Unix processors, such as the
      HP9000 range, will increase to the extent that they will be fighting head-to-head with
      IBM mainframes. The differentiators will be price and system management ability.

2.2   DISTRIBU TED COMPUT ING

      The very issues which are accelerating the shift from traditional mainframes to open,.
      client-server architectures are highlighting the immaturity of the management
      environments for client server and the rapidly increasing complexity of the task. In
      addition, the selection of strategic vendors and products is made all the more complex
      because of the price pressures and technology changes which will drive all but the
      best, and the most astute, from the market.

                                                                                                   POL00028135
                                                                                             POL0002813 5




       This is the arena where bouom-up and top-down will collide. both in the sense of
       strategies and hardware. The increasing power of multi-Pentium processor PCs (and.
       indeed later X86 processorsl will overlay the mid-range. whilst small CMOS-based
       mainframes will encroach from above. Al the same- lime. mid-range vendors
       themselves will expand to scale the complete spectrum from desktop 10 data centre.
       At the low-end they will compete head-10-head with Intel-based PCs whilst at the
       high-end they will be price and performance competitive with mainframes. at least on
       paper.

       On the operating system front. the launch in 1993 of Windows NT Advanced Server
       gave notice of Microsoft's intention 10 offer a ~dible opponent for Unix. Current
       versions of 'NT-AS' are not yet sufficiently well supponed with management tools or
       robust enough for mission critical applications, but experience suggests that it will not
       be 100 long before they are. Although NT will run on either Intel or RISC
       architectures, it will provide a powerful boost for the PC-based server platforms
       which have suffered in the past from the limitations of generic UNIX (such as SCO)
       compared to the servers available from the mainstream suppliers.

2.3    DF.sKTOP AND LANs

       In 1993 we have seen the death of the 386 processor. Of the 40m or so Intel
       processors shipped in 1993. 32m are 486 technology. No one is shipping 386 devices
       for 1994. 486-based PCs are now considered the base product with 586 (Pentium)
       based systems being aimed initially at the power-user. and at server applications.

      In 1994. Pentium-based processors will ship in volume and soon become the nonn,
      even on the desktop. Intel are well ahead with planning for 686 and 786 technologies.
      The increasing power will be needed 10 exploit new graphical and video software.
      and. increasingly. hardware architecture and software will exploit and complement
      each other. This will be achieved by closer co-operation and partnership between
      vendors such as Microsoft and Compaq.

       Whereas processor power has enabled even more complex software 10 be developed
      and, conversely. the demands of software increasingly influence processor and PC
      design. the real issues of 1993 have been in the Operating Systems arena. Windows
      is becoming the dominant desktop OS and will cenainly be so for the foreseeable
      future     In the LAN environment. the decision by Microsoft lo discontinue
      development of LAN Manager. in favour of Windows NT-AS. has presented a major
      issue to the Post Orfice in that it will need to decide its migration path and timing.
      The extent 10 which LM/X (LAN Manager for Unix) will continue to be developed in
      line with NT-AS is currently an area of uncertainty. Within the Post Office this
      product has served as a link between the PC world and distributed UNIX servers. For
      a transitional period it will be necessary 10 support LAN Manager. LM/X. NT-AS as
      well as Netware. but some rationalisation needs 10 be sought in 1995.

       There has been liule innovation in desktop hardware in 1993/94. Vendors have been
       concer,tra~ing upon bringing the new higher performance CPUs on board. and
       improving quali1y and price performance in a more and more competitive market
       place. Vendor stability and s1rategic alliances are becoming the major differentiating
       factor in an increasingly commodity orientated market place. Second and third tier
       vendors are under great pressure. and may well disappear.

      In 1994/95. innovation at the desktop will be driven by muhi-media developments,
      many of which will become an integral pan of the standard multi-media PC by the
      end of 1995.

      •       CD-ROM prices have fallen dramatically and increasing amounts of
              reference data are distributed using this medium. For the Post Office. these
              cost reductions make the economies of 'infonnation kiosks', previously ruled
              out on the grounds of communication costs. much more anractive.

      •       Multi-media and the new 'document centric' software from Microsoft will
              !"tegrate voice. video. text, image and graphics in everyday applications . .
              "•uhi-media has hitherto been seen as technology for specific applications
              such as training but that will all change in the next few years. This type of
              integration will even be available to mobile users as their PCs attain the
              power of desktop equivalents.

      •       Also on the multi-media theme. there will be a trend towards convergence of
              domestic TV and Office/PC technology. Microsoft are extending into the
              domestic arena with 'Microsoft in ,he Home', and cable TV companies are
              beginning to build multi-media capabilities into tenninating units. The
              danger for the IS industry is that these products may have no affinity
              whatsoever with the established standards of the DP industry.

      In the office. the need for Business Process Re-engineering combined with an
      expanding reliance on team-oriented organisation structures. will drive office systems
      to deliver workrtow applications and multi-media to the desktop. Office systems will
      increasingly need to suppon every aspect of our business. and the move towards these
      workgroup applications and technology enabled employees could well bring a shift
      back towards centrally planned and implemented office sys1ems. This is panicularly
      true of electronic mail. which is graduating from a local workgroup to an enterprise-
      wide and intra-enterprise technology. Within the next few years. electronic mail will
      become as fundamental to business operating as the telephone. and this technology
      will be backed up with integrated image and workflow capabilities.

      Portable computing matured rapidly in 1993. Three categories of ponable emerged in
      what will become an increasingly important market segment. Desktop equivalents,
      mobile companions and consumer devices are the established categories with desktop
      equivalents rapidly approaching the capabilities of fixed desktop machines.

      The proliferation of mobile computing devices can be expected to continue during
      1994/95. although most of the devices available are still of an experimental nature.
      The real benefits will come when they are used in a controlled manner as a key
      component of client-server architectures. More effective and generally available 'dial
      in' solutions will be an imponani fac1or. along with grea1er ma1uri1y in 1he wireless
      arena.

2.4   SERVIC E MANAGEMENT

      Traditionally, hardware vendors operated in vertically segmented markets where they
      provided not only the box, but also the systems management software to make it all
      work in a secure environment. This is the traditional 'Glasshou se' scenario. Industry •
      moves towards open systems, client server and networked PCs have created the
      demand to provide service management across a heterogeneous array of hardware.
      software and communications. The demand is for a new, virtual Glasshouse. Further
      than that. the days when the IS department ruled over the Glasshouse without
      question have passed and the challenge has become one of being able to provide:

      •       a management environment which will encompass.this diversity;

      •       tools which will automate and integrate the management processes;

      •       tools which may be operated at a variety of levels and regimes ·from
              centralised lo distributed control.

      The potential to deliver end-to-end servir.e management across a variety of distributed
      platforms is gradually becoming reality. Products such as HP Openview, which has
      effectively become a· de facto standard, are beginning to provide a sound basis for the
      required environment and tool kiL

      Emerging standards such as Open System Foundations Distributed Computing
      Environment (DCE) have given credible vision to the industry and the suppliers to the
      Post Office are actively working within its framework. The same is true for the
      Distributed Management Environment (DME). although this initiative is now
      considerably less ambitious than was originally intended .

      Communications and systems management will become a continuum in the coming
      year. 1994 is the year in which the Post Office must choose its platform and
      environment for providing seamless system management across the variety of
      techniques and organisations involved in delivering today's options to the end user.
      The solutions shortfall apparent now in the area of integrating new management
      solutions with those necessary for the management of legacy systems will gradually
      be eroded by the evolution of new products such as HP Opcnview.

      The industry is also just starting to realise the potential security exposures inherent in
      the distribution of systems and interconnection of LANs. Business is now
      clamouring for cohesive security architectures across diverse central and distributed
      platforms. Regrettably, this issue has been neglected for a number of years and no
      standard solution exists. This will be the subject of much activity within the industry
      during 94/95.

2.5   APPLIC ATION DEVELO PMENT TECHNO LOGY

      Three major areas of market activity can be identified - CASE, Client Server 4GLs
      and Object Orientation.

       CASE tools were originally built on the structured methodologies of the late 1970's
       and the hardware and software environments of the early 1980's. In recent years they

       have had difficulties in keeping up with technological change. and panicularly with
       the moves to graphical user interfaces and clief' 1 server architectures. Two
       approaches are in evidence: LBMS with System Engineer have been constructing bi-
       directional interfaces 10 popular client server 4GLs such as Powerbuilder and Visual
       Basic. TI with JEF have been extending their code generation concept to encompass
       a total closed client server environment with its own communications and system
       management software paned across a range of hardware. operating systems and
       DBMS platforms. This approach is likely to be modified in the light of the recently
       announced relationship with Microsoft

       In 1993. the industry seized on the concepts of object orientation as the basis for
       applicaaion technology in the I 990's. Three major drives may be identified, with
       some degree of overlap.

       •       As a basis for linking the components of compound documents, panicularly
               in desktop applications. This is dominated by Microsoft' s OLE2. but subject
               to challenge from the OpenDoc consonium .

       •       As a basis for defining a more stable interface between client and server in
               the client/server environment. Here IBM ·s DSOM will be aiming to pre-
               empt Microsoft's CAIRO; the nexl version of NT due probably in 1996.

       •       As the basis for a new approach to application development based upon re-
               useable components. Here Microsoft' s CAIRO will be challenged by the
               forthcoming Taligent framework supplied by IBM and HP. and by Novell's
               Appware. The CASE tool vendors will also be aiming to evolve their tool
               sets and methodologies 10 include some elements of object orientated
               technology.

      It is generally recognised that the market is wide open. with most vendors hedging
      their bets rather than committing themselves irrevocably to any individual
      protagonist.

      There is likely to be an initial market for Microsoft OLE2 ·componen tware"
      developing in I 995 providing comparatively low level functions such as spell
      checkers as 'add-ons' 10 the office application suite. More ambitious use of object
      orientalion is likely to remain in the experimental domain for some years, until the
      tools are more mature. and the industry has teamed how to use them.


2.6    COMMUN ICATION S

       1993 has been the year in which network operators have been faced for the first time
       with the dilemma inherent in striking a balance between old and new technologies.
       Whilst technologies such as X25 and SNA have reached a degree of maturity, and
       can be managed to give a highly reliable service. the demands of inter-LAN
       communication are giving rise 10 new challenges which these 1echnologies are
       proving unable to meet. This :s not surpric;ing given that WAN bandwidths are
       typically one hundredth 1ha1 or LANs, and 1he unpredictable nature of end user driven
       demands.



GB0097.doc
                                                                                         12    I
                                                                                                  POL00028135
                                                                                             POL00028135




      New technologies such as asynchronous 1ransfer mode (ATM) offer a long term
      solution, with the potenlial for virtually unlimited bandwidth 'on demand'.
      Unfortunately it is going to be some years before these are widely deployed. and
      available at acceptable prices. In the meantime, Megastream-rate cell switching
      technologies, in conjunction with frame relay protocols offer an interim solution. and
      are being evaluated for inclusion in the Posa Office network .in 1995.

      One · consequence of the extension. of LAN communications across the WAN has
      been the need to standardise on the use of routable protocols. TCP/IP has become a
      worldwide de fac10 s1andard for corporate networks, but is creaking beneath the
      inadequacies of it own structure, and particularly the inability of its addressing
      structure to support the number of workstations now being installed. A Marie 2
      version which will overcome these problems is expected to be agreed in 1995,
      although it will take some years to roll out. In the meantime interim solutions are
      needed.

      On large campus sites, even LAN bandwidths will be under pressure once use of
      multimedia becomes widespread. Distributed backbones will give way to single box
      "collapsed backbones" which provide a ready transition to ATM switches, which will
      become available at more affordable prices by the end or 1995.

      Local Area Networks have become an indispensable compone nt of Post Office
      Information Systems. Interconnected LANs are now key to business strategies, and
      the management and security issues surrounding them are becoming critical. LANs,
      in effect, have spell the dealh knell of 'personal' computing and the PC has become
      the universal, networked workstation or client.

      New network operating systems from Novell. and subsequently Microsoft will
      gradually attempt to introduce the enterprise directory and management capabilities
      that are needed.

      Two major issues facing the Post Office will be provision of enterprise-wide inter-
      LAN networking to provide full functionality office systems, and the need to generate
      and maintain enterprise-wide directories of addresses and users. Products based on
      X400 standards for the former and XS00 for the latter are slow to emerge and it will
      be necessary to put in place key transition strategies and sound across-business
      tactical solutions to achieve effective solutions.

      One of the fastest growing trends in 1993 has been the demand for remote access to
      LANs and host services from mobile users and small remote units. Remote access is
      usually provided by dial-up networking, as opposed to leased lines.

      The importance of adopting a credible electronic commerc e strategy has been a
      feature of 1993. In addition to the need to trade electronically as part of our routine
      business operations. the Post Office has significant ability as a retail and distribution
      networlc to provide a unique range of products to its customers. The first steps
      towards this goal were taken in 1993.

2.7    CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURES

      Client-Server has been widely hyped as the answer to every IT problem. and the only
      way to develop systems in the 1990's. After some expensive mistakes. the IT
      industry is staning to come 10 terms with the reality. It is now widely recognised that
      client server systems are more expensive to develop and to deploy than conventional
      systems. Moreover, when implemented on a large scale they pose new management
      challenges for which technology has yet to provide a truly general solution.

       However. client server systems can provide unique business benefits. and it is on this
       basis that they must be justified.

      A widely quoted model. originating from the Ganner Group. identifieti ;ive types of
      client server system. The vast majority of those implemented to day are either:

               server centric - where the majority of the application resides on the server,
               and the client handles the user interface

       •      client centric - where the majority of the application resides on the client. and
              the server handles the database management system.

      The former has been used primarily as a means of providing a common new look
      interface across a range of legacy systems. It poses problems of change management
      panicularly, and is not recommended for new developments.

      The latter has been used very successfully in a LAN environment. but can cause
      performance problems when implemented on enterprise-scale wide area networks. It
      is not recommended for environments where client software is developed by end
      users.

      Over time it is to be expected that the industry will move towards a distributed logic
      architecture, where application function is distributed between client and server to
      minimise data transfer requirements and, as far as is practicable. to de-couple the
      client and server development processes. The full realisation of this concept is
      dependent upon the availability of object orientated middleware frameworks, which
      today are in their infancy.

      Much activity can be expected in the industry over the next few years, as vendors.
      consonium and standards bodies jockey for position as suppliers of ·major
      components for these future enterprise-wide system software architectures. In the
      meantime. the .Post Office Technical Architecture is designed to incorporate client
      solutions where required. based upon interim best of breed technology and standards.
      and consistent with longer term industry directions.

3.3   Clients in this context are th~-physical workstations through which end users gain
      access to information systems. They may be physical!:, connected via a LAN 14.6) or
      via a remote access service (4.8). The standard client is a personal computer (PC) but
      more specialised clients may be used when the occasion demands (e.g. counter
      terminals, bar code readers) .

3.4   Local servers are attached to a LAN, and are used to meet the needs of clients
      attached to the same LAN or via a remote access service. A Local server may also be
      a client of an enterprise server or another local server. Local servers are used to
      provide network operating system services (NOS), and to host local applications.
      They may also serve as protocol translation gateways for access to conventional host
      applications, in which case they will emulate a terminal control unit. and the security    I
      gateway. In this context their functions may also be extended to allow the direct
      connection of dumb terminals.

3.5   F.nterprise servers are used to host applications and databases that need to be
      accessed from many different locations. They may also be used to host enterprise
      wide services such as those outlined in 4.10 and 4.11. They are normally housed in
      purpose built, professionally staffed data centres.

3.6   Local Area Networks (LAN) are used to intercoMect clients and servers in a single
      geographical location.

3.7   The Wide Area Network (WAN) interconnects major Post Office locations. It
      handles voice and data traffic. With today's technology, WANs transmit data very
      much more slowly than LANs. and this is a major constraint on the overall
      performance of the architecture.

3.8   Remote access services are used to allow clients operated by Post Office staff to
      access the Post Office infrastructure from locations which, for reasons of cost or
      volatility (e.g. hotel rooms). are not connected to the WAN. Depending upon the type
      of application, they may provide access to a LAN or to a central server. For security,
      cost and performance reasons there are constraints on the facilities that they provide.

3.9   External Access Services are used to interconnect the Post Office IT infrastructure
      with the outside world. This may be used to access external information databases,
      for electronic data interchange with customers and suppliers, or to provide specialised
      electronic services to our customers. Special security provisions are required to
      ensure that the integrity of the internal Post Office infrastructure is not compromised.

3.10   The term Cross Platform Scn·iccs is used to describe software products that arc
       common to several components of the infrastructure. or need to work together in a co-
       operative way in order to provide a facility across the entire enterprise. These are as
       follows. Today most exist only in embryonic form. if at all.

       3.10.1 Electronic Mail. This is the set of services required to provide for enterprise
              wide mail exchange. It includes:

               •          mail access facilities at the client level, including the mail enabling of
                          applications.
               •          mailbox facilities at the local server level
               •          mail exchange backbone capabilities at the Enterprise level
               •          mail directory synchronisation and maintenance facilities

       3.10.2 Groupware. This includes all types of software. beyond basic mail and
              calendar facilities. designed to aid collaborative working across the
              organisation.

       3.10.3 Directory Services. This covers all requirements for directory services that
              extend beyond the bounds of an individual application.

       3.10.4 Security Services. This covers the hardware and software required to
              control access to applications with the infrastructure.

       3.10.5 File Transfer Sen·ices. These are general purpose file transfer facilities that
              can be used to move data between components of the infrastructure.

       3.10.6 Application Sen·iccs. These are general purpose software facilities provided
              to enable the implementation of cross platform applications (notably client-
               server).

3.11   Service Managemen t facilities are those that are provided to enable operational
       management of the enterprise. They are a special example of cross platform service.
       in that they need to be provided in some form on every component of the
       infrastructure . and increasingly will need to co-operate. Their major purpose is:

       •      To enable changes to be introduced 10 the infrastructure in a non descriptive
              fashion.
       •      To enable faults to be diagnosed and repaired when they arise .
       •      To enable the information processing and storage capacity of the components
              of the infrastructure to be adjusted in line with changes in demand.
              To allow usage of the infrastructure to be recorded for billing purposes.

      4: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR APPLICATIONS
4.1   Introduction

      The purpose of this section is 10 provide some guidelines for the positioning of
      individual applications within the overall technical architecture. ll is based upon
      research carried out under the auspices of the Technical Policy Unit, covering
      experience both within the Post Office and in other large organisations. Inevitably it
      is of a very general nature, given the complexity of this subject and the limited space
      available.

4.2   Client Server Architecture

      In spite of the current enthusiasm for client server architecture, it must be recognised
      that conventional host-terminal systems will generally be less expensive and more
      reliable. panicularly where they involve large numbers of users in multiple locations.
      Client-server should be used for such applications only where there are specific
      business benefits to be gained. Generally this will be where one or more of the
      following apply:

            A highly interactive GUI user interface is needed with fast response times,
            combined with the sharing of data across multiple locations.
            Access is required to a number of existing host systems, but the current user
            interface is unacceptable, either because it is too complex or incor,~istent with
            other applications.
            A high degree of integration is required with existing or planned local desktop
            applications.

      Even in these circumstances there can sometimes be a less complex or more
      economic alternative to a full client server solution. This may be achieved by taking
      periodic extracts from a central database, which are then transferred to the desired
      location using a software distribution or file transfer utility, or even on diskette or CD
      ROM. Where this is not acceptable, use of a data replication utility may be
      considered to enable multiple copies of a central database to be resynchronised at pre-
      set intervals.

4.3   Choice and Location of Servers

      Central servers should generally be used where data needs to be shared across
      multiple locations, or where data is mission critical or sufficiently large in volume to
      require professional management. If local data is likely to exceed a few gigabytes
      then local staffing implications need to be considered.

      Local servers should be used for data which is only required at the location concerned
      (or at directly dependent locations with remote access). They may also hold extract
      or replicated copies of central data (see above).

      In choosing appropriate server technology. the ratio of data storage volume to
      processing power is a useful indication.

            Mainframes should generally be used where this ratio exceeds 400 Megabytes
            per MIP and for databases in excess of 20GB. They should also be used for
                                                                                                     POL00028135
                                                                                                POL00028135




               applications requiring very high transaction processing volumes, although the
               capability of the HP9000 and Tandem computers are now such this will rarely
               be a constraint in itself.
               HP9000 Unix processors are appropriate for applications with requirements that
               do not exceed the above thresholds. Unlike mainframes, they will generally
               need to be dedicated to a single application. .     .
               PC based servers running Windows NT or Novell Netware should not be used
               for databases in excess of 1-2 GB. The limiting factors primarily relate to
               system management software and i/o processing capability.

         These figures are. of course. only a very general indication. The capabilities of· PC
         and midrange devices are continuing to improve. and other factors need to be taken
         into account. These include backup and recovery requirements, batch processing,
         and staffing considerations at the location concerned. At present PC based servers
         are not approved for local applications requiring complex processing, primarily
         owing to software limitations.

4.4      Function al Distribut ion

         In client-server systems processing is split between a client, which handles the user
         interface, and a server which handles the database. Application logic may be on
         either processor; or on both. In more complex situations there may be more than one
         server. These might be amnged in a peer configuration, where the client has
         simultaneous sessions with several servers, or hierarchical, as when a local server
         requests data from one or more remote servers.

         A number of models have been proposed within the IT industry to classify alternative
         client server configurations. As noted in section 2.7, the vast majority of applications
         today are either client centric or server centric.

               In a server centric system, the application logic all resides on the server - often
               a conventional host system - and the client is used only to provide the user
               interface. This is often used as a means of updating existing applications
               without charging the host resident code. Existing dumb terminals can continue
               to be used.
               In a client centric systems, all the application logic runs in the client, and the
               server runs a conventional database management system. The client issues
               remote SQL calls to the client, using communications "middleware" provided
               by the DBMS supplier or a third party. The advantage of this "remote data
               access" technique is that no special application coding is required.

      This approach is appropriate where locally based applications on multiple sites need to
          share access to a common database.

      Client centric systems can involve very large amounts of WAN traffic when client and
          server are in different locations. This problem may often be avoided by using some
          application logic on the server to optimise communication between the two. This is
          known as the "distributed logic" model.

          Within the Post Office Technical Architecture only the simpler forms of client server
          application are currently supported. Excluding products which are confined to use
          within a single local area network, these are follows:


                                                                                                        21

            lngres Net allows a single Windows client '-; a local ! ',ix server h. access a
            remote lngres database. The lngres embedded logic facility allows a limited
            amount of application specific data selection logic to be installed on the central
            server.
            Visual Basic in conjunction with the approved SNA gateway product allows
            graphical front ends, running on Windows 3.11 clients, to be built for existing
            mainframe applications. It should be noted that the client software has to be
            updated whenever changes are made to the host system, and that the
            operational implications require careful consideration.
            In house developed LU 6.2 code allows local UNIX servers to have real only
            access to central mainframe DB 2 databases.

      The middleware services required to support client server working are included
      within the ..cross platform services" layer of the architecture at section 10.6. Those
      currently approved do not have the sophistication to cope reliably with simultaneous
      access from a client to multiple servers. or more sophisticated forms of distributed
      logic. New products will be evaluated within the TSMC work programme in
      accordance with business priorities as and when they become established in the
      market place.

4.5   Decision Support

      In principle the remote data access technique may be used to allow locally developed
      decision support applications to gain access to centrally managed data. However. the
      extract and replication techniques outlined in 4.2 may often be more appropriate, as
      they represent less of a risk to the perfo-mance and integrity of operational systems
      using the same data.

4.6   Distributed Database

                                          S. PLATFORMS

        This section covers the three major types of processing platfonns oullined in the
        architecture model:

        • Clients - PC Workstations are recommended as the universal client.

        • Local Servers - associated with a specific LAN or Workgroup community.

        • Enterpri se Servers - centralised data centre processors serving a wider
          community.

        The relevant subsections outline the hardware and software environments currently
        approved for use within the Post Office. They also contain an indication of the type
        of application for which each should be used.

        More specific infonnation on technical architectures for different types of application
        is contained in section 4.

5.3 ENTERPRISE SERVERS

Definition: Processors providing services to multiple locations and/or requiring controlled
environments.

Centrally sited computers are used in the Post Office_to fulfil two main functions:

• the traditional role of supponing large scale applications on a single centralised data model
  providing interactive access to a large community of geographically dispersed users and
  complex batch workloads;
• an emerging role as server in major Client/Server applications where high volumes of data
  are required to be held in secure, central locations and complex batch and/or decision
  suppon processing needs to take place.

In panieular. existing central mainframe infrastructure is currently the most effective vehicle
for high volume TP and large on-line databases where there is a high data:MIPS ratio.
Centrally sited data and processors are panicularly suitable when any pan of the stored data
may be accessed by any user, from any location and where that data must be up to date and
consistent.

5.3.3 Other F.nterprise Servers

Tandem:

Tandem Fault Tolerant Systems may be considered as an alternative to IBM mainframes for
applications with the following requirements:

•       continuous on line operation;
•       very high levels of availability;
•       specialised security;
        short and consistent response times;
•       external gateway functions.

                                                                                            nal
Tandem also provides the platform for the strategic EDI Gateway supporting all internatio
EDI standards and X.400/X.435.
                                                                                               n
A decision to use Tandem must take account of the operational implications of any interactio
required with databases in other environments.
Tandem systems are not intended to support a mixed general purpose data processing
                                                                                            end

operation is possible with the smaller configurations and distributed relational databases
supported with full integrity control.
OSI, SNA and TCP/IP communications protocols (including PUS) are supported and a variety
of products are available to allow co-existence with the IBM environment.
•        Fault tolerant processing is based upon Tandem equipment using the Guardian
Operating system. Generally the policy is to remain close to the current release, but any new
release involving major application or hardware changes will be subject to strategic review.
•        A common technical environment is preserved for all systems.
•        For existing systems the ENSCRIBE data management system will continue to be
used. New applications will use Non-Stop SQL. which will also be considered for major
enhancements to existing systems.

                    6: LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LAN)


The role of Local Area Networks (LANs) within the architecture is to provide the medium
through which workstations at a location gain access to shared computer
systems/applications, peripheral devices and files at that location and to the Wide Area
Network (WAN).
It is now established Post Office policy to use a PC as the standard desktop device providing
access to all data and applications wherever they may reside. Hence LANs have assumed the
role as the first link in the communications chain to providing the required service delivery.
As such, LANs are also an established part of Post Office policy.

The three elements to the LAN infrastructure are the:
•       physical cabling system used within the building;
•       link level protocols used to attach devices to the network and send data from one to
        another;
•       LAN Network Operating System (NOS).

Hardware and Cabling:
•      The LAN adapter card fits in the PC and enables physical connection to the LAN
       media.
•      The wiring centre, or hub, contains the necessary circuitry to provide the required
       LAN topology; e.g. token ring or Ethernet.
•      The lengths of cable attaching the adapter card to the wiring centre.
       Local bridges enable two or more LANs of the same topology to be connected
       together.
•      A router may be used to connect multiple LANs. A router must be used if the LANs
       are of different media types (i.e. Token Ring to Ethernet).
•      Gateways are used to translate LAN protocols to protocols optimised for WAN
  transmission (e.g. across X.25 or SNA networks). These have the advantage of allowing
  the use of standard network management techniques, but their throughput is not as high as
  that of the simpler bridging and routing devices. Approved hubs and routers are shown in
  the Strategic Products Catalogue.

Software:
        The network operating system provides a set of standard network services, e.g. file
and print and a set of programming interfaces to enable development of networked
applications.
•        Network management software gathers statistics and generates error messages
relevant to the device in which it is installed. Network management information can be
exchanged with an appropriately configured network management console (see Section 11).

Current Approved Components:

        Cabling:                Structured cabling based upon UTP.RJ45 to be used
                                throughout. Category 5 capable of supporting 100 mbps is
                                recommended

        Note: A structured cabling system is cheaper af correctly design~ in the first
        instance rather than built piecemeal or to the demands of individual projects.
        Budgetary provision should be considered on an infrastructure basis rather than
        project by project.

                                      8: REMOTE ACCESS
     The growth in both distributed computing and in LAN 1echnology has led to an increase in
     the number of distributed applications within the Post Office and consequently in the number
     of remole users requiring access into these central services. It is al'llicipated that by the end of
     1996 around 4.500 sites will need access to serve around 12.700 users with around 300 MB
     of data being transferred in around 270.000 hours of terminal connect time.

     These remote users will therefore, require visibility to LAN based services and/or mainframe
     hosts and it is expected that these users will fall into one of the following three main
     categories:

     A)      'Nomadic' or mobile users who will expect access from home. hotel room, or other
             remote location via a modem into either the LAN or host based systems;

     B)      Single remote users at a fixed site, who are not pan of a LAN, but need access to
             business specific or mail type applications for timely information flow; and

     C)      Multiple remote users at a fixed or permanent location who may or may not be
             permanently pan of a LAN infrastructure and will require dial-up access.

             Remote access is the subject of current TSMC activity.

                               9: EXTERNAL ACCESS

9.1 EDI

         AB part of the Post Office Value Added Network (VAN), an EDI service has been
established. based on a Tandem machine at Farnborough. All connections to EDI VAN's
should be via this Gateway. The EDI Fact standard has been adopted for EDI formatting.
The service uses software called Messageway from Logica/Tandem and has links to two
third-party VAN's. GEIS and·POSTGEM. GEIS is an international network; POSTGEM is a
joint venture between Infonet (a Belgium-based VAN) and the Irish Post Office.
         The software provides translation services to format information into the chosen
message standard as well as controlling the data links to the VAN's.

9.2 Internet and similar Access

        Access to public information networks such as Internet from the Post Office data
network are specifically prohibited for security reasons. The provision of a firewalled
gateway service is under consideration. Interim access should be via dedicated PSTN
connection.

9.3TCPnP
         The Post Office has an allocation of 4 Class B IP addresses. These are allocated to
Royal Mail, Parcelforce, POCL and Group/iT/SSL. This limited allocation imposes
significant restrictions upon lower level address space which is managed by the iT Network
Design Group. Direct TCP/IP Access externally is not allowed (internal TCP/IP addresses
must not find their way on to the external network); external access must be by an address-
translation gateway.

9.4 Break In/Break Out
        The Break-out product/service allows long distance voice telephony calls to be routed
across the Post Office communications network which are subsequently passed to the public
telephone operator closest to the destination for final local delivery. The service is enabled by
the high functionality OPT ISDX digital PABXs that make up the core of the Post Office
network. These switches are currently linked to both of the main public telephone operators,
BT and Mercury, via high bandwidth (2 Mb/s) digital links which carries the DPNSS (Digital
Private Network Signalling System) data stream which allows routing information etc. to be
carried with the call.

9.5 Network External Access Security
       Currently under investigation. All external connections must be via a gateway that
provides appropriate protection.

9.6 Customer Links
          Currently under investigation on a project by project basis.

          10: ENTERPRISE (CROSS PLATFORM) SERVIC~

I 0.1 Electronic Mail
      The approved and recommended mail product for Post Office use is cc:Mail at both
      Client and Server Post Office level. To enable the use of other Mail clients and
      messaging services. a backbone Mail exchange infrastructure would be required with a
      directory service. Options for this arc under consideration.

I 0.2 Groupware
      Lotus Notes is the interim standard product for Groupware and group oriented
      workflc-.v applications.

      Investigation is currently underway to provide inter-Business Groupware capability.

I 0.3 Directory Services
      It is recognised that Group Directories and Directory structures must be available to
      provide effective cross-business mail and groupware services. The appropriate
      standard for such directories is X.500 and a structure based on this is being developed.

I 0.4 Security Services
       Another area where funher work is being undenaken to provide a platfonn independent
       security architecture. The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) looks likely to
       provide assistance in this area. At present, platform specific security facili•ics are
       implemented as outlined in sections 5 and 6. Additional security for dial up COMccting
       is provided.

I 0.S File Transfer Services
       Mainframe to other platform file transfer is undertaken using the XCOM6.2 product
       based on the SNA LU6.2 protocol. File transfer in a TCP/IP environment uses UUCP.

I 0.6 Application Services

      Cross platform services based on APPC LU6.2 conversations are useful in
      circumstances where low volume DB2 access via CICS is required. A number of
      robust solutions exist and the technique is recommended.

      This area is currently the subject of further investigation. Current facilities for
      supporting client/server applications are outlined in section 4.

                         11: SERVICE MANAGEMENT
Service levels provided by traditional mainframe services have set user expectations at a
higher level than can be expected in a distributed environment with the current levels of
software maturity. Additionally, increasing numbers of both Open System and PC Lan
environments, with associated hidden support costs, will increase the cost of service
management. The current aim of service management is thus to control costs whilst providing
a stable service environment that meets cusJomer expectations in an immature environment.

The Open Software Foundation (OSF) have developed a model to overcome inherent
problems with proprietary solutions to service management, particularly in the distributed
systems environment that is becoming increasingly popular within the Post Office. The OSF
definition, known as the Distributed Management Environment (DME) provides a framework
into which management for both applications systems and networks, developed by
Independent Software Vendors (ISV's), and other vendors, can be brought together more
easily.

The significance of DME to the Post Office is as the f rameworlc for HP's Openview producL
Openview has been the strategic service management tool for Open Systems for some time;
recently it has been ratified as the strategic framework for end to end service management by
GTPC.

The adoption by DME of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as its operational
protocol has lead to SNMP becoming far more widely implemented within service
management applications. For this reason it is recommended that SNMP should be adopted as
the protocol by which management can take place.

The recent creation of the DeskTop Management Task Force (DMTF) by a consortium of
major IT vendors, has lead to the development of service management standards based at the
PC hardware and microcode level. Currently these standards are not compatible with SNMP
but it can be expected that products will emerge, during the next two years, that bridge the
DME/DMTF gap.

Additionally, the MicroSoft Hermes product will be released in late 1994 specifically aimed
at providing service management facilities for the desktop. Microsoft's position as the leading
software vendor for PCs will ensure that Hermes is adopted as a major tool for service
management.

Group TPU will monitor developments in this area.

11.1 Overall Policy

•       Wherever possible equipment should be managed using SNMP based management
        applications.
        Management of TCP/IP Networks and equipment wherever possible by HP
        Openview or compliant applications.
        The purchasing of other management applications/element managers is discouraged.
•       Desktop Management solutions should interlace with the SNMP world. DMTF
        solutior.s will be adopteJ as Policy at the aprr<"r·iate time.

In order 10 ensure these aims are met and that lhe Applicaaion Oevelopmen1 process is

A number of common standards. principles and methodologies are employed cross-platform.
iT employs the Development Quality System (DQS); ,!:e DQS is specific to developmem
activities and specifies standards and procedures (wilh supponing checklists and guidelines)
relating to such matters as unit testing and other processes and techniques to support life cycle

There are two formal application development methodologies in use. namely Information
Engineering UEM) and SSADM which effectively provide framework s for the development
of projects. Whether SSADM or IE is used on a specific project is customer driven but where
there is no specific customer requirement as to methodology IE is used as the default. Use of
these methodologies allows a standardised approach 10 systems developme nt and the
production of deliverables to the same format.
The IE and SSADM methodologies are increasingly being supported by the use of Compuaer
Aided System Engineering (CASE) tools. Two CASE tools are currently in use. IEF from
Texas Instruments and Systems Engineering (SE) from LBMS. CASE tools store systems
data to aid the generation of Information Systems by ensuring the completen ess and integrity
of the information required. Both IEF and SE can be used from initial analysis through to
executable code generation on a number of platforms.
In addition. Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Joint Application Development
CJAD) can encompass rapid analysis techniques which are CASE driven.
IEF will normally be used for developing new, and enhancing existing. CICS/COB OL/0B2
applications where code generation is expected.
LBMS/SE will normally be used 10 develop Client/Server applications.
Code generated applications MAY produce less efficient run-time code.

1.     Overview

PC systems to support the ESNS application are being installed in approximately 1470 London Offices as part of the
ALPS project The ALPS project also provides for ECCO+ and APT functionality on the same equipment

The ESNS system is designed tn rnioirnise the risk of fraud in beodits distnlmtion. It docs this by the validation of
order books at the point of cocasbrncn! using negative authorisation against an electronic stop notice

During the day Counter temrioaJs i:apture details about each tr.msaction tbat they perform. At the end of the day, the
server gathers information from each counter terminal into one file ready to be uploaded to the Host polling system.
During the night the host polling system dials up the post oflicc and polls the server for the transaction file and status
information. At a later point in time the host polling system downloads data files for the ESNS software including
updates to the stoplist.

                           ECCo+ TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
ECCo+ System

The ECco+ system is based on personal computer technology. The system is installed in branch offices to support
local accounting activities, and capture basic transaction dc:tails. A counter terminal is located at each counter
position, and a back oflicc processor is located in the back office. A simple local area network (LAN) bas been
installed in all offices, linking the counter terminals to the back offii::e processor. The LAN is not currently used.

The requirement which ECCo+ was developed to meet is for a summarisation and balancing facility at point of sale.
The objectives of the system are to :

a)     Reduce the work in wcddy balancing by :

       - Totalling all transactions within groups
       - Automatic arithmetic
       - Identifying actual/potential mis-balances

b)     Speed up the production of the office wcddy cash account by eliminating the need to manually accumulate
       individual clc:rk balances.

c)     Automate production of client summaries.

d)     hnprovc efficiency at the counter by:

       - Eliminating manual calculation
       - Reducing the need to recmd transactions in writing
       - Reducing errors

e)     Improve the accuracy of client summaries.

f)     Improve customer image of POCL.

g)     hnprovc flexibility of staffing at the counter.

h)     Provide the opportunity to more easily revise operational and accounting procedures.

i)     Provide greater flCXJ.l>ility in meeting current and future accounting and information needs.

j)     Provide the opportunity to reduce the frequency of stock checks.

k)     Provide the opi,ortunity to interface with other Post Office systems.

1)     Allow 95% of transactions (by volume) to be accessed by dedicated keys.


Key Ji'eatu.ra

All transaction data is entered at the time of transaction.

A minimum number of keystrokes is required for clerks, using dedicated keys for most common transactions.

Where possible the system provides the price of an item.

~ comm.on transactions use price look up code (PLU's exist for all items).


Running totals for each customer session.

                                              ECCO+ Technical Description



Receipt option for customer.

Transaction data is written to hard disc/floppy disc at the end of each customer session.


Client Summaries

ECCo+ prints all GirobaDk summaries on client summary inserted in printer.

Other summaries are printed on tally roll (counter printer) or fanfold paper (back office printer) and sent to client in
place of existing client summuy (summaries currently provided are : Pension & Allowances, green Girobank cheques,
postal orders paid, BT bill sumnwy, redeemed avings stamps summuy).

Other client summaries are cmrcntly completed manually (e.g. DNS, DVLA).

Balancing and Cub Accoant

When the stock unit balance is complete the data is transferred to the back office~. cmrently by floppy
     disc.The system produces a trial balance (at any time during the week) and a final balance.

The balance takes only a few minutes to print on the tally roll.

When the stock unit balance is complete the data is transmitted to the back office processor.

When all stock unit balanru lll'C complete, the back office system automatically amalgamates them and produces the
office Cash Account

Each stock unit is held on one disc and one or more people have ownership of these, depending on whether the
balancing is performed by each clerk or as part of a team.

Provides a comprchcnsivc audit trail

Each time a different person uses a stock unit, an individual password is required and therefore accountability is
maintained on an audit trial that can be accessed by the manager at any time.

General

ECCO+ is linked to electronic postal scales in all offices comprising some 3000 scales in total which communicate via
RS232 interface ports. There is generally one scale per two positions.

A facility to extract management information, on transaction data at the lowest level is also required. The data is
required both for POCL intcmal use and for onward transmission to clients, in some cases.

The original ECCO+ specification identified a need to print on cut sheets. i.e. tax discs.

All databases must be parameter driven to enhance ease and speed of change.

Volumes

There are no available transaction volumes but the original sizing requirement during development was for up to
4,400 transactions per oountcr terminal per week with the back office processor required to hold two weeks data (i.e.
8,800 transactions) for each counter terminal (largest offices has 19 CTs).

are distn'buted on one or more discs to each site.

HELP DESK FACILITY

POCL operates a central help desk facility, located at Farnborough, which provides the first line of support to outlets
for all education. hardware and software problems. There are around 1,800 calls per month with the majority split
between education and hardware (roughly 45% and 40% rcspectivcly).

TRAINING

There is a one day training course in the use of the Counter Terminal and a two day course in the use of the back
office system. These are both delivered off-site (in a POCL training office). These are only applicable when the
clerks/manager are already conversant in working in a manual environment. For new clerks the use ofECCo+ is
included in the standard five week counter training course.

                                              APT Technical Description

Current Constraints in APT System

The APT was designed to meet the requirements of the automated payments market, to support products with an
identified client demand. In common with other tnmsaction terminals, the APT bas no disk. and its capacity is,
therefore, limited to what can be held in its main memory. The main memory is used to hold programs, transactions,
reference data and bot/stop lists.

The second area of limitation is the speed of the modem, used for despatch of transactions to the host, and receipt of
programs, reference data and hot/stop lists. The APT modem is at least twice as fast as that in other standalone
transaction terminals.

Main Memory

The APT will hold three average-sized hot lists and some 500-1300 automated ~yments transactions, depending on the
type of transaction (magnetic stripe card transactions use less memory). The amount of space for transactions would
reduce significantly if additional average-sized hot lists were to be held. The APT could not accommodate the size of
hot list envisaged for systems such as ALPS.

Whilst transaction data and hot lists are only two of the types of information contending for memory space, they are the
most dynamic: program and reference data requirements will increase but not with any significance when comp~
with hot lists.

The APT is, therefore, limited in its expandability for other schemes by its memory capacity, and this capacity would
need to be addressed in order to use the APT for any schemes beyond automated payments.

Modem Speed

The modem is medium-speed, using data compression to increase capacity, and error correction to reduce failures
resulting in retransmission. The length of a communication session is not an issue for the APT since it is dispatching
transactions, and receiving new programs/hot lists overnight The length of a communication session does have a cost
implication though.


NON-APT EQ~MENT

In addition to the APT described above, there arc a number of local bill payment schemes using their own dedicated
terminals. These arc summarised in the following table:

2.3     Current System Processing

        The principal stages in the current system processing are:

               polling;
               transaction processing;
               client transmission;
               client file reception.

        The automated payments processing cycle is shown in figure 2.1.

2.3.1   Polling

        APT and ECCQ+ polling takes place five nights a week, from Monday night through to
        Friday night. Polling may be extended to Saturday night in the near future. Polling is
        organised in two phases. The first phase - early polling - is to communicate with office
        terminals during specific agreed windows in the evening. The second phase - regular
        polling- covers the remainder of the terminal population.

        The early polling phase commences at 17.30 and finishes at midnight. It is organised into
        half-hour windows. The terminal will be programmed to expect a poll during the window.
        Typically, the terminal is sharing a residential line, and so the polling window is agreed to
        minimise disruption to other uses of the line. Anproximatelv 25% of terminals will be
        polled during the early polling phase.

Figure 2 1        Daily processing cycle

        The regular polling phase commences at midnight, to finish at 03.00. The terminals will be
        programmed to expect a poll during this window. Approximately 75% of terminals will be
        polled during the regular polling phase.

        In many offices, more than one terminal will share the telephone line. Each terminal is
        programmed to answer the line after a set number of rings. By this means a strict order of
        answering is maintained, which corresponds to the terminal number sequence for the office.

        Each terminal is polled only once during the night. During the communication session,
        transaction information is collected, new software and reference data is distributed, and new
        tariff files and 'hot list' information is distributed. Polling is attempted up to three times for
        each terminal.

        Polling is dial up over the BT PSTN and the Post Office Postline private switched network.

        ALPS PC polling will take place seven days a week. There will be two polling windows
        during each night. Each office will be polled in both of the windows.

        The first window will be from 22.00 to 01.00. During this window, benefits and AP
        t:ansactions will be collected, and AP !lot lists and tariff files will be distributed. This is to
        allow the AP transactions to be processed.

        The second window will be from 03 .30 to 06.30. During this window, the Benefits Agency
        stop list update will be distributed. The time is set to be after the scheduled arrivla of the
        update from the Benefits Agency.

        ALPS PC polling will be using BT ISDN services over the BT network.

        The document processing centre is 'polled' by the collection of a file using ISDN during the
        early evening phase. This file accounts for some 30°/c, of the transaction volume currently.

2.3.2   Transaction Processing

        All transactions collected are streamed by client and service for transmission to client
        systems. Automated Payments transaction processing must complete by 03.30 for the first
        client transmissions.

2.3.3   Oient Transmission

        Client transmissions will take place from the early morning though to late afternoon.
        Generally, those clients with overnight batch processing can take a transmission into the late
        afternoon. Those clients with on-line customer service systems require transmissions to
        complete before the start of the day.

        Client transmissions take place generally five days a week, from Monday morning through
        to Friday. Benefits Agency transmissions take place additionally on a Saturday.
        Transmissions may be excluded on bank holidays or local holidays for the client system
        centre. A transmission will include those transactions collected during the night. For
        Automated Payments clients, Monday's transmission includes transactions for Friday and
        Saturday. Specific service agreements for each client will state the transmission times and
        excefi Jons for that client.

        For higher volume clients, transmissions use Kilostream. ISDN is being investigated for
        the near future, and will be used for the Benefits Agency. For other clients, transmissions
        use PSTN, with V.32 bis modems using data compression and error correction. Most
        transmissions are to a dedicated PC using XCOM. The Benefits Agency transmission will
        use FTP to a Unix buffer system. Others are direct to the client mainframe.

        Automated Payment client interfaces conform generally to one of four standards. The
        magnetic stripe transaction interface is similar to the BACS standard. The smart key
        interface is to a Schlumberger client front end system. The WATERCARD interface is to a
        GEC Meters client front ·end system. The PISCES interface is to a standard agreed jointly
        with Landis and Gyr, Sligos and Yorkshire Electricity.

        There is also a daily transmission of Automated Payments transactions to the POCL finance
        systems based in Chesterfield. This is a transaction level interface. This also uses XCOM
        over a Kilostream link.

                                Polling and Terminal Control Service

        The smart card and smart key products have tariff and hot list information. A tariff file is
        received from the client to be distributed to a defined set of terminals. Similarly, a hot list
        type file is received from the client system to be distributed to a defined set of terminals.

        For the Benefits Agency, a stop list update file is received from the client each night. This
        file consists of new and amended entries, and deletions from the master file.

        The host contacts the client system daily to determine whether a file is available for
        collection. The specific client service agreement states the rules for collection and
        replacement of existing files. Generally, the files are collected during the early evening for
        distribution during that night's polling phases.

        The distribution will be to a client agreed set of terminals only. The set will be defined for
        each client's distribution requirement.

2.4     Products Supported

        The system supports the following products:

               magnetic stripe card;
               Schlumberger smart key for water and electricity;
               GEC Meters WATERCARD;
               Landis & Gyr PISCES electricity smart card;
               British Gas Quantum charging
               Electronic Stop Notice System for benfits payments,

2.4.1   Magnetic Stripe Card

        Utilities issue magnetic stripe cards to their customers. The card identifies on track 2 and in
        the embossing the client, customer and service (e.g. token saJe, prepayment). The customer
        presents the card at the counter with a payment. At an automated office (APT or ECCO+),
        the magnetic stripe is read and the transaction information is captured. This information is
        polled overnight by the host and then sent to the client.

        At an office with an imprinter, the embossing is captured onto a sales voucher, which is
        electronically processed at the document processing centre. The transactions are polled by
        the host daily and merged with the transactions from the automated offices.

2.4.2   Schlumberger Smart Key for Water and Electricity

        The utilities issue smart keys to their customers. The key carries value and tariff
        information to a meter or customer interface unit, and meter readings back to the
        transaction terminal. The transaction is very similar to the magnetic stripe card, except that
        the terminal updates the key with new tariff information and the money vaJue of the
        transaction. The transaction information is passed to the client, and in a separate
        communication session, thr. new tariff file is receiw•.d from the client.

                              Polling and Terminal Control Service

       Enhancements to the product include the use of special attention lists - a form of hot list.
       The special attention list is received from the client in the same communication session, and
       is distributed as a replacement file to all terminals agreed between POCL and the client.

       The host translates some of the tariff and special attention list file information to the
       terminal format before distribution. It also translates some of the transaction information.

2.4.3   GEC Meters WATERCARD

        This is similar in operation to the Schlumberger product. A smart card is used by the
        customer instead of a smart key. The hot list is known as an update list.

        The host translates some of the tariff and update list file information to the terminal format
        before distribution. It also translates some of the transaction information.

2.4.4   Landis & Gyr PISCES Electricity Smart Card.

        This is similar in operation to the Schlumberger product. A smart card is used by the
        customer instead of a smart key. The hot list is known as a command message file, and
        each message is distributed to a target set of up to three terminals. The host assembles
        command messages for each terminal before distribution.

        The host translates some of the tariff and update list file information to the terminal format
        before distribution. It also translates some of the transaction information.

2.4.5   British Gas Quantum

        British Gas issues smart cards to its customers. The card carries value and tariff
        information to a meter, and meter readings back to the transaction terminal. The
        transaction is very similar to the magnetic stripe card, except that the terminal updates the
        card with new tariff information and the money value of the transaction. The transaction
        information is passed to the client, and new tariff information is received from the client.

        The product also includes hot lists. The hot list is received from British Gas and is
        distributed to terminals. The hot list comprises messages and actions targetted at specific
        customers. When a smart card is inserted in a terminal, the terminal will apply the action or
        message to the card if the card is identifed as relating to the customer. The card in tum will
        apply the action or message to the meter when the card is inserted in the meter.

2.4.6   Electronic Stop Notice System

        This is a benefits payment product, rather than an inpayment product. Each customer has a
        benefit book with a bar code on the front cover. The bar code is read at the terminal to
        identify the customer. The bar code information is checked against a stop list to see
        whether the payment can be made, or the book retained for dispatch to the Benefits Agency.
        A transaction record is created, but no financial information is captured.

        Each night the host polls the transaction information for onward dispatch to the Benefits
        Agency computer. The stop list is updated each night from a file received from the host.

2.5     Current Management Organisation

        Currently, the POCL systems are managed from within the Automated Payments and ALPS
        projects. The reporting structure is as follows :

3.         REQUIREMENTS

           The requirements identified below must be satisfied in order that a service acceptable to
           POCL is provided. The requirements are grouped in the headings of the processes
           identified in section 2.1. Text in italics is for information to support the requirement.

3.1        Transaction Collection from POCL Terminal Network

           Transactions are stored in files on the office terminals. Currently, there is one transaction
          file for each type of transaction (magnetic stripe card, WATER.CARD, PISCES, smart key
          andE:SNS).

           For each terminal, a polling window will be established by POCL. '/'he polling window
           may be a half hour window in the early phase, or it may be the regular phase window. To
           the terminal, the polling window will be identified in the te17!'inal control reference data.

           For the ALPS PC offices, there will be two polling windows each night.

          Should it not be possible to collect transactions during the normal polling window, ad-hoe
          po/Ii,.6 during the working day may be required '/'his may also be necessary if the office
          reports that the terminal has reached its capacity for transactions.

3 .1.1     Transaction files must be collected from the APTs and ECCo+ systems according to the
           defined protocols.

3 .1.2     Transaction files must be collected from the ALPS systems according to the defined
           protocols.

3.1.3      Each terminal must be polled in its defined polling windows. Up to three attempts must be
           made to achieve a successful poll. Only one successful poll must be established with any
           terminal in each of its windows. An alternative strategy may be to propose the installation
           of dedicated lines in all offices, in which case polling may take place in a wider window.
           '/'his strategy must take account of the need to distribute files received from clients (see
           3.5.3).

3. 1. 4    Terminals must be polled on Monday night through to Saturday night, except as indicated in
           3.1.5.

                                  Polling and Terminal Control Service

3.1.5     Terminals will not be ready for polling on a Bank or other local holiday for the office in
          which the terminal is located. Polling need not be attempted to terminals on defined local
          holidays. In any case these attempts should not be counted as failures. APT and ECCO+
          systems will not be polled on Saturday night.

3. 1. 6   In many offices, more than one terminal will share a telephone line. Terminals will answer
          poll calls in the order of their terminal numbers. Any retry strategy for failed polling must
          take into account the need to maintain this order.

3 .1.7    A poll success rate of 97% must be achieved for 99% of normal polls.

3 .1. 8   Polling of individual terminals during the working day must be possible. This must be
          initiated by the polling service if a terminal has not been polled successfully on two
          successive nights. The time of poll will be agreed with the outlet.

3 .1. 9   Should an office report that a terminal has reached its capacity to the POCL operational
          help desk, the help desk will request that the service initiate a poll of the terminal. This poll
          must be initiated within 1 hour, following agreement with the outlet.

3.2       Transaction Collection from Document Processing Centre

3.2.1     Transaction files must be collected from the DPC according to the protocols defined in ref.
          1.5.2.

3.2.2     The DPC must be polled on Monday night through to Friday night, excepting Christmas
          Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day only.

3.2.3     A poll success rate of 990/o must be achieved.

3.3       New Software Distribution

          POCL will prepare a new version of the software programs in the APT. Typically 4-6 new
          versions may be expected in a year. Cu"ent/y, this service is required for APTs only. It
          may be extended to other platforms at a later stage however. For any platform, the
          software programs may be presented as one or more files.

3.3 .1    An electronic communication or magnetic medium link must be established for the receipt
          of new versions of software from POCL.

3.3.2     Following receipt of a new version of software programs for distribution, the software must
          be distributed successfully to all APTs in the managed network within 5 working days.

3. 3. 3   The previous version of software must be held ready for distribution as a contingency,
          should operational problems be experienced with the new version. If requested, the
          previous version of the software must be distributed successfully to all APTs in the
          managed network within 5 working days of the request.

3.3.4     Software must be distributed according to the identified protocols.

                                  Polling and Terminal Control Service



3. 4      Reference Data Distribution

          Reference data is used to determine the terminal's control characteristics, and to identify
          the clients for which POCL is providing a service at any terminal. New reference data is
          preparedfor issue whenever a new client service is provided Reference data may be
          supplied as one or more files.

3. 4 .1   Following receipt of a new version of a reference data file for distribution, the file must be
          distributed successfully to all APTs and ECCo+ offices in the managed network within 5
          working days.

3.4.2     The previous version of the file must be held ready for distribution as a contingency, should
          operational problems be experienced with the new version. If requested, the previous
          version of the file must be distributed successfully to all APTs and ECCo+ offices in the
          managed network within 5 working days of the request.

3.4.3     Reference data files must be distributed according to the identified protocols.

3.5       'Hot list' and Tariff File Distribution

          Hot list, update and tarifffiles are received from the client for distribution to a defined
          target set of terminals. Typically, new tarifffiles are available twice a year for .each client.
          The tarifffile is specific to a client. A new hot list file may be prepared each day for those
          clients using hot lists.

3. 5. I   For each client providing hot list and tariff files, the files must be requested and received
          according to the protocols defined in the respective client interface specification. This
          specification also defines cut-off times for file reception.

3.5.2     For each Automated Payments hot list file and tariff file, the file must be processed and
          translated prior to distribution into the defined format for distribution.

3.5.3     For each new hot list or tariff file received, the file must be distributed to a target list of
          terminals during that night's polling phases. POCL will define the target terminal population
          for each client file to be distributed. POCL will also define the earliest window in which
          terminals are polled to which distribution must be achieved for any particular file. This will
          be related to the cut-off time in 3.5.1 above, and will be no less than half an hour after the
          cut-off time.

3. 5.4    Hot list and tariff files must be distributed according to the defined protocols.

3.5.5     For any client, the file reception must be successful on 97% of valid days.

3.5. 6    The distribution success rate to be achieved is as for polling ( see 3. J.6).

                                 Polling and Terminal Control Service


          The APT and ALPS system times are controlled by the host system. There are no facilities
          on the APTfor time change in the office.

3.6. 1    The polling system must maintain an internal clock which is accurate to within one minute
          oflocal time (BST or GMT according to time of year.)

3.6.2     The polling system must ensure that all APTs and ALPS offices are synchronised with its
          time, according to the defined protocols.

3. 6. 3   The polling system must maintain a clock change file for APT standard time changes in the
          defined format.

3.6.4     The polling system must distribute the clock change file to all APTs no later than four
          weeks in advance of any clock change to which the file relates.

3. 7      ECCo+ System Recovery

          The ECCO+ system uses a recovery file to facilitate recovery following a system failure.

3.7.1     The ECCO+ recovery file must be collected from all ECCO+ offices, and ALPS offices
          providing AP within ECCO+ functions, in the polling network during every polling session,
          according to the defined protocols.

3. 7.2    On request from POCL, a recovery file for a specific office must be downloaded at an
          agreed time during the day. The service commitment must be to guarantee that this may be
          within 1 working hour after the request.

3.8       New Terminal Support

          From time to time POCL will introduce automation to new offices, or add terminals to
          existing offices. An installation and training coordinator will commission the terminal in
          the office and coordinate the loading of new software and reference data. The details of
          the office and terminal, including services to be offered, will be made available normally
          at least two weeks prior to the commissioning.

3. 8 .1   Following a request from POCL, software and reference data for the new terminal must be
          prepared.

3.8.2     On request from the installation coordinator on the agreed installation date, the prepared
          software and reference data (see 3.8.1) must be downloaded to the new terminal within 30
          minutes of the request.

3.8.3     On request from the installation coordinator, a poll of test transactions will be initiated,
          within 30 minutes of the request. These test transactions will be distinguishable from client

3.8.4      The new terminal must be added to the nightly polling schedule in the window previously
           agreed with POCL, and be polled from the night of the installation date onwards.

3.8.5      During the initial contact with the installation coordinator at the office, a terminal serial
           number will be provided for recording in the polling system for later use in terminal
           authentication. The terminal serial number must be recorded in the system prior to any poll
           of test or live transactions.

3.9        Terminal Replacement Support

           From time to time, terminals may fail in offices. They will be replaced under a
           maintenance contract with a third party within 8 working hours.

3.9.1      Following a terminal failure requiring replacement, the details of the replaced terminal must
           be removed from the polling schedules, and the details of the new terminal added.

3.9.2      Support for the commissioning of the new terminal must be provided as in 3.8.1 to 3.8.5
           above.

3.10       Collation of Oient Transactions

           Transactions collectedfrom the various office platforms and the DPC will be for a number
           of different clients and services. In order to prepare for transmission of transactions to
           clients in batchedfiles the transactions must be sorted by client.

3.10.1 All transactions collected from the APTs, ECCO+ and ALPS offices and DPC must be
       sorted by client into client files for later transmission (see 3.11), except where indicated in
       3 .10.2. Any transaction collected must appear only once in a client file.

3. 10.2    For magnetic stripe card transactions, reversed and reversing pairs of transactions must not
           be placed in client files. Test transactions, identified as relating to test clients, must not be
           pla~ in client files.

3.10.3     The transactions must be arranged in the client files in the order specified in the relevant
           client interface specification. Generally, no sorting is required

3. 10. 4   Where it is not possible to identify the client, the transaction will not be placed on a client
           file (but see 3. 13).

3 .1O. 5 Files must be assembled in order to satisfy any timing requirements for transmission. For
         some clients, more than one file may be prepared and dispatched each day. If only one file
         is required, it must contain all transactions for the client collected overnight. If more than
         one file is required, all transactions must be contained in the set of files for that night's
         processing. Generally, only one file will be required Where more than one file is
         required, it is to achieve an earlier delivery of some transactions to facilitate client
         processing. The target for ,:my earJ;er delive~, will be definPd in the interface
         specification. It is anticipated that only two clients will require more than one daily
         transmission.

3.11       Onward Transmission to Clients

           Generally, client files are dispatched to clients using communication links (PSTN or
           Kilostreaml/SDN). For every client, POCL will agree an interface specification which
           forms part of the contracted service that POCL provides to the client. Some transmissions
           are timed to reach clients before the start of their day for customer service reasons.
           Others may be timed to reach the client before ovemight batch processing.

3 .11. 1   Client files must be delivered to clients according to the protocols defined in the relevant
           interface specification.

3 .11.2    Client files must be delivered to clients to the timings defined in the relevant interface
           specification.

3 .11.3    Retransmissions following failures must be effected according to the procedures stated in
           the relevant inteiface specification.

3.12       Service Agreement Reporting

           Service agreement reporting is required to demonstrate to POCL that the service standards
           expected are being met. This applies not only to standards specified within this document,
           but also to standards required to meet client contractual commitments.

3.12.1     A daily reconciliation report must be produced to show transaction volumes for all
           collections and client transmissions since the last report. The report must include all
           transactions for which no client is identified, and show reversed and reversing pair volumes
           not delivered to magnetic stripe card product clients.

3.12.2     Daily reports must be produced to show that requirements for service specified in earlier
           sections are being met.

3 .12.3    For each client, a report must be produced daily showing transaction volumes by source
           (APT, ECCO+, ALPS, DPC) and by age (day B, day C, etc.) based on transaction date
           related to transmission date to client.

3 .12.4    For all client transmissions, a report must be produced to show the peiformance of client
           transmissions. This report will give date and time of all transmissions whether successful or
           not.

3.13       Oient Transaction Transmission to POCL Accounting Centre

3. 13 . 1 Details of all Automated Payments transactions must be transmitted to the POCL
          accounting centre mainframe, according to the defined. This includes all reversed and
          reversing transactions, and all transactions for which a client cannot be identified.

3 .13 .2   Transmissions must be achieved to the specified timings.
