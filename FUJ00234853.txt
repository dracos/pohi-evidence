This is related to call PCO156078 where marooned transactions were reinserted. 50 APS
transactions is the correct number of transactions we were expecting to see so I will
send them for processing as per the KEL.

Date:07-Apr-2008 16:16:57 User:John Charlton

Checked APS transactions and they all match the transactions I was expecting to see

Sent for normal processing with APS Transaction Exception tool. Will check for filenames
tomorrow.
