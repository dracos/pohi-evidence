Term Definition

Bank_Transaction_Id Message sequence number assigned by the message originator (except HNG-X), to
assist in identifying a transaction uniquely. Stays unchanged through the life of the
transaction.

C4 Settlement Date The Settlement Date provided on the C4 transaction.

Exception Types Within all reports the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:

* ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more transaction component is
missing — a C4 without a C12 etc

© Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high level
transaction are of different value, e.g. C12 (amount) not = to C4 (amount).

Transaction corruptions

Horizon_Txn_Num Unique transaction number to be used in all messages between HNG-X and the Fl's
relating to the transaction. Generated by HNG-X and provided in the request
message initiating the transaction.

‘New’ Transactions Transactions that have had a change of state since they were last reported, or have
never been reported except in NB102 section 6. Note that if a transaction appears in
NB102 section 6 it is future dated as is reported in that section for information only.
Once future dated transactions become current dated, they must be reported as
though they have not appeared on the reports before.

‘Old’ Transactions Transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they were last reported.

POL FS Transactions From a Branch / Post Office Ltd. perspective, a transaction that has been sent from

TPS to Post Office Ltd. POL FS. From a system perspective, a ‘C112’ transaction.

Receipt Date Receipt Date is the Date as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It
forms part of all transactions

Receipt Time Receipt Time is the Time as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It
forms part of all transactions.

Reconciliation Date The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to allow Post Office
Ltd. to reconcile. It will be set the first available Bank Settlement date from the
transaction elements (C112, C12, C4, S & D) that make up a Network Banking
transaction. If no Bank Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be
set to the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first recorded any
element of the transaction being received. If a Settlement date subsequently
becomes available, the first available Bank Settlement date will replace the
processing date. However, once a transaction has been accounted for on the
reconciliation reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific transaction should be
sought.
Run Date This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, i.e. all transaction

components processed by the DRS on System Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are
accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial Institutions may
assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the following Monday may be set on
transactions processed on the preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

0.7 Changes Expected

Expected changes should the HNG-X design or solution require amendment to the RECONCILIATION
REPORTS provided by Fujitsu Services.

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1 Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify Fujitsu Services outputs from the Data Reconciliation
Service (DRS) so as to enable a generic end to end reconciliation of

1. Banking and Related Services transactions, which includes DCS and ETS
2. Automated Payment System (APS)
3. Transaction Processing System (TPS)

2 Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for HNG-X, which satisfies the
DRS reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define within the operating systems how the
transactions are processed.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within Fujitsu Services and
Post Office Ltd. with respect to the resolution of any exceptions, which may arise, nor does it scope the
requirement for any systems that may be required to assist in this process.

This information can be found in the associated documents, reference:

e SVM/SDM/PRO/0012: Reconciliation and Incident Management - Joint Working Document

3 Network Banking Reconciliation Reports
Specified

For Network banking services, it is assumed that each of the Post Office Ltd. Clients, as dictated by

Routing Gateway (assumed to be at this point the Banks / LINK) will require a separate reconciliation

report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:

Report Deposit Withdrawal
Number Transactions Transactions
NB101 Combined Report

NB102 Combined Report

NBOOO is a combined report for all Routing Gateways.

The format and content of each Client's report is considered to be identical when allowing for these
specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the specifications documented here are
applicable to each Client report set (specific Client requirements outside of this reporting specification
are not covered within this document).

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the Routing Gateway and/or
Transaction Type is not known.

Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the report set as ‘Not Required by Post
Office Ltd.’

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of reports are not of a
single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for each currency. All the amounts in a
single transaction will always use the same currency

« NBOOO: DRS Summary
e NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement
e NB102: Exception Summary

Rows and columns are described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations required to
achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are described.

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘State’ definition is quoted, this takes precedence over any
narrative which has only been provided to help understand the business processes.

3.1 General Banking and Related Services Report
Specifications

A separate set of reports is produced for each Post Office Ltd. Client as identified by the Routing
Gateway (LINK being a single Client). The specification is general to all reports sets.

1. For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow settlement
totals to be correctly derived, will be:

Absolute volume

Net value

Where no value reported show “0.00”

Where no volume reported show 0.

-ve values will be shown in brackets e.g. (nnn.nn)

2. Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the Client name (derived from Routing Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.e., the period for which the report refers

Production date and time

Fujitsu Services report number

Fujitsu Services reference

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

e ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since they were
last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section 6

e ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they
were last reported

4. Reports: NBOOO, NB101 and NB102 will be produced DAILY. They will be delivered by
08.00hrs the day following the Run Date to:

e Post Office Ltd. / POL FS gateway: The Host writes the reports to a directory. These are
picked up by FTMS and posted to the POL FS gateway (as per other Host to external
systems applications).

5. Within report NB 102 the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:
e ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more transaction component is
missing — a C4 without a C12 etc
e Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high level
transaction have been exceptioned, e.g. C12 (amount) not = to C4 (amount).
e Transaction corruptions

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and not within
the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files - one for each report. The report layout will be
fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This will allow for ‘Excel’ input,
using fixed field width facilities. The formatting (lines & shading referred to in this document)
will not be included within the file. Every line will have the character ‘newline’, Hex 'OA', as
the last character. Each report will have the text “End of Report’ as the last line.

9. See also comments in Section 2: ‘Scope’

3.2 NB000: Summary Report

This report summarises all reconciliation reports produced by the DRS. It also summarises all reports
that were not produced by the DRS because there was no data to report.

3.2.1 NBOOO: Rules
1. Reports are listed by application type, Routing Gateway, and report number.

2. Where a report is produced, the filename will be shown.

3. Where for a routing gateway, there is some data to report, but for a specific report there is no data,
then the filename will be replaced by [NO DATA].

Where for a routing gateway there is no data at all, the application type cannot be shown and the file
name will be replaced by [NIL RETURN].

3.3. NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement

This report identifies ‘C4’ transactions received against each ‘C4 Settlement Date’ as reported to
the DRS for the most recent processing date. The report will be used by Post Office Ltd. as a
basis for settlement of Network Banking transactions with the Financial Institutions.

3.3.1 NB101: Rules

NB101 is run daily

NB101 is repeated for each Routing Gateway

NB101 will show ‘C4’ transactions received for ONE day only — breaking these down into

individual ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ There will be one line for each ‘C4 Settlement Date’

4. NB101 will show Deposit and Withdrawal transactions in separate columns, (headed
‘Receipts’ and ‘Payments’ respectively) derived from ‘Txn_Type’

5. NB101 will show a final settlement column derived in the following way:

e Volume: Volume of Deposits plus Volume of Withdrawals

e« Value: Value of Deposits minus Value of Withdrawals

e Where the net total is negative i.e. the Value of Withdrawals exceeds the Value of
Deposits, the total will be shown as (xxx.xx)

Where the volume for a given ‘C4 Settlement Date’ is nil, the date will not be reported.

‘C4 Settlement Dates’ are shown in reverse chronological order.

Where there is more than one institution with the same Routing Gateway, the values for the

institutions will be shown individually provided the transaction volume for that institution is

greater than zero.

‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the ‘D’ discrepancy type.
Where no ‘D’ transaction element has been received, the ‘Discrepancy Type’ will be blank

6. Where an exception is set to F99 by Fujitsu Services , clearance of this exception within the
appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown as cleared within section 8),
will always refer to the previously reported state regardless of any change of state which
may have occurred within the DRS.

Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions >24 hours are listed individually —

(NB102 section 11)

Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client identified by

Routing Gateway — (NB102 Section 12)

Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be grouped

and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire section.

For reporting purposes:

e Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement date
allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same as the
reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

e Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a Reconciliation Date
ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most Clients will settle Friday,
Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following Monday. This means that each
transaction completed on these days will have a Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run
Date of the report. These transactions are expected to clear naturally once the
Reconciliation Date and the Run Date are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a
Reconciliation Date is considerably ahead of the Run Date, Post Office Ltd. may wish to
clear the exception manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services will set the transaction to
‘FQ9’.

For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the column headed

‘Transaction Type’ will be populated by the following codes:

« 03 - Withdrawal; Magstripe & PIN Verification (Banking and Related Services)
e 04 - Withdrawal with balance; Magstripe & PIN Verification (Banking and Related

Services)

05 - Withdraw Limit; Magstripe & PIN Verification (Banking and Related Services)

13 - Withdrawal; Signature Verification (Banking and Related Services)

14 - Withdrawal with balance; Signature Verification (Banking and Related Services)

15 - Withdraw Limit; Signature Verification (Banking and Related Services)

22 - Cash Deposit; No Verification (Banking and Related Services)

27 - Cheque Deposit; No Verification (Banking and Related Services)

31 - Purchase; Magstripe & PIN Verification (DCS)

32 - Refund; Magstripe & PIN Verification (DCS)

41 - Purchase; Signature Verification (DCS)

42 - Refund; Signature Verification (DCS)

51 - Sale; No Verification (ETS)

52 - Refund; No Verification (ETS)

67 - Cheque Deposit; ICC (Banking and Related Services)

For Banking and Related Servicesreconciliation reporting, System States 8, 9, 10, 11, 16,

17, 18, 19, 20, 21,22,23, E05, E06, E07, E14, E22, E24, E31, E32, E33, E38 are never

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

In summary, The Transaction Management Service accumulates APS transactions from HNG-X
Branches centrally during the day. TPS harvester and the APS Harvester both harvest APS transactions
from TMS at the end of the processing day. The TPS Harvester harvests all TPS (including APS)
transactions to the TPS Host system whereas the APS Harvester harvests only APS transactions to the
APS Host system. Both harvesters are synchronised to ensure that the same cut-off point is applied to
transaction harvesting for each Branch and, consequently, each harvester harvests the same APS
transactions.

The TPS Host system delivers harvested TPS transactions to POLFS.

4.1 Reconciliation between Client Transmission files and
CTS

The end to end transaction flows are supported by validation processes which verify that the transactions
processed by the APS Host are consistent with the transactions included in each Client Transmission
File and with the CTS sub-file sent to Post Office Ltd.

This validation is carried out for the volume of normal transactions and the value of all transactions only
in each of these files. Any differences in this reconciliation will cause an operational alert to be raised
and the appropriate file delivery to be suspended.

A Validation Status report (section 4.8) will be produced as part of this validation process and the results
of this notified to Post Office Ltd.

4.2 Accounting Sense

Reconciliation reporting operates on a seven day a week basis regardless of the Client file transmission
schedule (which may, for example, exclude weekends and bank holidays). In principle, reconciliation
reporting totals volume and value for transactions. It includes reversals by adding volume and
subtracting value.

Thus, for In-pay transactions:

e Volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Value is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal value is positive and subtracted (net result: subtract)
For Out-pay transactions:

e Volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Value is negative and added (net result: subtract)

e Reversal volume is positive and added (net result: add)

e Reversal value is negative and subtracted (net result: add)

Reporting has to be able to show a representation of negative value. To be consistent with other
reconciliation reporting from HNG-X, this will be done with the use of brackets rather than the use of a
prefix sign, e.g. (23.42) represents the value -23.42.

4.3 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Points

Four reconciliation points are identified. These are shown in the diagram below. Note that HAPS and the
Legacy Branches (shaded in the diagram for clarity) are now historic and so there is no data flow via
those routes. Values are reported as zero where it is still specified that the reporting take place.

Reconciliation Point R1 is the main APS Host reconciliation and reporting point. It confirms the APS
accounts are balanced for the processing day and provides a balance statement, a Client delivery
summary report and a transaction exception report.

Reconciliation Point R2 is transaction reconciliation between:

« the APS transactions at Branches;

e the APS transactions delivered by TPS to POLFS;

« the APS transactions delivered by APS to Clients.
It provides a reconciliation summary report, transaction exception Client account and detailed reports.
Reconciliation Point R3 reports on HNG-X Branches, which have not been harvested.

Reconciliation Point R4 is an intermediate point to help the operational management. It is not necessary
to meet requirements. It confirms consistency between:

e the APS transactions at Branches;
e the APS transactions harvested by APS Clients.

4.4 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Point 1

4.4.1 Description

At the beginning of a normal processing day (about 8am), the APS Host is expected to have delivered all
APS transactions for previous processing days to Clients. However, there may be some transactions left
over because they have failed APS validation at some point. The most likely reasons for a transaction to
be in an exception state are:

e A transaction has failed a HNG-X security check.
« Atransaction has failed another APS validation check.

During normal Branch hours, action is taken to resolve these transactions and, once resolved, the most
likely outcome is that the transaction is returned into normal processing mode. However, the APS Host
system does cater for instances where an APS transaction cannot be returned to normal processing and
needs to be processed manually. Therefore, during normal Branch hours, exception transactions may be
returned to normal processing or, possibly in very rare circumstances, put into manual processing.

During the evening of the processing day, APS transactions from the HNG-X counters are harvested and
delivered to the APS Host. The HNG-X transactions are validated by the APS Host and are put into an
exception state if validation fails.

The APS Host delivers all valid APS transactions to migrated APS Clients within the operational
schedule leaving the system with just the transactions in an exception state.

This reconciliation point is at the end of the processing day when all these transaction flows are
reconciled and reported.

Objectives: To provide details of all transactions which have not been delivered by Fujitsu Services
because they have been delayed within the APS Host system. Initial Customer Support resolution will
cause the transactions to be returned for normal processing or sent to manual for manual processing. No
equivalent report is produced for APS transactions in TPS as there is no delaying mechanism in the TPS
Host System. All transactions are passed through to POLFS.

4.5 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Point 2

4.5.1 Description

Normally, APS transactions flow through the TPS Host to POLFS and through the APS Host system to
Clients within the same working day. However, the rules associated with the processing of APS
transactions within the TPS Host and the APS Host systems are different. The APS Host needs to apply
a number of extra rules mainly to support Client migration. Consequently, transactions may be placed in
exception status by APS but be accepted as valid by TPS. In addition, there may be error conditions
where the TPS and APS Harvesters are not fully synchronised.

This reconciliation point is at the end of the processing day. It reconciles the
e APS transactions at Branches;
e APS transactions delivered by TPS to POLFS;

e APS transactions delivered by APS to Clients.

It maintains a record of which transactions have passed through the TPS side and which transactions
have passed through the APS side and on a daily basis it reports transactions which have been
processed by one side and not the other.

example, due to business processing rules for TPS and APS being different. For Dates 1 and 2 only,
unmatched TPS transactions will not be detailed individually, but a total count and value will be entered.
For Dates 3 to N, unmatched TPS transactions will be detailed individually.

APS/Client Only: Unmatched APS transactions are transactions that appear in APS and are delivered
to Clients but for which there are no matching TPS transactions. Such transactions are not expected
other than in error conditions. For Dates 1 and 2 only, unmatched APS transactions will not be detailed
individually, but a total count and value will be entered. For Dates 3 to N, unmatched APS transactions
will be detailed individually.

Error Message: The error message identifying the APS transaction discrepancy. This includes problems
concerning synchronisation between HNG-X and POLFS on Client accounts, HNG-X security checks,
and transaction validation checks. The message “Unmatched” will be used for unmatched TPS or APS
transactions.

Difference: The Value of the TPS/POLFS Transaction minus the Value of the APS/Client Transaction.
Note: Difference 3 is the Unmatched TPS Value minus the Unmatched APS Value.

Total Difference: The Count of the total Number of TPS Transactions minus the total Number of APS
Transactions, and the total Value of the Difference for all Transactions for the specified date.

Reconciliation Error: Total Difference minus Difference (2) from the Daily TPS / APS Transaction
Reconciliation Summary Report for the specified date (see section 5.2.2).

Value fields: If any value to be reported is negative, then it shall be enclosed in brackets. For example,
the value -£4.23 shall be shown as (4.23).

4.6 APS Reconciliation / Reporting Point 3
4.6.1 Description

The APS harvester attempts to harvest all APS transactions from all HNG-X Branches each day.
However, there will be error conditions where this is not fully achieved, possibly because of a
communication link issue or failure of the counter gateway PC.

This reconciliation point is on completion of the APS Harvester. The APS Harvester provides the APS
Host with details of which Branches have been harvested each day. The APS Host correlates these
details with reference data information on Branch automation and Branch opening days and maintains a
record of the number of working days since each Branch was last harvested. A report is produced each
day of Branches, which are scheduled to be open and have not been harvested.

4.7.1 Description

The APS harvester attempts to harvest all APS transactions from all HNG-X Branches each day.
However, there may be error conditions where this is not fully achieved, and a transaction that took place
in an Branch is not harvested.

This reconciliation point is on completion of the APS Harvester. It identifies Branches where the
harvested APS transaction number and value totals are different to the totals at the Branch.

5 TPS Reconciliation Reports Specified

The Transaction Processing System (TPS) Report Set has been designed to enable reconciliation of the
transactions carried out in Post Office branches using the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS)
which are sent to POLFS and POLMIS.

The TPS exceptions report set identified herewith reports errors that have occurred within counter
transactions or during the harvesting process.

NB: For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal reconciliation produced between the POLFS and
POLMIS transaction stream. The POLMIS stream should therefore not be used to verify financial
integrity and Post Office Ltd should ensure the TPS Report Set and POLFS transaction stream are used
for this purpose.

IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT FUJITSU SERVICES WILL DELIVER ANY OF THE TPS
RECONCILIATION REPORT SET IDENTIFIED HEREWITH TO POST OFFICE LTD.

The reports specified below are Horizon based Reconciliation Report set.
This may change or be replaced when the HNG-X transition happens.

The following data is reported for each branch.

Data Attribute

Description

Trading Date

‘The Calendar Date that the EOD Marker was written. EOD Marker defines the
end of a Trading Day. N.B. The time the EOD Marker is written varies from
Branch to Branch.

Group Id

Group Id (Branch Code without the check sum) for the branch.

Article Id

POL FS Article

All HNG-X Products will map to a POL FS Article. This may be a dummy article
to facilitate the consistent mapping of all HNG-X Products.

Dummy articles will be for items such as Cash in hand, cheques etc that will not
map to an article in POL FS but actually map to a GL or Agent Account instead.

Transaction
Mode Id

HNG-X Mode the product was transacted in, e.g. Sell, Rem In, Revaluation, etc.

Settlement

Defines which data is used to settle with the Client

P = Post office data

Client Data

E = Estimated data

This is required as there will be a different indicator used within POL FS to
differentiate these data types. (Special GL indicator).

This is optional as it is only relevant to Client products and transactions that need
to feed the Client ledger.

Ledger

Defines which Ledger the POL FS account belongs in

G = General Ledger

Client Ledger (AP)

A= Agents Ledger (AR)

POL FS uses three different ledgers and needs to know which ledger each
account number is part of.

This field is optional in the file because records that relate only to stock
movements with no financial impact will not map to an account in any ledger.

Account

POL FS account number

This is the account number within the Ledger defined above. This field is optional
in the file because records that relate only to stock movements with no financial
impact will not map to an account in any ledger.

Movement Type

POL FS Movement type

This is only relevant for stocked products and allows different movement types
such as REM in, REM out, and adjustments to be shown differently in SAP.

There will be a consistent mapping between certain modes to movement types
but these will only be valid for particular Articles.

Account
Reference Id

Transaction Identifier (this field is needed if the information is being sent
unsummarised)

Controlled by reference data.

[DN: This is either the value of TPSTransaction.BlackBoxData.Pouchld or
TPSTransaction.BlackBoxData.TCReference. These are mutually exclusive and
can therefore be harvested into a single NEW attribute in the TPS interface table
