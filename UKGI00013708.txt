Note for Mark on Meeting with Tim Parker (10 November 2015)

Main priority for meeting is to get his first impressions of the business, now he has been in place for
around 6 weeks.

We can probe him on our priorities for the business currently:

e  IT—huge project to do a full IT refresh over next 2-3 years. ShEx concerned that POL has the
skills and capabilities (and budget)

e Horizon IT issue — it is a huge distraction for the business and we need to bring it toa

conclusion.

e Paula?
