Dear Michael

Re: Suspense account query

Thank you for your letter dated 14” January 2005 regarding your concerns
over the £1000 shortage being held in your suspense account and the issue

concerning ‘phantom’ banking transactions.

As requested I have forwarded your concerns to our problem management
team for them to investigate. As soon as they report back to me I will update

you.

Regards,
