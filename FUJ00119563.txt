Social Security Agency (NI) MASTER PLAN 16 August 1996

INTRODUCTION
Purpose

This document sets out the Master Plan for the delivery of
the PDA programme. It brings together the activities of
the BA, SSA, POCL and Pathway and covers the timescale up
to completion of the programme in 1999.

The objectives of this plan are to:

° integrate at the high level the activities of all
parties. Each activity on the plan will be supported by
a lower level sub-ordinate plan

© communicate key information on the status of the
programme regarding scope, implementation approach,
responsibilities and timescales

e clarify uncertainties and communicate their status

*® to provide the framework for ongoing management
(monitoring, reporting and control).

The plan will be updated as required, initially this is
expected to be monthly.

Status

This version of the plan was agreed by the PDA Board on
13 August for sign-off and general release. The changes
requested by the Board have been incorporated. It is
signed-off on the basis that the following have yet to be
addressed:

® the target dates are those which all the parties are
endeavouring to meet even where they may be different
from the baseline dates. It is intended that when change
control is introduced the baseline dates will be changed
formally

* the roll out programme has yet to be agreed. The
proposed roll out strategy has been approved by the
Board in principle and Pathway are to submit a detailed
plan. When this is received and agreed the roll-out plan
can be baselined

* the duration for Release 1 UAT is two months and assumes
the provision of a model office test environment
dedicated to the PDA from 1 November. This too is being
discussed together with other aspects required to
achieve this duration

* it has not been possible to yet ascertain the
intermediate milestones for all the strategic
milestones. These will be added when determined.
Similarly, as all the sub-ordinate plans are not in
place all interrelationships and the full set of
handshake milestones cannot yet be determined

* resourcing has to be applied and is dependent on the
development of sub-ordinate plans

* the POCL systems migration and testing plan has to be
developed

* contingency plans have to be developed.
The sign off means:

® commitment to work toward and achieve the (target) dates
on the basis that they will be endorsed by change
control (as appropriate in due course)

*° commitment to develop sub-ordinate plans in line with
the Master Plan

¢ baselining the business cases on the basis of the Master
Plan

* proceeding on the basis set-out in the Master Plan.
1.3 Related Documents

In preparing the plan we have sought to minimise
duplication with other documents. The plan should
therefore be read in conjunction with the following:

THE MASTER PLAN
Plan Structure

The plan has been structured with three principles in
mind;

1. The work (and the plan) divides into the eight groups
set out in section 2.2.

Group A - Initial go live which summarises the
intermediate milestones and activities leading to the
IGL strategic milestones (Al and A2)

Group B - Pilot which summarises the intermediate
milestones and activities leading to the Pilot
strategic milestones (Bl and B2)

Group C - Mainland PO roll-out which summarises the
roll-out of automation into offices; this is not
(strictly) dependent on product development {(C1-C99)

Group D - NI PO and SSA benefit roll-out which
summarises the roll-out of automation into NI POs
(D1-D99). In NI all offices are automated when the
products are delivered and the migration taken place
over the period shown. Milestones D4, D7 and D8
replicate the milestones E4, E6 and E7 respectively,
as they denote when these benefits become available
within Northern Ireland.

Group E - BA benefit roll-out which summarises the
delivery of BA benefits with the key intermediate
milestones, when defined (E1-E99)

Group F - POCL developments which covers the POCL AP
migration and settlement projects. (F1)

Group G - Pathway releases which sets out the
operational dates for Pathway releases 1 to 4 (G1-G4)

Group H - PDA Programme support which summarises the
PDA support activities (which will have sub-ordinate
plans) leading to the ‘programme complete’ strategic
milestone (H99) when all benefits can be paid
electronically and all POCL current products are re-
engineered, as appropriate.

Responsibilities

The responsibilities for the activities on the plan are
identified on the Gantt Chart and also the Activity

Descriptions.

Responsibilities are defined.in detail in the PID which
will be updated by the PDA as required. At a high level
the responsibilities of the parties are:

BA

e to deliver the CAPS systems on time and meeting the
requirements in the interface specification (feeds,
responses etc)

e to upgrade the functionality of equipment in BA offices
and centres, introduce new processes and train staff
appropriately

* to ensure customer data is migrated in a timely manner
to be fed to Pathway.

POCL
* to provide the TIP system in time for national roll-out,
preceded by manual systems or an appropriate prototype

for IGL and the pilot

* to provide reference data in a timely manner to meet the
roll-out programme

e to make staff available for training

e to edit, print and distribute appropriate Post Office
procedures

® to manage data links with client systems ensuring feeds
operate satisfactorily

* to specify re-engineered, and new, products for Pathway

to implement.

SSA
*® to upgrade the functionality of equipment in district

offices, introduce new processes and train staff
appropriately

Pathway

To provide the service as set out and defined in the
contract and in particular

e® to develop, test, implement, operate and maintain the
service

* to install equipment in Post Offices, write procedures
and train staff to meet the roll-out programme

® to produce cards and manage ail customer communications.
PDA

® to achieve overall management and co-ordination of the
programme to ensure the business case is met

® to monitor the development of the system to assure
satisfactory performance and that the service is fully
secure

* to co-ordinate the user requirements and sign these off
on behalf of the BA, SSA and POCL

e to manage the Pathway contract

*® to oversee Pathway testing (functional, performance and
security) and conduct end to end tests. To provide a
model test office with the full range of Post Office
equipment.

Plan Assumptions

In preparing the plan a number of assumptions have been
made. These are set out in Appendix F with the key ones
being:

® that the CAPS programme is able to meet the expected
dates for Pensions which is due at the start of the
national roll-out. The business case is highly
sensitive to the dates of pensions and IS/JSA combined
with the number of Post Offices automated

Page 13 of 15

Benefits Agency Programme Delivery Version 1

Post Office Counters Ltd Authority (PDA)

Social Security Agency (NI) MASTER PLAN 16 August 1996

e stability of the interface spec (v6) for all future CAPS
releases. CAPS developments will not require changes to
the Pathway software

* POCL will have systems acceptable to BA and other
clients for reconciliation and settlement allowing both
the pilot and national roll-out to proceed
satisfactorily

e that the POCL migration plan will maintain a seamless
service to the AP clients allowing the best reaction to
Cashstop. It is expected that POCL will, however, take
additional measures

* roll-out can ramp up to [300] offices per week total and
60 offices per week in any POCL region.

The plan is constrained by a number of factors. The key
constraints are:

® SSA require all Giro Payments to be transferred to card
by 31 March 1998

® Post Office roll-out must not disrupt POCL business
during the busiest trading period from mid November to
the end December

e PSCS and Incapacity Benefit will not be rolled-out
before the next election. It has been stated that the
Government would not risk upsetting pensioners in the
run-up to an election. Clearly, if the Government does
not call the election until the last possible date then
the programme will be delayed.

External Dependencies

The programme has few external dependencies. The primary
one is government policy and other political decisions or
priorities which may affect the direction or speed of the
programme.

The SSA are dependent on ITSA completing activities by
particular dates, as identified in the SSA plan

3.6 Internal Dependencies
The major dependencies between parties are identified as
handshake milestones in Appendix G and give the date for
the provider/recipient handover.
Other dependencies are built into the Gantt chart and are
included in the sub-plans. The routine planning review
process will develop the plans such that dependencies are
well understood and communicated to the responsible
parties by the programme management process.

3.7 Business Risks
The business risks are described in the PID and are not
repeated here. It may be appropriate at a later stage to
transfer them to this document.

3.8 Programme Organisation

the responsibilities. The supplier/sponsor organisation
is the responsibility of that supplier/sponsor.

APPENDIX B - STRATEGIC MILESTONE DEFINITIONS

The Strategic Milestone Definitions that follow describe the
required status that must be achieved, in a number of
categories, for the milestone to have been achieved.

The areas where then required status is defined is in the
categories:

external customers

products available

BA systems

BA/SSA offices and staff

POCL Systems/links

Post Offices, staff and agents
Pathway systems

PDA

eeee

The change column indicates whether a change in status from any
of the preceding milestones is required for this milestone to
be achieved. If the required status has been implemented for a
preceding milestone then no change is required (N) for this
milestone. If the required status appears for the first time
in this milestone the the change is required (Y) and needs to
be managed as part of the achievement of this milestone. The
responsibility for actioning the change is also defined.

The milestone definitions are an initial draft for detailed

review by all parties (including, for instance, training
groups) to ensure that they reflect the detailed plans

Social Security Agency (NI) MASTER PLAN 16 August 1996
APPENDIX F - ASSUMPTIONS

Assumption Description

Number

1 Batch Interface Spec (V6) is valid for’all CAPS

releases.

Implementation of additional BA Benefit
Payments does not require changes to Pathway
systems or training of PO staff (except where
specifically identified).

CAPS delivery schedules are achieved such that
live operation can commence as follows; Rel 1:
20 September 96; Rel 2: 16 December 96; Rel 3:
6 April 1997; Rel 4, September 1997; Rel 5:
January 1998. No other releases are foreseen
or planned for within the programme.

The BA are able to resolve the conflicts over
priority of access to the EDS systems (the CAPS
systems provider) at weekends for testing and
data conversion.

The BA will carry out special procedures to
ensure the convergence of Pension & ChB Payee
details to Personal Details Computer System
(PDCS) for Pension systems process testing to
start in March 97.

CAPS System redevelopment under the BA Change
Programme doesn’t change the interfaces and
that all necessary redevelopment of the BA
feeder systems will be completed in time for
the roll-out

The ‘on line’ authorisation and card stop
systems will be designed within timescales such
that they do not impact on earlier interfaces
and card procedures.

POCL will define and prioritise the re-
engineering of their current products by August

1996. First product specifications completed
by December 96 to be incorporated in the
October 1997 Pathway release.

Either TIP is available for the start of the
national roll-out in June 1997 or the printing
and re-keying of reports is accepted by BA and
POCL.

POCL will have a system acceptable to BA for
reconciling card payments by the live trials

In addition to BES; OBCS, EPOS and Automated
Payment (except for SMART card/key handling)
are included in Release 1.

The frequency of Pathway software releases wiil
be not more than two per year after initial
releases in December 1996 and October 1997.

All SSA benefits, including ChB (by January
1998), are identical to the Great Britain
systems.

The Functional Spec agreed on 30 June 1996
contains sufficient detail to allow development
to continue.

Initial Go Live with Child Benefit is limited
to 10 Post Offices.

The full introduction of PSCS/INCAP and IS/JSA
will be preceded by a Limited Go Live of
between 1 and 3 months limited to 10 Post
Offices.

There will be no Limited Go Live for the
introduction of FAMC/ETU/DWA and DLA/AA.

Once CAPS Release 2 is implemented (Jan 97)
then the BA will not be a constraint on the
rate of roll-out providing adequate notice of
plans is given.

The roll-out will start with large conurbations

and leave inside the M25 until the latter half
of the roll-out.

Six weeks of installation will be lost due to
Christmas 1997 and installation will be
completed by mid November 1998.

There will be a gradual ramp up in rate of
roll-out after the initial trials, increasing
to the target rate of 300 POs per week after,
say, 12 weeks, achieved by up to 7 teams
working in separate PO regions.

PO Regions will be able to cope with levels of
work generated by up to 60 POs being rolled out
per week in each region.

POCL back office and CAPS back office
(including EDS/ITS PO table building etc) can
cope with 300 POs per week.

OBCS will not affect roll-out strategy.

The roll-out schedule will allow commercial
action to combat Cashstop.

POCL reference data can be prepared manually to
meet the needs of the Initial Go Live.

The SSA will, in general, rely on the PDA team
for their Government and other communications.
However, they will maintain their own parallel
communication stream into the NI Ministers for
usé as appropriate. All customer
communications, including PUNs and forms, will
be received by the SSA to allow changes to
reflect the different Agency name,
organisations, legislative references etc.

Any help desks supporting the SSA will have
Slightly modified procedures for SSA calls,
reflecting their organisation and different
terminology and forms. The SSA will review the
procedures manual and identify any changes
required to reflect these differences.

The SSA will follow the Great Britain (GB) card
procedures.

The SSA will accept whatever account

reconciliation mechanism is agreed between BA
and POCL.

The project plans are unaffected by the
potential privatisation of the ChB Agency.

CAPS system functionality: Rel 1: capacity
limited to 1500 ChB payees by dependence on
manual procedures; Rel 2: dependence on manual
procedures removed, but only one benefit; Rel
3: supports multiple benefits; Rel 4: on-line
interface implemented, allowing IS & JSA to be
implemented; Rel 5: clears remaining clerical
payees

23 September 96 and 21 October 96 dates are set
in stone

The BA Business Plan assumes 200 POs per week
implementing ChB from 1 January 97, failure to
meet this will impact on the financial benefits

The SSA will implement payment of each benefit
by card either in parallel with the BA or
after. The roll-out of benefits will be
carried out in the same way as within the BA,
despite the differences in size and benefit
administration

Cards and customer documents will all be made
available for the SSA to review in sufficient
time for them to be customised and produced for
the roll-out

The NI POs will all be brought live in a single
hit over a period of approximately six weeks.

APPENDIX G - HANDSHAKE MILESTONES

The attached set of handshake milestones represents a set of
‘medium’ level handshake milestones agreed between Pathway and
the PDA. Further work is required to complete the list and
verify the detail from sub-ordinate plans as these are
developed. The precise status of the past dates is being
verified.

The list also requires the addition of the PDA responses to the
Pathway outputs.

This is scheduled for Version 2
