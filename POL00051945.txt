WORCESTER CROWN COURT
CASE POLTD/0809/0126

The above named Defendant appeared at Worcester Crown Court on 15 June 2009.
Following discussions between Counsel and consultation with this Office, the
Defendant pleaded guilty to Counts 4 and 5 of the Indictment on an agreed basis
reflecting the full loss of approximately £27,800.

A pre-sentence report was requested and the case was adjourned.

This matter is now listed on 3 August 2009 for sentence.

The case was adjourned to the above date to give the Defendant ample opportunity
to sell the post office and thereby repay the loss prior to sentence. The Sect 18

statement was not signed or served at Court however, in the event the outstanding
sum is not repaid, confiscation proceedings will be considered at the next hearing.
