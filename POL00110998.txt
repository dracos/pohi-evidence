POL00110998

Requests for Information 26 June 2018

Page 2 of 34

This document follows communications between the two experts to establish
agreement as to what information is needed by both experts.

Comment from Mr Coyne

Each of my requests is made in relation to the agreed ‘Horizon Issues’ and,
where appropriate, with reference to material already disclosed using the
agreed disclosure reference numbers.

Comments from Dr Worden

My general position is that I do not have any requests for information at this
stage because my current requirements for information are being met by the
110,000 documents that have been provided to the experts.

My view is that many of Mr Coyne's requests can be satisfied, at least in the
first instance, by asking Fujitsu to point him towards the appropriate documents
within those 110,000.

My own preference is to develop my understanding by reading some documents
which will enable me to ask the right focused questions, if necessary, after that.

It should also be noted that my focus and priorities are not necessarily aligned
with Mr Coyne's at this stage and the requests made by Mr Coyne suggest that
this is the case. Although I do not support requests that relate to lines of
enquiry that I am not pursuing at this stage that does not mean that I oppose
all of Mr Coyne's requests if he can show that they align with the Horizon Issues
and his lines of enquiry.

In relation to Issue 1:

1.1 [RFI 1.1] Please describe how a Subpostmaster (“SPM”) reports an issue
(detailed from the moment that SPM picks up the phone), how this is
recorded and how this is investigated (throughout the various ist, 2nd
and 3rd lines of support).

a. If a Peak/bug is ultimately determined, how is the impact
considered and what is the process of scheduling this into the
development cycle and then ultimately how is this recorded in the

code versioning system?

POL-0108608

b. When and how are changes agreed through to release
management, including the release notes for new versions and
which persons these are shared amongst?

c. Is there a consolidated complete release/version chronology
available for Horizon/Horizon Online with accompanying Release
Notes at final version?

Post Office's position is that

an issue is identified by Fu,
PO or an SPM.

No further documents or

response to request 1.1.

Dr Worden declines

Jason Coyne — “broadly

This is a factual question
and, in any event, Dr
Worden's view is that the

Jason Coyne — Request

with Dr Worden that this
question should be
delayed since Dr
Worden has not
specified when he is
willing to review KELs.

In relation to Issue 15:

1.54 [RFI 15.1] Please describe what evidence/reports are provided to a SPM
with the Transaction Correction. Are they informed of what the specific

being multiple causes?
