Susan, Jarnail
Please find attached a draft holding letter to go to the CCRC. This letter probably needs to go from Paula.
This letter just holds the current position until we have spoken to Brian Altman tomorrow.

Kind regards
Andy

Susan,

Please find attached a draft update to the Board on the headline legal issues we are dealing with post-Second Sight
Interim Report.

There are a couple of issues:

1. In 1.3, we say a holding letter has gone to the CCRC. Andy — do you think we will have something to send
tomorrow?

2. 2.2 needs to accurately reflect where we have go to with Second Sight over case reviews and mediations.

In 3, we will need to reflect BD’s advice that they do not see personal liability attaching to the Directors

following on from POL's criminal prosecutions. Jarnail—is it worth getting CK’s view on this?

4. In3,lalso refer to our D&O Policy. I have asked Charles Colquhoun for a copy of this, but he has been out
of the office today. I have raised with Andy that we may want some advice on whether we should be doing
anything to protect the coverage the policy may provide.

w

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Kind regards, Rodric
