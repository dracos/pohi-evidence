Subject: FW: PCO065665: PinICL - call transferred to Escher-Dev
Mark,

I've received this PinICL.

| know I've raised with you before the question of Error 82, though in the past its been on counters. I'm also aware that the error itself
is benign, though it could result in other errors to agents (for example).

As well as the occurrence reported, | am aware of 2 other occurrences over the last 2 months.

In this case there are the following events in the event log :-

02/05/01 10:52:07 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 89 N/A MWICORO2 An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003).

02/05/01 10:52:07 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 82 N/A MWICORO2 An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003)

02/05/01 10:51:55 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 89 N/A MWICORO2 = An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC 1090003).

02/05/01 10:51:55 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 82 N/A MWICORO2 = An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003)

02/05/01 10:51:51 Riposte Warning MessageProcessor 150 N/A MWICORO2__Lock timeout

occurred while update an index within an index build or maintenance thread. The operation will be retried.
ie the problem has occurred twice in quick succession and in each case is followed by Error 89.

It also happened on MBOCOR(1 earlier the same day with similar events :-

02/05/01 02:19:55 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 89 N/A MBOCORO1 An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC 1090003).

02/05/01 02:19:55 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 82 N/A MBOCORO1 An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003)

02/05/01 02:19:34 Riposte Warning MessageProcessor 78 N/A MBOCOR01 An incoming request
was discarded due to an overflow condition on the incoming request queue.

02/05/01 02:18:29 Riposte Warning MessageProcessor 78 N/A MBOCORO1 An incoming request
was discarded due to an overflow condition on the incoming request queue.

02/05/01 02:17:25 Riposte Warning MessageProcessor 78 N/A MBOCORO1 An incoming request

was discarded due to an overflow condition on the incoming request queue.

Again it was followed by an Error 89 and it would appear that the CS was somewhat busy, (replicating Ref Data to the counters |
assume given the time of day)

The 3rd occurrence was somewhat different :-

08/03/01 15:09:05 Riposte Error Riposte 7 N/A MWICORO1 An unhandled exception occurred in
Riposte API function RiposteStartTransaction. Exception 0xC0000005 occurred at program address 0x00476B5A. There were 2
excpetion arguments: Ox00000000 0x00000010

08/03/01 15:09:05 Riposte Error MessageProcessor 82 N/A MWICORO1 An unexpected error
occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for lock. (0xC1090003)

08/03/01 15:07:03 Riposte Warning CacheManager 65 N/A MWICORO1 An i/o wait event occurred
while invalidating a cache item in the Block cache. This may occur periodically under normal operation however if this event occurs
frequently it indicataes a need to increase the configured cache size.

In this case it was followed by Error 7. | seem to remember mentioning that Error 7 to you at the time, but | can't find any emails about
it.

What I'm really asking is for confirmation that the associated errors are indeed benign, in which case | can ensure that KELs are raised
so as to suppress the reporting of them in future. It worries me that messages are failing to be inserted, however if they are being
replicated, then | guess it doesn't matter!
