                                so I've taken money out of Yetminster to put into Chetnole but I was told
                                that I had to still book it as though it was in the office.
                GT. .           Right ok and that was £2,000?
 12.50          TM              At that time it was £2,000.
                    GT          Qkso what did you ask Catherine to do?
                TM              To put in £2,000 at the end of the day as in as though it was in
                                Yetminster's money not.
                    GT           Right so for example if there was 3,000 of £20 notes you asked her to
                                 increase it by 2,000 to make it 5,000?

                TM.             Well however she done it.
                    GT          Yeah to increase it by 2,000 whatever?
                    TM          -Yeah 'cos obviously the other one would have been showing up.
                    GT           Ok and that would have been at what time when was that?
                    TM           What do you mean what time?
                    GT -         Well was it June January?
                    TM           When she was last.
                    GT          When she was last working at the office.
 13.33              GT          `.Ok so as you said at that time then you would have taken 2,000 out of
                                 Yetminster and taken it to Chetnole and if you'd balanced Yetminster you
                                 would have had a shortage in Yetminster but the surplus should have
                                 been at Chetnole?
                    TM           Yeah.
                    GT           Now obviously when the auditors turned up and they done both offices
                                 obviously the shortage came in at.

                TM               (indistinct)
                    GT           Or just short of, yeah just short of 12,000. You'd written out a cheque
                                 for 9,500.

                GT              No I requested that audit to take place at your office.
                TM..            That's ok.
                GT              So that's how, it was nothing about it being a random audit or anything
                                it was a special request audit by myself.
                TM:             Well I can only tell you what they said and they said "oh they're all done
                                random".
                GT              They are done random unless there's considered to be a problem at a
                                particular branch and if there's considered to be a problem at a
                                particular branch which is identified by cash declarations, we have ONCH
                                management systems which obviously when you put your ONCH data in
                                etc it does an automatic ordering system and it obviously would send
                                you cash if you needed it etc etc. Now obviously if those show large
                            i   discrepancies up or down or whatever obviously it flags up and then it
                                causes a concern at a particular branch and I can tell you that the audit
                                was ordered specialty by myself. Now in respect of obviously the
                                auditors turning up and I know you mentioned that you were locked in a
                                room with 2 auditors, what do you mean by locked in a room do you
                                mean in the secure area of the Post Office?
                TM              mm.
                GT              Where you actually serve customers. Ok so was the shop closed at that
                                time?
                TM              No,
                GT              Right so you had customers coming into the office in the open you
                                weren't actually locked in a room away from the public if you like?
                TM              No I had all the public staring at me which wasn't nice.
 16.36          GT              Right ok whilst you monitored the audit taking place?
                TM              Well apparently I wasn't allowed to leave the room.

               GT '',       Yeah 'cos you had to monitor the auditors taking place?
               TM           Yes.
               GT :         Ok well obviously What the:audit report saysis that after arrival i :think
                            your:daughter was there and.you'd gone to the Cash & Carry just to sort.

                            they advised you that they were here to perform an audit and it says
                            before we commenced our checks Miss. Merritt offered me a cheque for
                           :£9,500.00 explaining she'd removed cash to the value the previous
                            evening after she declared her cash .on'the Horizon. system?
               TM           No              didn't offer it: she said        the basket which              where all my end of

               GT           It,says the cheque was with her outstanding daily docbments.
               TM           In the: basket so its not 'I offered it'.::
               GT           She also said, she meant to put the cheque through the system the
                            evening before but hadn t done so and was intending to process it in the
                            morning"'. When asked whether it was needed for bills for the retail
                            business she said "it was for something personal at home and nothing to
                            do with the shop" is:that not correct or?
17:45          TM          .. That's what I said but as I say I would have said the man was made of
                            cheese on the moon at that time.
               GT'          But why would you need to, why would you need to if you; could say.to
                            them, if you could say to them that you balanced the night before?
               TM           Because nobody ever believes you, nobody believes you.
               GT           So why not tell the, truth, why tell a:story about taking the money home,?

               And she does £11,951.09 so she's actually balanced quite close she's
               within about £1 of her balance for that day but she's not prepared to
               inflate it by the £12,000 you've asked her to is she?
               Don't know she never spoke to me about it,
               No 'cos she spoke to us.
               That's fine.
               Did you not ask her to inflate it by £12,000 then?
               No not by 12,000 no.
               Right so it's going to be her word against yours that she's lying and she's
               come to us and yet low and behold when we call an audit team in we
               find it to be around about £12,000 missing some 4, 5, weeks after the
               incident and yet you then now claim that you're in the Post Office in a
               locked room which is actually the Post Office secure area open to the
               public and low and behold we find that money to be missing and you
               then tell the auditors that this cheque that you've written out is in
               respect of the night before when you've used money for personal money
               I put that to you and you say you've made it up a story, I think the whole
               thing is a story because you've probably got financial difficulties.
               I have not got financial difficulties.
               You've probably been using the Post Office money then for whatever
               means whether it's for through desperation or greed then if you don't
               have money that you've used the Post Office money and I think that
               obviously that we want to obviously, I've spoken to Mike prior to today
               about obviously not obtaining copies of your bank statements etc.
        TM     I've got them here I've got nothing to hide.
        CT     Ok what we'd like to do is.
        TM::   I work 7 days a week if I need money I get off my backside and work.

                            Yetminster that there is a problem with the Post Office then given that
                            we have I don't know 17,000 Post Offices operating on the same
                            computer system?
                TM          No I don't, I'm sorry no I don't 'cos there's 11,500 of us that are all
                            having problems.

                TM`;        I can't answer for her can I, I'm not being rude but I can't.
                GT : :      But she's prepared to do a witness statement to stand up in Court to
                            give evidence to say you've told her to inflate the cash 'cos the monies
                            missing.
                TM -        That's fine I can't answer for her.


 35.1D                      TM said she does not live above her means.


 35.15                      When asked if she has copies of her Nat West statements between May
                            and September, TM said she only has her last statement as she never
                            has any money in her personal account and therefore shreds her
                            statements.


 35.33          LA          So how could you write a cheque if you haven't got no more in there?
 35.29          TM :'       Because I was putting the money from that account and that account
                            and that account and that account into it and as you can check.
                GT '        So what and you've transferred?
