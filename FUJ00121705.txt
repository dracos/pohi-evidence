Notes to go with Jan’s statement

Reference to “workarounds”
Could it be stated in brackets after the first mention of a “workaround” what a
workaround is?

When dealing with the question of “releases” under the 4" line heading, is it possible
to set out roughly how often releases were provided, or even provide precise
information on this by way of table (if appropriate) during the period of Mrs W’s
contract. eg. “During the time of Mrs Wolstenholme’s contract at Cleveley, [insert
number] interim releases were installed on her computer and [insert number] major
teleases. The dates of these installations are set out in the following table:”

Check whether 2™ sentence added under “Resourcing” section is accurate.

Query what note 3 at the end of the document relates to/what it means/whether it
should be included.

Add a statement of truth at the bottom.

Finally can Jan, or Keith Baines provide any details of:
e actual visits made to Mrs Wolstenholme’s office to deal with, or offer support
in relation to, the computer system.
e Actual hardware or software fixes or supplements provided to Mrs
Wolstenholme’s computer system.

One reason I raise this is that I am concerned that the logs do not show any evidence
or details of problems with Mrs W’s computer system being taken to the next lines in
the support system. Even if we cannot provide the exact details set out above, is it
possible to provide an explanation of why such information largely appears to be
lacking from the call logs?
