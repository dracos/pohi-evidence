Hi James

Thank you for sending through the test report and for your time during our call last month, both of which have been
really useful. I have a couple of very important, but hopefully small, follow-on questions that I'd be grateful if ATOS.
could come back to us on this week, ideally tomorrow:

Peak PC0273234, attached, indicates that a further instance of the issue occurred in August 2018, four months after
the changes to the scripts were released to live on 19 April 2018. Can ATOS please confirm:

a. If this was a further instance of the problem or an unrelated problem.

b. If this was a further instance of the problem, why it occurred after the earlier fix? Was it the case that
the script didn't go live in April 2018? Was it the case that it wasn't released to all branches?

We need a full response to these points, together with relevant supporting documentation to evidence how ATOS dealt
with the August 2018 issue, as currently it looks as though a fix was implemented that didn't work in practice.

What does the APADC script do?
What does the Open Account script do?

Section 3 of the Test Report, extract below, is confusing and implies as though there is a separate issue here. Can
you explain the below note please as simply as possible for us?

Note: Recovery scenarios working same as earlier. We observed that with the transaction
where cash was not taken from the customer horizon behaved correctly, processing the zero
value transaction. But the customers Drop & Go account has the increased the balance. This
is the live behaviour and not connected with this fix.

Whilst writing, a separate query has arisen that you may be able to help me with. This relates to an issue involving the
ATOS recovery script. I may need to send you some more information but I wondered as an initial point whether you
would be able to explain what the recovery script does please?

Kind regards

Katie

Katie,

I have spoken to the person who made the change and here are summary answers. If you want to call to talk

these through with us please do call me.

. How the issue was fixed

Atos were alerted to the error by Fujitsu on 2 March 2018.

This enabled Atos to recreate the error and identify the bug.

Previous errors had occurred but this was the first time that Fujitsu were able to capture the key logs.

© Once this was identified a fix was developed, tested and delivered into production using the normal

change management processes.
Delivery to live took place on 19 April 2018.

2. An explanation of the issue

WBD_000095.000003
WBONO0000225
WBON0000225

« The underlying issue was that the system did not manage time-outs for Drop and Go properly. When a
message was sent to a banking system and no reply was received the Horizon transaction carried on
‘assuming’ that a reply had been received.

¢ The fix ensured that the Horizon system waited for the response and where none was received put up
and error message so that the transaction could be safely redone.

Kind regards,

David

David

Thank you for your email. We're looking to complete the attached bug note and largely need your help with the points
highlighted in yellow, including:

1. How the issue was fixed.

2. A simple explanation of the issue — currently we have " Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the
Accenture CDP system identified that only one top-up had been received by Accenture CDP but two were being
shown it the Horizon Batch Feed. The second Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction, confirming
the problem was with the first transaction." — it would be helpful if this could be expanded on/ explained as fully
as possible.

Happy to have a call if the above and attached are still unclear — I can be free for a call between 3.30 and 4.30 today if
you let me know when is best for you.

Kind regards

Katie,

Ihave done some digging on this and it doesn’t look like we have a lot of information relating to this issue. It
would be helpful to understand what you are looking for so we can see if there is anything that could be
useful.

If you want to discuss this please do give me a call.

Barry is out of the office today, I've been asked to communicate to you directly. Barry has been in touch with your team
separately on this.

I wondered if you would be able to come back to me today in terms of an ETA for a full response from atos please on
the Bug 28 response for the ongoing litigation? The plan is currently to include these bug summaries as part of the
Counsel team's written closings in the Horizon Issues Trial so we just want to be sure on timings of response.

Who’s the lawyer?

What’s this all about?

. One of the bugs that we need atos' support with has been called the 'Drop and Go' bug. Fujitsu have confirmed they
are not aware of the Drop and Go business process and are therefore unable to comment on whether the issue was
caused by user error or a fault with the APADC script. Ideally we want to understand what happened in this particular
instance, if it is a known issue with the script and, if so, how this was resolved. In terms of relevant documents, please
find attached:
