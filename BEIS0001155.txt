Strand

Proposal

Approach (leads to set out)

Short-Term deliverable (by
Dec 2019) (leads to make
these SMARTer over next 4-6
weeks)

Long-Term Deliverable (TBC)

Rationale for
future
subsidy

(Cecilia)

Develop policy
options on ‘subsidy
with conditions’

[lightly consider
alternatives in case
Minister wants us to
explore these further]

To work jointly with UKGI to gather data from POL

on:

Uncommercial network: associated costs
(and benefits)

Definition of branch: to understand what
the minimum service offer ought to be

¢ BEIS/UKGI view on
data gathered from
POL

* BEIS/UKGI view on
size and purpose of
post 2021 subsidy and
the nature of the
conditions.

An evidence base to inform
Govt's aspiration for PO:

- definition and
measurement approach
of social purpose

- balance between social
purpose and commercial
sustainability

Sustainability
of network
and positive
workforce
relations

(will)

Develop policy
options on reviewing
the future design of
the network and
access criteria

Understand POL’s PSG approach and
work with UKGI and BEIS analysts to
appraise this

Assimilate available evidence e.g. Citizens
Advice

Commission analysts to do international
comparisons (if POL are not doing this)
Check if POL plan to do trends analysis?
What would analysts role be in this?

e BEIS view on the scope
and outcomes of PSG
work on this.

e BEIS view on available
evidence (stakeholder
views/SC report)

* Potential update on
analytical work on
international
comparators and/or
trends analysis

An evidence base to inform
design of future post office
network (taking into account
international comparators,
trends analysis and stakeholder
views)

Work with POL to
explore what makes
an attractive support
package for
postmasters

Understand POL’s PSG approach and
work with UKGI and BEIS analysts to
appraise this

To check if DfE can advise on
apprenticeships?

e BEIS view on scope
and outcomes of PSG
work on this.

¢ BEIS view on agent
pay package???

To develop a ‘what works’
evidence base to create a
stronger and more inclusive
workplace e.g. mutuals

BEIS0001155

e Assessment of mutualisation

Update on pros/cons of
mutualisation???

Social
Purpose

(Shanice)

Build an evidence-
based approach to
reviewing the overall
definition and
measurement
approach to the social
purpose

e Understand POL’s PSG approach to
defining their purpose [and test our
thoughts with them]

« Understand the social value/benefit of

uncommercial branches via data gathered

from POL (linked to strand 1)
e Clarify/define ‘vulnerable customers’

[what is this, where and for who]

BEIS advice on next
steps on developing
social purpose i.e.
taking account of POL
data and insights on
local areas/particular
types of branches e.g.
community branches
and groups that may
need targeted support

Build an evidence base
to understand the
broader ‘social value’ —
what works, for whom
and where

Drawing on conditions
attached to subsidy re
uncommercial network to
inform the social purpose
definition and
measurement approach.
Work with POL to
develop minimum criteria
for face to face provision
and or local service offer

Develop policy
options on a future
social purpose that
reflect OGD agendas

e Work with analysts/POL/OGDs to identify

ways to develop broader evidence base
on ‘innovative local practice’ and how

‘current social value postmasters provide’

can be boosted.

[how do we boost it]

Key OGDs
MHCLG - Community Assets/Hubs

Provide an update on
government strategies
that offer suitable join
up with the Post Office

Deliver cross-

(Pranita)

Identify risks and
opportunities linked to
the delivery of future

related to future government services and
digitisation

e Explore incentives with POL — how can we
develop both cost effective and customer-
focused options such as co-location of
govt services and digital options

e Engage DWP and potentially DfT, MoD
and DfE on channel shift approaches

¢ Explore HMG innovation funding

Understand scope and
join up with PSG
thinking

Signal and give an
update on engagement
with OGDs on this
particular area

A strategy on the Post
Office’s role in
developing government
services over the next
