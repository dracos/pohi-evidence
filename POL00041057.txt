Response to SS Pt 2 of 9 April 2015.DOCX

Patrick, Mark, Mel

Please find attached an updated draft Reply to the latest P2 Report for your review and comment (plus a comparison
showing the changes from the version sent to SS on 27 March 2015).

Mark — there are a small number of points in green that need further input / approval from POL. Would you mind chasing
these down?

Mel — Please can you take a look at section 26 — Conclusion? This is really a comms piece I think. I've para-phrased
something from the Final Scheme Report but you may have better ideas.

Patrick — in relation to para 1.14 of P2 (the "supplemental report" issue) Rod and I think it is best to outright say that there
will be no supplemental report. This prevents Howe from delaying further mediations. See my suggested wording at 1.11
of the Reply.

Other issues:
e The formatting still needs sorting out.
e — Irritatingly, SS have removed some sections / paras from P2 so all our cross-references need updating.
e A thorough proof-read is needed before release.

I've not sent this to Rodric as he only wants to see the final version (although I already have his line-by-line comments on
P2 and have incorporated them into the draft Reply).

Kind regards
Andy
