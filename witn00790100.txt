                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                  FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF HELEN ROSE




I, Helen Rose, will say as follows:-

INTRODUCTION

    1. I am a former employee of Post Office Limited.

    2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

       "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 6th April 2023

       (the "Request").

BACKGROUND

    3. I started work with Post Office in 1997. I spent approximately 2 years (until

       1999) on the counters in the head office branches. For the following

       approximately 5yrs (from 1999 until 2004) 1 worked as an Auditor, completing

       audits at branches from Lincoln up to the Scottish borders. For the following

       2yrs (from approx. 2004 until 2006) I worked in the Security Team as an

       Investigator. My remaining time at the Post Office was in various analytical

       roles. I do not remember exact roles which often changed with internal

                                                                                WITN00790100




   reorganisation. I left the Post Office in 2016 and have had nothing further to do

   with the Post Office or systems since.



4. I have been asked to set out my understanding of the Security Team and the

   Fraud & Conformance Team, my role within those teams and their structures.

   I have been referred to documents to assist my recollection (POL00104906)

   and (POL00105025). I have no clear recollection on specific roles within the

   Security Team. As I worked in Security, I would have had day to day dealings

   with some of the people in the team but have no recollection of anything

   specific.


5. As an auditor I visited numerous offices each week, sometimes alone

   sometimes with others. My line manager was John Jenkinson for the latter part

   of my time as an auditor but I don't remember dates and think I had on the job

   training but can't remember anyone or specifics in training. I cannot recall

   having specific Horizon training but may have had.


6. I have been asked what I remember about `Grapevine'. The name rings a bell

   but I have no recollection of who worked there or what they did.


7. I have been asked about my relationship with those who worked in Fujitsu in

   matters relating to Horizon and given names (Gareth Jenkins and Anne

   Chambers) to see if I recall having worked with them, and if I have any

   recollection of their knowledge of defects, bugs and errors in the Horizon

   system. The various emails between myself and Gareth Jenkins indicate I

   knew of him all those years ago, but I do not remember having had any specific

   working relationship with Gareth Jenkins or anyone else in Fujitsu. I do not

                                                                              WITNO0790100




   recall Anne Chambers. I do not believe I would have had any reason to know

   their knowledge or roles.


8. I don't recall raising any concerns regarding PO systems.


9. I have been asked to recall matters relating to Lee Castleton. I have been

   referred to documents (POL00069514), (POL00069536), (POL00069562),

   (P0L00069623),       (P0L00069772),           (P0L00070736),   (P0L00070763),

   (P0L00071047) and (P0L00071744).


10. 1 have no recollection of Lee Castleton or any issues or details regarding his

   case. From the documents provided I can see I was the auditor at his office

   but have no recollection of the audit or details.


11. 1 have been referred to (POL00069527). I have no recollection of any email

   or anything that was said to a Stephen Dilley


12. 1 have been referred to the 2 statements I made in relation to Lee Castleton's

   case, (POL00082945) and (POL00082946), and (POL00071196) and

   (POL00071197). From the documents supplied I can see I was an auditor at

   the time and clearly made a statement about the audit I did on his post office

   branch. I am unable to make any further comment: it was an event almost 19

   years ago.


13. 1 have been referred to (POL00070183), transcript of evidence I gave at a

   hearing in Lee Castleton's case. I have no recollection of the Lee Castleton

   case and court proceedings.

   these individuals.



16. 1 have been asked if I had a role — as investigator or witness — in any case that

   I might consider relevant to the matters being investigated by the public inquiry,

   in particular bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system.         I have no

   recollection.


17. 1 have been asked if I have any recollection of criminal cases, and any

   involvement I had, in relation to the following individuals:

   I have no recollection of any of the above, or of any prosecutions I may have

   been involved in or may have been relevant to the Horizon system and matters

   being investigated by the public inquiry.



18. 1 have been referred to documents: (FUJ00123913) and its attachments

   (FUJ00123914),        (FUJ00123915),           (FUJ00123916),     (FUJ00123917),

   (FUJ00123918), (FUJ00123919), and (FUJ00083737).                I note that I am

   described as "disclosure officer dealing with Horizon challenges". I do not recall

   ever having had a job role called `Disclosure Officer dealing with Horizon

   challenges'. I am unable to make any comments what this role was about, or

   who might have appointed me to it or any instructions I was given as to its aims

   and objectives.



19. 1 have been asked about matters relating to the Lepton SubPostoffice ("SPO").

   I have been referred to documents (POL00097437), (POL00097441),

   (P0L00097442), (P0L00097447), (P0L00097450), (P0L00097453) and

   (POL00097481).


20. 1 cannot recall any details or dates relating to this matter 10 years ago. I do not

   recall having had any concerns regarding Horizon transaction data. In

   (POL00097481) there is a reference to "deeper issues". I have no recollection

   of this. I have been asked about Angela Van-Den-Bogerd, Gareth Jenkins,

   Andrew Winn, Elaine Spencer specifically, I cannot recall any details from the

   emails to and from Gareth Jenkins. Elaine Spencer was my line manager for a

   short time during my latter years with PO but I don't remember dates or

                                                                               WITNO0790100




   anything specific or relevant issues. I don't believe Elaine Spencer had any

   Horizon knowledge.


21. Referring to documents (FUJ00086811) and (FUJ00030214) I can see that I

   drafted and authored a report in June 2013.


22. I have been asked if I can recall any details around the report — who asked me

   to produce it, why it was produced, its intended audience and what steps I took

   to produce it. I have no recollection who asked me to produce the report.


23. I do not recall any details of the emails or having any discussions with Gareth

   Jenkins regarding the matters addressed in the report and documents

   referenced.


24. I have been asked if I can explain ARQ logs and what was done with them; I

   have no clear recollection of ARQ logs.


25. 1 cannot assist with any explanation as to what the reference to "horizon

   integrity issues" means. I have no recollection.


26. In relation to the Horizon system, I can see that I stated, "I do believe the

   system behaved as it should and do not see this scenario occurring regularly

   and creating large losses". These were clearly my thoughts then; I cannot add

   anything else now.


27.Although I have read the report and recommendations made in report, I can

   provide no further comments to the reference in the report that the data might

   be "misinterpreted when giving evidence and using the same data for

   prosecutions".

28. I am unable to explain what actions may have been taken upon the comments

   on the report. I do not know whether the recommendation in the report had

   been adopted or not.



29. I am unable to make any presumptions on who would have seen the report. I

   do not recall or have any knowledge as to who it was sent to, whether it went

   to anyone at management or executive level, or what they did with it.


30. I do not have any recollection of any discussions with Angela Van-Den-Bogerd

   regarding the matters addressed in the report.


31. 1 have been asked to recall any knowledge I have of the complaint regarding

   Michael Mann. I have been referred to document (POL00086843). I have no

   recollection of this matter or the underlying fraud investigation, and/or the

   conduct of the Post Office fraud investigators.


32. I was never aware of complaints being made regarding my conduct during an

   audit or investigation.


33. 1 do not recall ever having concerns regarding the conduct of Post Office

   auditors and investigator colleagues.


34. 1 do not recall any involvement with investigations, advice or reports into

   Horizon IT system or the prosecutions that were carried out by the following

   groups/individuals:

                                                               d) Brian Altman KC

                                                               f) The Bates & Others Group Litigation



    35. 1 did not follow the events of trials or take any notice of reporting in the media.

         I left the PO in 2016 and have had no connections with anything PO related

         since.
