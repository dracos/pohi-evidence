. As an auditor | visited numerous offices each week, sometimes alone
sometimes with others. My line manager was John Jenkinson for the latter part

training but can’t remember anyone or specifics in training. | cannot recall

having specific Horizon training but may have had.

. | have been asked what | remember about ‘Grapevine’. The name rings a bell

but | have no recollection of who worked there or what they did.

. | have been asked about my relationship with those who worked in Fujitsu in
matters relating to Horizon and given names (Gareth Jenkins and Anne
Chambers) to see if | recall having worked with them, and if | have any
recollection of their knowledge of defects, bugs and errors in the Horizon
system. The various emails between myself and Gareth Jenkins indicate |
knew of him all those years ago, but | do not remember having had any specific
working relationship with Gareth Jenkins or anyone else in Fujitsu. | do not
