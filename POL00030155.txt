Subject: RE: Global user access issue

For clarification — has this been done now?

e I’ve spoken to Fujitsu and have a list of all admin users ( Pol people) and
engineers and when they last logged on . This will give the auditor the clarification
that whilst there may have been names on the list who have left the Business, we
can demonstrate that they have not logged onto an Horizon kit since they left.

Are we confident that whilst the controls have been ineffectively managed that there has been no breach or usage. Echo
Micheals point that even if they did get on — what could happen?

Can we also state how many users we’re talking about and whether those that are still in employment need that access
(and if they don’t whether they’ve used it).

I think there will be a collective sigh (despite the controls issue) if we can demonstrate before the ARC that there has
been no exposure.

ve now received a full update from Kendra Dickenson in the Branch Support Centre team.

The work to give global user access to Trainers and Auditors was as part of HNGX and it saved the field teams needing to
get temp passwords set up per audit or training intervention, so operationally, it’s a good thing. When first introduced,
NBSC simply managed the requests which were actioned by FJ, but the ability to set up access transferred to NBSC last
summer from FJ as an IT project.

i don’t believe proper JML controls were put in place as part of the handover and therefore we need to clean up the user
list and then implement appropriate controls going forward.

Kendra now has a number of immediate actions:

e Iwill arrange to sanitise the list based on those we know have left the Business.

e Rebecca is speaking to Computacenter to understand how they can ensure the list
of engineers is brought up to date and is monitored moving forward.

that whilst there may have been names on the list who have left the Business, we
can demonstrate that they have not logged onto an Horizon kit since they left.

e We will review this list against those names who have left the business and
provide the final version to Rebecca and Joy who will then update from what they
have via Computacenter and HR leavers.

\ trust this answers the questions, but please feel free to pick up directly with Kendra for any follow up questions or
further information as she is owning this on my behalf.

Thanks Michael

In order to answer the question, we need to know:
- what access and the rights permissions the user(s) had which they shouldn't have
what system are they accessing and what could they do (ie delete, amend, etc).

At a high level, the horizon system captures the transaction data from counters to the data centre to the Audit Store.
This is the horizon system (which is subject to the appeal). The GLO considers whether there are coding or rule breaches
that undermine the credibility of the system itself or is it the operating procedures of Fujitsu etc or indeed there is no
issue at all.

POL-0026637
POL00030155
POL00030155

What we need to find out is whether the inappropriate accessing of the information relates to the horizon system (live
environment} or rather just the data centre which produces various reports and data feeds which is utilised by various

parts of the business. Depending on that then we can hopefully rule out GLO issues but the remaining JLM etc incident
remains and needs to be remediated.

As an aside, I understand that Deloitte looked at this several years ago and I don’t think it was raised with the general
process but the above questions should be answered.

I hope that helps. I’ve copied in Rod and Ken in my team who can support.
Zoe- just FY!

Folks - scroll to the bottom. This will be reported into the arc and will get a lot of heat and light because the jml
issue always causes concern and this potentially demonstrating we don't have the right controls in place. So
three things that hit me:

1) Let's urgently close down any outstanding issues with people that have left and still have access... Who's
responsibility?

2) What's gone wrong? what control issues do we have? Need to get ahead of this before the arc

3) How do we give comfort to the arc that we are in control on jml given this.

Is it your guys?

Hi both,

Are you aware of the below? Not picked up by EY previously; feels like this should be managed in the MI team
(which doesn’t stop the audit issue point that will be raised).

Not great...

Hi tom

At the moment all I know is:

POL00030155
POL00030155

PWC met with Jane Smith from the branch management team in NBSC, Janes team manage the Global User

access process.

POL-0026637
POL00030155
POL00030155

I believe they have a list of users that are active, but when PWC asked if that person is still in employment with
the business the search on active directory (email) confirmed that the person is no longer with the business, so
potentially they could still access the system in branch if the fraudulently gained access.

This means there is gap in the process, so the active directory process is in place to close items down, but
there doesn’t appear to be a process to close down all accounts associated with that person... I don’t know

who owns that process at this stage etc etc

Hi,
Please can you give me some more details on the issue that was raised on the global user access point? I’ve
got an update call with PWC at 3pm and they are likely to want to chat through. Ideally if I can know who this

impacts and to what extent that would be great.
