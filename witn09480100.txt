                                                        Dated: 19 June 2023


                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




I, Gregory Booth, will say as follows.



INTRODUCTION

   1. This witness statement is made in response to Rule 9 Request no.1 regarding

       Marine Drive Post Office and the Lee Castleton Litigation dated 5 May 2023

      (the °Request").




   2. From 1965 to December 1970 I was an Articled Clerk to a firm of Chartered

      Accountants in Bristol. Then from January 1970 to 1976 I worked in audit for

      Coopers & Lybrand, an international firm, now part of Price Waterhouse

      Coopers. From then until 1998 1 worked as an Accountant in industry, holding

      various positions including Group Financial Accountant, Finance Manager,

      and Company Secretary.

  3. In 1998 my wife and I purchased a sub-post office (Edgehill) in Scarborough

      and ran that until it was closed under the Network Re-invention Programme. I

      was then asked by Post Office Limited ("POL") to take over a larger office

                                                                               WITNO9480100




   (South Cliff PO in Scarborough) of which the sub-postmaster had been

   suspended. I ran this office from September 2003 to February 2004, when a

   new permanent sub-postmaster was appointed. I next ran Marine Drive Post

   Office in Bridlington from 21st April to 28th May 2004, again at the request of

   POL. After that I ran various offices around the area as a relief postmaster,

   and lastly Newby Post Office in Scarborough as manager until 2008 when I

   retired.




4. In answering the questions below, I have considered the following documents:

   my first Witness Statement dated 7 October 2006 [POL00074091]; my second

   Witness Statement dated 8 November 2006 [POL00081446]; the first Witness

   Statement of Catherine Oglesby dated 21 January 2006 [POL00083031]; the

   Second Witness Statement of Catherine Oglesby dated 10 October 2006

   [POL00071592]; and the first Witness Statement of Christine Train dated 29

   November 2006 [POL00083641].

5. 1 was asked to take over Marine Drive Post Office by Catherine Oglesby, a

   Sales Account Manager of POL, as the sub-postmaster, Lee Castleton had

   been suspended due to losses not made good, and the acting temporary sub-

   postmaster was no longer available.

6. 1 was told briefly the reasons for Lee Castleton's suspension, but not in great

   detail, as far as I can remember.

7. 1 have been asked to describe my experience of running the Marine Drive

   Post Office between 215t April 2004 and 28th May 2004. 1 didn't have any

   particular problems with the weekly balancing. Catherine Oglesby requested

                                   Page 2 of 11

                                                                                  WITN09480100




   that I add £100 to the Suspense Account, then print off a balance listing to

   check that the system did what was intended, and then reverse the

   transaction and re-check. The results were exactly what were expected. It is a

   normal thing to do to test any system to enter a dummy item and the reverse

   it.

8. 1 have been asked about my working relationship with the other staff in the

   Marine Drive Post Office. To start with, there were no other current staff in the

   post office as both the sub-postmaster and his assistant, who he relied upon

   to do much of the work, had been suspended. The previous temp had run the

   office on her own, but I realised another member of staff was needed, as

   queues could become long when customers came in with large piles of

   packages to process. I therefore employed an assistant, which was at my

   expense.

9. Interactions with most customers were satisfactory, given the difficult

   circumstances of the suspension, but there could be problems dealing with

   large piles of packages when I didn't have an assistant. The custom had been

   for a customer to leave the packages for the staff to process later and be

   trusted to return to the office later to pay. I was not prepared to take that risk,

   as it could have resulted in me losing money if they had not returned. I

   therefore processed all the items with the customer present.

10. I did not have any problems with the Horizon hardware or software as far as I

   can remember.

11. Since I did not have any problems there was nothing to investigate relating to

   Horizon during my time there.

                                                                                 WITNO9480100




12. It is clear from correspondence dated September 2004 [POL00082577] that

   Mr. Castleton wanted Christine Train (his former assistant) to take over as

   sub-postmaster and was determined to make it unattractive to anyone else to

   do so, including the statement to me that the rent for the office would have to

   be high. I doubt if he would have charged the figures quoted to Mrs. Train. He

   also implied that my car might be damaged whilst parked there. I therefore

   declined to accept the position, and presumably as a result, the office closed.

13. Whilst I was running the office, it was obviously a difficult time for Mr.

   Castleton, but I didn't have any problem with him personally, or his wife. Often

   after the office closed in the evening, we would spend time discussing the

   problems, and possible causes. He told me that via the internet (at that time a

   new phenomenon) he had discovered that other sub-postmasters had

   experienced similar problems.

14. After my period there had finished, I would occasionally see (unplanned) Lee,

   Lisa, or her father, and they would update me on how things were

   progressing.

15. The Inquiry has provided me with various documents relevant to the litigation

   for me to consider. Please find my comments on these documents below:

       a. POLO0083319_036: This document is self-explanatory.

       b. POL00071025: again this is self-explanatory. As regards the possibility

           of Car Auction banking being mixed up with PO money, Lee Castleton

           did not think this had happened. "Leave to financial difficulties" should

           read "lead".

       c. POL00081700 221: The draft statement is not shown with this letter.

       d. POL00081700 180: The draft statement is not shown with this letter.

                                                                                 WITNO9480100




      e. P0L00081700 150: The draft statement is not shown with this letter.

      f.   POL00081700_069: This letter is not significant.

      g. POL00069418: This is with regards to the "System freeze" at Newby

           Post Office where I was currently working. I had not known this to

           happen before and felt it could be relevant to the ongoing system

           enquiries, which is why I felt it was necessary to notify Mr. Dilley about

           the lost transaction. In itself, I would not have considered £1.27 to be

           significant.

       h. POL00069845: At the time of the instance, I would not have been

           aware of the remedy subsequently given by Fujitsu to Stephen Dilley,

           which he then passed to me by letter.

           POL00069824: I have nothing to add to this Attendance Note.

      j.   POL00069922: With regards to the first paragraph, I don't believe I

           alienated customers, except insofar as queues could build up. See

           paragraph 8 above. Regarding paragraph 2 - I can't remember.

16. I have been asked to describe the circumstances in which I first had contact

   with Stephen Dilley of Bond Pearce LLP and were introduced to the Lee

   Caslteton case. I can't remember, but it was probably Stephen Dilley's letter of

   22nd August 2006 [POL00083319_036].

17.At the time, my understanding of the case against Mr. Castleton was simply

   that Mr. Castleton's Horizon records showed a considerable cash deficiency,

   which had been asked to make good, which he was not able or willing to do

   because he believed the losses were created by the Horizon system and were

   not true losses.

   to state my experience of the system whilst I was running the office.

19. From my initial interview with Mr. Dilley, I have been asked why I thought that

   potentially the car auction deposit funds may have been mixed with the cash

   in the Post Office which may have caused a discrepancy. This was simply

   because there did not appear to be any other transactions of a size which

   could result in the apparent losses, plus the fact that I considered the way the

   cash was handled was unsatisfactory and could lead to errors.

20. 1 also thought that Mr. Castleton was inexperienced and didn't get sufficient

   help because Mr. Castleton had only been appointed a few months before,

   but also much of the work was done by Christine Train rather than himself. As

   to the amount of help he received, I can only go by what he told me.

21. I have been asked why these points (at paragraphs 19 and 20 above) were

   not included in my witness statements for the Lee Castleton Case




22. 1 have been asked how each of my witness statements were prepared and

   their content agreed. I can't remember- it was too long ago.

23. I can't remember how I found the process of preparing my witness

     am too out-of-touch with the Horizon system now, and can't follow the two

     questions, or the response to them.

  29. 1 was not aware of this conversation between POL and their legal team

     regarding the test transaction in the suspense account.


MR. CASTLETON'S TRIAL

  31. 1 was not made aware of the content of Mr. Castleton's Defence and

     Counterclaim, except verbally by Mr. Castleton.

  32. POL and Fujitsu took the view that the Horizon system was infallible, and that

     any errors must have been made by staff. In the days of manual systems this

     would have been a valid approach, and it was assumed that it was also true

     for Horizon.

  33. 1 don't think I have any additional relevant observations or views on the

     litigation that I've not set out above.

  34. I have been asked to set out my views on the approved Judgment in the case

     [POL00004325]. I don't feel any need to comment on paragraph 24. However,

     the Judge said that the burden of proof lay on Mr. Castleton to show that the

     computer was wrong (paragraph 1), but presumably Mr. Castleton had neither

     the skill nor the opportunity to examine the Horizon system, himself or by an

     agent, so his chance to prove the system wrong was incomplete.

  35. I was not provided with a copy of the judgment (until now), or informed of the

     outcome of the case, except verbally by Mr. Castleton.


REFLECTIONS


  36. Since the trial I have not experienced any issues with the Horizon IT system,

     but I have been retired for 15 years.

  37. I have seen Mr. Castleton, his wife, and her father on several chance

     occasions since, and they would tell me how things were progressing with

     their claim.

  38. I now believe, with what has been publicised, that it is likely Mr. Castleton was

     unfairly treated. The Post Office took the attitude, as they always have, that

     they and their systems are infallible. In the days of manual accounting this

     may have been justified, but at the time of Mr. Castleton's problems, this

     attitude to the Horizon system had not been seriously questioned or

     examined.

 THERMATTERS


   39. 1 don't think there are any other matters not referred to above that I wish to

        bring to the attention of the Chair. I do think, however, that views on my own

        performance are not relevant to the inquiry into the Horizon system.

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
