Subject: RE: PCI meeting where audit archive gaps was raised

Hi Steve

* This week we have been running daily sessions with POL to discuss requirements the “Tactical” PCI Audit
solution — the migration of Belfast Audit to AWS Card Data Environment
* The issue was first raised on Monday in the 13:00 session with John Nelis POL PM and Alex Wood POL Tech
Lead
© The context was discussing the scope of the data migration due to audit data over 10 years old being
inconsistent across the two Belfast Servers.
© This requirement had been identified as an output of a requirement capture session between myself
and Gerald last week
* On the Tuesday session @ 14:00 Dean Bessel joined the call. I had no prior warning he would be on the call
© Also present were myself, Gerald and John Nelis and Andy Frodsham an amazon Cloud Architect.
0 John asked Andy to drop off the call temporarily which he did.
© Dean then explained he was head of horizon risk controls and wanted to get more background detail on
the issue
© Interestingly at that juncture I said it would be sensible to record the call, and started the recording,
however Dean said his preference was not to record at this juncture and so I obliged by stopping the
recording
© Ihave 15 seconds of recording confirming this request. BA Tactical PCI Audit Requirements - Session 3-
20211130 140210-Meeting Recording.mp4
oO At the time we had documented a couple of sentences in this document ARC PC! Migration -
Requirements Capture - WIP - Cloud Office - Confluence (atlassian.net) which lacked depth.
© The subsequent conversation covered the issue in a lot more substance with Gerald providing historical
background
© Asaresult at the end of the discussion it was agreed Fujitsu needed to document the
history/background in more detail.
© We were told this could be done in the requirement doc or in an email
© John mentioned producing a “problem statement” but it wasn’t a firm request.
© John it was his intention to take the statement, once received, to POL legal so a decision could be made
on the scope of data that was required to be migrated
© No minutes were taken. Other subjects were discussed after Dean left the call. To be clear the purpose
of the meeting was to discuss ALL requirements.
© The historical data issue was discussed first and Dean dropped off once he had enough verbal detail
« After that Gerald and I got together to produce the statement I sent you.
© This was sent to you and Phil Boardman on Wednesday, December 1, 2021 11:51 AM
