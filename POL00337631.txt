STAKEHOLDER GATING PROCESS

The Stakeholder Gating process aims to:
* support projects in identifying and engaging with Stakeholders across the
POL Business areas and
© protect the Post Office from deploying into the operational environment
any changes for which impacted areas are not properly prepared
e in order to guarantee success and protect Post Office and Postmasters from
harm or reputational damage.

Any change initiatives are subject to this process if they meet one of the
following criteria:

¢ Itis part of a SPO recognised project

¢ Itis not following an established, regular, process
POL00337631
POL00337631

e Failure to implement successfully will have an adverse impact on
Postmasters, Customers and/or the reputation of the Post Office.

This process provides contact points for every area that might be impacted.

If you are unfamiliar with this process please
contact GatingForum!

Other business changes should go through this process as soon as possible
before the release date.

¢ The first step is to complete a “Project Summary for Gating” form which will
outline the project/change plus any releases planned — which is then
submitted to the Gating Forum mailbox along with your Prove Plan (or
Business case if going straight to Gate to Deliver).

¢ The Summary will be uploaded to the Stakeholder Gating SharePoint
site where Stakeholders provide their responses at each Gate;
© Engagement (Opt In/Opt Out/Informed),
© Prove Plan
© Gate to Deliver,
© Gate to Release
© Gate to Close.

* Occasionally, due to changes in dates, scope, finances or benefits, projects
generate Project Change Requests. It is at the discretion of the Head of
Transformation Portfolio (HoTP) as to whether the project has to then re-
submit to the Stakeholders for additional approval.
© Generally a change request does not get referred to Stakeholder

Gating. It is at the discretion of the HoTP to determine if a PCR is
significant enough to merit referral back into the Stakeholder Gating
process because the change is significant.

e For each of those Gates the project must attend the Gating Forum which
usually meets on Wednesdays at 10.30am. Projects/BAU areas present their
change and Stakeholders provide Go/NoGo responses.

To get a slot on the Agenda, email GatingForum/ GRO.
midday BEFORE Gating Forum meeting.
