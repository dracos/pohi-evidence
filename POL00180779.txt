I have just met Ron Warmington and want to put on record that he would do an excellent job for us: exactly the right
quality level of engagement, etc., we're looking for. I made it very clear to Ron that our primary objective of this
exercise is to be transparent and to deal with whatever outcomes and conclusions he comes to.

Regards
Paula
