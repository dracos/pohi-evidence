Thanks Richard, I hadn’t thought of that risk but probably very wise based on past dealings!

Thanks. I have had no reply from POL Legal. I will chase them about it. I have not said to them that the Minister wants
the update, partly because I rather feared that would cause the update to be less useful or perhaps even be met with a
refusal to provide one.

Kind regards

Richard,

To see further clarification below from the Minister's office on the Minister’s request for trial updates.
I think this means that, ideally, we’ll submit once a week a package to the Minister’s office comprising:
-a roundup of the week’s news coverage (collating the daily updates from POL’s Comms Director)

-an update from POL’s legal team on trial developments over the past week (though perhaps there’s some wriggle room
for this to happen once every two weeks if you judge that more appropriate/realistic).

UKG1I00021771

On the second, have you had any feedback from POL Legal on this request and when the next update is likely to come?
Thanks,
Stephen

Hi Tom,

Would you be able to provide me with a collated weekly update? My plan is to only put them to Kelly every two weeks
but if I have them for info each week I can always put them to her more often if there is a major update.

Feel free to give me a call how best to work it if not.

Thanks,

POL are providing us with a daily media summary on the trial. Do you us to share them with you every day or collate into
a weekly update? As per the below, we will send a written update on the trial via POL every fortnight. To let you know
we’ve asked POL for an update weekly — we can either provide these each week or send two together per fortnight, as you
prefer!

Thanks both.

I think that covers everything. One point to note is that Kelly asked for biweekly litigation updates, rather than weekly —
I think weekly would probably be a bit too often and am not sure you’d have significant updates that regularly? Also to
note that Kelly would like to see the written updates once every two weeks and will decide as and when whether she
would like a verbal update in addition.

In terms of a face to face meeting, Kelly will let us know when she feels she requires further briefing on ongoing
issues. Unless anything major comes up before Christmas, this is likely to be something for the new year now due to the

huge volume of parliamentary business to get through before then.

Thanks again to Sam for providing the additional points before OPQs yesterday, Kelly found these very helpful.

Thanks Sam for addressing the action points promptly and yes, it would be helpful to see the information on investment
costs and old branches.

Many thanks,

Thanks for this. In addition to information on the branch investment costs (i.e. how much POL were putting in in
addition to WHSmith) the Minister was also interested in what happens to the old branches. I supplied both bits
of information yesterday ahead of BEIS Orals. If UKGI colleagues want to see this let me know.

I have also agreed with Sam that when the Minister receives Post Office branch franchising correspondence
that she is particularly interested in, and would like more detailed briefing on the local issue, Sam will flag the
to us and we will work with POL to provide it.

On the remuneration, I don’t think there was an explicit action, but it is something I know the Minister is
interested in. So I’m going to work with POL on how we can explain the current network transformation model
simply i.e. we’re no longer paying postmasters a fixed fee but now variable, and that the post office element of
the business is just one part — a strong retail business is vital too.

Subject: Follow-on actions from yesterday's meeting

Hi Sam,

Thanks to the Minister for her time yesterday, detailed below are the follow-on actions (Both Sams’ please let me know
if I have missed anything).

¢ Weekly briefings as the litigation case progresses (verbal and written updates) (UKGI to action)
UKGI00021771
UKG1I00021771

¢ A face-to-face meeting with Tom Cooper (UKGI to action, Tom Aldred and Gavin Lambeth can also possibly
attend)

e Further information around the franchising process and local issues particularly regarding accessibility, service
provision, etc. As such, going forward the Minister wants direct briefing from POL on franchising cases (Sam
White and team to action)

e Anunderstanding of who invests when POL franchises with a retailer — (1 have checked with POL on this point,
and they say it is a joint investment but the exact split is dependent on the contract and commercial agreement
— they will provide more information when the request is commissioned) (Sam White and team to action)

e Anunderstanding of the breakdown of the £17million fall in sub postmaster remuneration (Sam White and
team to action)

Thanks,
Tosin
