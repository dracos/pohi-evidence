STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE ACCOUNTS

Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and result of the company.

In preparing those accounts the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

« make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

e state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any

material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts.

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

The directors are responsible for ensuring that proper accounting records are kept
which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the

company, and which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with company
law.

The directors are responsible for ensuring that the assets of the company are

safeguarded and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.

of the accounts. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our

explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In

forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
