Jane

See below re MH QC put in Righlight for your ease of reference.

Slightly frustrating but this availability becomes critical once we have a sense of direction from Neuberger QC (on
recusal yes/no in particular).

So info' this evening will (I hope) be OK. I'll keep pushing and chase Luke this eve’ if he has not come back to me
beforehand.

Kind regards
