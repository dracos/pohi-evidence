Michael has (annoyingly) exceeded himself and located POL's board papers for Sept 11 to July 13. POL don’t have
access to any earlier than Sept 11 and disclosure is cut off at July 13.

We need to disclose:

"Minutes of meetings of Post Office's Board of Directors (or historic equivalent) (a) between 1999 and 2001 at which
the roll-out of Horizon, its operation and any associated operational risks were considered or discussed, and
(b) between 2010 and 2011 at which the same was considered or discussed with respect to Horizon Online,
limited in each case to matters associated with financial reconciliations, shortfalls, discrepancies or losses."

Reports to Post Office’s Board of Directors (or historic equivalent) between (i) 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2000,
(ii) 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2006 and (iii) 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2013 relating to Post Office’s network-wide
approach to identifying, tracking or managing discrepancies, shortfalls or losses, or to Postmasters’ ability to
dispute shortfalls.

Michael has been through the board papers and located a number of papers which fall within the above categories and
should be disclosed (ie. see pages 121 to 124 of the attached). The issue is that these documents are packs of
Papers — can we redact the non-disclosable pages — they are littered with privilege and commercially sensitive?

I am going to review these documents as well just to double check we actually have to disclose them but I also think
we are going to need to brief at least Rod / Mark on the contents of these. Do you need something for the SG
tomorrow?

Thanks

I've been through the board papers uploaded to the FTP site and believe the following are relevant:

See 20120315 - POL BOARD.pdf referring to major incidents on Horizon (eg p121 onwards).
See 2012040418 - POL BOARD. pdf (eg p132 onwards).
See 20120523 - POL BOARD.pdf (eg p141 onwards).

See 2013 07 16 Board papers single pdf v.2.pdf (eg p 32 onwards).

See BoardPDFpack.pdf (eg p 81 onwards).

Most (if not all) of these documents contain some privileged material and so will need to be redacted.
Let me know what you think.

Thanks

Michael

Hi Michael

I have uploaded all our board papers between September 2011 (the earliest we have access to) to July 2013.
You will notice I have also added individual agendas for 2011 up to September 2012 as the pdf documents
are not in order and the agenda will hopefully help you find what you need.

Kind regards

Kim

What arrangements do we have in place for sharing documents securely? This amounts to hundreds of
documents. We are extremely busy and really need proper notice of these requests.

In relation to the reports to the board of directors (item 2 in my original email), we are looking to get hold of these
reports from a number of date ranges, one of which is between January 2010 and July 2013 — do you have access to
the reports from 2011 onwards or are these held by the Postal Museum too?

I spoken with my team and I understand that it is likely to be the Postal Museum that holds these records.
The contact name we have at the Postal Museum is: - Jenny. Willis though our
dealings with Jenny have been to do with data retention. The CoSec files here only go back to 2011.

A group of former and current postmasters, branch assistants and Crown employees have brought a legal claim
against Post Office. Their claim is very broad alleging failings from inadequate training and support, to inadequate
consideration of the reliability of Horizon. As part of this, Post Office has been ordered to disclose a range of
documents which are relevant to the claim.

We are speaking to a number of people across a variety of teams within Post Office so as to understand where these
documents are located, the overall volume of documents and any issues we might encounter in accessing them.

Specifically, we would like to speak to you regarding the following types of document. If your team does not have
access to these documents then we would like to know which team it would be best for us to contact:

Minutes of meetings of Post Office's Board of Directors (or historic equivalent) (a) between 1999 and 2001 at which
the roll-out of Horizon, its operation and any associated operational risks were considered or discussed, and (b)
between 2010 and 2011 at which the same was considered or discussed with respect to Horizon Online, limited in
each case to matters associated with financial reconciliations, shortfalls, discrepancies or losses.

Reports to Post Office’s Board of Directors (or historic equivalent) between [date range to be agreed] relating to
Post Office’s network-wide approach to identifying, tracking or managing discrepancies, shortfalls or losses, or to
Postmasters’ ability to dispute shortfalls.

Please note we do not need you to send us any documents.

Please could you let me know when you would be available for a call during the course of this week.

If you have any queries about the documents or the call, please feel free to contact either Mark Underwood or me.
Kind regards
