Introduction

1.1 Auditor’s Eye View

1.1.1 Scope

This functional specification defines the operational and commercial audit trails. These
are, respectively, the audit trail associated with the operation of the services which
make up the HNG-X solution and the audit trail associated with that part of Post Office
Account's internal commercial records to which Post Office Ltd’s Internal Auditors or
Agents may have access as set out in Schedule D5.

The operational audit trail includes that generated by the mainstream operational
services and the Business Incident Management System (BIMS).

At HNG-X Release 2, the mainstream operational services making up the Post Office
Ltd steady state applications are:

Automated Payment Service (APS) including Additional Data Capture (ADC) and AP
OutPay (APOP)

EPOS Service (EPOSS) including Debit Card (DC)
Logistics Feeder Service (LFS)

Network Banking Service (NBS) including NBX
National Savings and Investments (NS&l)

Smart Post

Bureau de Change (BdC) including the use of Debit & Credit Cards, Automatic
Remittance Advice and Authorisation Referrals.

Electronic Top-up (ETU)
Post Office Limited Financial Systems (POL FS)
Infrastructure Services

Transaction Enquiry Service (TES)

The BIMS provides an auxiliary audit trail that separately covers the treatment of
exceptions encountered within the mainstream operational services. The audit trail
associated with the mainstream services is never modified for the purposes of
correction as such.

This specification also addresses, in Section 3, certain elements of Schedule D5 that
relate to access by Post Office Ltd’s commercial auditors to parts of RMG BU’s own
internal records and systems. These latter requirements are met through the definition
and use of a commercial audit trial and associated audit procedure providing for access
from within RMG BU

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

The Counter Transaction Journal element of the operational audit trail, and other
operational support and system management elements relating to financial systems,
are retained for 7 years. The remainder of the operational audit trail, specifically data
relating to APS, TIP and LFS is retained for 18 months.

Note that although OBCS and TIP were discontinued services at S80 the audit data
generated up to the point of rolling out Horizon S80 is being retained under existing
rules.

The commercial audit trail is retained for seven years although some records are held
for the life of the contract, which may be longer than seven years.

If the technology used to hold elements of the audit trail becomes obsolete then they
will be copied to the new technology to maintain continuity of access.

1.1.2 The Total Mainstream Horizon Solution

From the standpoint of the auditor, the total mainstream solution, including both the
Horizon sub-systems and the source and sink subsystems, is shown in Figure A. The
arrows represent the subsystem interfaces at which key auditable events occur.
Horizon’s responsibilities extend to the subsystems coloured green (dark lozenge) and
the interfaces coloured blue (dark arrows).

SAP Advanced Distribution System (ADS) for Inventory Management (IM)

Post Office Limited Financial Systems

The stock and Branch trading Statements are also produced within each office on
paper. These signed paper records will, foreseeably, represent the fiduciary record of
the outlet’s business.

The Reference Data system is responsible for supplying transaction steering data to
Horizon. This data describes the relationships and properties of the data to be
processed (typing of regions, Post Office Ltd organisations, outlets, Clients, items for
sale, methods of payment, and transaction tokens); and the processing methods
(processing and validation rules, check digits, calendars, accounting collation
sequences, tax tables).

ADS is an on-line system but with a same-day level of response time. It handles
orders, secure stock returns, transfers and secure stock inventories, providing for
central control interfacing with Horizon’s Logistics Feeder Service (LFS)

AP Clients will have direct interfaces to Post Office Ltd for receiving files of payment
records generated by the Horizon Service.

1.1.4.2 Post Office Ltd Client Systems

This level of specification does not define the audit facilities to be made available to the
audit departments of Post Office Ltd’s Automated Payment commercial Clients. These
facilities will be negotiated between Post Office Ltd and the Client as part of the AP
Migration Plan Interface specification for each Client. It has been decided by Post
Office Ltd that such Client systems will NOT access the Post Office Ltd Horizon Service
directly to provide customer and payment scheme reference data (transaction steering
data). Such data will be passed through the Post Office Ltd Reference Data system.

1.2 Audit Trail Responsibilities and Usage
1.2.1 Responsibilities

1.2.1.1 Tracks and Trails

In the description below use is made of the terms audit track and audit trail. An audit
track is a record of activities made within a Horizon subsystem for one or more of its
interfaces. An audit trail is one or more such tracks. The data recorded in a trail’s
several tracks may represent the treatment of related transfers and processing.

In general it is possible to produce an audit track for an interface on either side of that
interface, or, if the interface is itself problematic, on both sides.

It is of course a matter for Post Office Ltd and Post Office Ltd Clients to produce their
own audit tracks on their sides of the interfaces to Horizon.

1.2.1.2 TWO Tracks

The Horizon audit trail is based upon files representing the single main audit track
representing the traffic running through the Horizon solution, the Post Office Ltd
Horizon Service. This system is RMG BU’s operational responsibility and its operating
interfaces are also under its control.

As discussed above, a second audit track represents the systems management
operation of the Horizon system itself.

1.2.2 Principles, Agents and Rights of Access

The underlying policy for access control is defined in the Access Control Policy —
SVM/SDM/POL/0027 (ACP) and the HNG-X Technical Security Architecture —
ARC/SEC/ARC/0003.

An Agent may carry out a particular audit for Post Office Ltd or by Post Office Ltd
themselves. The Agents that are permitted are defined in Schedule D5.

Horizon provides for rights of access for individual roles and enforces these rights of
access. Changes to these rights is via Change Control.

1.2.3 Access controls

Access controls are effected through the use of roles. There are two auditor roles: Post
Office Ltd Emergency Manager/auditor and Post Office Ltd Auditor. These roles and
the functions that they may perform are further defined in document HNG-X Menu
Hierarchy and Messages DES/GEN/SPE/0007.

1.2.4 Post Office Ltd Usage

Post Office Ltd Audit functions has access to the Post Office Ltd Horizon Service audit
track and the Systems Management track

1.2.5 Post Office Ltd Client Usage

Post Office Ltd Client Audit functions will have access to those parts of the Post Office
Ltd Horizon Service track relating to that Client and subject to the Client’s contract with
Post Office Ltd (subject to paragraph 1.2.3 above)

1.2.6 Audit trail formats
1.2.6.1 Native Formats

The principle followed is that Horizon originates the audit track source data in flat files.

The format in which the Counter Transaction journal is written by Horizon operational
software is that used as input to the utilities that prepare the bulk extracts for the audit
authorities. That is, the native flat format is the operational format Subsets of the
Counter Transaction journal represent the data transferred to ADS and Post Office Ltd
Clients, and from RD, ADS, possibly Post Office Ltd Clients.

The native format of the flat files containing the data transferred between subsystems
is described in file headers. They are therefore self-describing at the file level. See
Host Application Database Design and Interface Standards - DES/GEN/STD/0001
(HADDIS).

The logs of file transfers (control files) are in one simple format.

1.2.6.2 Custom Formats

The Counter Transaction journal native flat format is not to be further transformed.
Custom formats for other audit files may be specified at a later level of specification.
Transfer is by CDROM.

As a principle, the less transformation the better, since this preserves more of the
original raw data and removes the need to qualify and maintain transforming software.

1.2.7 Audit trail retention periods
Schedule B3.2 establishes the retention periods for the Operational and Commercial

Audit Trails. These are, for the Counter Transaction Journal element of the operational
audit trail, and other operational support and system management elements relating to

financial systems, 7 years. For other operational systems18 months, and for the
Commercial Audit Trail 7 years or contract duration, whichever may be longer.

Operational Audit Data may be retained beyond the specified retention period if it is
required to support an ongoing Post Office Ltd Investigation, or Litigation Support by
RMG BU, as described in the CCD Security Management Service: Service Description-
SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

Certain archived data such as EPOSS administration functions, which contain dated
internal references, will itself have an implied longevity of more than 18 months.

2.1.1.1. Counter Transaction Journal

The audit archive of the Counter Transaction journal is taken daily by copying all new
messages to audit archive media.

The Counter Transaction journal comprises records appended to the journal of each
outlet. The Counter Transaction journal contains the original transaction details,
including its origin, when it happened, who caused it to happen, and the outcome.

2.1.1.2 Post Office Ltd Systems

These comprise:

« Those at the RD and SAPADS interfaces holding control records describing files being
transferred

e There is no systematic value in holding separate audit copies of the raw data
transferred across these interfaces with Counter Transaction because this is what the
Counter Transaction journal itself represents and because the SAPADS transfers are
selective extracts of it.

2.1.1.3 AP Client Systems

This comprises the various AP Client interfaces holding control records describing files
being transferred.

2.1.2 Audit Access to the Post Office Ltd Horizon Service Track
Logical audit access will be provided as follows:
2.1.2.1. Counter Transaction Journal Access at the Outlet

Views of the transactions that have taken place within a whole post office during the
recent past are available from any counter or back office position within a post office,
subject to the Post Office Ltd Auditor having appropriate access rights. The term
“transactions” here embraces both the serving of customers and EPOSS administration
events. The journal is also used to carry certain Horizon control sequences. These are
of no intrinsic interest to auditors but their retention within the message numbering
means that auditors can be sure there are no missing records.

2.1.2.2 I Counter Transaction Journal Access at the Data Centre

Counter Transaction journal data is maintained within the Branch database in the
Horizon Data Centres. Audit records are written to audit archive media. They are
presented in exactly the same way as recent records when retrieved although will be
subject to filters appropriate to the selection and the audit authority for which the
selection is being made. Archive records will take a longer time to retrieve, the retrieval
time being in proportion to the volume requested.

If and when the Counter Transaction service provider changes, then the Counter
Transaction journal will be transferred to the new provider as part of the transfer

agreement. Apart from the longevity of data retention and the associations of data with
post offices, these views are equivalent to those taken in the post office. Itis
understood that the vast majority of Post Office Ltd audits will be conducted within the
post offices, with resort to the Data centre server views only where the outlet views are
not available (denial, destruction) or, of course, where the historical record is required.

Schedule B3.2 specifies that the audit trail shall be maintained and retained by RMG
BU and protected by security measures.

2.1.3 Auditor Utilities

2.1.3.1 Interactive Access

Facilities available to Auditor roles within a Post Office are defined in document HNG-X Menu
Hierarchy and Messages DES/GEN/SPE/0007.

2.1.3.2 Bulk Access Using Keys

Bulk access is provided via the Horizon Data Centres only. A utility is provided to
produce bulk selections according to the role of the auditor and in the custom magnetic
format specified by the audit authority to which he belongs. Post Office Ltd Client audit
authorities may require different formats from those used by Post Office Ltd but RMG
BU proposes that they be required to use the Horizon native flat format directly.
Clearly, subject to the terms of Post Office Ltd’s contract with a Post Office Ltd Client,
the data accessed will be limited to that pertaining to that Client.

Retrieving Operational Audit Data in support of Post Office Ltd requests is described in
the CCD Security Management Service: Service Description - SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

In the event that the audit function requires direct, personal and extempore access to
the actual Counter Transaction operational journal then this access will be supervised
by RMG BU staff.

2.2 Systems Management Track

2.2.1 Systems Management Track Content and Maintenance

The track is made up of audit events for the particular domain in question. Within
these domains events are collected by Tivoli Agents and transformed into Tivoli Events.
In the Horizon solution all events that are deemed significant are transferred to the
Tivoli Collection Layer. From there the events are written to serial files as an audit trail.

Event data sources within the Horizon solution comprise:

« Counters in the Branch estate

¢ The Branch Router

¢ Data centre platforms and appliances from sources such as SNMP, Oracle,
Cisco, text files, Windows Event Logs, Syslog etc.

Tivoli provides extensive event management facilities including central display, sorting
and filtering before viewing, for example, all operations initiated by a particular

Audit Trails. These are, for the Counter Transaction Journal element of the Operational

Audit Trail 7 years and 18 months for all other elements, and for the Commercial Audit
Trail 7 years or contract duration which may be longer.

For these purposes BIMS is deemed to be part of the Operational Audit Trail.
