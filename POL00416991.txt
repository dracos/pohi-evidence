Sensitivity: Confidential

Andy

Thanks for this.

I have discussed this with Tracy Marshall and she has asked whether you could draft a letter to the Mrs Rachpal Athwal, spmr,
explaining in as simple terms as possible what happened and why it is now necessary for her to send us another cheque. Mrs
Athwal is arguing that she did what the helpline told her to do and as she has already settled the shortage by cheque which has
cleared from her bank account, doesn't see now why she should send another one despite the surplus in the branch.

Mrs Athwal and her husband have already challenged the integrity of the Horizon system so it needs to be explained that she
has not been disadvantaged by any software problem and that POL took the necessary steps to rectify this as soon as possible.

In view of the sensitive situation at this branch, could you please send the letter to Tracy first and cc to me.

lam off after today for a week so if you need to speak to me, I will be available all day.
In the meantime, I have asked Glenis Devlin to hold the DFR until we have resolved this.

Many thanks

Regards

When Horizon on line was delivered it was discovered that the software was misinterpreting the “Make Good Cheque” button as
“Settle Centrally”.

What should happen:-
Loss at branch trading declared i.e. cash declaration is lower than Horizon derived total.
e Resolved by “Make Good Cheque”.
Horizon derived cash position moves down to match cash declaration acknowledging that the cash is not there. Cheque
value (shown under “Other MOP" on branch trading statement) goes up by value of the cheque.

What was happening:-

Loss at branch trading declared i.e. cash declaration is lower than Horizon derived total.

e Resolved by “Make Good Cheque”.

* Horizon derived cash position moves down to match cash declaration acknowledging that the cash is not there. Horizon
interprets as “Settle Centrally” and moves the value to the Customer Account in POLSAP.

e Subpostmaster makes out cheque and places in the till.

 Atnext end of day cheque listing is produced and does not contain above cheque.

Cheque is introduced to Horizon via a cash/cheque adjustment. This increase the cheque value but decreases the
Horizon derived cash total. Therefore if the branch was in a balance position immediately prior to the adjustment they

would now have a cash gain equal to the cheque value.
All cheques are remmed out as per normal process.
 Cheqie clears but debt is not resolved.
Current Agents team pursue settled centrally debt under normal processes.

In this instance the expected actions are clearly seen within our management information system (attached) apart from the
cheque being remmed out before the cash/cheque adjustment was made.

On 21% January our Current Agents team talked to Daljinda Athwal (Manager) who was not happy but did confirm the anticipated
surplus was there. This is confirmed in the spreadsheet.

The problem has been corrected in late January.
Branches were not formally informed of the problem due to my not being able to obtain a target fix date for the problem.

Hope this makes sense.
