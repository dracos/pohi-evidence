hat happened:

2:21 counter 9. Clerk LSU002 did a banking withdrawal for 190.86 which was
added to the basket. The basket was not settled.

2:25 Same clerk logs on to counter 10 without logging out from counter 9
first.

lessage displayed:

Ihe clerk pressed Continue. The session on counter 9 was terminated and 3
isconnected session receipts printed, to show that there was an outstanding
session for which recovery would be needed.

13:30 Clerk TGI001 logged into counter 9 (again this was a concurrent logon,

they were already logged on to counter 1, and there were a couple of attempts
to log on). Recovery for the outstanding session was invoked.

the recovered basket was written into the correct stock unit SJ, but TP 1 BP 1.
stock unit SJ was in TP 12 BP4 (and wasn't rolled over until the following

IFADO21329 recovery into wrong TP/BP

Date: 26-Apr-2010 11:02:07 User:Anne Chambers

[Start of Response]

I've now reproduced this in LST, logging into a counter with outstanding
recovery using a user attached to a different stock unit which is in a
ifferent TP/BP from the original.

This is a serious problem because the recovered session uses the correct
(original) stock unit but the TP/BP of the stock unit to which the recovering
ser is attached.

For the original stock unit, this TP/BP may not yet exist, or may already have
een balanced, or may never exist. In the first case (as for this branch
Ireporting the problem) they will have a loss in one TP but a matching gain the
ext. In the latter two cases the transaction will never be included in the
accounts.

It've contacted the PM who confirms that they did have a gain in the next
eriod.

I've talked to Gareth Jenkins about this and we will attempt to find out
fhether any other recovered transactions have been similarly affected.

Increasing priority to A, because of the financial implications, and passing
call to 4th line. I have not attached any evidence, it is easily reproducible.

lore Analysis and proposed solution:

tr is sending current stockunit TP/BP in recovery settlement request. This
I'P/BP are updated in db during settlement of the recovery item.

01 1ForwardRecoveryStrategy.setUpRecoveryBasket() sets the optionaldata for the
recovery item.

In SettleBLO.setUpBasketData() the TP/BP are overridden with current stockunits
iTP/BP.

(This is where the TP/BP of the recovery item is changed to the current
lstockunit's TP/BP.

In SettleBLO.setUpBasketData(), the stockunit is set as current stockunit only
if (basketHeader.getStockUnitId() == null)

so, we propose to set the TP/BP in the basketHeader in the sameway to fix the
issue.

heck for null for TP/BP in basketheader, then only Set TP/BP to current
lstockunit's TP/BP.

Hi f (basketHeader.getStockUnitTradingPeriod() == null)
if
asketHeader.setStockUnitTradingPeriod (stockUnitP
lrofileLDO.getCurrentStockUnitTradingPeriod());

)

The same for BP also.

fhe fix looks ok although we are still considering whether there are any
lanforeseen implications. Please continue to do further testing, particularly in
the area of RollbackRecovery, and different scenarios such as original TP/BP
ahead of logon TP/BP, original behind logon TP/BP etc. Also, I would like some
confirmation that this fix does not impact SettleBLO in its role of normal
settlements (i.e. non-recovery). Please provide evidence that this testing has
een carried out.
