M: Carl Adrian Page.

(TC: 00:01:15)
Moderator: And your date of birth?

(TC: 00:01:17)
Moderator: Okay, and your occupation?

(TC: 00:01:20)
M: I haven't got occupation. I'm suspended from the Post Office.

(TC: 00:01:23)
Moderator: Okay, and home address please?

(TC: 00:01:25)
M: (mw 01.26);

(TC: 00:01:31)

Moderator: Okay. Thank you. Err, as I've explained, err, we are investigating a possible criminal
offence and therefore have to caution you, um, and that is you do not have to say anything but it
may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on
in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand that?

(TC: 00:01:47)
M: I understand that.

(TC: 00:01:48)

Moderator: Um, just so there's no confusion over what the caution means, err, I will explain it in
its entirety to you. Um, there are three elements to it. The first part says you do not have to say
anything. That means exactly that. You don't have to answer our questions today. You don't have
to speak to us today. Okay?

(TC: 00:02:02)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:02:03)

Moderator: The second part says that-, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when
questioned, something which you later rely on in court. What that effectively means is if this matter
should proceed to court, um, and at court you were to put forward a defence, um, which, um, for
instance, was a different version of events to what you've said here or you chose not to answer our
questions today and the court could reasonably have thought, ‘Well, you could've answered the
questions today,' they might infer that, you know, those, those version of events may not be true.

(TC: 00:02:35)
M: Okay.

Okay? And the third part says that anything you do say may be given in evidence and
that's exactly what it says. Um, everything you've said or you say in this interview and previous
interviews is recorded and can be used as evidence.

(TC: 00:02:48)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:02:48)

Moderator: Okay? Right. Um, this is a voluntary interview and I'll go through some of the
background when we start the interview proper as to how we've arrived at a voluntary interview
today. Can you just confirm that this is a voluntary-,

(TC: 00:03:01)
M: It is a voluntary interview, yes.

(TC: 00:03:02)

Moderator: Um, there are some-, there are, err, some legal formalities that we need to just go
through, err, initially before we start the interview proper. As I say, we're, we're-, we are Post
Office investigators and have slightly different ways of working than, say, the police or customs do.
Okay. The first, um, document I will refer to you, to you, is, is what we call the Legal Rights in the
Post Office is a form CS001. Okay, side A. Um, can I just put the date and time on there? 23rd.
15:48. Okay. Um, what I'll do, I'll just read the part of it out to you. Um, then there's four points on

3741
POL00066733

www.takenote.co

there. I'll allow you to read it yourself, um, and then if you could record your replies at the bottom
of that. Okay. Um, it says, 'Because you are suspected of having committed a criminal offence, you
must-, sorry. You may-, which may result in criminal prosecution, I must inform you,' and it says
the caution again, which, which-, I've already cautioned you but I'll say it anyway. 'You do not
have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned,
something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.' You
said you understand that. Um, then it says, 'I must also inform you that 1) you are not under arrest,
2) you do not have to remain at this interview. If, if the interview is being conducted anywhere
other than a Post Office Ltd premises, err, consent must also be obtained from the interviewee and
the person in title grant entry to premises to carry out the interview there.' Okay? Um, third point
says, 'If you do remain, you have the right to legal representation and advice including the right to
speak with a solicitor either in person or on the telephone.' Err, in brackets it says, 'A solicitor will
give you advice regarding legal aid,' um, and I can help you obtain a solicitor. Obviously that's
superfluous because Mr Farrington is sitting here. Um, number four says, 'You are entitled to read
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 codes of practice if you wish. The codes set out your
legal rights and the rules governing the conduct of this interview,’ and I have a little copy-,

(TC: 00:05:02)
M: Yes, I've seen it.

(TC: 00:05:03)

Moderator: Down there, if you wish to, err, peruse through that. Can I ask you to have a look at
that form yourself? Um, just have a read through those points yourself. Make sure that you're
happy, that you understand those points, and then if I can ask you to record, um, your replies to
those three questions there for me please. The third one's an either/or. Obviously because your
solicitor is here, you-, you'd be ticking that one or signing that one which says, 'I do want a, err,
solicitor at this time.' Yeah? The first one says, 'I wish to speak (talking over each other 05.44).' Oh,
sorry. They've moved them around since the last time I saw this form. It's the top one you need to
sign.

(TC: 00:05:51)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:05:51)
Moderator: Um, and this just says if you didn't want a solicitor now, you can choose at any time
during the course of the interview to have a-,

(TC: 00:05:58)
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, and then if you can sign, date and time and print your name at the bottom
please, the time now being 15:50 hours.

(TC: 00:06:07)
M: And it's 23rd, isn't it?

(TC: 00:06:08)
Moderator: It is.

(TC: 00:06:11)
M: There you go. Thank you.

(TC: 00:06:13)

Moderator: Thank you very much. Right. One other thing that-, in the Post Office, which is
different to, um, outside, err, investigative bodies is the, err, Post Office rights to have a, a friend
present during the interview. Um, there's another form, which, which details this and, again, I'll
read that out to you and allow you to have a, a read of it. This is form CS003, um, and it's-, the Post
Office Ltd have-, has agreed with the unions, so Post Office Ltd or SPSO (ph 06.41) staff, when
interviewed by an investigator may have a friend present at the interview. Any friend invited to
attend a Post Office Ltd interview or search must be at least eighteen years of age and not already
involved in the inquiry. He or she must be a Post Office Ltd employee, err, who may be the-, a local
union representative or other official of a recognised union for the grade, and then it says, 'Do you
require a friend?' If I can ask you to read that top part yourself to make sure that you're fully
happy with and understand what, err, what's being said there, um, and then-,

(TC: 00:07:13)
M: (inaudible 07.14)?

(TC: 00:07:14)

Moderator: Well, it's, it's up to you. If you want, err, a friend union rep, then we can make those
arrangements and, again, if you can sign, name and now 15:51. Okay. Um, so just going through
those, very briefly, those two forms, you've said, um, you've read questions one to four. You
understand questions one to four and obviously you-, you've signed that you wish to speak to a
solicitor obviously because your solicitor is here and you've had consultation prior to-, (inaudible
07.48).

(TC: 00:07:48)

Moderator: Um, and you've said no, you don't want a Post Office friend to be present.

(TC: 00:07:52)
M: Correct.

(TC: 00:07:52)

Moderator: Okay. If, at any time during the course of the interview, you change your mind, um,
about having a Post Office friend, please let us know. We can suspend the interview. Okay? Can I
just put that over there for a minute? Right, that's the formalities out the way. I just wanna spend a
minute or two just briefly going back through some of the history to explain how we've arrived
here today.

(TC: 00:08:13)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:08:13)
Moderator: Okay? Firstly, you were arrested by Staffordshire Police on Monday 13th January
2003 in the evening. Um, on the same evening, you were interviewed by police officers.

(TC: 00:08:27)
M: Correct.

(TC: 00:08:27)
Moderator: Err, the following day, 14th, Tuesday 14th January 2003, you were further
interviewed again by myself and one police officer.

(TC: 00:08:35)
M: And suspended.

(TC: 00:08:36)
Moderator: And suspended. Indeed, yes. Um, then on-, following that interview, you were released
on police bail, err, to return to Stafford Police Station on Tuesday 4th March 2003, yes?

M: Correct.

(TC: 00:08:50)
Moderator: Err, you returned on that day. Obviously we hadn't been able to go through all the
paperwork we had to by that time-,

(TC: 00:08:55)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:08:56)
Moderator: And therefore you were further bailed on that day to return to Stafford Police Station
on Tuesday Ist April-,

(TC: 00:09:01)
M: Correct.

(TC: 00:09:02)
Moderator: 2003. Um, at that time, um, you were-, you were obviously there and we were there.
We were proposing to, to carry out a further interview with you.

(TC: 00:09:09)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:09:10)

Moderator: Um, unfortunately, um, we ran out of time, um, on the custody record. Um, there's a
time element and therefore you were released from police bail, albeit you agreed to attend a
voluntary interview at a later date.

(TC: 00:09:23)
M: Can I make a note that I would have-, if you'd have let me know you wanted to interview me, you' ve
have been-, I' ve have had a solicitor present (inaudible 09.30).

(TC: 00:09:29)

Moderator: Yeah. Maybe my failure, I should have maybe, err, contacted you beforehand or your
solicitor's and made, made them aware of that. I, I just assumed that, um-, I just assumed you
would've arrived with one but maybe not.

(TC: 00:09:41)
M: Solicitors cost money.

(TC: 00:09:42)

Moderator: Indeed. My fault. Um, but yes, no fault of your own. Um, okay, and following that
then, you had agreed at that time and shortly afterwards I wrote to, to yourself and Mr Farrington
got in touch with me, um, and, err, it has resulted in a voluntary interview (TC 00:10:00) being
taken place today at the offices of Hand Morgan & Owen.

(TC: 00:10:14)

Moderator: Okay. Right. Okay. Um, the last time I interviewed you, Carl, it was only-, it was less
than 24 hours after, after you'd been arrested, um, and, and as I say, there was a large amount of
documentation to go through and including, at the time when I interviewed you, certain
documentation which had been seized from the office during the search on the 13th that wasn't
made available to me and therefore I wasn't able to, to show it to you to ask for any comments.

(TC: 00:10:42)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:10:42)
Moderator: I do have, err, the majority of those documents and, and initially I just wanna go

(TC: 00:10:52)

Monday, January 13th, um, there was a transaction which took place, um, early in the morning.

(TC: 00:12:53)
Moderator: Well, I just wondered why, why he didn't write one out for 360 grand or whatever it
came to.

(TC: 00:12:58)
M: Sometimes he writes that, um, but sometimes as I'm sorting the money out, he'd write, maybe, four
cheques out.

(TC: 00:13:05)
Moderator: Right. He writes those cheques, um, whilst he's there at the office, does he?

(TC: 00:13:08)

Moderator: Or are they already prepared?

(TC: 00:22:09)

Moderator: Um, right. Let's start from this point here. This is you speaking. It says, 'I've never
had a problem with any cheques. If I had a cheque, I've, I've, you know, I've said there's problems
with it. We had a cheque with him, a few, few cheques. He flagged it up before I did,' and I say,
'Right.' Okay. You then say, 'Then he used that to draw on-, that cheque to draw on some more
euros that came out-,'

(TC: 00:22:36)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:22:36)

Moderator: 'And then waiting because we still hadn't had the error notice because the error
notice, you know, for the-, for the cheque, it might take two or three months, so when those come
through, he's going to give me a cheque, which is-,' and then I say, 'Okay'. Can you just clarify
what you meant by that?

(TC: 00:22:55)

M: It's that the-, I had a notification from the cheque (mw 22.59) people there, there might be a problem
with the cheques and then turned around said, ' There's a problem with the cheques.' I said, 'I' ve had a
cheque from? 10 cover the amount.’ Right?

(TC: 00:23:07)
Moderator: Right, yep.

(TC: 00:23:08)

M: Now, with the cheque reconciliation people, you know yourself that it may take-, you might get next

week or you might get two or three weeks. It might take a bit longer for them to come through, so what I

decided to do is that I gave him some euros for that amount and then when the problems with the cheques
come through, the problem cheques, he'd give me a cheque to cover those.

(TC: 00:23:30)
Moderator: Right. So, he bought some more euros using this cheque, which he gave to you to cover
the bounced checks?

(TC: 00:23:36)
M: Yes because how can I put that through the system when I hadn't had an error notice come through?

M: 'Cause else is-, how can I-, I mean, all I'm gonna do then is run that out to the end of the week and
sell a profit of 278,000. Then what am I gunna do? Wait then for the reconciliation department to get in
touch with me?

(TC: 00:23:54)
Moderator: Yeah.

(TC: 00:23:55)
M: So, all I did, I used that to sell the rest of the, err, the cheques and when the reconciliation people get
in touch with me and send me physically something through, I' ve got a cheque to cover those in.

(TC: 00:24:05)
M: So, would that have been on the 2nd of, of January that you gave him-, ' cause he gave you the
cheque, presumably on the 2nd, because that's the date we, we weren't sure about that.

(TC: 00:24:14)

(TC: 00:24:59)
Moderator: Right. But, but that-, but that cheque, he'd, he'd given you- well who, who suggested to
do that?

(TC: 00:25:06)
M: I thought I'd take off my own back, the reason being, that cheque was then stopping the till, have to
show the end of the week, the profit between 70 and eight thousand pound.

(TC: 00:25:17)
Moderator: Well, you don't have to show the cheque at all, isn't it, he just gave you the cheque to
wait for your error notice to come back, isn't it?

(TC: 00:25:21)
M: Yeah, but that might take two or three weeks, might take a month, two months.

(TC: 00:25:24)
Moderator: Right, so you suggested to him.

(TC: 00:25:26)
M: No, I didn't, I took it off my own back, I was saying, I said, well why don't you use this.

(TC: 00:25:32)
Moderator: Sorry, who suggested what?

(TC: 00:25:33)
M: I suggested it, because else someone would have a, a cheque in my till for that amount and if say I' ve
got auditors maybe three weeks down the line, there's a cheque here, received the 2nd of the Ist.

(TC: 00:25:43)

Moderator: But, you could've told- if the auditors came down or if anyone else came down, you
could've told them that, that cheque is sitting in the till still because you're waiting for the error

(TC: 00:25:57)

(TC: 00:25:59)

(TC: 00:26:02)
M: Yes.

(TC: 00:26:04)
Moderator: Right and.

(TC: 00:26:05)
M: And, then when, when the analysis come through, it'd given me cheques to cover that then. Because,
physically I'm not showing any loss or profit.

(TC: 00:26:12)
Moderator: So he'd, he'd have to give you another cheque for 278181.82 when the error notice

(TC: 00:26:24)

M: Because I haven't-, I haven't officially been told, I know I' ve been told by the phone, but I' ve got
nothing official to say there's a problem with the cheques. I remember a while back I had a problem with
the, somebody, the error notice people phoned me up, said there's an error with the cheque, problem with
the cheque, right, £2,000 with somebody. And, then, I had a cheque off him for another £2000 right and
what happened, it'd been, they'd planned to refer to drawer, the post office had the cheque for £2,000,
then they send it back to the um, the cheque people again, the band and the (mw 26.52) was £4,000
instead of £2,000 out of profit, out of pocket.

(TC: 00:26:56)
Moderator: Okay, but, so it wasn't his suggestion? He didn't say to you, well, you know, Carl, I'm
gonna give you this (talking over each other 27.02).

(TC: 00:27:03)

M: No, i thought, well, I'll clean the till out and get it all straight and then when they officially get the
error notice come through, asking for the money, which, as I said to you before, I have no-, I have, in the
past I' ve never had a problem with it or had any inkling that there's a problem with him after dealing with
him for so long and having that amount of money in cheques.

(TC: 00:27:21)

Moderator: Well, okay, well let's assume then that the transaction happened around about that
time, either on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th, right. Why was the cheque still there on the 13th then if he'd
bought some more euros?

(TC: 00:27:33)
M: Because, he bought, he might' ve bought the, he didn't buy the euros maybe the 2nd, might be a couple
of days after, I can't tell off the top of me head.

(TC: 00:27:40)
Moderator: Right.

(TC: 00:27:42)

(TC: 00:27:56)

(TC: 00:27:57)
M: Or 12th, 11th, 10th or 9th, could' ve purchased on the 9th or the 8th.

(TC: 00:28:00)

Moderator: I don't think he did, because the other cheques which I've shown you, the ones he
bounced, which have bounced, this one, these two here, which come to 184000 which is MP, um,
can't remember where it is now. Um, the two, right, MP 2 of this exhibit here, that comes to
£184332.13, that was for transactions, two transactions done on the 7th of January.

(TC: 00:28:32)
M: Okay. So, someone's left it there and decided they're gonna use it later, as they did.

M: No.

(TC: 00:28:41)
Moderator: You were going to use it later?

(TC: 00:28:43)

iright and then I thought to myself, well
I'll use this cheque that's sat in the drawer to buy euros, right, to sell and wait for the error notice to come
through. That might have been there three or four days, five days.

Moderator: Yeah, sorry those euros, yeah. So, it's gotta be prior to that, hasn't it, because the next
transaction after the 7th, was the one on the 13th. There wasn't a transaction between the 7th and
the 13th.

(TC: 00:29:25)
M: Well, it might have been that. He might have used his transaction for that.

(TC: 00:29:28)

(TC: 00:29:31)

and it's towards the end, I haven't got, um, not got time there, but it's probably about, oh right,
we're about probably 22, 23 minutes into it now. Right, it starts with me by saying, um, we're
talking about the three cheques, you know the three cheques for £278, the bounced ones, yeah?

there was three cheques in the post that had been bounced and I know he gave you reasons as to

you think that was a wise decision to, um, accept a cheque from him to cover the error notices when
it materialised and yet allow him to have more euros on that cheque?

(TC: 00:33:46)
M: Well, as you said, I've had no problems with him in the past. I mean, in hindsight, if everybody acts
in hindsight, no I shouldn't have done.

(TC: 00:33:52)
Moderator: Right. But, if you suggested it, why, how did you know he wanted euros that day?

(TC: 00:34:01)
M: Well, he comes in and has euros nearly every, not every day, every, you know, two or three days, or
whatever.

(TC: 00:34:06)
Moderator: But, but, he presumably came along to cover the three that were bounced, right? He
wasn't expecting to go home with 280 grands worth of euros.

(TC: 00:34:15)
M: Yes, but he'd already wrote a cheque for the money that he came out with, didn't he.

Moderator: I know, but he was-, he was only, see he was only going to turn up to your office, give
you this cheque and say, that's Carl, here you are, when you get that error notice, that covers it. I
don't expect he ever thought he was gonna walk out on the same day with another 280 grand of
euros.

(TC: 00:34:30)
M: He didn't walk out the same day, did he.

(TC: 00:34:31)
Moderator: He didn't?

(TC: 00:34:32)
M: He may have walked out a couple of days after, I mean, you're asking me to look back, you' ve got all
the figures there.

(TC: 00:34:36)

Moderator: Let, let's refer to, um, 'cause I'm coming onto this anyway, um, let's refer to this
exhibit here which is MP3. You've seen part of the schedule of this, I believe, already, err, this is
now the final version, the one you probably had before, err, wasn't fully completed because, um, I
hadn't been, err, supplied all of the over 5k rates, okay.

(TC: 00:34:57)
M: Okay

(TC: 00:34:58)

Moderator: Before I explain fully what that, um, what the schedule demonstrates or shows, let's
just look at the last page, um, which shows the transactions which took place in January, okay. 3rd
of January, yeah, um, advised 290000 euros, okay and that's the amount £178351 and I don't know
if I can't read that, 78 pence, right. Then, on the 7th January, there's two lots bought, err, 150000
each time and the two cheque values are the ones we've talked about, MP2, okay. And, then at the
very bottom, um, I've separated it, it's the 13th transaction of 584000, okay. Can you-, can you tell
me then, when, when he walked out with 280 grands worth of euros?

(TC: 00:35:47)
M: Now, I'd say between the 7th and 13th, I'm sure.

Moderator: Between the 7th and the 13th?

(TC: 00:35:52)
M: Yeah, or in between, I mean, I can't, off the top of my head, I can't remember, I mean, the 3rd or the
7th, [honestly don't know, can't remember.

(TC: 00:36:00)

Moderator: So, because, the date on this cheque is the 2nd of, um, January which was a Thursday,
well according to this schedule and I've been through every single, err, forward money changer till
roll to pick out all of these transactions as well as the team, um, and that's what I've found and
there isn't-, there isn't a transaction on the 2nd of January, which was.

(TC: 00:36:23)
M: Like I say, it weren't the 2nd.

(TC: 00:36:23)

Moderator: No, no, but if there wasn't one on the 2nd, there's one on the 3rd, right, um, which is-,
which is for a lower amount, £178,000, right, um, and in fact, later on in the interview, I'll show you
the cheques you used for those, okay.

(TC: 00:36:38)
M: Okay, yeah.

(TC: 00:36:39)
Moderator: Okay, um, and I've shown you the cheques you used on the 7th so I don't understand
where this transaction is then. Did you put it through the forward money changer?

(TC: 00:36:50)
M: Yeah, I'm sure I did.

(TC: 00:36:51)
Moderator: You did?

(TC: 00:36:52)
M: 99% sure I did.

(TC: 00:36:54)
Moderator: Alright.

(TC: 00:36:54)
M: Have you asked them for a receipt?

(TC: 00:36:56)
Moderator: Have I asked them for a receipt?

(TC: 00:36:57)
M: Yes.

(TC: 00:36:57)
Moderator: Um, no, no. Well, I wasn't aware that that's what you'd done, I'd noted it in my
interview and that's why I wanted to clarify.

(TC: 00:37:03)
M: Yeah, I did tell you, I told the police and I' ve told you on the 14th.

(TC: 00:37:07)
Moderator: Well, I wasn't-, I wasn't fully aware that he'd purchased more euros with this cheque.

(TC: 00:37:11)
M: I did tell you.

(TC: 00:37:12)

Moderator: Well, that's why, why I clarified that, because I wasn't sure, um, but now I know. But,
I still can't find where that transaction took place. But, you're absolutely sure he purchased more
euros with that cheque?

(TC: 00:37:24)
M: Yes he did, yeah.

(TC: 00:37:26)
Moderator: Okay. Okay. Right, as I say, we're moving onto the schedule now anyway, um, you've
seen it before haven't you?

(TC: 00:37:43)
M: Yes, I have.

(TC: 00:37:44)
Moderator: Right, okay, um, just for the benefit of those then that listen to this tape, um, I'll
briefly go through the main headings on it, okay. Dates of all the transactions.

(TC: 00:37:57)
M: Cash count, time, transactions, euros.

(TC: 00:3: :00)

rate for under £5,000, the rate for over £5, 000, ‘they amount that should have been paid using “it
published rates and therefore then the underpayment, yeah, okay. There's a number of pages there,
um, and if we go back to the second page, the last page sorry. Um, discounting the transaction that
took place on the 13th, okay that's why I put it down at the bottom, err, the totals, err, which are
shown on this schedule and I should say that, I should point out also that it starts on the 9th of
March, because that's when the till rolls that we've got back start from. Okay and it goes all the
way through to the 13th January '03, that's the 9th March 2002. There are, however, 27 working
days which are missing for which we couldn't find the till rolls. Therefore there are some more
transactions which we're not able to find. Apart from, back here, where we do have all of the till
rolls, yeah?

(TC: 00:38:56)
M: Yeah.

(TC: 00:38:56)

Moderator: Yeah, okay and that's the latter period. Now, just covering the totals then, um, there's
110 transactions, um, detailed on the schedule, um, and during that time, err, there's €11,132,450
um, for which he paid a sterling value of £6,701,097.08. And, what we're

(TC: 00:39:28)
M: It should have been £7,000.

(TC: 00:39:30)
Moderator: It should have been £7,291,965.90 and the difference between those two then comes to

£590,868.83, yeah. So, that's what we're saying, we in the Post Office are saying that you had no
authority to change those rates, um, albeit you've used your discretion.

(TC: 00:39:52)
M: Can [ask you a question? What profit did you make?

(TC: 00:39:54)
Moderator: What profit? Well it's not a profit.

(TC: 00:39:57)
M: You made no profit out of the transactions at all?

(TC: 00:39:59)

Moderator: No. No, not at all and I'll (TC 00:40:00) demonstrate that to you very shortly. Because,
the amounts you've sold them for, you've effectively given it away and you've got to think about the
profits, as in the overheads of, err, First Rate supplying the, err, supplying the currency to us, it
being stored at Hemel, it being transferred to you by special delivery and by the time you take all of
those overheads into account, the little profit that you may want to call profit that you've made on
them is a loss in fact, not profit.

(TC: 00:40:25)

M: Okay, so you're saying that First Rate would not, um, the Post Office via Bank of Ireland via First
Rate, or which way it goes, will not turn around and say they'll match or beat anything on the open
market?

(TC: 00:40:40)

Moderator: If they did, that would be a matter for them and if that's the case, you know, why
didn't you put a call into Hemel or to First Rate directly and say, I've got a business customer who
buys large quantities from me, can we give him a special rate.

(TC: 00:40:52)
M: But, I asked your area manager then.

(TC: 00:40:54)
Moderator: Well, not an area manager that I've spoken to whose supplied witness statements.

M: Yes, but the one person I did speak to, can't remember,

(TC: 00:41:01)
Moderator: Well, that begs the question whether such a conversation took place or not and I don't
know, only he can say that, can't he.

(TC: 00:41:08)
M: Okay

(TC: 00:41:08)

Moderator: Yeah. Um, and when we talk, when we go through some of the evidence there, I'll be
able to demonstrate to you what you call profit is not in fact a profit, it's a loss to the Post Office
and what we’re saying is at the current time, or from just those transactions alone, you've lost the
Post Office at least £590,000.

(TC: 00:41:31)
M: Okay

(TC: 00:41:31)
Moderator: Yeah. Okay. Um, just, again, very briefly.

(te: 00:41:53)

(TC: 00:42:04)
Moderator: Um, we've identified every large transaction which took place, um, from those till rolls
and then matched them up with the vast majority of, um, cheques where we can find cheques, um,

I nd, I think Mr Page, at the last interview, said that
he's the only person who buys such large amounts and they stick out like a sore thumb.

(TC: 00:42:26)
M: Thank you.

(TC: 00:42:26)
Moderator: Would you agree with that?

(TC: 00:42:30)

Moderator: I think there's nothing under, I was just going to say there's nothing under 5000 that
he's bought. The one time he bought 5000 was on the 22nd of March 2002. Everything after that is,
is a very large amount, yeah. This tape is gonna finish very shortly, um, can I ask you Carl, just to
sign above your name there, it's tape seal number 058037, thank you, would you like to read us that
or not? Err, there isn’t a proper space, but anywhere on there will do. (Silence 42.59-43.09) Thank
you. Okay, the time now then being 16.28 hours, we're suspending this tape. (Silence 43.21-43.51).
