Martin,

Further to our telephone call earlier today, I attach the recent letter received from the CCRC and our
acknowledgement of receipt. I also attach for ease of reference our 5 June 2014 letter to which the CCRC refers.

Please note the CCRC’s specific request for the preservation of materials.

We are meeting Brian Altman QC on Friday to discuss the form and content our response. Given that this is likely to
involve a summary of Cartwright King’s review of the cases submitted through the Mediation Scheme (both criminal
and non-criminal), we will need you to prepare a note summarising the steps you have taken and why they were
necessary.

Please give me an indication of the likely cost of this so that I can determine whether it can be dealt with under the ad
hoc file or if it needs a separate eSRF. Please also let me know if there is any reason why you might not be able to

complete this in the early part of next week.

Thanks, Rodric
