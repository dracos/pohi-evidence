Rebecca, Simon,

As promised, please find attached copies of the 7 additional bug reports. As discussed yesterday, these have not
been reviewed by Andy. I have included our queries regarding disclosure and the addition of documents to the trial
bundle in the below table below. In terms of timings for adding documents to the trial bundle, we propose to keep a
record of any and add these to the list Tony sends through before trial so that everything can be added in one go,
unless you need the trial bundle references sooner.

Kind regards

Katie

further disclosure and potentially draw
