Electronic documents questionnaire

(Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 31B)
WARNING: Unless the court makes some other order, the answers given in this document may only be
used for the purposes of the proceedings in which the document is produced unless it has been read to

or by the court or referred to at a hearing which has been held in public or the Court gives permission or
the party who has completed this questionnaire agrees.

Please read the notes at the end of this form before completing the questionnaire

Part 1 — Your disclosure

General Comment

The Claims in this litigation are very broad and the generic pleadings produced by the Claimants so far
provide only limited details on those claims. This litigation therefore has the potential to touch on nearly
all aspects of Post Office's business and the volume of disclosable documents may be enormous.

In this Electronic Disclosure Questionnaire, Post Office has sought to provide a holistic view of the
documents and databases which appear, at this stage, to be potentially relevant to this litigation. It may
be that a further or revised EDQ is required as the issues in dispute are further particularised and
refined, and as more information becomes available.

Post Office does not believe that it would be reasonable or proportionate to disclose all the documents in
all the sources identified below. It proposes, as has been agreed by the Claimants, that following
exchange of the EDQs the parties discuss the purposes and topics for which further disclosure is sought
and seeks to narrow the sources and / or filepaths from which disclosure is provided. The parties can
then also discuss further search criteria, keywords that might be applied to those source documents so
to filter down to those that are truly useful and additional technologies or analytics.

Note on Royal Mail: Post Office and Royal Mail have at all material times been two separate companies
but up to 1 April 2012 Post Office was part of the Royal Mail Group and they had a number of shared IT
systems. After 1 April 2012, the two companies were separated, with Post Office continuing to be
owned by the UK Government and Royal Mail being privatised. Since then the IT systems have also
been separated and Post Office has migrated to using its own systems. Where relevant, this point is
identified below.

Extent of a reasonable search
Date range and custodians

1. What date range do you consider that your searches for Electronic Documents should cover (‘the
date range’)?

In relation to documents which relate to individual Claimants (as per Question 6), disclosure to be
limited to electronic and hard copy documents created between 6 months before the Claimant's
first date of service with Post Office and (a) 6 months after the Claimant's last date of service, or
(b) 6 December 2017 (whichever is earlier).

A number of the Claimants are currently acting as postmasters and thus documents continue to
be generated in relation to them which may be relevant. However, a longstop date of 6
December 2017 has been selected for the practical purpose of having a cut-off date for extracting
data from IT systems into a disclosure review platform. Post Office believes it is reasonable and
proportionate (given the issues with extraction of data explained below) to set a longstop date.

Please see Appendix A to this Electronic Disclosure Questionnaire for the date ranges of each

Claimant.

In relation to "generic" documents, disclosure to be limited to electronic and hard copy
documents created between 1 January 1999 and 6 December 2017.

Attachments to emails which do not fall within the above date ranges should be disclosed where
the parent email falls within the date range.

Identify the custodians or creators of your Electronic Documents whose repositories of
documents you consider should be searched.

Note - Include names of all those who may have or have had custody of disclosable documents,
including secretaries, personal assistants, former employees and/or former participants. It may
be helpful to identify different dates for particular custodians.

Please see Appendix B of this Electronic Disclosure Questionnaire for a list of Key Teams and
Custodians.

As at 1 October 2017, Post Office had 4,965 contracted employees. These work from around
320 different offices and locations, with 461 of Post Office's employees either working from
home or are field-based, meaning that they have no fixed office base. Consequently, Post
Office will have potentially relevant documents spread amongst a significant number of people
and different locations. The list of Key Teams and Custodians at Appendix B is limited to
those teams and individuals who from the generic pleadings appear to be relevant to the
issues in dispute. Post Office considers it reasonable and proportionate to limit its search to
the custodians listed. This may change based on additional information, or if Claimants agree
to limit scope and focus on specific custodians.

Method of search

Key words

Note - Where Keyword Searches are used in order to identify irrelevant documents which are to
be excluded from disclosure (for example a confidential name of a client or customer), a general
description of the type of search may be given

6. Do you consider that Keyword Searches should be used Yes O No
as part of the process of determining which Electronic Documents
you should disclose?

If Yes, please provide details of —

(1) the keywords used or to be used (by reference, if applicable, to individual custodians,
creators, repositories, file types and/or date ranges); and

In relation to documents that specifically refer to a Claimant, Post Office proposes to apply
the following key words to identify those documents:

(Claimant's First Name or Claimant's Last Name) AND (Branch Name or Branch Code or
Company Name)) or Mediation Case Number.

For example, a document which included the terms "Alan" or "Bates" and "Craig-y-don" or
"461614" would be identified as a document which is relevant to Alan Bates, as would a
document including the term "M137".

This is subject to the assumption that the number of documents deemed to be keyword
responsive is not disproportionate or unreasonable. These keywords will be considered
further after the data has been extracted, keywords applied and the results discussed with
the Claimants' legal advisors.

As addressed in Womble Bond Dickinson's letter of 24 November 2017, Post Office
proposes that following the exchange of EDQs, the parties discuss the other topics on which
further disclosure is sought and then seek to agree appropriate key words for these topics.

(2) the extent to which the Keyword Searches have been or will be supplemented by a review of
individual documents.

All documents and their family members deemed to be keyword responsive will be
individually reviewed to determine their relevance (and to redact or remove any material

that is legally privileged).

This is subject to the assumption that the number of documents deemed to be keyword
responsive is not disproportionate or unreasonable to be individually reviewed. This will be
determined after the data has been extracted, keywords applied and the results discussed
with the Claimants’ legal advisors.

Other types of automated searches

7. Do you consider that automated searches or automated techniques other Yes ONo
than Keyword Searches (for example, concept searches or clustering)
should be used as part of the process of determining which Electronic
Documents you should disclose?

If Yes, please provide details of —

(1) the process(es) used or to be used (by reference, if applicable, to individual custodians,
creators, repositories, file types and/or date ranges);

This will be reviewed once the potentially responsive material has been collected,
indexed and an overview has been obtained as to whether keywords will be
appropriate. Again, that review will include discussion with the Claimants’ legal
advisors.

(2) the extent to which the processes have been or will be supplemented by a review of individual
documents; and

Documents identified as potentially relevant by any searches will be subject to a
review.

(3) how the methodology of automated searches will be made available for consideration by other
parties.

This is something that will be considered in due course once a view has been reached
as to what searches or techniques are appropriate.

8. If the answer to Question 6 or 7 is ‘Yes’, state whether (a) attachments to e-mails (b) compressed
files (c) embedded files and (d) imaged text will respond to your Keyword Searches or other
automated search.

Yes, Post Office proposes that documents which would not be responsive are
converted into an OCR document so as to be responsive to keywords.

Documents which cannot be converted to OCR (such as call recordings), will be
subject to manual review. This is subject to the assumption that the number of
documents is not disproportionate or unreasonable to be individually reviewed. This
will be determined after the data has been extracted, keywords applied and discussion
with the Claimants’ legal advisors.

9. Are you using or intending to use computer software for other purposes in Yes ONo
relation to disclosure?

If Yes, please provide details of the software, processes and methods to be used.

Subject to the issue of proportionality it is envisaged that having collected the data it
will be indexed, non-searchable files containing text will be OCR’d and a fully
searchable database of the material will be prepared — with any documents that
cannot be included being identified.

In addition, it is proposed that a litigation review database (kCura Relativity) will be
used to maximise the efficiency of the review exercise.

Potential problems with the extent of search and accessibility of Electronic Documents

Note - See Practice Direction 31B, which refers to the following matters which may be relevant: (a) the
number of documents involved; (b) the nature and complexity of the proceedings; (c) the ease and expense
of retrieval of any particular document; (d) the availability of documents or contents of documents from other
sources; and (e) the significance of any document which is likely to be located during the search.

10. Do any of the sources and/or documents identified in this Electronic Yes ONo
Documents Questionnaire raise questions about the reasonableness of
the search which ought to be taken into account?

If Yes, please give details.

(a) Sharepoint

Post Office has already engaged a third party e-disclosure provider to forensically extract
and preserve potentially relevant documents from SharePoint. This was a considerable
project requiring input from ComputaCenter (Post Office's IT supplier that manages access to
SharePoint), as well as internal input from Post Office's data and information security teams,
IT team and owners of the SharePoint sites. During this extraction a number of issues were
encountered and these may re-occur during future extractions.

. Due to the security permissions being setting up in a granular manner
(enabling access to one area of SharePoint does not enable access to other
areas) there were and may be further issues creating a user account for the
third party e-disclosure provider which enables an appropriate level of access
for documents to be forensically extracted.

. Once access to SharePoint was obtained, Nuix (the collection tool) was
unable to communicate with SharePoint.

. The above matters have now been resolved but similar difficulties may be
faced with further extractions from SharePoint.

(b) Transaction and event data:

As addressed in Womble Bond Dickinson's letter of 22 November 2017 (a copy of which is
enclosed at Appendix G), Post Office has been informed by Fujitsu that there are a vast
number of fields available in the Horizon database which hosts the transaction and event
data and that over time these fields have changed. Post Office therefore proposes it would
be reasonable and proportionate that the data is filtered so that it only includes those fields
which relate to transactions and events which would affect a branch's accounts.

To disclose the unfiltered data would require it to be extracted in a .txt format (rather than in
.xlsx which can be read by Excel) and converted into a readable format. Further, the
unfiltered data would be between 10GB and 1000B of data per branch per month depending
on the size of the branch and the activity in that branch during the month. This compares to
the 1 MB of data per month in the filtered format. The hosting of 400 months of unfiltered
data by Post Office's third party e-discovery partner would cost between £100,000 and £1
million per a month.

The Claimants have not yet responded on this proposal and it will therefore be discussed
between the parties following exchange of the EDQs.

POL-BSFF-0090111_0006
POL00252048
POL00252048

(c) Proprietary databases:

A number of the databases used by Post Office are proprietary databases which require
specialist software to review the data in an intelligible format. These databases are often not
set up for mass extraction of data and where it is not possible to extract documents in their
native format, then it is proposed that the documents are (where possible) exported to
commonly used software such as Excel. Further, responsibility for these proprietary
databases during the relevant period has been passed between companies and Post Office is
reliant on the third parties for the transfer of this data between systems and the assistance of
third parties to access this data.

(d) Other:

It is not anticipated that there will be other problems but until the extraction of documents
begins it is impossible to guarantee this.

11. Are any documents which may be disclosable encrypted, password- Yes O No
protected or for other reasons difficult to access, or do you have any
reason to believe that they may be?

If Yes, please state which of the categories identified at Questions 3, 4 and 5 above are affected,
and your proposals for making them accessible.

Note - For example, back-ups, archives, off-site or outsourced document storage, documents created by
former employees, documents stored in other jurisdictions, documents in foreign languages.

Please see Appendix C. A number of the documents contain coding information that, while

often intelligible from the text, would need to be viewed in its native program to see the
intended format.

12. Are you aware of any other points in relation to disclosure of your & Yes ONo
Electronic Documents which require discussion between the parties?

If Yes, please give details.

As addressed above, there is a need to agree search terms, filtering of transaction and event
data, process for exchanging documents and the extent of disclosure which is to be provided
in relation to "generic documents". These matters shall be discussed between the parties
following exchange of EDQs.

Preservation of Electronic Documents
13. Do you have a document retention policy? Yes O.No

If Yes, please give details

The majority of the Post Office's documents are retained for a period of 7 years, however the
specific document retention policies depend on the type of document and team. Please see
Question 5 for further information.

When an employee ceases to be an employee of Post Office, their laptops are re-distributed
within the business. Their emails would remain stored in Mimecast (as explained further in
Question 3) and documents stored in SharePoint.

If Yes, when did you do so?

Yes, 20 April 2016 and 12 May 2017.

Inspection

15. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties to this Electronic
Documents Questionnaire, (a) in what format and (b) on what media do you intend to provide to
other parties copies of disclosed documents which are or will be available in electronic form?

Please see Appendix H which sets out the Post Office's proposals made to the Claimants on
14 November 2017. This matter will be discussed between the parties following the exchange
of EDQs.

16. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties to this Electronic
Documents Questionnaire, do you intend to provide other parties with Disclosure Data
electronically?

If Yes, in what format and on what media?

See Question 15, above. The format and media / method of delivery will be agreed with the
other party and could involve USB stick or hard drive or sftp transfer - depending on volumes
and what is agreed.

17. Insofar as you have available or will have available searchable OCR Yes O.No
versions of Electronic Documents, do you intend to provide the
searchable OCR version to other parties?

Note - There is no requirement that you should obtain OCR versions of documents, and this question is
directed only to OCR versions which you have available or expect to have available to you. If you do provide
OCR versions to another party, they will be provided by you on an ‘as is’ basis, with no assurance to the
other party that the OCR versions are complete or accurate. You may wish to exclude provision of OCR
versions of documents which have been redacted.

If No, why not?

Part 2 - The disclosure of other parties
The extent and content of their search
18. Do you at this stage have any proposals about the date ranges which Yes ONo

should be searched by other parties to the proceedings?

If Yes, please provide details.

Same as Question 1.
19. Do you at this stage have any proposals about the custodians or creators Yes ONo

whose repositories of documents should be searched for disclosable
documents by other parties to the proceedings?
If Yes, please provide details.

Note - Include names of all those who may have or have had custody of disclosable documents, including
secretaries, personal assistants, former employees and/or former participants. It may be helpful to identify
different dates for particular custodians.

As raised with the Claimants on 30 May 2017, Post Office proposes that the following
custodians should be within scope for searching:

(a) Claimants;

(b) Claimant's accountants / financial advisors;

(c) Claimant's previous lawyers;

(d) Claimant's insolvency practitioners (where applicable);

(e) Claimant's estate agents (where Claimant is seeking to claim loss of investment)
(f) HMRC / Claimant's tax advisors;

(g) Claimant's medical advisors (where Claimant is seeking to claim personal injury);
(h) other business advisors;

(0) Claimant's branch managers or assistants; and

0) Claimant's family member (where Claimant is seeking to claim for losses caused to
them).

20. Do you consider that the other party(ies) should disclose all available Yes ONo
Metadata attaching to any documents?

If Yes, please provide details of the documents or categories of documents.

Note - ‘Metadata’ is information about the document or file which is recorded in the computer, such as the
date and time of creation or modification of a word-processing file, or the author and the date and time of
sending of an e-mail. The question is directed to the more extensive Metadata which may be relevant where
for example authenticity is disputed.

Disclosure is sought of all available files in their native format together with a load file indexing
that material and holding the key metadata fields — in the same way as is contemplated for
disclosure by Post Office as outlined in our response to Question 15 above.

Proposals for the method to be adopted for their searches

21. Do you at this stage have any proposals about the Keyword Searches, or Yes ONo
other automated searches, which should be applied by other parties to
their document sets?

If Yes, please provide details.

As stated at Question 12 above, this is something that will need to be discussed and agreed in
due course.

Inspection

22. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties to this Electronic
Documents Questionnaire, (a) in what format and (b) on what media do you wish to receive
copies of disclosed documents which are or will be available in electronic form?

(a) The format in which the documents were created.

(b) The media / method of delivery will be agreed with the other party and could involve USB
stick or hard drive or sftp transfer - depending on volumes and what is agreed.

23. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties Yes O No
to this Electronic Documents Questionnaire, do you wish to receive
Disclosure Data electronically?

If Yes, in what format and on what media?

E-Filing
Cabinets

From around 2004 to the introduction of
SharePoint, Post Office used E-Filing
Cabinets within Lotus Notes for the
storage of electronic documents.

The E-Filing Cabinets were on a server
hosted by Royal Mail. Following Post
Office's separation from Royal Mail on 1
April 2012, access to the E-Filing
Cabinets was lost.

On 28 June 2017, Royal Mail provided
Post Office with a copy of the E-Filing
Cabinets. However, this copy is not
complete with, for example, some
attachments to emails and _ files
embedded in other documents having
been lost.

Since March 2016, Post Office has used
a cloud based platform called One Drive.
One Drive synchronises_ with the
documents held in the "My Documents"
folder for a user. If a document is
deleted from either the "My Documents"
folder or from One Drive then these
documents are potentially restorable for
approximately 60 days, following which
they are permanently deleted.

Prior to One Drive, Post Office's
employees stored their documents in

Horizon Transaction and event data As set out in Question 4. Transaction and event data Either make available in native format or

Transaction data is the line-by-line record
of each transaction processed in a
branch. Event data records events on
Horizon such as logging on and off,
printing certain reports, etc. In Horizon
Online (i.e. since 2010) this data is input
on terminals in a branch and then
transmitted to and stored in central data
centres.

Transaction and event data is held in the

To retrieve all transaction and event
data for all of the Claimants will be a
considerable undertaking. Fujitsu
have informed Post Office that to
extract one month of data for a branch
takes 1 % hours. To extract a years’
worth of data for all Claimants would
take approx. 10,000 man hours. This
is a technical limitation on the system.

central data centres for a period of seven
years. After 7 years, the data is usually
deleted at regular intervals. In October
2014, as part of the Mediation Scheme,
Post Office instructed Fujitsu to stop
deleting transaction and event data. Post
Office understand that Fujitsu currently
holds transaction and event data for all
branches dating back to October 2007.

Counter logs

Post Office understand from __ its
discussions with Fujitsu that there are a
number of logs held on the terminals and
not stored in the data centre. The two
which may, depending on the
circumstances, be of relevance are:

. The "postofficecounterlog" which
contains data concerning
interactions between the terminal
and the PiNpad, rateboard and
printer; information messages
from the Counter Business
Application (e.g. identifying
button presses and messages
which appear on the terminal
screen); and the building of
reference data for use by the
Horizon application.

. The "messagelog" which contains
information about messages sent
from the counter to the data
centre and the responses
received from the data centre.

The logs are held on a terminal for a
period of 30 days, following which they
are overwritten. Fujitsu can extract the

Disclosure of transaction and event
data will be given, but will need to
focussed to particular Claimants and
dates in order to be provided in a
timely manner.

Counter logs
No.

On 28 September 2017, Womble
Bond Dickinson made proposals to
Freeths on the preservation of the
relevant counter logs. This proposal
explained that to extract the logs for all
Claimants who are live postmasters
(approx. 140) would take around 280
hours every month (since process
would need to be run every 30 days
due to the over writing of the data).
This would be unreasonable and
disproportionate.

Post Office therefore proposed that if
a Claimant believes they have
experienced a technical issue with
Horizon, and if the NBSC and HSD
have been unable to resolve the issue
to the satisfaction of the Claimant,
they may request the counter log from
Fujitsu.

28

POL-BSFF-0090111_0027

logs from a terminal through a manual
process which takes approximately two
hours.

There are other logs on the terminal,
such as a log which shows how much
memory is in use and logs which relate to
the windows operating system. However,
Post Office does not believe that these
are relevant.

APPENDIX E

Third Party Electronic Documents

POL00252048

POL00252048

A range of third parties provide support and services to Post Office and may hold documents which are relevant to this litigation. Whilst many of these
documents are not within Post Office's control and therefore do not fall to be disclosed by it, in the interests of assisting the Claimant and the Court, Post
Office sets out below a high level overview of these documents.

It should be noted that to assess whether documents held by third parties fall within Post Office's contro! will not be a straightforward task, It will require a
close reading of the relevant contractual documents between Post Office and the relevant Third Party and precise identification of the documents or
information in question. Post Office considers that this assessment is best done retrospectively, after a document or class of documents has been identified
as being needed for this litigation. It may also be the case that some third parties (eg. Fujitsu) would be willing to voluntarily disclose some documents.
regardless of whose control they are under. It is therefore most cost effective and constructive to deal with issues of control on an iterative basis.

Some of these products and services
have their own bespoke databases of
information within Post Office.

Furthermore, most of these products and
services are provided by third parties and
re-sold by Post Office. The third party
product / service suppliers (known as
"Clients" within Post Office) may hold
information about related customer
transactions in their own IT systems.

(eg. email, phone, etc,) and
file storage (eg. Sharepoint,
shared drives, etc.).

It may also include various
customised and proprietary
databases.

Third Party I Brief description of documents and I Nature of information held I Are these documents within the Proposals for provision of

and products and services to customers (eg. I all commonly used file types

Post Office therefore considers that
these documents are currently outside
the scope of disclosure.

If, as this litigation progresses, issues
are raised in relation to specific
products or services, a further EDQ
may be filed providing more detail on
these databases and the documents
held by relevant third parties.

IT Support
Partners

Post Office has had numerous IT support
partners between 1999 and present.
This includes = Accenture, ATOS
ComputaCenter and Fujitsu. Each may
hold information relating to Horizon and
other relevant IT systems.

Due to the central role of Horizon in this
litigation, more detailed information on
the documents held by Fujitsu is set out
below.

Various

Save for Fujitsu, no.

It is expected that the majority of the
information held by these support
partners will be mirrored inside Post
Office on emails held by Key
Custodians or in Post Office's
databases.

If, as this litigation progresses, issues
are raised in relation to specific areas
supported by a third party IT support
partner, a further EDQ may be filed
providing more detail on the
documents held by that third party.

In relation to documents held by
Fujitsu, disclosure of these documents
can be discussed following exchange
of EDQs.

POL-BSFF-0090111_0044
FUJITSU DOCUMENTS

Fujitsu provides a range of IT services to Post Office in relation to the Horizon system throughout the relevant period.

POL00252048

POL00252048

As a result, there are a significant

number of documents within Fujitsu's possession which may be relevant. Below is a high level overview of:

. the locations of documents held by Fujitsu that are potentially relevant to the Claim;
. the types of document held by Fujitsu that are potentially relevant to the Claim; and
. comments regarding the ease and proportionality of disclosure of the documents.

This information has been provided by Fujitsu to Post Office.

Known Error Log (KEL)

The KEL is a proprietary database with approximately
4,000 entries containing information which is used by
Fujitsu to explain how to deal with or work around minor
issues that can sometimes arise in Horizon and Horizon
Online for which (often because of their triviality) system-
wide fixes have not been developed and implemented.

The KEL only contains the current database entries and is
constantly updated and so the current version will not necessarily
reflect the version that was in place at the relevant time. The
previous entries / versions of the current entries are no longer
available.

The KEL cannot be easily downloaded as it is stored on a
database. Even then, unless one has the necessary database
software, reading the data in the KEL is difficult. The alternative is
to manually copy or print each entry, but this would produce poorly
formatted material and would take significant effort.

In light of this, the Claimant's IT expert has inspected the KEL at
Fujitsu's offices.

Dimensions

Dimensions is a configuration management system in
which Fujitsu keeps a library of the key technical
documents relating to Horizon and Horizon Online. The
documents range from high level designs to detailed
designs of the system and its code, along with
documents that describe hardware that is used in the
system. A full index of these documents has been
provided to the Claimant's solicitors.

The documents are formatted in various formats including Word,
PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio and in a zipped format. Most
documents can be extracted from Dimensions.

Asmall number of older (pre-2001) documents that are believed to
be non-Fujitsu documents were received in hardcopy and not
scanned in. It may be possible to locate the hardcopies in archives
or it may be that another party is better placed to provide these
documents if relevant.

POL00252048

Peak System

If Fujitsu identifies an issue in Horizon or Horizon Online
that requires a programmatic fix then it is logged in its
database, the Peak System, and labelled as a 'Peak'.

If Fujitsu identifies an issue in Horizon that requires a
programmatic fix then it is logged in its database, the Peak
System, and labelled as a ‘Peak’.

TFS and Powerhelp

Post Office and its agents have access to a help desk
called Horizon Service Desk (HSD) to manage technical
issues with Horizon — HSD was provided by Fujitsu prior to)
June 2014 (and has been provided by ATOS since that
date).

Between 2001 and September 2009, Fujitsu used
Powerhelp to log calls. From September 2009 onwards,
Fujitsu used Triole for Service (TFS), a proprietary
database, to log calls made to HSD.

TFS call logs date back to September 2009. These call logs could
be extracted from TFS into an Excel document. Powerhelp may
contain call logs for the period between 2001 and September 2009,
however, Fujitsu has advised that the Powerhelp servers are still
stored but they do not currently have the means to access them;
they would have to recreate a ring fenced network running WindowsI
2003 (the redundant software on which Powerhelp was run).

SharePoint and shared drives
Projectweb

SharePoint has been used by Fujitsu since c.2008 to store
and share documents it produces relating to Post Office .

Shared drives are also used for a similar purpose.

Prior to 2008, Fujitsu used a self-built system, Project
Web, for this purpose. This system is still available in a
read-only format, although access to the system is by
temporary arrangement because it is a legacy system.

As explained in relation to the extraction of documents from Post
Office's SharePoint, similar issues may be encountered when
extracting documents from Fujitsu's SharePoint.

Documents stored in SharePoint, shared drives and ProjectWeb areI
generally regarded as uncontrolled, working documentation that is
not held in a completely formalised structure, in contrast to the
Dimensions depository.

Emails

The vast majority of Fujitsu's internal communications take
place via email.

Fujitsu does not operate a formal email archiving policy or system.
Therefore, to the extent that any emails are not stored in other
accessible locations, availability will be limited to those held in
individual users' email accounts. As users have a storage limit on
their accounts, emails are routinely deleted from the user's own
email account but may be subsequently stored in locally held .pst
files.

On average, between 250 to 400 people at Fujitsu work on Post
Office's account at one time. Consequently, there have been
thousands of people at Fujitsu who have worked on Horizon over
the 17 years since the system was developed.

Local computers

It is possible that Fujitsu staff will have also stored relevant
documents locally on their individual Fujitsu PCs or local

storage devices. It is believed that most users will also

Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Action
Disclosure of Transaction and Event Data

We refer to paragraph 4(a)(iv) of the CMC Order which concerns the disclosure of the transaction and
event data (the Data). We write to provide Post Office's proposals on the format in which this data is
disclosed.

We have been informed by Fujitsu that there are a vast number of fields available in the database which
hosts the Data and that over time these fields have changed. When Fujitsu extract the Data it is usually
filtered so that it only includes those fields which relate to transactions and events which would affect a
branch's accounts. At Schedule 1 is an example of the Data and the fields which are extracted through
running this report, along with an explanation of the fields.

To disclose the unfiltered Data would require it to be extracted in a .txt format (rather than in .xIsx which
can be read by Excel) and converted into a readable format. Further, the unfiltered Data would be
between 10GB and 100GB of data per month depending on the size of the branch and the activity in that
branch during the month. This compares to the 1MB of data per month in the filtered format. The
hosting of 400 months of unfiltered Data by our third party e-discovery partner would cost between
£100,000 and £1million per a month. Post Office therefore proposes that it would be reasonable and
proportionate to only provide the Data in the filtered format as set out in Schedule 1. As you will see,
this filtered data is still extensive and will provide the information necessary for the purposes of this
litigation.

Further, the extraction of the Data is a time-consuming process and to ensure that the Data is extracted
and disclosed by 19 January 2018 it would be appreciated if when informing us of your Potential Lead
Claimants you could also confirm the months of Data which you would like disclosed.

If you have any queries on the filtering of the Data or would like to discuss this proposal please let us
know by 4pm on 25 November 2017.

Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Action
Proposals for the Exchange of Electronic Data

We write in advance of the disclosure under paragraphs 4 and 13 of the CMC Order to provide Post
Office's proposals on how documents should be exchanged. Our objective is to try to streamline the
practical steps involved in disclosing documents for the benefit of both parties. These proposals are not
intended to be exhaustive; there may be certain categories of documents that do not fit with the structure
we have proposed below.

We welcome your comments on these proposals.
1. Disclosure List
It is proposed that each party maintains a Disclosure List of the documents which they have disclosed in
an Excel spreadsheet. The Disclosure List would contain all of the documents which have been
disclosed and we suggest that they should be organised in the following manner:

cl The documents are sorted into chronological order, with any attachments listed directly

below their parent. The documents for each Claimant are grouped together and any
"generic" documents (disclosed by Post Office) should be grouped separately.

. The list should contain, unless impracticable, the fields set out below.

Disclosure Date Since disclosure will take place in a staged manner, DD/MM/YYYY
the list would include the date on which disclosure of
that document was provided.

Claimant No. Claimant's number as per the Claim Form. Where 19
Post Office discloses documents which relate to more
than one Claimant then we propose that these are
marked "Generic".

Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales under number 0C317661. VAT registration
number is GB123393627. Registered office: 4 More London Riverside, London, SE1 2AU, where a list of members’ names is open to inspection. We
use the term partner to refer to a member of the LLP, or an employee or consultant who is of equivalent standing. Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP
is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP is a member of Womble Bond Dickinson (International) Limited, which consists of independent and autonomous
law firms providing services in the US, the UK, and elsewhere around the world. Each Womble Bond Dickinson entity is a separate legal entity and is,
not responsible for the acts or omissions of, nor can bind or obligate, another Womble Bond Dickinson entity. Womble Bond Dickinson (International)
Limited does not practice law. Please see www.womblebonddickinson.comilegal notices for further details.

Disclosure ID See below for more details.
Disclosure This ensures that families of documents can be
Attached To identified. The Disclosure Attached To number for a
family document is inherited from the Disclosure
Number of the parent document.
Sort Date The sort date is used to ensure that families of DD/MM/YY HH:MM

documents are kept together on the list. For emails
with attachments, the date of the parent would be
pushed down to the attachment to ensure that these
remain together on the list.

For parent documents this is the primary date of the
document. For child documents, this the date of the
parent document.

Document Date

I

The primary date of a document is typically the best

I date that we are able to ascribe to the document when

it is processed. Typically, this would be the date on
which it was last modified and, in the case of an email,
this would simply be the date the email was sent or
received.

In circumstances where this meta data is not available
(either due to the extraction process or being a
scanned hardcopy document) then it should be brought
to the other parties attention that this is an estimated
date.

DD/MM/YY HH:MM

Document This information is intended to contain the meta data
Subject / Title value extracted from the document subject or title.
File Name This information is intended to contain the meta date

value extracted from the file name.

Document Type This field should be based on the file signature. Microsoft Word
Document
Author The name of the person who sent or created the
document.
Recipient/s The name of the person(s) who received the
document.
cc The name of the person(s) who were copied in on the
document.
MD5 Hash Value I The 32 digit hash value generated for the purpose of
de-duplication.
Redacted Confirmation of whether a document has been Yes / No

redacted.

2. Document Reference Numbers

21 Post Office proposes that every document is assigned a unique Disclosure ID. This should be a
sequential number prefixed by the disclosing party's ID. For example, we intend to use POL-
00000001

2.2 For the Claimants’ disclosure, it is important that the exact disclosing Claimant is known. It would
not be workable for the Claimants’ disclosure to be collated together and given on behalf of the
group. Each Claimant should give their own disclosure, even if this means disclosing duplicate
copies of documents across multiple Claimants. This is important because:

2.2.1 Our client will need to use the documents in cross-examination and can only do so
effectively if it knows which documents relate to or were sourced from which
Claimants.

2.2.2 Our client has alleged that a number of the Claimants have acted dishonestly and
documents in their possession (or the absence of documents in their possession) may
be probative on this question.

2.2.3 Our client may wish to draw inferences where a particular Claimant has not preserved
relevant documents.

23 We therefore suggest that the Claimants use the following convention: C-001-0000001. "C" for
Claimant. The second number is a particular Claimant's claim number on a claim form. The final
long number is a sequential unique identification number.

3. Format of Exchange

3.4 Electronic documents

It is proposed that these documents be exchanged in their native format, with the exception of
those which have been redacted, along with the metadata set out above.

3.2 Hard copy documents
It is proposed that hard copy documents be scanned as a PDF image and be scanned as black
and white, or if colour is required to understand the documents (plans / graphs / photos) then
should be scanned in colour. Further, OCR should be used to make the PDFs text searchable
and they should be manually coded with the information set out above.

3.3 Redacted documents

It is proposed that redactions are marked with a black box and documents which have been
redacted will be exchanged in PDF format.

4. Method of exchange
Post Office proposes that the data should be exchanged by way of a Data Exchange File in a .dat
file format. The documents should be provided to the other party for inspection on an appropriate
disk of medium which is encrypted.

We would welcome your thoughts on the above proposals. If it would be convenient to arrange a call to

discuss these proposals please could you confirm a convenient time. Moreover, if you have already

engaged an e-disclosure support partner, it may be worth them talking directly to Advanced Discovery,
our e-disclosure support partner.
