BRIEFING FOR KELLY TOLHURST MP
POSTMASTER LITIGATION
CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE

Detailed briefings have been provided to UKGI under a protocol which is designed to protect
Post Office’s privileged legal advice.

¢ Litigation follows a number of years during which Post Office sought to understand the
concerns of postmasters and address their issues. While many of the claims alleged faults
with the Horizon computer system, to date no evidence of systemic problems have
emerged, rather there is a pattern of operational errors in branch, as well as, in specific
cases, where Post Office could have done more to support postmasters.

e Litigation was commenced in early 2017 and involves claims by 561 postmasters. The
specific details of their claims have not been provided, and we do not have any details as to
the possible quantum of damages that they may seek.

e Litigation is being managed by the Court in phases:

© Common Issues trial (4 weeks in November 2018) - to determine the proper
construction of the contract between Post Office and agents, and whether
approximately 21 further terms should be implied into that contract

© Horizon trial (4 weeks in March 2019) to determine the Horizon issues — the
questions to be posed are still being agreed between the respective experts

©. Thereafter, and to be scheduled, one or more trials to determine whether in specific
cases Post Office was in breach of contractual and other duties to postmasters, as a
result of which postmasters suffered ‘damage’ and / or loss for which they should be
compensated by way of a financial award of damages.

@ The key risks in the litigation are that:

othe Court’s decision on one or more of the ‘Common Issues’ has a material adverse
impact on Post Office’s operations, and/or these operational issues create cash flow
concerns

othe Court determines that there are systemic issues with the Horizon system, such
that transactions between postmasters and Post Office are not seen to be reliable

© Public opinion goes against Post Office as a result of the decision such that we lose
both the trust of the public and of our key (government and commercial)
stakeholders.

e Weare developing contingency plans to address these risks and will discuss these in more
detail at the meeting on 17 October.
