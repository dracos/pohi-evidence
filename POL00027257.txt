2.2. The CEO:

(a) noted the strong retail trading performance over Christmas, which would be
covered in more detail in the report from the CE, Retail later in the meeting.

(b) provided an update on Peregrine discussions following the conversations with
the new Bol CEO., as a result of which negotiations have been more positive.

Board Meeting

Terms by the end of February. The scope of discussions includes FRES
however they have flagged that they do not want to change the ‘contract
construct’ which we interpreted that they wish the contract to remain
evergreen.

(c) reported that the payroll module of Success Factors (“SF”) had gone live on
8th January with only a minor issues, and congratulated Martin Kirke and his
team for their work delivering to that timetable. Overall feedback has been
positive.

(d) advised that she had met Stephen Jones, CEO UK Finance in December in
relation to the Banking Framework. A further update would be brought to DS/M
the Board in May on the further development of the Banking K
Framework.

(e) noted that RMG have signed a deal with the CWU although details of this deal
still to be announced. Post Office was in discussions with CWU through ACAS
to seek to resolve the dispute about the move from weekly to monthly pay.
There are a number of other discussions ongoing with CWU in relation to
operational developments such as telemetry etc.

(f) noted that the L300 event was taking place the next day with three main areas
of discussion around IT Strategy, wider digitisation and people change, with a
focus on strategy and key priorities.

(g) informed the Board that due to Prime Minister's reshuffle, there is a new Postal
Minister - Andrew Griffith MP. This is still to be confirmed officially and PV is
still to meet him.

(h) reported that Martin Kirke, Group HR Director has announced his intention to
retire later in the year and a search for his replacement has started. Debbie
Smith joined as Chief Executive, Retail on 8th January.

The Chairman questioned whether Post Office would seek compensation from
Gemalto in relation to the disruption to our AEI services in December. PV responded
that contractual compensation had been discussed and that this had been reported
at the ARC earlier in the day.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPORT
The CFOO presented the P9 financial performance report covering December 2017.
The Board NOTED the financial performance report and in discussion the CFOO made

the following points:

(a) There had been strong Christmas trading however he noted that this only
added an extra £600k to EBITDAS reinforcing that mails are a low margin
business.

(b) EBITDAS for P9 was £6.8m, giving us a £1.7m upside against forecast, but
£1.5m adverse to budget, driven by strong mails trading, interest rate rises
supporting POCA performance and accelerated IT costs savings, offset by
additional agents pay.

(c) Balance sheet headroom in P9 was £127m which was £129m worse than P8&
due to Christmas trading, but £36m better than forecast.

(d) POMS trading performance was behind by £(0.5)m predominately due to profit
share not being met.

(e) ATM performance is being watched as availability has fallen: 420 ATMs have
been experiencing issues resulting in 65% availability. This is partly due to the
introduction of new £10 notes. Both Bol and Post Office are reviewing
performance and seeking to understand the impact of the new interchange fee
structures. AC noted that ATMs would be part of the cash strategy
which would be coming to back to the Board in May. The Board
requested that this review also consider whether there was value in
talking to manufacturers, and review the location strategy.

Ds/
MK

The CFOO noted that the Scorecard was showing positive outcomes (slide 3 in the
Performance paper), and the following were discussed:

(a) Number of branches and ‘trapped Postmasters’ and PV responded that this, Ds
together with the ‘white space’ strategy would be coming back to
Board as part of the review of the retail strategy.

(b) Branch technology conversions are progressing however there is a need to exit
from BT and onto Verizon and this is affecting the shape of the delivery.

(c) Health & safety performance in Supply Chain was starting to cause concern.
There are no significant trends or particular issues requiring specific
intervention but rather a higher incidence of not taking care, especially on our
premises. This will be addressed through activities seeking to engage peoples’
hearts as well as their minds.

Other matters flagged by the P9 report included:

(a) Forecast EBITDAS for the year was still expected to be c£33 million, however
there were a number of issues that would need to be managed to achieve this
outcome.

(b) Project costs were much closer to forecast than they had been, apart from
changes in the timing of DMB announcements.

(c) There is still ongoing work to reduce network cash levels back to the pre-
Christmas levels, and branch cash are being managed more proactively.

KM queried the relationship between reductions in staff costs as franchising was
rolled out, and increases in agents pay, and queried whether costs were reducing at
the expected level? The CFOO noted that there were a number of factors affecting
agents’ pay including simplification and product mix. On staff and non staff costs,
the next step change required the deployment of new technology and this could not
be introduced scalably until the underlying systems programmes such as Back office
Transformation are complete. He expected costs to be broadly flat in 2018/19, falling
in 2019/20 and achieving more significant savings in 2020/21.

ANNUAL BUDGET 2018/19

The CFOO presented the Annual Budget for 2018/19 as set out in the paper which
was NOTED by the Board. The CFOO highlighted the following:

POL00027257
POL00027257

Post Office Limited
Board Meeting

(a) The focus of the paper was on EBITDAS. The GE had reviewed progress
during December and January and detailed budget reviews would start the
following week.

(b) IThe CFOO noted that in October, the Board had approved an EBITDAS target
of £40m for 2018/19. The impact of accounting changes including the
exclusion of the costs of the Group Litigation meant that £47m would be
consistent with the 3 year plan and was recommended. This represented
significant growth given that there was no profit share from the Bank of
Ireland (c£11 million), a significant Ofcom pricing challenge (c.£15 million
gross impact) and growth in marketing of c. £15m. The CFOO noted that the
gap still to close against the 2018/19 target was £12 million.

(c) IThe Board discussed the EBITDAS target and indicated that £47m now felt
conservative and the target should be at least £50m. It was noted that the
FS&T revenue lines were disappointing. The CFOO noted that savings
products were still being impacted by low interest rates, and POMS had been
struggling due to changes within Post Office relating to the withdrawal of
mortgage and financial specialists, and the delay in roll out of marketing
plans, as a result of which the ‘hockey stick’ uptick had been delayed. The
CEO noted that a new marketing director has been appointed for POMS which
should start to see a difference and she noted the new advertising campaign
which had just been launched.

(d) IThe Board commented that the portfolio should be reviewed to ensure that
Post Office could compete effectively in the financial services market, and
consideration should be given to focussing efforts in those areas where the
Post Office brand would allow us to compete most effectively. The Board
challenged whether the balance was right between short and longer term
objectives, and whether management were sufficiently ambitious for the
POMS business. The CEO undertook to come back to the Board to
update on the POMS acquisition strategy, and the Chairman noted it
would be helpful to get some wider background briefings from py
insurance experts.

(e) TP noted that he would like a target figure of at least £50 million for 2018/19,
that the Board needed to understand how the growth fund would contribute
to this, and there should be some contingency in the plans. He noted that he
was encouraged by initiatives however those projects that underpin the plan
- and deliver longer term benefits, will be key.

(f) The Board then discussed how other initiatives such as Panther, New Call
acquisition and Identity would contribute to the overall strategy. The CEO
noted that the strategy for the retail business was being reviewed by
the new Chief Executive, Retail who had only recently joined and pg
would be covered at the Board away day in June, however an update
would be provided at the March board.

The CFOO noted that proposals would be brought to the Remco at its meeting the
following week, for the STIP and LTIP measures. He noted that management's view
was that the measures for the two incentive schemes should be different, and that
following discussion at Remco, the recommended measures would be brought back
to the Board in March. He noted that the GE had debated supplementing a retained
EBITDAS with two critical pieces of delivery: (i) the replacement of legacy and

outdated infrastructure including POLSAP, HRSAP and HNGX; and (ii) the delivery of
customer hub functionality with products available for customers in Travel and
Identity.

CE PERFORMANCE REPORT - RETAIL SBU

The Chairman welcomed Debbie Smith, the new Chief Executive, Retail and Cathy
Mayor and the Board NOTED the paper.

DS noted that she had attended the recent opening of the first 24 hour branch in
New Oxford Street.

CM reported on the following:

a) Christmas trading had been strong with increased customer sessions and trading
as compared with the previous year, although these had come through later in
the trading period, and reflected structural changes in the market.

b) Customer services levels had improved year on year, including customer effort
scores and wait time acceptability. The no queues at Christmas initiative had
brought wait times down by an average of 2 minutes, an improvement by 4%.

c) Mails performance was underpinned by continued growth in home shopping
returns and local collect which help offset ongoing decline in stamps.

d) Overall, the trading trends are positive and the current forecast is that Retail will
end the year £7m ahead of EBITDAS budget.

e) The Board brought up the discussion of Agents pay and it was agreed DS would
be looking into this and come back to the Board in June with a strategy.

The Board NOTED that transaction simplification was a key enabler for much of the
network and was materially important to the larger multiples. DS commented that
being able to convince retailers of the footfall benefits that Post Office could deliver
through the Banking Services Framework, click and collect, etc, was key to
leveraging the Post Office brand. Further work remained to be done on quantifying
the DPC of the various products - presently many of the central costs are not well
understood and therefore are not taken into account which may mean that products
look more profitable than they actually are.

DMB STRATEGY

The Chairman welcomed Julie Thomas and Martin Kirke to the meeting.

The following points were highlighted to the Board:

a) DS introduced the paper and noted that it was clear that DMB’s are not meeting
customers’ needs due to the restrictions on opening hours, and are not profitable
due in part to the significant central costs required to support them. Work is
ongoing to consider options to reduce costs including property options, reviewing
employment terms. franchising options etc; nevertheless exiting DMBs becomes
progressively more expensive due to the related central costs.

b) JT reported that the proposed revised franchising programme has been designed
to enable the franchise of all 227 DMB’s and staff over a three year period,
however at this point approval was only being sought for the first phase of the

DS

roll out. JT explained the model worked in two stages: (i) temporary operators
would be approached to operate a franchised DMB in the same premises, with
flexible lease terms. This should enable immediate staff cost savings while the
recruitment of the long-term operator and branch location is progressed in
parallel.

c) While there are currently 3 well established organisations who each can manage
approximately 30 branches on a temporary basis at any time, it is proposed that
a compliant procurement process should be undertaken for operators of
temporary branches across the network. The proposition should be attractive for
temporary operators as it is low risk and involves minimal investment.

d) The Chairman queried the impact on employees and whether union consultation
would be required? JT noted that under the current structures, it can take up
to six months to complete a franchise and that employees are often keen to
leave but are prevented from doing so because of the local consultation
processes. She advised that the plan was to start the staff consultation process
by telling staff about new Branches being advertised in the area and the strategy
of replacement of DMB’s over the next three years.

e) The Board queried the impact of the proposal on the underlying costs of the
business and JT replied that the benefits step down over time as set out in the
table on page 5 of the paper.

The Board was supportive in principal of the revised strategy however approval
was only sought for a one year roll out following which the strategy would be re-
assessed. APPROVAL was given on this basis including drawdown of the first
year of funding of £23.1m for 2018/19 which would allow the roll out of the
Franchise Programme to 56 branches.

EUM

The Chairman welcomed Julie Thomas back to the meeting to present the business
case for EUM paper.

Debbie Smith introduced the paper which was noted by the Board.

a) JT explained that since the Board approved the initial EUM business case of
£7.8m in January 2017, it had become clear that a key design assumption that
all training could be delivered through Success Factors could not be delivered
and the current Horizon system does not support web-enabled training.

b) This updated Business Case requests £2.53m of additional funding to deliver:
new IT developments needed to ensure EUM will work for agents using the
current Horizon system.

c) Approval of funding will allow the programme to rollout to the entire network of
c11,600 branches by November 2018 with a workable design, allowing us to be
fully compliant with all relevant sales-related regulation and contractual
requirements.

d) To the extent possible, EUM had been designed to ensure compatibility with
HNGT.

e) Data collection regarding postmasters and their assistants was taking longer
than expected, however those branches which were critical for POMS sales were
being prioritised and it was still expected that the target of July 2018 which
POMS were relying on, would be achieved.

The Board noted their concerns over the delay in the roll out of this programme, and
queried what could be done to accelerate delivery to ensure delivery for POMS by
the July target date? The Board also commented that management needed to review
the project and understand what could have been done differently.

It was RESOLVED to approve the revised scope and business case including the
further funding of £2.53m, including an immediate draw down of £1.3m. The
Drawdown of the balance £1.23m in due course should be brought to the Investment
Committee.

BACK OFFICE TRANSFORMATION

The Chairman welcomed Rob Houghton to the meeting and the CFOO presented the
replacement Back Office Transformation business case.

a) The CFOO gave an update on the progress of Back Office Transformation since
the last update in September and explained the proposed changes to the
Business Case with a request for a further drawdown of funds that will allow the
programme to complete Phase 1.

b) Phase 1 remains focused on ensuring we exit from POLSAP by June 2018,
delivering as much transformation as possible. In the next 2 months deliveries
include: Agent Remuneration process transformation & data migration from
HRSAP to CFS, and Cash Processing functionality migrated from POLSAP to
Transtrack for Belfast cash centre (soft launch).

c) It was noted that while costs have increased slightly by £0.3m to an expected
total of £21.2 million, the annualised IT benefits have reduced by £0.8m to
£3.1m as set out in the Board paper

d) RH noted that Credence had now transitioned and that this creates further
capacity in the Fujitsu environment, which of itself, decreases the risk.

The Board queried whether the CIO had now addressed the resourcing challenges in
his team, and whether he was confident in the capability and capacity of that team
to deliver the necessary changes required? RH advised that the Chief technology
Officer had been the last key role to fill however there now remained a challenge to
recruit the necessary IT architecture skills, although this was underway, with a much
better operational team in house now in place.

It was RESOLVED that the Board approve the revised business case and additional
£5m drawdown of budgeted spend to enable the completion of Phase 1, noting the
reduction in IT cost benefits.

11.2 Health & Safety
The Board NOTED the report.

a) The CFOO noted that ‘across the pavement’ attacks were the greatest current
area of concern in Supply Chain. Supply Chain is trialling body cameras to test
usability: attacks are rare and they cannot be tested for impact. It is likely that
if workable the cameras would be rolled out across high risk areas.

b) The Board noted that the expansion of the Banking Services Framework would
result in increased cash in branches and that management would need to review
whether MI and technology were adequate to cope with increased risks and
demands.

Cc) The CFOO noted that work was underway to assess the impact of the expansion
of the banking Services Framework, and further that an external audit of the
Health and Safety framework had been commissioned, the results of which would
be shared with the Board once available.

d) The Chairman noted that it would be helpful if the reporting could separate
robberies and criminal activity from the more traditional health and AC/
safety measures, so as to enable management and the Board to prioritise MH
what needs to be done to reduce violence to employees.

11.3. Conflicts of Interest

The Board NOTED that the Company secretary would circulate details currently
held about other directorships and conflicts and that these would be updated and
presented to the March board.

Meeting Dates and Forwards Agenda

The Board NOTED the future meeting dates and January’s agenda.

12.1 Bank Ring-Fencing Changes

The Company Secretary advised that the Board previously approved Post Office
entering into a Facilities Agreement dated 26 November 2015 with the Royal Bank
of Scotland plc (RBS) under which RBS makes available: a £400m intra-day facility;
a £350m overnight NRF facility (for the purpose of providing overnight collateral to
the Bank of England); and a £1m collateral facility used in connection with our crime
insurance (Facilities Arrangement).

As a result of the UK government's ring-fencing requirements which come into force
on 1 January 2019, RBS has to restructure their activities and legal entities (which
includes the National Westminster Bank plc (Nat West). Nat West will sit within the
ring-fence of retail & business banking within the RBS Group.

Consequently, POL needs to enter into an Amended and Restated Facilities
Agreement with RBS and Nat West to allow Nat West to provide the Facilities
Arrangement going forward.

12.2 IT WAS RESOLVED THAT:

CEO’s Report

Author: Paula Vennells Meeting date: 27" March

Executive Summary

Context

Our target for 2017/18 is to achieve EBITDAS of £30m. Our 3 year goals are to:

~ Accelerate the transformation of the Post Office.

+ Secure commercial sustainability for the long term.

+ Establish a business that can ultimately fund investments and the social
purpose from profits rather than subsidy.

In summary, our strategy is to secure our position as the UK’s number one
parcels and letters retailer, grow in financial services and protect our network
and social purpose - all supported by a much leaner central organisation.

Input Sought

The Board is invited to note the report and highlight any issues where a future
discussion would be welcome.

The Report

Looking Back
WHAT HAS GONE WELL?

¢ Financial Performance

— P11 benefitted from continuing strong trading and delays in programme spend
versus forecast expectations. EBITDAS (excl. GLC) was £0.2m, £1.4m
favourable to forecast and in line with budget. YTD EBITDAS (excl. GLC) is
£20.1m, £4.4m favourable to forecast and £4.0m favourable to budget.

— Balance sheet headroom in P11 was £299m. This was £10m lower than prior
month as increases in cash holdings £66m and investment spend £22m were
funded through an increase in the bond facility. Cash holdings increased by
c.£40m due to the temporary impact of introducing high speed note counters in
cash centres. Headroom will tighten again as we approach Easter and move
more cash into the network.

— Retail P11 performance is strong and YTD on track. FS P11 performance
EBITDAS is £(1.3)m adverse to forecast. Revenue overperformance offset by
additional costs and different revenue mix in agents pay, annual mortgage
check fees and a reconciliation of full year performance on FRES.

¢ Financial Services

— The Savings book will end the year strongly at £14bn (vs expectation of
£12bn) following the base rate change in November and lower than expected
attrition on the back book. The new mortgage lead generation and
qualification model through the Chesterfield contact centre went live on 12th
March and our new mortgage proposition launches next month.

— Peregrine negotiations continue in depth following the arrival of the new BOI
Group Chief Executive in November. We are likely to be offered an enhanced
package across both the core products and FRES and expect to make a
recommendation to Board, with some independent advisor analysis, in May.

— Moneygram - work continues to improve our commercial terms and we have a
proposal which will be discussed later in this Board.

— The Q4 insurance campaign continues to perform in line with plans and is
showing a 300% increase in protection sales versus P11 16/17. Weare
building our new home insurance model and have released an invitation to
tender to underwriting companies to work with us on design and the customer
solution. We aim to have this in place by June and will then move to the
design phase.

— Telecoms - Project Galaxy [voluntary pricing agreement between BT and
Ofcom in the HomePhone only market; POL has 10% market share] has now
moved into implementation with around 100,000 customers already contacted

Strictly Confidential

POL-0023898
POL00027257
POL00027257

POST OFFICE PAGE 3 OF 7

and response levels under 10% and lower than expected, which is
encouraging. The agreement between BT and Ofcom is to reduce monthly
customer pricing by £7 per month (£18.99 to £11.99), Post Office have
agreed to offer eligible customers HomePhone customers, free Broadband or
the option of HomePhone only at £11.50pm to maintain price competition
with BT.

-—» Customer Hub: The first launch is targeted for May 2018. The initial
proposition is focused on the Travel Monday Card and Travel Insurance
products which will be served through a new Post Office Travel App. The
project is in development with both FRES and BOI. Following the launch, all
new TMC customers will be directed to the Customer Hub where we will also
be able to offer them travel and gadget insurance add-ons; this will be
introduced as part of our summer campaign.

¢ Retail

— Work continues on the Future of Cash business case to be presented at the
May Board. Following the recent reorganisations, both ATM and POCA
strategies will be included.

— Banking Framework continues to over perform with increased Business
Banking supporting performance above budget and forecast. Increased
engagement from banks as well as new engagement with Credit Unions helps
support our Financial Inclusion agenda. We continue to work closely with UK
Finance on a joint proposal to send to John Glen MP, Economic Secretary of
the Treasury, regarding the future plans for the framework.

— The VOC results remain very strong with YTD Waiting Time Acceptability
maintaining the all-time high of 94.2% against a target of 95% and Effort at an
equally impressive 80.6% against a target of 76%.

Mails

— Royal Mail re-entered the FTSE 100 on 19* March with shares closing at 564p
on the FTSE cut-off date; up more than 50% from a closing low of 370p in
November. The market has responded positively as the risk of industrial action
faded and the terms of the principle agreement with CWU became clear. The
deal was unanimously agreed by the CWU’s Postal Executive and will be
recommended to the union’s 110,000 postal members in a forthcoming national
ballot.

~ Discussions regarding the prospect of extending the current MDA have begun

and the Mails team will provide an update on progress at the May Board.

. IT
— Everest (Fujitsu negotiation) continue and there is good progress on application
maintenance, cloud migration and commercial contracts. The contract note on

POST OFFICE PAGE 4 OF 7

the principle of switching revenue from operational expenditure to capital
expenditure has been signed. FJ demonstrated good innovation and customer
journey ideas to the Group Executive at our recent GE meeting.

— The network and branch technology rollout continues and is going well. We
have passed the 10,000 branch level on network and hope to be virtually
complete and transitioned to Verizon by end of March. Branch rollout is around
7,000 counters and the Admin network is almost complete with a complex set
of issues overcome. There will be a high level of change taking place in the last
two weeks of March to complete these plans.

e¢ Our 101 digital innovation centre is fully active; we have employed our first
software engineers and developments in customer hub, agent portal and the
next generation Horizon (HNGT) are ongoing.

WHAT HAS NOT GONE WELL?

e Severe weather and impact on the Network

— Due to the recent snow and bad weather all branches were affected across the
network, but with minimal impact. 400 branches needed to close at some point
due to severe conditions, however a maximum 210 branches were closed at
anytime, which means at all time Post Office maintained around 98% of
branches open to the public. Supply chain was affected minimally. During this
time branch transactions were down as people chose not to travel.

— Royal Mail and ParcelForce were unable to collect and deliver in some areas and
special delivery guarantees were cancelled during this time. Our POMS call
centre in Scotland closed for two days and the NSBC closed early on two days;
no branches reported any issues with this. Our IT equipment continued to
operate as normal.

— Overall Post Office continued to operate as near normal throughout resulting in
little impact and no customer complaints. We estimate £200k in lost revenue.

¢ IT Transformation

— The full year target has slipped as a number of controls are currently actioned
to be delivered in June/July, these controls are reliant on the implementation of
the Security Operations Centre which will be fully commissioned in July. A
review of the TrAction Controls Management tool tool is currently underway to
ensure that control issues are being reported consistently.

e Branch safety

— There were two incidents in branches recently due to branch colleague
negligence with electrical appliances. An explosion in our DMB in Romford and
a fire in the Hounsditch branch; thankfully both branches were closed and no
one was hurt. Both issues were dealt with quickly and both reopened quickly.
We have issued new communications to all colleagues highlighting the

Strictly Confidential

POL-0023898
POL00027257
POL00027257

POST OFFICE PAGE 5 OF 7

importance of turning off equipment when the branch is closed as well as
reviewing and reissuing our white goods security policies.

Looking Ahead
FUTURE FOCUS

¢ Simplification

— Having assessed our change portfolio and the current strength of our
proposition with agents, we have changed our plans on Simplification. Phase
1 of Mails simplification is fully implemented and will deliver £4.6m of
recurring EBITDAS benefit through reduced remuneration. We have reviewed
Phase 2 (which would deliver further efficiencies and £6.5m recurring benefit)
and decided not to continue for three main reasons:

— 1- the agent reaction to this particular Simplification approach has been
as expected negative and we believe that implementing could put future
numbers at risk;

— 2- implementing Phase 2 would require a further £8.0m, (and the time of key
subject matter experts), which we can re-allocate to other change initiatives;

— 3- we need to minimise any further investment in our current codebase
‘HNGA’ given we are developing ‘HNGT’, which will radically simplify our
customer and user experience. Our message to agents will be that
simplification remains critical to our success and we are deferring, rather than
stopping, plans to reduce remuneration where we can create genuine savings
for agents.

« Back office Transformation

— The first phase of Back Office Transformation is live with agents now being
paid through the new systems. This was on time and on budget. However, the
remaining phases are signalling delay and our expectation is that the
programme will be re-planned to complete end September rather than end
June to avoid compromising testing, controls or management information.
The CIO's view is that the infrastructure can sustain this delay. However,
further delays would not be acceptable. The cash module has been more
complicated than anticipated and the Belfast pilot has successfully gone live,
2 months behind plan. We are also behind on design and testing of the sales
and finance workstream. A full re-plan is close to completion and will be
subject to independent challenge.

¢ Government Affairs

— Iam meeting with the new Minister for Postal Services, Andrew Griffiths MP
on 19* March. Andrew was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
at the Department for Business in the January 2018 reshuffle. This is the first

Strictly Confidential

POL-0023898
POL00027257
POL00027257

POST OFFICE PAGE 6 OF 7

meeting we have had and will provide an opportunity to update the Minister
on our strategy and our key priorities.

— Iwill also be attending the first meeting of the Financial Inclusion Policy
Forum, jointly chaired by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (John Glen
MP) and the Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion at the Department
for Work and Pensions (Guy Opperman MP). The purpose of the forum is to
ensure that individuals, regardless of their background or income, have
access to useful and affordable financial products and services.

— Debbie Smith will be attending the Future of the High Streets Forum, hosted
by Jake Berry MP the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local
Government.

— The first phase of a brand activation campaign called #Commonunity -
celebrating communities and local activities, has been launched. The
campaign explores the changing nature of community in the UK, with the Post
Office telling the story in the context of modern Britain. We are giving Post
Offices the chance to win upto £1,000 bursary by nominating and highlighting
how community matters to them. Prize funds can be used for anything that
supports the community.

¢ Building an inclusive culture
— Ihave implemented a campaign internally which stresses the importance of
speaking out against bullying and harassment. On the back of this we have
received an increase in people coming forward to speak out, which is both
encouraging and worrying. I am committed to ensuring we provide a safe
and transparent workplace for our colleagues and that we remember and live
by our PO values: Care, Challenge and Commit.

e Personnel & Business unit changes

— Martin Edwards has formally moved into his role as Managing Director of the
newly created Identity Services business unit.

— Ihave created a new Strategy Group working to agile principles which will be
led by Tom Moran, who also retains his role as Network Development
Director. Tom will have a small central team reporting into him and they will
be responsible for the broader business strategy, as well as leading on
strategy for Retail and the preparations for the Board Away Day. There are
three key topics for that agenda: Retail, IT and Post Office Insurance.

— Nick Kennett left the business last month and I have made two changes to
the Retail and FS business units; Banking has moved into the Retail business
and I have promoted Owen Woodley to Chief Executive of Financial Services &
Telecoms (FS&T).

BOARD DISCUSSION PAPER
February 2018 (P11) - Performance
Author: Micheal Passmore Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron Meeting date: 27 March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

YTD P10 EBITDAS, excluding Group Litigation Costs (GLC) £19.8m. £3.0m favourable
to forecast and £4.1m favourable to budget.

At end of FY 16/17, cash in Network was £666m and balance sheet headroom was
£189m.

P11 forecast EBITDAS (excl. GLC) £(1.2)m, budget £0.3m. Balance Sheet headroom
forecast was £286m from the facility limit, £86m from the Board limit.

Questions this paper addresses

1. What is the financial and scorecard performance in P11?

2. Does the performance highlight concerns over future delivery?
3. What are we anticipating for the full year outturn?

Conclusions

P11 benefitted from continuing strong trading and delays in BAU programme spend
versus forecast expectations. EBITDAS (excl. GLC) was £0.2m, £1.4m favourable to
forecast and in line with budget. YTD EBITDAS (excl. GLC) is £20.1m, £4.4m favourable
to forecast and £4.0m favourable to budget.

Balance sheet headroom in P11 was £299m. This was £10m lower than prior month as
increases in cash holdings £66m and investment spend £22m were funded through an
increase in the bond facility. Cash holdings increased by c.£40m due to the temporary
impact of introducing high speed note counters in cash centres. Headroom will tighten
again as we approach Easter and move more cash into the network.

Network numbers are 11,510 which is very close to the contractual minimum of 11,500
branches. A number of new openings are planned and we anticipate the year end
number will be closer to 11,600.

Change and capital spend of £28.6m, £3.0m more than 5+7 forecast suggesting
continuing improvements over control and delivery.

The full year outturn is now anticipated to be c£36m, £6m above forecast due to higher
Bank of Ireland Profit Share and release of Growth Fund.

The Board is asked to note the financial performance.

1. Headroom at P11 was £499m (£299m above the £200m board limit) and security
headroom was £223m. Ensuring facility headroom was higher than security
headroom was a key target of the cash work as set out in the summer.

2. Net profit YTD is £11.0m favourable to budget; EBITDAS (incl. GLC) up £2.3m.
Underspend on change charged to the profit and loss account is £3.9m and
unbudgeted profit on disposal of property of £4.6m drive the remainder of the
variance.

3. Acceptable Wait Time scores remain at 96% and continue to track above targets for
DMB, agency branches and W.H. Smith. Acceptable Wait Time is 1% below target
ytd.

4, P11 Branch compliance was rated Amber following 3 months of red ratings, YTD the
rating remains Amber. Improvement was due to Bol reviews of FS promotional
material held in branch that are no longer rated Red. Whilst this is encouraging we
need to maintain our focus to ensure these improvements have been embedded.

5. The overall rating is Amber due to Counter Mystery Shopping continue to produce
challenging results. The key reason for non-compliance was the failure to provide a
Savings Summary Box leaflet with the application pack as well as BolI’s assessment
of other compliance requirements. To address this we have published a Branch

6. Attendance Reporting: Still not available following the implementation of Success
Factors in P9. Absence and hours reports for P10 and P11 are being worked on but
a number of anomalies have been identified with the data. A fix has been identified
but has not been implemented.

7. Safety LTIFR: There were 7 employee accidents during P11 and 104 YTD v 112 for
the equivalent period last year. However, LTIFR which measures the severity of the
impact of accidents as a proportion of hours worked remains above budget.

Modernisation

8. Network: Network numbers are 11,510 which is very close to the contractual
minimum of 11,500 branches. A number of new openings are and we anticipate the
year end number will be closer to 11,600. YTD there have been 201 unplanned
closures with 104 branches remaining closed following postmaster suspension.

9. NT and ND Transformation: 466 branches have now been transformed in the
year exceeding the full year target of 400.

10. Branch Counter and Network Rollouts: Snow delays in the week commencing
26th February resulted in a 30% reduction to the weekly deployment. This will be
addressed in week commencing 19th March schedule where 83 branches will be
rescheduled. Project currently tracking green.

11. IT Transformation (% of IT controls implemented): The full year target is now
unlikely to be achieved as a number of controls will be implemented when the
Security Operations Centre is delivered in July.

performance dropping through to the bottom line. Costs delays from programme
spend were offset by incremental costs in the month. The full year outturn is now
anticipated to be c.£36m, £6m above forecast due to higher Bank of Ireland Profit
Share and release of Growth Fund.

13. Retail performance driven by Government Services revenue overperformance
+£1.9m (POCA +£0.9m and Verify +£0.6m) and delays in programme spend
£1.1m until 2018/19.

14. FS&T shortfall due to true-up in FRES position £(0.4)m for full year given volume
shortfalls and annual mortgage check fees £(0.3)m not forecast.

15. POMS +£0.2m with strong response from the Q4 campaign (including DRTV)
driving incremental Protections revenues. Still anticipating to achieve full year
forecast position (less impact of Russet).

16. Other costs include the annual audit fee £0.4m (timing) a provision for losses
£0.5m and a £0.3m fine for non-compliance with AML regulations. Change spend
expenditure is £6.6m above forecast but this was shifted from capital spend in the
period.

months.

in P12 and it is currently anticipated that up to £35m of costs in the P5 reforecast

could fall into 2018/19.

19. Our net funding
position increased by
£90m to £721m in
P11 as cash in the
network increased by
£66m and £22m of
capital and
investment spend in
the month.

Cash in the network
increased primarily due
to an increase in Cash
Centres balances of
£39m. This is a
temporary increase as
the new note counting
machines were rolled
out.

21. The loan balance
with BEIS increased
by £10m but

maintained against

anticipated to reduce
as we approach

P11 EBITDAS £3.8m favourable to forecast driven by strong revenue performance and
delays in programmes spend until 2018/19 as identified as part of the P9 risks and
opportunities update.

Gross Income beat forecast by £1.7m:

Government Services +£1.9m with POCA +£0.9m (£0.5m Interest Rate, £0.3m closed
accounts, £0.1m volumes) and Verify +£0.6m due to strong trading performance with
volumes doubling to c.11,000 per month. Small volume gains in Passports & DVLA also.

Mails +£0.4m with continuation of recent trends.

Retail and Lottery £(0.6)m, being £(0.3)m shortfall for trading (timing with no impact
on full year) and £(0.3)m accounting impact for the new contractual agreement with
WHSmiths where margin only is recognised (minimal EBITDAS impact as offset in COS
also)

Agents Pay +£0.1m: In line with revenue mix. Revenue overperformance in products
with limited agents pay impact.

Non Staff Costs +£1.4m: Due to delays in programme spend (costs deferred until
2018/19) and delays in marketing spend, partially offset by incremental costs of
£(0.4)m in the month for POCA statements.

POMS has performed ahead of P5 forecast in the month and is in line with the updated
view performed at the end of P9 (comparatives above refer to the Board approved P5
reforecast). The full year EBITDAS target is £19.9m and management continue to
believe that this is deliverable (P5 forecast adjusted to remove the impact from the
removal of Mortgage Specialists £0.3m).

The decisive factor in POMS hitting its full year EBITDAS target is the continued
performance of the Q4 campaign which includes the Life Over 50’s DRTV test and learn
and associated activities. The campaign launched on the 22nd of January has achieved
a step change in performance. In P11 3,464 Protection (Life, Easy Life and Over 50's)
policies were sold which is 2,462 higher than P11 last year, an increase of 246%.

BOARD DECISION PAPER
Author: Cem Oztoprak Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron Meeting date: 27 March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to finalise the annual plan for formal submission to Government. At its review
in January the Board requested EBITDAS of £50m, up from £47m.

RemCo has agreed on STIP targets and recommending a gateway criteria for STIP to remain above
11,500 branches, with incentives paid on three measures: EBITDAS; removing POLSAP, HRSAP and
HNGX from the business; and having the Customer Hub operational, serving customers in two pillars of
Travel and Identity.

Questions addressed in this report

1- How has the budget moved since the last Board meeting?

2- What is the 2018-19 change plan?

3- How are we proposing to manage the balance sheet in 2018-19?
Conclusion

There have been a number of moving parts within the budget which largely net off. We are not
recommending any change to the £50m EBITDAS target.

We are budgeting for a change plan of c. £255m.
We will maintain cash control staying within headroom limits in spite of the growing banking framework.

How has the Budget moved since the last Board meeting?

1. The Board paper in January proposed a number of changes to finalise the budget delivering £50m
EBITDAS. These changes have now been incorporated and the final proposed P&L is as following:

2017-18 2018-19
£m P5 Forecast* Budget Variance YoY
Gross Income 949 968 19 +2.0%
Cost of Sales (121) (121) -

Agents’ Pay (369) (364) 5
Staff Costs (184) (182) 2
Non-Staff Costs (276) (285) (9)
EBITDAS 34 50 16 +66.7%

* Latest view on 2017-18 EBITDAS is £36m and overperformance vs budget is due to
underspend in growth fund and increase in Bol profit sharing which will not recur next year.

the wider negotiations with BOI (Peregrine) and it was agreed with the Board in January that the impact
of this would lead to a change in the budget targets.

before being kicked off.

9. The projects with in-year benefit (£130m) and further key investments (£93m) represents over 85% of
the planned spend for 2018-19. The remaining is made up of smaller projects and are also subject to

governance approval.

10. Current plan doesn’t reflect Project Panther costs. If this materialises, the project will be self-funded.

How are we proposing to manage the balance sheet in 2018-19?

11. The Balance Sheet, Cash and Headroom positions have been prepared and are subject to update
following the final 2017-18 outturn position. The key assumptions made are:

« Government funding will be drawn down on a quarterly basis in line with the proposed spending
pattern and there will be no significant fluctuations in spend profile vs. drawdowns.

¢ Banking Framework is assumed to require an additional £36m of cash in the network (future of cash
paper is still in development)

¢ Branch holdings are reduced down to £486m, including the adverse impact of banking framework
by end of next year vs. 2017-18 ytd avg. of £550m.

e Cash centre balances are held at current levels, subject to seasonal fluctuations.

12. The net inflow for the year is ca.£60m leading to a reduction in the net funding position. Month-end
headroom is not expected to exceed the £750m threshold but as always will be tight over the Christmas
period and will need to be closely monitored.

Overview

2017/18 Another year of progress:

« We continue to modernise, over 7,500 branches now modernised. These branches are delivering longer opening
hours, more efficient ways of working and more attractive environments for customers in their local communities.

* Supply Chain rationalisation (Project Iris) implemented in early 2017 is now embedded into the organisation and
settling down as BAU.

* Back Office Transformation continues with Phase 1 implementation ongoing and expected to complete in Aug 18.

* IT transformation continues with the network change to Verizon expected to complete by Mar 18 and Branch
Technology upgrade in Aug 18.

* 3 year funding plan agreed and EBITDAS (excluding Group Litigation Costs (GLC) ahead of 2017/18 targets as we
continue to deliver momentum towards commercial sustainability.
But trading conditions look challenging:

* £50m EBITDAS (£3m ahead of funding plan*) in spite of challenging trading conditions in Retail, Telecoms and
Financial Services.

* 2018/19 will represent a year of stabilisation and delivery of key transformation projects as we set ourselves up to
successfully deliver the next round of significant cost reductions in 2019/20.

substitution and overall market decline. UK letters market decline is (5)%
including high volume business mail (statements and direct mail.(Note:
RPI formula doesn't apply to Stamps).

Labels - YoY income broadly flat with 1% decline in class volumes
and flat 2"4 class volumes.

2017/18 volumes have held up despite challenges from Hermes and eBay
price promotions and RM’s channel strategy (online price differential and
delivery confirmation)

Labels remains the main area of risk and opportunity going forward with
substantial challenges deferred from this year.

Home Shopping Returns - Continues to grow +21% inline with UK online

returns are challenged by growing customer expectation and competition

s Decline in ATM resulting from a decline in POca volume of (3.5)m withdrawals, partially offset by improved ATM availability from 94% to 96% which

increases withdrawals by 2.8m YOY.

Availability issues:

. Of 2,370 live ATMs 2,110 are transacting at average availability of 98.2% (i.e. 2.2% above 96% target) @ P10 17/18

. The remaining 260 ATMs have been experiencing average availability of 65%. This is primarily being driven by a high number of cash dispenser

faults and cash jams following the introduction of polymer £10 notes.

. YoY reduction (10%) is driven by POCA (3.2%), Out of Grounds ATM (2.6%) , Reduction in cash transactions (2.3%), Service issues (2%)

+ 18/19 volumes will be supported through (i) service levels to remain above 96% target, (ii) £5 note dispense on additional 300 ATMs and (iii) 50

Passports - Budget has been revised and shows a year on year decline of
39%. The key driver of change is the HMPO announcement on differential
pricing that makes online applications cheaper than those made through
check and send. This change comes into effect at the start of the new
financial year and will therefore impact branch volumes.

Motoring - volume decline is planned at 9% YOY, in line with current
performance and reflects the slow down in decline over the past two
years. The volume decrease is prominently led by tax discs, 10 year
renewals are planned to remain static.

POCA - volumes are planned to continue to decrease steadily as account
holders are migrated onto bank accounts

continue throughout this year as they attempt to hit their target of 720k customers (they are currently about half way through).

+ Income from O/N balances is up YoY by £5m due to the uplift in LIBOR rate in Nov 2017 (following BoE increase in base rate) and

additional £1.5m from the interest rate swap (approved by ARC).This is also helped by total balances remaining higher than originally
forecast although this is expected to return to forecast as pensioners are encouraged onto other products.

+ Budget assumes an 8% decline in volume YOY. The current trend shows a 7% YOY decrease which has been embedded into the
plan, with a further 1% reduction derived from new Home Office digital product launches expected in 2018/19.

+ Market share of passports has continued to decline between 0.2% and 0.5% per month in 17/18, with a market share of circa 37.5%
anticipated in March 18 compared to 44% in March 2017. HMPO have announced that PMA registered companies (Photo Me,
Timpsons etc) will be able to provide digital photographs to support online applications and also that the online service will be extended
to 16 -24 year olds. Both these actions are expected to impact 2018 volumes. We expect HMPO to increase the activity to promote
online services in Q4 17/18, which may see additional pressure in 2018.

Verify volume growth is anticipated to continue at 31% YOY, this is in line with P1-P8

2017/18 performance.

Growth will be driven primarily by the on boarding of new services, which is handled by
Government Digital Service. Improved conversion rate is the other driver, which itself is

driven by improved and new data sources.

LoA2 is still Verify's biggest income driver, contributing 93% of Verify income since

LoA1s launch in Week 20

LoA1s launch did not have the impact anticipated on LoA2 volumes mainly because
DWP (View your state pension) service hasn't migrated away from LoA2 yet.

Conversion rate has increased YoY from 46% to 50% and is expected to reach 58% in

2018/19

PO remains market leader with circa 40% market share. We will be looking to improve
this through marketing in 18/19, with an ambition of 47% during marketing campaigns

Platform) and Hera (Protection business model) as well as commence the development of a replacement Home insurance
business model

drive revenue and group EBITDA contribution to £77.3m and £41.1m respectively (up 89% and 103% compared to
2017/18) by 22/23 whilst maintaining our group contribution of £20.3m in 18/19.

Mails EBITDAS is up £4.8m YOY to £157.2m

Despite contractual reductions of £4m,
Mails net income is +£12m YoY due
mainly to RPI (£7.7m), now confirmed at
net 3% (RPI-1%) and benefit of 53¢
week (£5.4m).

Excluding these benefits, underlying
income and EBITDAS are flat, reflecting
the change in mix (fewer letters, more
parcels)

Variable Agents Pay is +£7.5m on 17/18,
of which £3.3m relates to the 53% week.
The balance reflects the move from fixed
to variable costs resulting from DMB
closures and change in agent contracts.

Staff costs are +£0.2m on 17/18 due to

personnel transferring from projects
back to BAU.

IT costs reflect inclusion of £0.1m for
ongoing maintenance of Drop & Go.

Favourable £0.5m variance in Other
Operating Costs is due to a one-off loss
(fraud) on Parcelforce in 17/18.

Retail EBITDAS is down £0.3m YOY to
£2.9m

. Budget income reflects the new WHS
retail contract whereby stock is owned
by WHS and commission is earned on
sales revenue. Additionally there is a
direct contract with Royal Mint for the
sales of coins within DMB’s

° Closure of DMB’s results in
-£0.7m net income decline however is
partially offset by WHS contract which
provides a +£0.3m uplift.

. Direct costs (cost of sales) reduce by
£1.3m due to the change in the Retail
contract. £1.1m direct costs relate to
purchase of Royal Mint coins.

® YoY non staff costs decrease by
£0.2m due to procurement costs no
longer required going forward.

Strategy & Market

Economic uncertainty and rising inflation are putting pressure on consumers’
holiday finances. GDP is forecast to grow by 1.4% in 2018 but is slowing
The Travel Market is expected toremain flat and Consumer confidence is at
a low ebb of-13 (post Brexit it was -12).

Consumers continue to be price conscious so online and TMC are expected

to grow whilst on demand sales will fall by 5.7% due to reduced footfall and
new AML thresholds

Income and costs

Post Office and MoneyGram have a commitment to contribute up to £250k each (£500k) towards joint marketing activity. PO willbe taking a more
active role in managing these marketing initiatives. (Awaiting Penny confirmation this is sitting in Marketing budget)

MoneyGram have given a short term commitment to fund an increase in remuneration for cash to account transactions to India. This funding
supports the postmasters as their remuneration will be the same as a cash to cash transaction. Following a review of these results we will be
looking to agree ongoing funding from MoneyGram and expand destinations.

Risks & Opportunities

Depending on the outcome of our strategic review, we would expect to improve our financial position through enhanced remuneration form
MoneyGram alternatively if we move to an RFP process we will have to increase our oversight of the relationship to ensure tha MoneyGram do
not divert their resources to the RFP. The RFP process is also expected to impact 18/19 as we do not expect M/Gram to deliverdigital capabilities

Opportunity We are working with MoneyGram to develop more direct marketing campaigns in 2018/19 to maximise penetration of existing
customer relationships. This focussed approach is also aimed at stabilising the current send and receive RPT.

Key elements
+ Versus the 5+7 forecast, gross income is up £8.7m (10.1%), which is £7.4m (8.5%) excluding the 53! week

+ £2m of the growth is due to tier increases in the framework fee due to volume increase which rises from £20.7m to £22.3.m, tgether with
£400k RPI increases on transaction rate cards from P10.

+ The remaining £5m is due to the ongoing volume increases resulting from Bank closure programmes and increased awareness. Whib is an
increase of 7.5% on 2017/18 transactional income base of £63.6m

+ Agents Pay has reduced YoY by £1.6m to £27.6m versus the £29.3m in the 5+7 Forecast

+ Other costs, are broadly flat YoY aside from £150k auditcosts.. £180k of marketing was charged to the Development Fund in 2017/18
Since the budget was submitted

+ Transactional income has exceeded forecast-— likely end of 17/18 will be c. 67m vs £63.6m in initial budget.

+ Trading in the period since the budget was submitted has been strong, and the expected outcome for 2017/18 is £1.7m better tan the 5+7
forecast. The growth in Business Deposits (18.43% in 17/18) is significant, andas a result we believe that there is upside of up to £2m income
versus the current submission, most of which is offset by measures to improve the agents’ situation, and marketing spend. Tkse are set out in
more detail in the following pages.

BOARD DISCUSSION PAPER

Cash Efficiency

Author: Mark Dixon, Russell Hancock, Mark Ellis Sponsor: AlCameron Meeting date: 27 March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

Many of our customers want to transact in cash including the unbanked, people who
are resistant to technology, people who prioritise privacy and security etc. Our cash
enables our agents to support customer preferences and is, through Banking
Framework, a product in itself for small business.

We operate at scale, managing around £1.5b of cash in a typical day and moving
around £60b over the course of a year. The rules we operate under, set by BEIS and
the Bank of England, are unique. An explanation is set out in the Appendix.

At the last Strategy Awayday, we agreed that we would improve the efficiency with
which we use cash, creating future flexibility and improving our facility headroom to
be greater than our security headroom.

Putting cash to use with agents creates the risk that they will steal or lose it, creating
losses. Minimising cash availability reduces losses and it was agreed with the Board in
January that we would provide a combined update.

The purpose of this paper is to set out progress and next steps.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What progress has been made in improving flexibility?
2. What else can be done?
3. What is happening with agent losses?

Conclusions

We reduced cash in use by £180m by end January, reducing to £127m in February due
to the temporary impact of installing new High Speed Notes Counters. £24m extra was
borrowed from the Bank of England, giving a total balance sheet reduction of £151m.
This was partly offset because, as planned, we spent more on change in the period than
we received in funding. Borrowing from BEIS fell by £110m.

This improvement has been made in spite of growing Banking Framework activity and
is sustainable. We will always see seasonal impact, with an earlier Easter bringing
forward higher branch cash in March compared to last year.

Facility headroom under the BEIS facility increased to £299m and now exceeds security
headroom. We believe that a further £40m improvement should be possible without
significant investment.

POL-0023898
POL00027257
POL00027257

POST OFFICE PAGE 2 OF 5

Security headroom reduced to £223m due to the net change spend. As forecast, using
less cash reduces the borrowing and the security without benefitting headroom.
However, with higher facility headroom we can monetise security headroom if we need
to.

To improve security headroom, we are about to trial using smaller denomination notes
in branches and are in discussions with the Bank of England about an amendment to
increase off-balance sheet funding. We are not pursuing any changes to the rules
governing security headroom as we do not believe we will make progress.

Reducing cash in branches can also reduce fraud. As the Board is aware, due to the
impact of the Postmaster Litigation, we are currently restricted as to the legal action,
including County Court proceedings, we are able to bring against Postmasters with
unexplained branch losses.

This is likely to remain the case for at least another year and is well known across the
network. To combat higher levels of loss we have reduced excess cash in individual
branches from £90m to £27m, improved conformance with cash declarations, improved
the speed and accuracy of fraud analysis and significantly increased the number of
audits. We now find a problem in 81% of directed audits with no significant issues
identified in random audits.

In spite of this, losses have risen and the inherent risk will continue to rise. We are
assessing whether we need to further increase resources.

We will focus on managing future impacts of the Banking Framework (the future of cash
work will be brought to Board in May) and improving our MI on the back of the POLSAP
replacement. A longer-term Phase will likely be created to introduce better technology,
possibly including the internet of things and/or smarter counter safes transforming our
knowledge of where cash is and reducing losses.

Our long term goal remains charging for cash delivery and inventory to align our
interests with those of agents. However, this is a major change and would only be
introduced as part of a package of measures. This will form part of the Retail Strategy.

The Board is asked to note the progress made and comment on the next steps.

The Report

What progress has been made in improving flexibility?

1. We have c. £151m less cash on our balance sheet. We believe there is limited
seasonal impact in this comparison:

Cash position, £m Feb 2018 March 2017 Variance
Sterling 498 551 53
FX 57 85 28
Total Branch Cash 555 636 81
Inward REMs 48 83 35:
Outward REMs/Other 91 74 (17)
Total for Processing 139 157 18
Other, cheques, cards 68 120 52
Total Cash in Use 762 913 151

2. January's cash in use was even lower at £708m: the rise in February is primarily
due to £42m of extra cash in the machine processing rooms as we switch to the
new High Speed Note Counters.

3. This reduction reflects progress in a number of the planned areas. We worked with
3,000 branches to recover cash after Christmas. Branch Sterling has fallen by c.
£53m and as we will set out later in the paper, we believe this has been
successfully focused on branches with excess cash (£60m) and has not risked
trading through a general rationing of cash. We changed the way we provide Euros
and US Dollars to send the amounts we thought branches needed rather than the
amounts branches chose to order. FX holdings have fallen by £28m with at least
£20m due to this initiative.

4. The next significant area of focus was cash being processed back into bond.
Deploying overtime and 9 extra FTE in cash centres, inward rems are now £48m
versus £83m last year and a peak of £160m in Q1 as the Banking Framework
volumes increased.

5. We have spent £224m on capital and change while receiving £160m from trading
and Government support. As a result our net funding from client and other
creditors has fallen by £75m. We have borrowed more from the Bank of England,
enabling us to reduce borrowing from BEIS by £110m:

Borrowing position, £m Feb 2018 March 2017 Variance

6. Our facility headroom on the RCF is measured against an effective limit of £750m:
the facility limit of £950m less the Board’s £200m internal cap. Our headroom has
increased by £110m to £299m.

7. Our security headroom is relatively unaffected by the improvement because
reductions in cash in use reduce both the limit and the balance. However, it is
affected by the drop in the net funding provided by other sources as follows:

February 2018 674 (451) 223

8. We agreed with the Board last summer that our immediate task was to ensure that
Facility Headroom increased above Security Headroom, creating flexibility. That
has been achieved.

What else can be done?

9. Overall, we estimate that a further c. £40m of cash can be removed by targeting
excess cash in individual branches (this will never be nil), analysing whether it
would be cost effective to bring back c. £10m of surplus foreign currency in less
used currencies held in small amounts across the network and continuing to
optimise the end to end process.

10.We identified four other potential opportunities last Summer. Firstly, reducing
overall borrowing by creating a £50m third party facility: this is with HMT for
approval. Secondly, creating additional capacity in the NRF: we have dialogue with
the Bank and trials which in combination could benefit security headroom by c.
£60m, partly by using lower denomination notes in branches.

11.Thirdly, we may be able to reduce our buffer if we forecast better. We are
forecasting more often and working with KPMG to understand what else we can do
in the current state of our systems. However, this has not yet led to a systematic
improvement. Once we have replaced POLSAP, we expect to work on re-basing
both our financial and cashflow forecasts on trends in the underlying £60b of
transactions, for which information is not easily available today.

12.Finally, we discussed the potential to change the security headroom rules with HMT
but believe they will not change as it could impact the way the loan is
characterised on their balance sheet. We have stopped this workstream.

13.As we revert with the Future of Cash work, the banking framework may lead to
further phases being required. In the long term, we would like alignment with

agents on their use of cash by sharing the drivers of our cost base and charging for
cash delivery and inventory.

14.We have intentionally not made any progress in this area: we do not have
sufficient, reliable data to support any charge for inventory, which could be the
greatest driver of agent behaviour; and secondly, we can’t assess this in isolation
of the broader agent remuneration and retail strategy, due to the Board in June.
Whether we charge for services, offer different levels of service and how we
maintain people interested in taking and retaining Post Offices is complex and
finely balanced. Nonetheless, this would remain our preference.

What is happening with agent losses?

15.In the 11 months to end February, we saw an increase in debt provisioning net of
c. £4.3m - annualised c. £5m. This represented gross losses of £7.1m and
recoveries or £2.8m of which the bulk happen within a few days of the loss being
identified. This compares to net losses of c. £2.9m in 2016-17.

16.The pattern of rising network losses was discussed with the Board earlier in the
year. It is some years since we have felt able to routinely prosecute agents for
fraudulent activity and we are not now pursuing county court actions. This may
contribute to an increase in incidents: in the first quarter of the year we saw three
material losses of more than £300k each. We set out plans to improve
conformance with and simplify the cash declaration process, giving us better data,
to improve fraud analytics and to increase the number of audits.

17.We are working hard to combat the trend:

e Cash declaration conformance has increased steadily over the last year from 85%
in January 2017 to 91% in February 2018 with a continuing upward trend. This is
the result of thousands of phone calls.

e The project to simplify declarations is underway for delivery in July. It is taking a
long time because making changes to Horizon code is slow.

e We have reduced estimated excess cash at branches from £90m (£126m after
Christmas) to c. £27m. This does not represent a static population of branches.

e We have worked with a third party to improve the accuracy and speed of
identifying fraud. We have completed 594 risk audits YTD versus 425 for the whole
of last year. When the team request an audit there is a loss and /or excess cash to
return 81% of the time, 75% have some sort of cash loss. 97 random counts have
been carried out with 40 showing small losses totalling £18k, an average loss of
£450, highest individual loss £2.3k.

« YTD 143 postmasters have been suspended compared to 116 last year, with 101
branches remaining closed. The majority relate to audit issues.

18.The net impact is that the average loss has fallen from £24k in Q1 to £16k now but
that is a rising trend from Q2 at £9k. We are not seeing the very large losses - our
largest loss in Q4 is £130k

19.Within a future phase, technology options can be used to reduce theft, including
potentially using internet of things sensors on cash packets and new counter safes
pioneered by the Norwegian Post Office which reduce handling of and access to
cash. These are potentially game changing. The immediate systems priority
however is to manage the transfer of cash management from POLSAP to new
Transtrack software. We are working on improved data flows, analytics and
forecasting to flow from this core change.

APPENDIX —- HOW DOES CASH WORK IN POST OFFICE?

The purpose of this Appendix is to remind people of the way we manage cash, the
rules we operate under and the jargon we use. For consistency, we are using the data
at the March 2017 year-end throughout.

Cash under our control

On that date we had £1,444m! of physical cash under our control. We operate as a
member of the Bank of England’s Note Circulation Scheme (NCS) which supports us
operationally and with funding in exchange for us distributing cash throughout the
country.

Cash we manage for other people but do not own

Of that £1,444m, £532m was in Bank of England (BoE) vaults in our Birmingham and
London cash centres or in a Clydesdale Bank vault in our Glasgow. Once the cash is in
the vaults, it belongs to the bank and not to us - neither the cash nor any related
borrowing appears on our balance sheet.

There are very specific rules that govern the operation of the vaults from opening
hours (broadly 9-5), to security to processing requirements. Either bank can and does
send teams in without notice to audit us: to date we have always passed.

Our main risks are the security of the cash and ensuring that the amount of cash held
does not exceed our insurance limits for that site or across our business. Limits can be
stressed by the build-up of £50 notes. Oddly, people across the world will take £50
notes in their original wrapping but not once they have been used even if they remain
in perfect condition (A-FiT). A-FiT £50s come in via FRES and tend to build up until we
can persuade the BoE to take them back. To date, they have done that (to the tune of
c. £210m this year) and we have not had to refuse FRES.

Cash we use in our business
Cash is used in our business from the moment it leaves the vault until it is paid to a
customer and from the moment it is paid in to our till until it is back in the vault.

Cash is considered branch cash from the point at which it is barcoded (remm’d) into a
branch as the Supply Chain driver delivers it. It is remm’‘d out when it is packaged for
return and the barcode swiped - it may then stay in the branch safe until Supply
Chain picks it up again.

Once it has been barcoded for return it becomes an Inward Rem. It will be picked up,
and returned to one of 15, local depots. It will then be put on larger lorries to be
“trunked” back to one of the cash centres. The cash is then counted by machine under
camera. We are currently replacing our old machines with High Speed Note Counters
that meet the BoE’s new rules for polymer notes. The cash is processed in alignment

with BoE rules and goes back into the vault at which point the cash is owned by BoE
and disappears from our balance sheet and funding requirement.

Cash will also be doing the same journey in reverse (Outward Rems) and we maintain
other cash between vault and branch for a variety of reasons - local stocks of coin to
speed up delivery, Scottish notes etc.

The cash in use in our business at year-end was therefore £913m, broken down as
follows:

Cash position, £m March

2017
Sterling notes and coin 551
Foreign currency notes 85
Total Cash in Branches 636
Inward REMs 83
Outward REMs/Other 74
Total for Processing 157
Other distributed inventory, cheques, cards 120
Total Cash in Use 913

Funding

That £912m of cash was funded as follows:

RCF Clients NRF Total
561 106 246 913
The NRF

£246m was borrowed from the BoE under a complex arrangement within the NCS
known as the Note Recirculation Facility (NRF). The BoE wants us to distribute cash
around the country preferably using smaller denomination notes. Every note we
process over the course of a year (October to October) creates capacity and the
smaller the note, the more capacity it creates. Over the course of a year, the notes
we distribute earn us capacity of some £250m every day.

We are allowed to sell that capacity to the BoE overnight. Effectively the cash sits in
our branches and would sit as borrowing on our balance sheet during the day. At end
of day, an amount is formally transferred to the BoE and both the cash and the
borrowing are removed from our balance sheet.

We only have to stay within our capacity over the course of the year - on a given day
we can sell capacity to the BoE up to a limit of £350m, giving short-term flexibility. If

we over-use the facility across a year, we have to pay the BoE an interest charge on
the additional amount. We work hard not to do this in case we risk the relationship.

PAGE 3

The BoE is not prepared to risk this money and it is guaranteed by RBS for which we
pay a small LIBOR related interest fee. The RBS arrangement works within an overall
commitment of £400m, used in various ways over a 24 hour period:

e £1m is used at all times as collateral with the Bank of England so support the £1m
self-insured element of our Crime Insurance.

e At 6:00 am we repurchase notes from the BoE. This is funded by an overdraft on
our RBS account. This can be up to £350m. We also pay the BoE for the amount
of Notes that we expect to take out of bond on that day. The combination of the
two can be no more than £399m. This means that our bank account with RBS can
be overdrawn by up to £399m during the day.

e At the end of the operational day (6:30 pm) we receive funds from the BoE for
notes demonetised (i.e. sold back within the NRF) and for any notes that we have
put into Bond during the day.

e Treasury have to fund the RBS bank account so that the balance at the end of the
day is zero.

e Shortly after RBS then allocate up to £350m from their collateral pool with the BoE
in favour of POL as collateral for the notes purchased by the BoE to back up POL’s
commitment to repurchase them the next day.

e At about 5:30 am the following day this collateral is then released by the BoE.

The borrowing under the NRF and the cash it relates to is held off-balance sheet. In
our ARA, the cash balance is not £947m but £947m minus £256m - £691m. We are
looking, as discussed at the last ARC, at increasing the transparency of the NRF in the
ARA.

Client Funding
£106m was funded by clients. Most of that was owed to Santander Bank whose
customers have longer and more substantial paying in relationships with Post Offices.

RCF and RCF Headroom
The remaining borrowing of £561m was from BEIS under its Revolving Credit Facility
or RCF.

We have to give BEIS 48 hours’ notice of how much money we want to borrow.

The facility is capped at £950m which was reduced from £1,150m in a previous
funding period and that has been confirmed through to March 2021.

The Board has taken the view that some funding availability should be held back in
case the position of the business deteriorates, to manage volatility and to enable us to
cope with shocks. As a result, we can only borrow above £750m with the Board’s
permission.

While the flow of client monies can create significant swings (in 2016-17 there were
10 days where our headroom deteriorated by more than £200m compared with the
previous day and 29 days where it deteriorated by more than £100m) we have sought
to manage that within the £750m. Only at Christmas in recent years have we
requested Board permission to extend the limit to £850m and in fact that was not
needed in 2017: we held at £749m of borrowing.

POL00027257

Our facility headroom against that limit was therefore £750m less the balance of
£561m - £189m.

However, the RCF was designed to fund the working capital needs of the business and
is held on a different and less scrutinised part of the Government's balance sheet. The
use of the facility is not hypothecated or limited and our cash is fungible. However, to
ensure that we do not over-borrow against the facility for other reasons such as
investments, the RCF is also subject to another limit, being Security Headroom.

This requires the borrowing under the RCF to be less than the working capital needs of
our business. This is defined according to a formula:

Security Headroom fm
Cash in use in the business 913
Less: cash de-monetised under the NRF (246)
Branch cash 667
Other defined net client assets/debtors 227
Total security available 894
Less: borrowing under the RCF (561)
Security Headroom available 333

Managing Headroom

As set out in the main paper, and as forecast in the June Board session, reducing the
amount of cash in branches and in the cash process will increase the facility headroom
(we borrow less against £750m) but does not increase security headroom as the
security limit and the branch are both reduced equally.

We also have a separate security arrangement with Santander which has c. £90m of
headroom but which could presumably be managed within the overall relationship.

The Report

Balance Sheet Product Set
1. How we Make Money

* Mortgage income is based on the total completions value: 30bps for contact
centre/online and 9bps for brokers. Cards and Loans are based on transaction
volumes and balances - 45bps of total written lend value and £21 for each card sale.

e In Savings, under the current value share, we receive a fixed payment of £43m.
There is also variable income based on a Net Interest Margin (NIM) target of 55bps
in March 2018, with £0.55m of income for each additional 1bp below this target.

2. Core Proposition for our Customers

Today we offer good value, straightforward retail banking products but we need to move
away from being price-led into differentiated propositions that build long-term customer
relationships. The first will be two new mortgage propositions launching in April.

4. Review of Performance

Savings performance has been very strong, supported by the partnership’s pricing
responses to the base rate increase. We expect NIM to be c.46bps, leading to a
forecasted income level £4.4m above budget.

Mortgages are tracking ahead of last year but remain behind target in both apps and
completions. Price is the key driver which has restrained volumes but we are launching
two new propositions in April, backed by a major marketing campaign. Our unsecured
lending journeys are improving with higher accept rates (68% in cards/55% in loans).

5. Year-End Outlook

Contribution is expected to end the year in line with budget and £5.5m ahead of
forecast. We are not expecting to receive any profit share from credit cards (budget
£0.9m) or personal loans, however this will be offset by the additional savings income.

Transactional Product Set
1. How we Make Money

¢ Our foreign currency products deliver income on a transactional basis (£1.92 per
‘normal’ FX transaction, 0.4% of ‘click & collect’ turnover, £4.58 per new ‘travel
money card’ sale and 0.625% of all top-ups) plus an annual fixed payment of £10m.

e« MoneyGram income is generated through three streams: the FX margin (c.34%),
customer fee (c.36%) and a fixed 65p per transaction. We get c£6.35 per Send and
£10.50 per Receive and there is also an additional £3m annual payment to POL.

e Postal Orders (“POs”) cost 50p for transactions 50p-£4.99, £1 for £5.00- £9.99 and
above that 12.5% capped at £12.50. We also recognise income from expired POs.

2. Core Proposition for our Customers

Post Office is the number one provider for in-branch foreign currency sales, with a
market share of 25% and online share of 17%. We also have the largest network of
money transfer branches in the UK and hold a c.13% share of cash money transfer
business. Postal Orders are in structural decline and subject to a wider strategic review.

4. Review of Performance

Travel Money & FRES revenue is £1m ahead of budget and £0.5m better than YTD
forecast, principally due to the performance of the TMC but also recently better volumes
in branch. However, AML limits are a risk to FRES profit (£2k+ transactions down 40%).

MoneyGram is behind its original income budget by £(4.8)m and YTD forecast by
£(1.7)m. Key drivers are migrant levels and uncertainty around Brexit, the value of £
and FX margins and stricter AML regulations requiring ID on higher value transactions.
PO volumes are declining by c.20% YoY and are 13% lower than budget.

5. Year-End Outlook

We are expecting Travel Money to end c.5% behind target due to competitive pricing in
the online market but this has been offset by the good performance of the TMC. We are
reviewing our remittances strategy and are in commercial dialogue with MoneyGram.
Postal Orders contribution is expected to end the year in line with the 5+7 forecast.

Telco
1. How we Make Money

e We offer consumer telephony products (HomePhone, Broadband ADSL and Fibre)
and telephony services (voice calls, premium install, virus protection etc). The
products offer 3 contract lengths (12/18/24 mths) ensuring that new promotional
offers can be rotated to balance ASA compliance with avoiding “always on” offers.

e Customer monthly Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) and average tenures vary
by product and promotional price points. In HomePhone, the average ARPU is £24.46
over 57 months and in Broadband it is £27.48 over 32 months. ARPU is a mix of
fixed contract income (c70%) and variable income from call packages etc.

2. Core Proposition for our Customers

Broadband (ADSL) & Fibre (FTTC): For Qi 18/19 we will be launching our most
competitive Standard Broadband price point at just £18pm through our key affiliate
partners (U-Switch, Moneysupermarket, Broadband Choices) and improving Fibre retail
prices from £32 to £31pm on our most popular tariffs. This increased aggression is
primarily supported through wholesale cost reductions negotiated with Talk Talk.

HomePhone: The base HomePhone offering will be reduced from £16.99 to £11.50 on
ist May in response to the OfCom’s market pricing intervention. We are also introducing
a £1.50 charge for paper billing for customers moving to the £11.50 tariff but we expect
POL to remain competitive vs BT with better value through free call features and rates.

4. Review of Performance

Telecoms gross income is £1.8m better than forecast due to higher customer numbers
and greater ARPU. YTD contribution variance to forecast is (£0.3m) due to accounting
treatment of contract set-up costs, partly offset by higher customer numbers and an
early price increase and lower cost of sales, particularly for HomePhone only customers.

5. Year-End Outlook

Telco gross income should outturn c£2.6m ahead of forecast due to higher customer
take up and ARPU. At the same time, amortisation costs have increased since the 5+7
forecast through a changed accounting treatment adding £1.5m to the cost base.
Overall, Telco contribution is expected to outturn (£1.1m) adverse to 5+7 forecast.

Post Office Insurance (“POI”)

1. How we Make Money

¢ Travel Insurance (“TI”): Revenue is through commission income. 84% of sales
are single trip policies with one-off revenue. The rest are Annual Multi-Trip (AMT)
policies which builds annuity income. AMT retention is c18%. There is an
underwriting profit share; returned as revenue or rate reduction.

e Life & Over 50s: Income is generated through commission, reflecting the lifetime
value of the sale to POI and is subject to clawback for policies cancelling within the
indemnified period (up to 48 months). An annuity income stream is received monthly
for all policies that continue beyond the indemnity period and a monthly income
stream of 2.5% of premiums is paid to POI as commission on these policies.

« Home, Car & Van: Revenue is generated through a combination of commission
income, add-on margins (e.g. Legal Expenses, Roadside Assistance etc), service
fees, instalment income and First Notification of Loss income. Policies generate an
annuity income stream from both new sales and renewals, plus a profit share.

2. Core Proposition for our Customers

POI propositions are simple to understand, easy to access and offer good customer
value while not being the cheapest in the market. Propositions for Travel and GI remain
mass market with limited differentiation although plans to refresh this are in
development. Protection products are evolving at pace, providing the platform to
successfully build a material share of the growing direct to consumer protection market.

Q4 protection campaign continues to build momentum. Marketing is delivering above
expectations driving response for over 50’s into all channels. We are seeing early signs
of success in respect of our 1 on 1 customer communication and digital marketing for
Life insurance. Month on month digital sales of protection are up by 323% (P10 to P11).
Renewal retention for car insurance continues to outperform plan by 2%. We continue
to track behind plan for Travel Insurance sales volume across multiple channels.

DRTV, Life sales and Easy Life will be critical in hitting the year end number.

Customer Hub
1. Programme Plan Summary

The Customer Hub is targeting a first launch in May 2018. The initial MPV is focused on
the TMC and TI products which will be served through our own Travel App. The project
is in its product development sprint cycle, application build and API integration with
both FRES and POI. FRES now has dedicated development, test and production
environments and we are now working on a clear, POL-wide Hub operating model.

2. Achievements to Date

We have introduced Agile Ways of working to support rapid product and application
development - learnings which will need to be shared more widely in POL. The Post
Office Digital Innovation Centre has been launched and key people recruited. The
procurement of the OutSystems platform & development is ongoing. UI/UX prototyping
for TMC is now completed, and continuing for TI.

3. Launch Proposals

Following launch in May, all new TMC customers will be directed to the Customer Hub
where we will also be able to offer them TI and Gadget Insurance as add-ons. Sales
support kits and call centre briefings are being prepared.

4. Expected Take Up and Usage

Assumptions for the first MPV are based on an approach of co-existence with the current
FRES TMC App initially. This will be followed by a period of migration for existing TMC
customers to the Travel Hub (expected to complete by the end of Q4 2018/19). We also
intend to migrate existing TI customers into the Hub at their renewal point and from
this base, we will cross-sell TI, TMC, Gadget Insurance and Identity products. Regular
usage is critical via personalisation, velocity of new services and some key capabilities:
e Active customer management based on data analytics, e.g. nudging.

e Additional functionality to increase self-serve (e.g. insurance add-ons, Mid-Term

Adjustments, Claims, Chat bot, TMO, onboarding TMC etc)
e Improved propositions (e.g. affinity arrangements such as HolidayExtras).

5. The Future

We are developing a process to include additional verticals in the future. This process
will be discussed and approved in the Customer Hub Steerco and brought to GE for
information.

Appendix - Brief Market Overview

Mortgages

Current market size c£1.4bn; POL’s total stock c£5.4bn; market share c0.38%.
Mortgage lending has been growing consistently over recent years, with accelerated
growth in 2016 compared to 2014 and 2015 but base rate rises would impact the market
over the coming period. The dominant players in the market are Lloyds Banking Group,
Nationwide, RBS, and Santander. Digital channels are most important when customers
are researching a product, but many customers still value face-to-face advice at the
application stage. The intermediary channel continues to grow in importance.

Savings

Current market size £1.45trn; POL’s book size c£14.5bn; market share c.1%

Savers have been disadvantaged by extremely low interest rates for a number of years
and as such customers have often been turning to interest-bearing current accounts
instead as a means of bolstering their savings income. The major retail banks together
with Nationwide and NS&I remain the largest providers of retail savings accounts.

Personal Loans

Unsecured loans market size c£38bn; POL written lending c£120m; market share 0.3%
The unsecured lending market grew by 40% between 2012 and 2016, reaching £260
billion by the end of the period, with estimates from Mintel showing a further 5% growth
for 2017, spurred on by low interest rates making repayment levels more affordable.

Credit Cards

Current market size 36m (vol); POL active accounts 406k (vol); market share 1.12%
Credit card lending has maintained growth levels of 5-10% over the last five years. Low
interest rates have driven hard competition with increasing balance transfer offers and
rewards. The number of credit cards in circulation has been roughly stable at 60 million
over the last five years. Barclaycard remains the largest provider with an estimated
market share of 16% followed by LBG at 15% and HSBC at 11%.

Travel Money

Market transaction value £9-12bn; POL transaction value £2.5bn; market share 25%
UK residents spent £43.4 billion abroad in 2016. However the Brexit vote led to an
immediate fall in the value of the pound which has yet to recover its pre-referendum
levels. This has significantly reduced consumer spending power abroad and as a result,
consumers are paying closer attention to exchange rates and are much more likely to
spend more time shopping around to find the best deal. Fintechs like Revolut are
performing well in the pre-paid multi-currency card arena.

Telco

Homephone only market c2m households and POL market share is 10%; Broadband
market is c25m households and POL market share is c1%

There are four major providers in the Telco market - BT, Sky, Virgin and TalkTalk. All
are focused on fibre broadband to support fully converged 3 or 4 play offers. Fibre offers
lower margin returns, but which these are offset by converged offers of TV and Mobile
by most of the big four. ADSL broadband (up to 17mb) is still in over 9m UK homes,

and remains highly attractive to value seeking or smaller households. Over 50% of
customer switching is now happening online and through affiliate websites such as U-
Switch.

Travel Insurance

Market Gross written premium c£730m; POI’s GWP is c£50m; market share 6.8%
Steady market growth predicted with the current market size of £730m written premium
forecasted to grow to 920m over the next 5 years. This will lead to the continuation of
intensified price competition from a crowded market. Annual Multi Trip continues to be
c.40% of the overall TI market, but this is inflated by policies offered by Banks/Credit
cards. Market share of packaged accounts with travel insurance is on the decline with
customers expected to revert back into the direct travel insurance market.

Motor Insurance

Car insurance market GWP c£11.5bn; POI’s GWP is c£80m, market share 0.7%

Whole car market growth is estimated at cl1%pa to 2020 with aggregator expected to
grow at the same rate. There is little to no impact from insuretech/fintech in motor
given high entry barriers and costs and business/product model highly commoditised.
The short term outlook for motor is favourable with a short and shallow drop in rates
expected as some providers move for growth.

Home Insurance

Market GWP c£5.7bn; POI’s GWP is c£98m; market share 1.7%

Insurable households currently total 20.1m and expected to fall by an average of 2%
p/a over the next 3 years (eBenchmarkers). This reflects changes in home ownership
especially for younger segments. Aggregator share is still expected to grow by 7% pts
between now. The home market is likely to be more challenging in the short term as
traditional insurers have not sufficiently adjusted their business models to reflect
increased competition from aggregator distribution.

Term Life

Total non-advised market 250k new policies pa, £70m APE; POI’s market share 2.5%
There remains a significant protection gap in the UK market - very difficult to scale but
believed to be multiple £bn. Mintel forecasts 1-2% market growth per year over next 3
years with a trend for direct to consumer new business comprising an increasing portion
of the market. Aggregator growth is expected to continue too at c10% pa.

Over 50's

Market is 280k new policies pa; £55m APE; POI’s market share 7%

The market is expected to be flat in 2018/19 with potential for limited growth in 19/20
and beyond. It should be noted however that market size has shown a strong historical
correlation to the TV advertising expenditure of the market leader, Sun Life.

BOARD DECISION PAPER

International Remittances

Authors: N. Boden / C. Pispinis Sponsor: Owen Woodley Meeting date: 27 March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

« Following on from the Remittances paper presented to the December GE, Post Office
Money has completed its review of our current contractual obligations with our in-
branch cross border payment provider, MoneyGram (MG).

« Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) have seen continued impact to consumer
spending caused by a number of key factors —- Brexit, falling immigration rates, the
weakness of sterling and continued focus on AML requirements - all of which will
remain ongoing considerations over the short to longer term.

e The financial impact to POL continues to be challenging with double digit YOY decline
in transaction numbers. Our 2017/18 YE income outlook is £26.2m, £2.4m adverse
to the 5+7 forecast.

e Digital capabilities, in contrast to the traditional cash-to-cash send and receive
transactions, continue to increase in popularity with remittance customers. It is
estimated that digital remittances have grown from 5% of the UK market to around
20% over the last three years. Currently, our existing agreement with MG contains
an exclusivity clause removing our flexibility to operate in this digital arena with
other providers, yet this is not a strength for MG’s European operations.

e Our current exclusive contract with MG runs to September 2019, with the option
(requiring confirmation by 30'* March 2018) to extend to September 2021.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What is the size of the current market and estimated share by MTO within the UK?

2. What would be our key RFP considerations and how would these balance against
improved value from an extended MoneyGram contract?

3. What is our current 3-year forecast and how does it compare to the negotiated
outcome with MoneyGram?

4. What are our recommendations and next steps?

Conclusions

1. As digital activity continues to build in the remittances market, and growth in the
total market remains flat at best, we expect cash-initiated remittances to see single
to double digit decline over the next three years. Further changes in AML transaction
thresholds and lower immigration into the UK will exacerbate this decline rate, as

room for further background on the market & competitive landscape, and contractual set-up
with MG.

we have seen following the current £800 limit introduced in 2017 and Brexit. Our
future revenue expectations will therefore be under growing pressure unless we have
access to a complementary digital solution.

2. Our discussions in the market would suggest that we are unlikely to get an enhanced
offer on our branch proposition from an alternative provider and critically, any new
agreement would only commence in late 2019 by which point we expect the digital
market to have moved even further. We believe we need to act sooner than that.

3. We do not believe that it is feasible for POL to own the full value chain for the
foreseeable future, given the need for a global network of correspondents: current
branch, online and digital providers operate in >100 countries and come with
recognised and trusted brands. We also believe that a multi-partner branch
proposition would be untenable given differing provider tariffs and exchange rates,
and would be potentially less beneficial commercially.

4. Based on the above and our earlier analyses, we have two primary choices:

« Option 1: Move to RFP - this would corroborate, or otherwise, the sense we are
getting from the market and determine whether MG would provide enhanced terms
from late 2019 onwards under competitive pressure. However, this would certainly
delay our ability to launch a digital proposition until early-mid 2020. Furthermore, it
is expected that any new provider would be seeking a significant new contract period
and likely request full exclusivity across branch and digital.

e Option 2: Negotiate better commercial terms through to September 2021 and
remove exclusivity on digital capability with MG immediately. This would keep the
focus and continuity on our current branch product; help protect against any further
declines in performance from the political landscape affecting immigration (our core
customer base); and enable us to develop our digital product offering and test the
market faster than if we had to wait to go to RFP.

5. We believe option 2 provides better customer and business outcomes, particularly
with a clear commitment from MG to build out their non-European corridors; as such,
we have sought and secured an improved guaranteed income stream from our
existing branch channel which will mitigate against any further revenue decline. This
amounts to a net income of £5.6m over the life of the extended MG contract to 2021.
We have also secured MG’s consent to give us more flexibility on digital remittances,
including full freedom on pure digital transactions. We think this is a compelling offer
which helps to mitigate our market risk over the next three and a half years and we
therefore recommend that the MG contract is extended to September 2021, subject
to legal terms.

Input Sought

The Board is asked to support the recommended next steps.

The Report

What is the current size of the UK market, estimated share by
MTO and product differentiators?

1. The UK is an outbound market with send transactions accounting for 90% of all
transactions. We estimate the send market to be c£6bn p.a. with 21m send
transactions in 2017 by MTOs for walk-in and online business. Share by operator
(banks excluded) is as follows:

a. Western Union (“WU”) 43%
b. MoneyGram 19%* (*POL represents 70%)
c. RIA 8%
d. World Remit 7%
e. Transferwise 5%
f. Others 18%

2. POL is the largest single network with a UK market share of 13%.

3. WU primarily operates across a network of independent operators, similar to RIA;
RIA commenced a pilot with Asda in 2017 for a white-label online solution, the
success rates of which are unknown. RIA’s owner, Euronet, also owns HIFX and XE
who are competitors of POL in the digital sphere.

4, The three largest MTOs — WU, MG and Ria - are all US companies and between them
have over 1m send and receive locations globally. They also operate in most
countries and territories. They all offer a 10-minute person-to-person cash send/pick
up service, as well as bank account deposits and deposits to mobile wallets in certain
markets. These markets are growing and a key focus of each operator. The very
broad and established network locations in ‘receive’ countries are the main reason
why POL would not be in a position to become a provider in its own right over the
short to medium term, and therefore is better off partnering with an existing,
recognised branded network.

5. FinTech MTOs operate simple internet/mobile low cost models and provide an
alternative to the walk-in cash-to-cash models, by signing agreements directly with
banks and mobile operators. Similar to the cash-to-cash providers, these digital
operators are also focussed on owning the customer data to directly market their
new services and influence customer behaviour, e.g. through prompt and
personalised notifications of exchange rate movements.

6. We believe there is a significant opportunity for POL to engage in the digital space
by partnering with a FinTech - either the established names, such as Azimo,
Transferwise or Revolut - or the less established, such as Smallworld or TransferGo.
There are also opportunities for POL to disrupt the market in terms of a more simple
pricing structure which we will be exploring further.

What are core RFP considerations and how do these balance

against improved value from an extended MoneyGram contract?

7. WU and RIA are expected to require a minimum five-year agreement as this
timescale is currently a recognised payback period for signing fee, branch rebranding
and marketing investments for a partner with our branch footprint. We would also
expect to be required to accept an exclusivity clause for this time period consisting
of cash-to-cash and digital capabilities.

POST OFFICE PAGE 4 OF 8

8. Additionally, we think that an RFP would result in loss of focus from MG on the core
business during the critical period in the run up to Brexit, which would likely further
impact POL's decline in revenues over the next 18 months. MG’s current agreement
expires at the end of September 2019, unless POL requests an extension through to
September 2021, to be requested by 30" March 2018.

9. Whilst the recent ANT Financial planned purchase of MG was blocked by US
authorities, MG remains open to further takeover bids. If this situation was to occur,
POL would have a right to terminate if MG were acquired directly or indirectly by an
entity outside of MG’s group, provided we can explain our motives, which must be
reasonable.

10.Of course, an RFP would give us the opportunity to engage with the market leader,
Western Union. This has its benefits, though we should also consider:

o The market is changing rapidly; waiting for the RFP, which means we would
not be contracting with a (new) party until October 2019, would further
exacerbate the current declining income trend, by less focus on the business
given diversion of resource to the RFP, and further falling behind in the digital
space.

o Informal engagement with WU indicates they could provide digital capability
within 3-4 months, subject to POL tech; the negotiating approach we have
taken with MG (i.e. more digital flexibility) would still give us the opportunity
to partner with WU in the digital space.

o WU has also indicated they would not be prepared to give us access to customer
and behavioural data; this would limit the wider payment capability we are
looking to leverage across POL, and through Customer Hub specifically. This
would apply to physical and digital transactions

o Whilst some of the points above could be negotiated, WU, as any new provider,
would most likely be looking for exclusivity for a minimum of five years to
ensure payback; this would take us out to late 2024.

11.Other areas we have considered in moving to an RFP process include: timescale to
complete; opportunity cost of the RFP process, including senior management, legal
and procurement resources and cost; unknown financial impact to October 2019
(date from which a new agreement would run and by which time the digital part of
the market is likely to have continued its rapid growth); removal of existing signage
and rebranding of our branches; employee training; and system investments.

12. As such, we devised a negotiation strategy with MG, developed on the basis of three
key objectives: (i) protect against current revenue decline, (ii) release/reduce our
current “exclusivity” contractual obligations to allow us to develop/partner on new
digital capabilities and, (iii) create a financial benefit for POL if MG is unable to deliver
against a pre-committed new market and product development schedule. Through
our negotiations we have made significant progress against the first two of these
objectives. MG’s reliance on third party agreements to deliver against the schedule
means that they are not willing to agree on the third objective.

13. To help MG get to their final offer, we have actively supported a review of their cost
base and received a 12-month new market and product development plan.

14. The table overleaf shows a summary of MG's offer and our commentary. It is
important to share at this point that we do not think that the cost reductions MG has
proposed to part-fund the additional fixed payment will exaggerate further revenue
decline, except for point 3 which is expected to impact our gross income by £0.2m
p.a.

Appendix 1) third-party actions

15.In summary, MG will reduce its annual costs by £1.6m p.a. and pay POL an additional
guaranteed payment of £6m (£5.6m net) over the life of the extended agreement.
MG has also confirmed that POL has the freedom to source a new partner or develop
its own product for digital remittances, providing a new revenue stream and
enhancing the Travel Hub and ID propositions.

16.Whilst the recent acquisition of MG by ANT financial has been blocked, MG continues
to develop its direct relationship with ANT which is a critical development to gain
penetration against the existing strength of WU in the Asia-Pacific market. The table
in Appendix 1 represents MG’s 2018 market development roadmap, all of which will
be accessible to POL through its branch network, pending any system developments.
This roadmap should significantly improve MG’s competitive strength in these
regions.

What is our current three-year forecast and how does it

compare to our negotiated outcome with MoneyGram?
17.MG has offered an additional £6m fixed payment over the term of the extended
contract; on taking the extension payment over 2018/19 and 2019/20:
o Any decline in FS&T Contribution is protected by £5.6m over the next two
financial years as it is a guaranteed payment, not a variable payment.
o A sensitivity check against a 10% decline in sales in 2018/19 and 2019/20
would provide FS&T a contribution value of £13.8m and £11.9m respectively,
based on the new financials.

*If the agreement is not extended then the annual fixed payment reduces from £3m to £1m and the
Network access fee reduces from £2m to £1m in the 2019/20 budget bringing our contribution down to
£8m

The table above assumes the additional £6m ‘extension payment’ is equally split over two years, 2018/19
and 2019/20; this could be flexed differently depending on POL’s wider business requirements.

NOTE: The extension of the agreement would also run for the first six months of our 2021/22, for which
MG is not proposing any additional payment; in line with current agreement we would only receive a
network access fee at a value of £1.08m (no fixed payment)

18.With the removal of digital capabilities from the current exclusivity clause with MG,
POL will have the freedom to realise new revenue streams by developing the right
capabilities to capitalise on its ambition in this arena. If the digital market grows to
£2.1bn (35% share of the total remittance market) and POL can penetrate 10% of
that market at a margin of 1%, it could drive c.£2m gross income p.a., subject to
commercial negotiations. We will formally engage with digital providers as soon as
we are contractually able, to assess the size of the opportunity.

What are our recommendations and next steps?

19. Following our successful negotiations with MG in securing additional guaranteed
payments totalling £6m gross, and the change in the existing exclusivity clause to
allow us to pursue digital capabilities (whether with MG or elsewhere), we
recommend extending our existing agreement with MG through to September 2021.
This is a finely balanced decision since it defers a competitive tender from MG for
two years, but it enables POL to pursue other avenues for digital, whilst keeping
momentum in the cash-initiated business without the distraction brought by an RFP,
also allowing us to focus our resources on other business priorities.

20.A two-year extension with MG would give us additional guaranteed income and the
ability to test the digital opportunity and reality; this would put us in a much stronger
position in 2021, when we go out to the market at the end of the extended MG term.

21. We would also undertake the following next steps:

o Engage legal to draft the required MG contract changes and initiate the business
case process as appropriate

o Engage with a selection of FinTech and online specialists, with the aim of
understanding their strengths, the market and digital fit with POL. Review
opportunities of a JV with or acquisition of a FinTech or online specialist

o Continue engagement with Innovation and Identity to assess opportunities of
developing a digital remittances proposition within our new app, whilst
supporting our aspiration to eKYC every customer once for all products

o Develop a comprehensive digital deployment roadmap (please refer to

2. The second relates to how we exploit the ‘pure’ digital remittance opportunity. As
mentioned earlier, we'll need to decide how we deploy that capability, e.g. through
a partnership with or acquisition of an existing online specialist. Other considerations
will include wider Customer Hub developments, broader payment capabilities
(including Payment Hub), and digi-identity.

STRATEGY PAPER

Identity services: priorities for 2018/19

Sponsor: Martin Edwards Authors: Bryn Robinson Morgan, Elinor Hull Meeting date: 27% March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

Identity Services was established as a separate business unit in February 2018, with
an objective to lead the market for digital identity. This paper outlines the immediate
priorities for the new unit over the year ahead.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What is the opportunity and vision for Identity Services?

2. What is our product strategy for 2018/19?

3. How should we re-engineer our supplier ecosystem to support the delivery of our
strategy?

Conclusions

1. Digital identity is a major growth opportunity for the Post Office, with an estimated
addressable UK market in excess of £1.5bn pa (based on the costs of identity
checking under existing business models). While there are a broad range of
prospective players looking to take a slice of this profit pool, the competitive
advantages of the Post Office put it in a unique position to lead the market.

2. We see 2018/19 as a critical foundation year in this context, with an urgency to
accelerate customer acquisitions and launch the products that will enable us to
target new clients rapidly and cost effectively. We are proposing a c£8m
investment programme in eight priority projects to lay these foundations, which
will be reviewed via Investment Committee over the coming weeks and months.

3. While our existing contract with Digidentity has served us well since 2015, we now
need to re-engineer our supplier arrangements to align to the much broader
ambitions of our new strategy. We therefore propose an accelerated process of
negotiations with Digidentity and other short-listed suppliers over the next 3
months to establish new ‘backbone’ capabilities, but architected with flexibility to
evolve with other suppliers over time.

Input requested

The Board is asked to: a) provide any steers on the overall shape of the proposed
delivery programme for 2018/19, before specific funding requests are taken to IC;
and b) note the proposed negotiating approach with suppliers, indicating any
preferences between the different commercial models outlined in this paper.

1. The full year revenue budget for our existing GOV.UK Verify service is £10.5m in

2017/18 (£5.8m of profit contribution), which we exceeded five weeks before
year end. We expect to deliver 66% income growth over the full year. This strong
performance has been driven by three main factors:

a) successfully persuading HMRC to give more prominence to Verify for the
Self-Assessment peak in January, and backing this up by running our own
social media campaign targeted at self-employed small businesses;

b) product improvements to support more customers to complete the process
of assuring their identity, which have enabled us to maintain the best
conversion rates out of the seven Verify providers; and

c) the roll-out of Universal Credit and other new services such as online
criminal record checks, driving a significant increase in new registrations.

. At present our product is limited to the 15 government services connected to
Verify, with no private sector clients. Across the Verify federation there are
currently 2 million registered users - around 45% with Post Office - representing
just 4% of the UK adult population. The imperative for 2018/19 therefore is to
supplement the organic growth of Verify (budgeted to increase to £12.9m in
2018/19) with additional decisive actions to lay the foundations for our long-term
success, set out in further detail below.

The broader market opportunity and our vision for identity services
3. Across the economy there are a broad range of transactions which require

customers to prove their identity before they can access a service. These checks
are typically performed on a siloed basis, requiring customers to prove who they
are again and again relying primarily on physical documentation like passports,
driving licences and utility bills. The cost to the UK economy is estimated to be
at least £3bn pa, split between the direct cost borne the organisations performing
the checks and the indirect costs for customers. The table below summarises the
key areas of demand for high assurance identity services in the private sector.

Opportunity Transactions Costs (£m)
Bank account opening 2m 134
Travel (includes pre-flight checks and car hire) 78m 102
Age verification & retail >2,000m 557

4. Digital identity disrupts the traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) market by
providing individuals with an efficient and reusable means of proving who they
are according to recognised standards. Consumers benefit from increased
convenience and greater security and control of their personal data.
Organisations benefit from reduced acquisition costs and drop-out rates, creating
a substantial commercial opportunity for us to monetise.

5. The Post Office is uniquely well placed in the UK to lead the development of this
new market, building on our existing leading position under GOV.UK Verify. This
ambition - to lead the market for digital identity - is now reflected in the Post
Office’s overall North Star. Annex A provides the Identity Business Unit’s own
North Star to distil its vision and measures of success for the next three years.
The 3 Year Plan assumes £15m of net income growth from digital identity services
by 2020/21, on top of a baseline of £5.8m this year. Bottom-up modelling is
underway to chart a course to deliver these outcomes.

6. In pursuing this vision we need to contend with a broad range of competitors,
including:

a) the KYC Incumbents - Credit Reference Agencies provide much of the
data driven transactional identity market today. With the shift to consumer
owned identity this is a threat to their core business. At present they are
keeping an active interest in supporting the digital identity market to re-
purpose their operating model for data.

b) Payment Incumbents - MasterCard and Visa have experience of
integrating and creating interoperability across national borders and market
segments. With their market reach they have the ability and motivation to
own the infrastructure on which identity runs in much the same way.

Cc) Tech giants - Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and
WeChat all offer federated log in services. As they expand into more
regulated markets, such as payments, they have the ability to disrupt the
identity market through their customer and market penetration. The risk is
they do identity themselves; the opportunity is they look to be consumers
of digital identity.

d) Tech Challengers - The personal information economy has spurned some
well-funded start-ups such as Yoti, Digi.Me, Evernym. They currently lack
adopted standards or customer volume, though are pushing hard on both.

Product strategy for 2018/19

7. As indicated above, the UK digital identity market is still in its infancy, with the
Post Office currently only servicing the GOV.UK Verify market. Our ambition for
2018/19 therefore is to launch an identity product that works across a broader
range of channels and markets, positioning us firmly ahead of the competition.

POST OFFICE PAGE 4 OF 6

8. To achieve market penetration, we have set the following 2018/19 targets
underpinned by a c£8m project portfolio (see Annex B) driving the product build
and client acquisition.

i. Develop a market ready product: We will: a) develop our product on a
modularised rather than bespoke basis, enabling us to serve new clients quickly
and cost effectively; b) provide an extensible menu of identity checks,
continually evolving to meet increasing market and regulatory needs; c) enable
our service to be seamlessly integrated into customer on-boarding journeys;
and d) develop standardised contractual terms including limitation of liabilities.

ii. Prove the case internally: to build momentum and establish our credibility
with the external market we need to demonstrate that we have sufficient
confidence in our identity solution to use it for our own products and services.
We are embedding identity as one of the key horizontal capabilities in the
Customer Hub, starting with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks required
for travel money. This generates two-way benefits: accelerating growth in our
identity user base with up to 1 million additional registrations by 2020/21; and
providing the Customer Hub with one-click access to the 1 million ‘pre-qualified’
customers who have already registered for Verify. We are also developing plans
to embed our identity service into the vetting process for new Post Office
employees and postmasters, reducing our costs and increasing advocacy.

iii. Link branch and digital: our Verify service is currently a purely digital offering,
with no option for customer to register or use their identity across our branch
network. We are missing a major opportunity to accelerate adoption and
differentiate from our competitors. We are pursuing three initiatives in 2018/19
to rectify this: i) launching in-branch support of customer registration; ii) giving
customers of our new digital passport application the ability to create an identity
account as part of the service; and iii) introducing a digital notarisation service,
to replace the existing paper-based service, with the option for customers to
create a re-usable identity account as part of the process. We will equip counter
colleagues with the right sales messages to explain the benefits of a digital
identity account to customers, linking to both internal and external use cases
and testing incentives such as Travel Money Card credits. Based on the 18%
conversion rate which Australia Post have achieved for similar initiatives, this
has the potential to generate nearly 1 million additional users by 2020/21.

iv. Build the external market: our priority sectors for 2018/19 are: a) travel,
covering both Post Office travel products and external services such as car hire
and airline Advance Passenger Information; b) retail age-verification, leveraging
our existing relationships with retailers (including the Panther network) and self-
service kiosk manufacturers; and c) banking, co-ordinating efforts to influence
the regulators to recognise the use of digital identity to meet KYC requirements
and promoting our new digital notarisation service as a precursor product that
can reduce the need for banks to serve customers in their own branches.

Re-engineering the supplier ecosystem to support the delivery of our strategy

9. At present we have a very thin role in the digital identity value chain, essentially
just being a brand. We rely on our Dutch partner, Digidentity, to provide us with
an end to end identity service. This provided us with a low cost, low risk way to
enter the market, and has generated over £15m of cumulative net profit to date.

10.Our contract with Digidentity expires at the end of the calendar year. We are
now at an inflection point in our strategy and it is appropriate to review our
supplier arrangements to ensure we are set up for long-term success.

11.It is critical that our commercial relationship with our identity supplier(s) enables
us to move rapidly in the market and seamlessly integrate with the wider Post
Office digital architecture. To support this objective, we propose to re-engineer
our supplier arrangements based on four key design principles:

i. Closer control of customer experience - consistent with the approach
we are taking across the business, we need to fully own our customer -
brand, experience, data and interfaces.

ii. Modular flexibility - we need the flexibility to source ‘best of breed’
components on an evolving basis from multiple suppliers at competitive
rates.

iii. Continual innovation - the technology to support identity moves on at
Pace; as does the threat landscape for identity fraud and cybercrime. Our
supply chain must support continued innovation to address this rapidly
evolving environment. We need responsiveness and flexibility to meet our
ongoing market needs.

iv. ‘One team’ operating model - it is essential that we have close
alignment with our key suppliers, creating an agile, holistic and responsive
mode of working together with shared priorities for product innovation,
driven from market insight.

12.The technology and ‘manufacturing’ side of the digital identity market is relatively
well supplied, with a broad range of providers offering scalable capacity and a
steady stream of innovations in data and analytics. Over the past few months
we have met with over 20 of prospective suppliers, supported by desk-based
analysis of a longer list through our specialist consultants.

13.However, for the foreseeable future GOV.UK Verify remains our cornerstone
market and there are only six suppliers currently qualified to meet the specific
technical requirements set by Government: Avoco, Digidentity, Experian, GBG,
Idemia, and Verizon. Our principal supplier must therefore be one of these six
companies, while preserving the flexibility to add in others as our broader market
propositions evolve.

14.We have ruled out building the end-to-end solution in-house on the grounds that:
a) it will take at least 18 months to build an accredited solution so we would not

POL00027257
POL00027257

POST OFFICE PAGE 6 OF 6

have market-ready capabilities in place until 2020, by which time the key
opportunities will be lost; b) our design principle of continual innovation means
we need the flexibility to source the right technology from the market as it
emerges, rather than being encumbered with maintaining our own legacy,
custom technology.

15.To meet our design principles we need the right commercial construct with our
principal supplier. We have assessed four different models, with varying degrees
of direct ownership for Post Office:

a) a strategic alliance via a contractual relationship, with growth and
outcome based incentives for the supplier;

b) a technology joint venture, co-investing in a new entity which has a
primary mandate to provide services into Post Office’s identity business;

c) a market facing joint venture, giving our supplier a minority stake in
our identity business (set up as a subsidiary) in return for them injecting
technology and other assets; and

d) a partial or full acquisition of a supplier.

16.Inevitably those options which entail greater direct ownership of the technology
assets provide us with increased control and stronger alignment of incentives -
but with the trade-off that we either need to invest upfront (in options b and d)
or share more of our upside value (option c). Joint ventures and minority stakes
obviously also come with additional governance complexity.

17.As the table at Annex C sets out in more detail, these commercial models are not
equally applicable to all six of the short-listed companies. Based on our pre-
tender assessment, we view three lead options as the best fit strategically for
Post Office: a) a strategic alliance or joint venture with Digidentity; b) an
acquisition of Avoco; or c) a contractual arrangement with GBG. In all cases we
would propose sourcing the supplier via an SPV rather than direct from Post Office
Limited.

18.We are now commencing a 3-month accelerated procurement process inviting
the short-listed suppliers to participate in an evaluation of their technological
capability and commercial alignment to meet our design principles and product
needs. The technology assessment will be undertaken through a combination of
traditional due diligence activities and use-case based hackathons, providing a
better indication of technical competence, cultural alignment, speed and agility.

19.We expect to be in a position to make a firm recommendation to the Board by
July, setting out non-binding heads of terms and any additional investment
requirements.

POST OFFICE BOARD

Performance Review - Health and Safety

Authors: Martin Hopcroft Sponsor: Al Cameron Meeting date: 27" March 2018

Executive Summary

Context

1.1 Keeping our employees healthy and safe is fundamental to Post Office success. This is
reflected in the Post Office Board’s legal responsibilities and members of the board have
both collective and individual responsibility for health and safety.

1.2 Our Health & Safety performance has improved significantly in the past 6 years and we
have a rolling 3-year plan to drive compliance, targeting a reduction in safety metrics
including accidents; lost time accidents; days lost; and personal injury claims. Our H&S
reporting and safety management system is measured against the externally recognised
standard, OHSAS 18001. We also recognise the importance that wellbeing can play in
creating engaged and motivated employees.

Questions this paper addresses:

2.1 It has been agreed to provide a monthly performance report to the Board for noting
and a more in depth Health & Safety deep dive report 6 monthly.

Conclusion:

3.1 There has been a recent decrease in the total number of accidents and absence related

accidents reported by Directly Managed Branches during periods 10 and 11 following an increase

in December. Whilst the number of incidents year to date in Supply Chain are in line with

2016/17, the rate per 1000 employees has risen. Investigations have been undertaken and

accountabilities reviewed with a safety plan agreed for which includes the introduction of a Safety

Forum and Safety Champions. Other initiatives are being developed to strengthen a ‘hearts and

minds’ safety culture.

32 Benchmark data indicates that overall Post Office performance is favourable. HSL/HSE
have reported that the POL Safety Management System is very strong.

3.3 Road risk is being reduced through a number of initiatives in Supply Chain eg. Telemetry,
Alcolock, winter driving advice and online awareness training for those driving for work, including
those using personal cars for business.

3.4 Whilst CViT attacks remain lower, Post Office robberies have increased over the last 12
months, however, the trend has reversed and decreased over the last quarter. A number of
initiatives are being deployed in hot spot areas.

3.5 Due to an increase in violence across the industry, a review including a horizon scan of
risk across the industry and the Post Office is taking place and a report will be provided to PO
Board in May. This review will also look at the increase of violence and abuse from customers.

3.6 The overall level of Property risk is predominantly low. An Independent Assessment of
high risk building fabric (including signage) is complete, with remedial works completed in March.
Medium risk assessments have commenced and will be completed by April. Current property
statutory compliance is good at 96.70%.

a) A serious gas explosion took place at Harold Hill DMB on Sunday 4th March and was
reported in the local press. There were no injuries and no investigation by HSE or local
authority likely. A swift response from Operational teams and CBRE engineers who
completed gas, electric and structural surveys enabled the branch to reopen at 13:30
Monday. The collective view of the Fire Brigade, Police and engineers was that the cause
of explosion was likely to have been due to a gas cooker being left on with a low flame
that extinguished over the weekend, allowing a slow build-up of gas which was ignited
by an electric supply to the microwave LED, which was extensively damaged. Engineers
have been instructed to check all appliances at their next monthly maintenance visit,
remove all gas cookers from our branches asap. An instruction has been given to all

Strictly Confidential Health & Safety Report Mar 2018

POL-0023898
POL00027257
POL00027257

Managers that gas cookers must not be used if an alternative means of cooking is
available. There is no evidence of faulty kitchen appliances.

b) There was also a fire reported at Houndsditch DMB involving a Portable Heater. The site
was evacuated and the fire extinguished. The Fire Brigade were called and declared the
site safe and the fire risk assessment checked and passed. CBRE have been instructed
to remove all similar make and model heaters on the next monthly check, as well as
instructing all managers to check their heaters and report damage or wear and tear to
the Property helpdesk and not to leave heaters unattended at any time.

3.7. An independent audit with HSL / HSE has been undertaken to review the Post

Office Safety Management System. Initial feedback confirms that we have an excellent safety
management system in place with a focus from Group Executive to frontline. There are a few
areas to strengthen in order to reach best in class:

. Recognition - we should celebrate where we do this well and there should be greater
discussion, visibility and recognition communicated in team meetings and 121s

. Broader training - to raise competence across the business. Higher level health and
safety training to be provided where the risk is higher.

. Greater awareness and management of verbal abuse in stores. This is a general

area of concern for the HSE and an expectation that businesses will do more to
mitigate risk through training, support, policies, recording and monitoring of cases
to assess risk. Whilst we have a policy and training brief and we assess risk, our
approach should be reviewed and updated with more training for frontline
colleagues.
The Head of Health & Safety will receive a report and will circulate for discussion with GE in April,
prior to Post Office Board in May.

3.8 Absence data is not robust following migration to Success Factors but we expect to report
accurate year end data from the end of the month.
There has been a positive uptake of free flu vaccinations offered to Support Centre
and Supply Chain colleagues and early indications are that flu related absences are
below the current industry level.

° Mental health related absence remains the most common cause of long term
absence. Proactive activity includes ‘positive mental health awareness’ sessions for
colleagues, Mental Health Awareness Workshops for line managers and the
introduction of approx 50 Mental Health First Aiders who have received training to
provide proactive support to colleagues.

. The new Wellbeing portal has been linked to peoplehub and has now been formally
launched to bring all Occupational Health services together in one place to raise
colleague awareness. www.postoffice-wellbeing.com
