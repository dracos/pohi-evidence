1.0 31/08/06 Agreed

44 22/11/06 Amendment to tables 4 and 8, to describe the revised Branch I CP4298

and Counter Availability SLT’s for both the Post Office Critical
Period and the Post Office Core Day resulting from this change
in incident prioritisation

12 30/01/07 Review comments from V1.1 incorporated into document. As
agreed with Post Office Ltd, all faults in the Branch Telecom
infrastructure to be allocated A priority (2.3.3.1.4).

2.0 28/02/07 Issued for Approval

24 30/11/07 Branch Availability SLT Matrix added to the document. Branch
Availability Matrix has been updated to reflect updated as follows:
~ Remove references to SLT periods per year and calculations of
figures on an average SLT period basis. SLT %s are calculated
on a per annum basis, with these percentages applied to each
month — as agreed with Adam Martin.

- Base the SLTs on the MTBFs and number of
counters/branches as at April 2007. This gives constant SLT %s
which will only be updated when the MTBFs and number of
counters/branches in this calculation are updated.

SLTs have been removed from the document and the reader
referred to the branch availability matrix to view the SLTs. This is
due to the fact that during the network closure programme, the
SLTs will be changed on a quarterly basis.

1 Service Summary

1.1.The Branch Network Service is responsible, using appropriately trained operational staff, for
performing the day to day operational control and management of the following components of the
Branch Telecom Infrastructure:

(a) The Wide Area Network (WAN) for connected Branches, i.e. the connection between the
Branch Infrastructure and the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. This excludes BFPO where the
connection is provided by the local British Forces. PSTN and ISDN communication methods
will be withdrawn from 01% October 2017. Fujitsu Services will be providing new Bootloader
infrastructure (upon completion of required project activity to be agreed via Change Control)
to enable the personalisation of Sarian Branch Routers.

(b) The logical connection between the router and the telecommunications socket in the Branch.
(C) The logical connection between the POMS and the router in the branch.

(d) One connection to each of the two Computacenter Data Centres (Romford and Salford
Quays Manchester) to remotely manage the new Horizon Anywhere (end user compute
tower) branch computers.

(@) Provide network service and support to the Reference Data counters located in Winnersh.
This Service excludes the underlying PSTN line provided by Atos.

1.2. The Branch Network Service is based on remote unattended principles, i.e. monitoring that seeks to
minimise interruptions to the normal business operation of the Branch Infrastructure.

1.3.Communications Incidents can be identified by either the Branch or Fujitsu Services following
monitoring of the Branch Telecom Infrastructure.

1.4.All Branches will be equipped with a backup network based upon mobile communications via the
2G/3G router. The use of this backup resilient network will be dependent upon a 2G/3G signal being
available.

1.5.The Branch Network Service is responsible for the measurement and reporting of Branch and
Counter Availability Service Level Targets (SLTs), which will include the effect of Branch Telecom
Infrastructure, Central Telecom Infrastructure and HNG-X Central Infrastructure Incidents.

1.6. The Branch Network Service is also responsible for the measurement and reporting of the call to fix
SLT in respect of Branch Telecom Infrastructure faults (as set out in Table 3 below).

1.7. Transitional Support Service (TSS)

e It shall be noted that, the inclusion of Branch Network Services as a Transitional Support Service
was not included in the Belfast Refresh Programme contracted for under CT1250b. It is
acknowledged that it is unclear at the date of CCN 1400 what refresh activities may be required
(if any) as a number of factors are outside both Parties’ control.

e Fujitsu Services shall prepare a comprehensive report (the Branch Network Service Study
Report SVM/SDM/FSR/2417) in accordance with (and subject to) the provisions of paragraph
1.3.2e) of Schedule B3.3.

e For elements of the Branch Network Service that are not covered by the components referenced
in the BNS Report, Fujitsu Services will continue to deliver Branch Network Service to the
current Service Levels assuming there is no change in availability of the existing third party
services. If there is a change to the current availability of these services then this would
constitute a Change and managed via the Change Control Procedure on the principle that any
remedial work to replace or upgrade the third party service and/or impacted elements of the
Services shall be chargeable to Post Office in accordance with the Rate Card or as agreed
between the Parties. To the extent to which such elements directly cause a failure to the Branch
Network Service prior to implementation of the Change, then Fujitsu Services shall not be liable
and an appropriate adjustment to the service level performance shall be made.

2.3.2 Service Level Relief

Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing its obligations
and Post Office shall have no right to action against Fujitsu Services in respect of the following:

e any failure of services outside the scope of the contracted Services save to the extent that
such failure has been directly caused by Fujitsu Services (such failure not itself arising as a
result of matters referred to in this section 2.3.2). Calculations of SLTs and liquidated
damages shall specifically exclude the period of time during an Incident where a resolution
action is with a Post Office third party to resolve.

or where an incident relating to the Branch Telecom Infrastructure has been logged in
accordance with section 2.1.1.2 of this Branch Network Service, Service Description and
Fujitsu Services is unable to resolve the Incident due to any of the reasons set out in the

2.3.5 Service Levels for which Liquidated Damages Apply

2.3.5.1 Counter Availability

The Counter Availability SLT is measured across the network of Counter Positions. The Counter
Availability metric is defined as the number of Counter Position hours available as a proportion of the
maximum number of Counter Position hours available based upon the Post Office Core Day and the
Post Office Critical Periods described in this Branch Network Service, Service Description. The reviewed
Counter Availability metric will be reported monthly in arrears.

The Management Information Service will extract data from the Fujitsu Services Incident Management
System to show all Branch Telecom Infrastructure, Central Telecom Infrastructure and HNG-X Central
Infrastructure faults logged for the Branch and closed on the previous Post Office Core Day, as defined
in section 2.1.4 2.4 of this Branch Network Service, Service Description. .

The Management Information Service will match this data against the Fujitsu Services view of the status
of each Counter Position. This will establish if the Counter Position was Unavailable during the Post
Office Core Day and Post Office Critical Periods. The relevant Unavailable time within the period for the
duration of the Incident will be used to calculate the Counter Availability SLTs.

The monthly Counter Availability Service Level Targets for the Post Office Critical Periods and the Post
Office Core Day are calculated by subtracting the total Counter Unavailability in respect of each Failure
Event that occurred in the period (the date of occurrence being deemed for this purpose to be the date
on which the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident Closure Process, as defined in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 — “POA Operations Incident Management Procedure”) from the maximum number
of Counter Position hours available in the period.

The targets set out in Table 1 above are calculated on the basis that Fujitsu Services is providing the
CMT Service. If the CMT Service ceases, the SLTs set out above will be reduced. The Agreement shall
be amended in accordance with the Change Control Procedure to give effect to this change. Liquidated
Damages Threshold for the Counter Availability SLT

(1) Subject to sections 2.3.6.2 (2) and (3) below, the liquidated damages for failure to meet the
Counter Availability SLT in a month shall be calculated by:

(a) adding together the Counter Unavailability in respect of each Failure Event that occurred in the
month (the date of occurrence being deemed for this purpose to be the date on which the Failure
Event is closed in accordance with the Incident Closure Process, as defined in SVM/SDM/PRO/0018
- “POA Operations Incident Management Procedure’);

(b) Deducting the Monthly Allowance from the total in (a); Where Monthly Allowance means the
‘Network and Local Allowance per Counter Position per calendar month’ shown in column 4 of Table
2 multiplied by the average number of Counter Positions in use during the relevant month, excluding
Counter Training Offices, Test Offices and BFPO sites. This Monthly Allowance is the allowable
downtime per Counter Position used to calculate the threshold of Counter Position downtime allowed
before liquidated damages start to be payable. At the end of each calendar month, any unused
Monthly Allowance shall expire and shall not be rolled over into the next month.

and

(c) Multiplying the remainder by the liquidated damages payable specified in the column entitled
“Liquidated Damages payable per hour or part thereof in excess of Network and Local Allowance per
Counter Position per calendar month” shown in column 5 of Table 2 .

(b) if the value of the liquidated damages for a Failure Event which gives rise to a Network Wide
Failure would be in excess of £400,000 then:

(i) Fujitsu Services shall have the right to not count its Counter Unavailability towards the
Counter Availability SLTs in respect of such Failure Event if it so notifies Post Office in
writing. In such cases, the Counter Unavailability shall not be deducted from the Counter
Availability SLTs in respect of that Failure Event; and

(ii) Only £400,000 shall be counted towards the liquidated damages payable for that month in
respect of that Failure Event.

(3) Unavailability is only counted once, so that for so long as a Counter Position is rendered
Unavailable by a Failure Event it shall not be counted in calculating the number of Counter
Positions affected by a second Failure Event.

(4) Liquidated damages will be reported, measured and agreed monthly and paid quarterly in
arrears.

2.3.6 Service Levels for which Liquidated Damages Do Not
Apply
