Denise ,

This was one of my offices . Generally it is not a bad office and the Subpm would be positive . The
office conforms to standards but in my recollection the QPA performance would not have been great .
In saying that the gir! mainly responsible for the office has now left so I may consider allowing this write
off without prejudice to any future problems .

items that have been tested by the auditors on this occasion and the findings
revealed at audit.

Appendix A contains a more comprehensive report detailing our findings and
recommendations for your information and attention. Any control gaps in bold
were noted on a previous audit and had not been actioned at the time of our most
recent visit.

At the audit, you were given a questionnaire to provide feedback on the audit
process. If there is anything else you wish to bring to our attention please feel
free to write your comments on the reverse of this report or contact Paul Large,
Network Audit Manager on telephone number

Please retain one of these reports for your information and return the other one,

“an essential part of everyday life” www.postoffice.co.uk
Dear Mrs McKelvey

Your letter requesting write off authority has been forwarded to me for
consideration.

Your office was audited on 18" April 2001. At this time, it was recommended
that obsolete stock (including commerative coins) should be returned
immediately to Hemel Hempstead. However, your letter states that you
attempted to remit coins on 10" October 2001.

In view of the above facts I am unable to issue write off authority on this
occasion. This decision is final and in accordance with Counter News
Workaid 19 you must make good the resulting shortage of £120.00 at the
next cash account ( i.e.week number 33).

Please confirm your acceptance by signing both copies of this letter. One
copy to be retained at your office and the other returned to myself in the
enclosed envelope.

Yours faithfully
