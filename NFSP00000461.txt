A/1 REPORTS AND RESOLUTIONS of the . I
Executive Council Meeting held on 4, 5, 6 January 1998
The Report had been circulated and was APPROVED.
A/2 MATTERS ARISING FROM THE REPORTS
There were no matters arising.
A/3. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE
The minutes of the meeting of the Negotiating Committee held on 26/27th February 1998
had been circulated, The Negotiating Committee had also met on numerous occasions with ¢

Post Office Counters and verbal reports would be given during the report.

1 POST OFFICE BOARD - PO BD

MR BURROWS, Chairman of the Negotiating Committee, reported that the appointment of
Dr. Neville Bain as Chairman of The Post Office was announced in the press on 4th March
1998, at which date a letter of congratulations had been sent to him. An invitation had been
sent to Dr. Bain to speak at the opening of the Federation's Annual Conference in
Bournemouth. During the course of the meeting a letter was received in which Dr. Bain
declined the invitation to address the 1998 Annual Conference.

A series of meetings with the Strategy Director for the Corporation, Vanessa Leeson, had
been organised by the General Secretary so that the Federation would have a voice direct to
the Corporate Board as well as the one put forward by the Counters Business,

2 GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS _- PO PZ
2(a) GOVERNMENT REVIEW fd
- INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

Post Offices had received a clear reference to handling ISAs in the Chancellor of the
Exchequer's statement in the House of Commons on 17th March 1998. No doubt that was
due in part to the pressure by the Federation on behalf of the Post Office and the fact that
Stuart Sweetman met with Gerald Robinson the day before the Budget to pursue the
Counters cause.

= THE MINIMUM WAGE - LOW PAY COMMISSION

The Government had not yet announced the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission had
enquired whether the Federation would be willing to be listed in the report as having given
evidence to the Submission and whether the evidence could be published. An affirmative
response had been sent and once again the Federation had made itself available to the Low
Pay Commission should further information be required.

2 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING « MARCH 1998
NFSP00000461
NFSP00000461

> THE POST OFFICE INQUIRY - TRADE & INDUSTRY COMMITTEE

It would appear from speculation in the press that the Government was soon to advise in
which direction it intended to take the Post Office. It seemed that the “Heseltine solution of
partial sell off for Roya! Mail and Parcelforce” was being trailed in the press which could be
inspired leaks. Pressure had been maintained on the Government and the Federation had
written once again to lan McCartney seeking a meeting. lan McCartney had responded
stating he would be pleased to meet the Federation again but shortly after the announcement
of the next stage of the Review which was expected to be In the next few weeks. Some
important signals could be taken from the correspondence dated 11th February received
from Margaret Beckett which seemed to come out fairly strongly in support of post offices,
particularly sub post offices and the part they played in the commercial infra-structure of the
country, An item reported under the Horizon debate could also be taken as a positive signal
that John Denham MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Social Security would be
attending Conference. That correspondence stated the value of the strong links between the
Government and the Department. Regrettably a reply was awaited to the Federation's letter
to Tony Blair MP an acknowledgement of which was received on 12th February. Contact had
been made again with Number 10 Downing Street seeking a considered response.

3 POST OFFICE COUNTERS
3(a) POST OFFICE COUNTERS BOARD - PO PC 02

Nothing to report.

3(b) ORGANISATION DEVELOPMENT - PO PC 03 i

Correspondence had been circulated, including a resourcing map of the Internal
Communications Department and the proposals to reduce the number of publications. Links
would be maintained with the Board of Post Office Counters as plans for the Counters
Business, both with the Government and within the Corporation were developed.

6 HUMAN RESOURCES
6(a) TRAINING FOR SUBPOSTMASTERS - PC HR 04

As Indicated in the minutes, the Negotiating Committee had received information about a
trial in the South East Region of a training programme for newly appointed Sub-Postmasters
which was a mixture of classroom and on-site training. The Committee would be considering
the trial and Sub-Postmasters’ training in general at its next meeting. It would be helpful If
Executive Officers could provide details of the training package currently offered to new Sub-
Postmasters in each of their Regions. Mr N, Bradbrook and Mr D. Evans were thanked for
providing information to Headquarters,

7 MAILWORK_- PC MP

The matter of an increase for Mailwork Sub-Postmasters which was due on 1st November
1997 had not yet been resolved, A reminder letter had been sent and Post Office Counters
had been advised in meetings that the Federation was keen to negotiate and resolve the
matter.

Concern was expressed at the delay in receipt of replies from Mr. Granville, That
concern was shared by the Negotiating Committee which listed at its last meeting a
number of outstanding items. It was pointed out that Mr. Granville was vastly
overloaded with work and did not have quality resources to assist him.

MR EDMONDSON advised of the action by Royal Mail to concentrate mailwork in
the Doncaster and York areas which would affect approximately 15 sub offices.
Post Office Counters had no idea of mailwork local unit specifications.

MR BURROWS drew attention to the Negotiating Committee minutes which
reported the Mailwork Sub-Committee had met on 26th January 1998 whereat 26
action points had been identified, including the rationalisation programme in the
Durham area and the events in the North East Region. Mr Granville had sent ¢
Carolyn Ratcliffe and Evan Elliott to visit and ascertain the mailwork situation in the
North East Region where it appeared Post Office Counters was very lackadaisical
protecting mailwork offices. That activity did not appear to be taking place in other
Regions. In North Thames and East Anglia Region it was known that £80,000 was
being spent on a Sub-Postmaster’s mailwork office and that other investment was in

the pipeline.

MR BURROWS explained Post Office Counters needed designated Mailwork
members of staff properly trained in aspects of mailwork processes in sub offices.
The Federation was endeavouring to ensure at least one Retail Network Manager
was trained per cluster, but Retail Network Managers were moved around and the
replacement was not trained.

8 NETWORK
8(a) NETWORK FORUMS - PC NW 04

- COUNTERS CLUB

The correspondence of 15th January indicated the current position of Counters Club. Other
initiatives being acted by Post Office Counters Included a trial of business post offices. One
post office in the South West, namely Prince Street Branch Office, Bristol, was participating
in the trial involving activity around 5 themes: training products and service portfolio,
environment, marketing and research. It was intended that the post office would offer
services to smaller and medium enterprises In the vicinity of this particular office. The Post
Office had indicated it was prepared to discuss this matter with the Federation, which would
be encouraged as part of the Network Reviews.

Other initiatives were being discussed with Post Office Counters, mainly:-

Equipment / open plan trials

Network transformation / Conformance

Combination stores and, of course, Horizon.

Clearly that illustrated the many separate initiatives and in the Network meetings Post Office
Counters was being advised of the Federation's concerns at the number of initiatives.

8(b) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW 06 04

The minutes of the Negotiating Committee reflected the situation which existed at the time. 5
There had been a great deal of press speculation about the future of the Horizon Platform {
and that speculation was growing. Intelligence sources were still saying that the Benefit :
Agency would like to be disengaged from the project and concentrate on ACT and an

updated ALPs style of fraud detection. Everyone In Post Office Counters, the Corporation

and ICL Pathway were involved in keeping the Government interested in Horizon and the

Federation was fully involved with all of those and the DTI, The news that John Denham MP

would be at Conference was an excellent signal of commitment and his interest must be

maintained.

The..GENERAL SECRETARY commented the press reports were predominantly

true, with Government Computing containing leaks from the Benefits Agency. If the

Government pulled out of the Horizon Platform then ICL Pathway would go out of

business. The following questions had been put in the House of Commons on 25th

February 1998 to the Secretary of State for Social Security by Mrs Gwyneth

Dunwoody MP:-

(i) what progress her Department was making with the introduction of the
computerised social security benefits system in post offices?

(ii) what was the target date for all post offices to be connected to the
computerised social security system?

(iii), how many post offices she planned to be connected to the computerised social
security system In the next 12 months, and how many were currently
connected?

(iv) what assessment she had made of the service provided by ICL to introduce the
computerised social security system into post offices?

The answer given by John Denham MP was that 205 post offices in the South West

and North East of England were paying child benefit by payment card as part of the

Horizon Platform. All post offices would be automated by the end of the year 2000.

Current plans would extend the trial to 305 offices early in 1999. The Benefits

Agency and Post Office Counters routinely monitored and assess performance of

the new system before a national introduction. The GENERAL SECRETARY

cautioned that use of the phrase “current plans” was Parliamentary speak for “could
be changed".

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - MARCH 1998 5

MR. BRADBROOK pointed out that if the ALPS system was updated, that would
release into the Provinces London APT machines which only needed software to
enable them to be up and running.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY explained that when automation was functioning in
10% of the network Post Office Counters would have to sign up with Pathway.
Pathway had put forward the same view as London Sub-Postmasters, that with an
adjustment, the existing equipment could be used. Post Office Counters’ staff were
fooking at the question outside of Pathway. ICL Pathway had asked the Treasury
for £100,000 and requested the Benefits Agency to extend the length of contract
from 5 years to 8 years which would mean extending the Horizon PFI from 5 to 10
years, ICL had also gone back to Fujitsu for more money.

MR BURROWS stated that since the January Executive Council meeting a lot of
work had taken place below the surface. Various questions had been asked in
Select Committees and the Government. The General Secretary and he operated
in the War Cabinet with Post Office Counters.

The GENERAL SECRETARY stressed the difficulty experienced by Pathway with
regard to modifications to the system. Pathway wanted Sub-Postmasters to
contribute towards the cost. At the moment it was important to tell Post Office
Counters and Pathway that Sub-Postmasters were not offering anything towards
the cost; The Rt. Hon. Peter Lilley MP had stated the automation system would be
provided free.

8(c) AUTOMATED PAYMENT TERMINALS - PC NW 06 02

Written confirmation of the decision to provide a further 2000 APTs into the network was
received in the letter dated 26th February 1998, Although it would be easy to state that it
was too little too late, it, nevertheless, represented an important step in fighting the
competition providing 85% of automated bill payment being delivered electronically. The
Negotiating Committee raised this with the CEC in October 1997 and had never given up
arguing for them. Some credit must, therefore, go to the Federation, although its contribution
would never be publicly acknowledged.

8(d) COUNTER AUTOMATION - ALPS - PC NW 06 07
- GOODWILL PAYMENT FOR SUB-POSTMASTERS

MR DARVILL commented that the ALPs equipment had saved the Benefits Agency
£30,000,000. Sub-Postmasters received a contribution towards electricity costs for
lottery terminals. London Sub-Postmasters no longer received £10.00 for each
book impounded.

The GENERAL SECRETARY stated Post Office Counters did not pay electricity for
Camelot lottery terminals. The Benefits Agency wanted the ALPs system as it was
capable of providing the service required. It had been agreed to pursue a goodwill
payment for London Sub-Postmasters, but the timing was wrong. The GENERAL
SECRETARY repeated the comments contained in the debate under 8(b) apropos
Pathway. It had been accepted that the likelihood of payment for electricity was
Negligible upon implementation of the new system.

6 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - MARCH 1998

NFSP00000461
NFSP00000461
NFSP00000461
NFSP00000461

MR DARVILL pointed out that if London Sub-Postmasters did not use the machines
correctly, Post Office Counters sought repayment. Sub-Postmasters received
notification to pay one and impound the book; irate customers demanded the return
of the book which could then be used for fraudulent purposes.

MR BRADBROOK stated all books had to be bar-coded, every transaction had to be
bar-coded and read on the monitor. Forgers changed the whole face of pension
books. The monitors were hot as were the computers underneath the desk. All that
was being asked was a payment.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY pointed out the decision as to the timing was the
responsibility of the Executive Council and suggested it be deferred. He asked from
whom the money was sought - it cost Post Office Counters £14 million - or the
Benefits Agency who saved the money? He asked the Executive Council members
if they advocated the Federation approaching the Benefits Agency for a goodwill
payment to London Sub-Postmasters at the current time.

MR BRADBROOK stated Sub-Postmasters spend a lot of money to keep the
machinery running and were only seeking a small payment.

MR JANNETTA commented Sub-Postmasters would have to pay their own
electricity bills.

12(a) TERMINATION PROCEDURES - PC SC

Although there was no correspondence on this subject, it was felt that the time may well have
come to agree the proposals put to the Federation tast year and argue about the remaining
paragraph when the difficulties affecting It were over. The delay was due to a possible Court
case. It was hoped to receive a letter from Post Office Counters regarding Paragraph 11
which would enable Conference at Bournemouth to be advised of the new termination
procedures.

MR DARVILL advised the case in question was that of Mr. Coney who had
deposited £100,000 in order to take Post Office Counters to Court. Post Office
Counters had deposited £27,000 with the Court. There were several other
outstanding cases, one being Mr. Sedani of Princesfield PO. He was not happy
with the termination procedure as very often an appeal had been decided
beforehand and suggested an independent outside appeal.

The GENERAL SECRETARY pointed out the new procedures, particularly ¢

Paragraph 11 referred to repayment of money to Sub-Postmasters upon
reinstatement. Mr. Coney was seeking the return of money not paid during his
suspension. The difficulties explained by Mr. Darvill would be addressed.

¢ THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AGREED to accept the draft Termination
Procedures, excluding Paragraph 11.

12(d) PAYPOINT - PC SC 21 014

PayPoint was still increasing its outlets in spite of reports about the dissatisfaction of their
agents. PayPoint seemed to be ‘gilding the lily" considerably by promising clients a full
network of around 8,000 outlets by 1998. There was no doubt that they were having an
effect on Post Office volumes in the areas where they had a presence. Sub-Postmasters
generally would wish to see Post Office Counters fight back a little more aggressively.
However, some regions seemed better prepared than others, On a related issue the Office
of Fair Trading was examining into Post Office Counters following a complaint made by
PayPoint.

The GENERAL SECRETARY indicated the situation was potentially very serious. It
was believed that PayPoint and Scottish Power were arguing that the Post Office
was in restraint of trade by not allowing Sub-Postmasters to handle the Scottish
Power work. The Office of Fair Trading had put 33 questions to the Post Office
which had been passed to which Mr. Granville for reply. It was expected the
Federation might be called. If the Office of Fair Trading determined the Post Office
was in restraint of contract it would mean Sub-Postmasters could work for PayPoint
as well as Post Office Counters, likewise the Gas Board as well as Post Office
Counters, etc. Therefore the clients would cut out Post Office Counters and
approach Sub-Postmasters direct and if that movement continued Post Office I
Counters would cease. That would effectively affect the strength of what singled
Sub-Postmasters out from other High Street outlets, that of being tied together
under a strong brand image. He urged the Council to retain the line always held,
that the restrictions in the contract held the sub post office network together. If the
Office of Fair Trading lifted restrictions, then the Federation would maximise the
opportunity and operate its own brand. Attention was drawn to the previous advice
from Legal Counsel not to challenge the restrictions as Sub-Postmasters would lose
their strength.

12(e) NIPOC - PC SC 28

The letter dated 19th March 1998 from Mr J. Legg of Post Office Counters had been
circulated together with Mr P. Bloor’s notes of 20th March 1998.

MR EDMONDSON asked whether an explanation had been received as to why it
had taken so long to effect the re-payments for 1992/93.

MR MORGAN JONES confirmed the NIPOC payments were being made. He
wondered who would compensate Sub-Postmasters for the interest lost on
investments?

The GENERAL SECRETARY stated Mr Bloor had done excellent work with regard
to NIPOC. With regard to compensation, he pointed out John Roberts had
promised that Sub-Postmasters would not lose out and, if necessary, the matter
would be referred to John Roberts.

13 SUBPOSTMASTERS PAY
13(a) PAY REVIEW - PC SP

Contact had been made with Emma Watson of Hartley McMaster who accepted that a
greater trawl of Sub-Postmasters was required. It was essential that the element of the pay
review was completed and as seen by the draft pay letter to be discussed next on the
agenda, the Federation was raising the matter again.

The position as outlined at the January 1998 Executive Council meeting still applied.
Pressure was being maintained with the Managing Director and the CEC to pursue and
resolve the potential serious position.

MR BROADWITH reported Sub-Postmasters in the South West who participated in /
the Horizon trials were being blackmailed by holiday reliefs who charged £50.00 per
day to run the office. There was a need to shop around and find reliefs who would
do the job at a reasonable price.

information. It pointed out the seriousness of the current situation and the damage which had
already been caused to Sub-Postmasters' business and urged POCL to treat the matter with
urgency as there was a need to make prompt progress.

promote a speedy response when decisions were time-crucial.

However, Executive Officers felt that there needed to be debate so that all sides of

corporate/multiple membership. j

PUBLIC RELATIONS AND SU8-EDITORSHIP OF "SUBPOSTMASTER"

Tim Cobb’s post as Sub-Editor and the recommendations regarding the relationship
with Management Advisory and a case where a Sub-Postmaster seemed to have
been given the wrong advice, MR HEASMAN said he would be grateful to have the
relevant information. Mr Abraham himself dealt with employer/employee advice,
whereas IRPS dealt with aspects of Health and Safety and most of the letters
received at Federation Headquarters indicated praise of the service received.

« There was to be a review of the operation of the Helpline and papers
would be circulated to Executive Officers in good time for the October
