                           POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                              FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT
                                    OF BRIAN ALTMAN




I, BRIAN ALTMAN KC, barrister, of 2 Bedford Row, London, WC1R 4BU, will say as

follows:




  1.       I am a barrister practising from Chambers at the above address. I was called

           to the Bar by Middle Temple in July 1981. I was appointed Junior Treasury

           Counsel in 1997, Senior Treasury Counsel in 2002, and I was appointed First

           Senior Treasury Counsel between 2010 and 2013. I have been a Recorder of

           the Crown Court since 2002, I am a Bencher of Middle Temple, and I am the

           current joint Head of Chambers at 2 Bedford Row, London.

  2.       This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

           (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 31

           October 2023 (the "Request").

                                                                                              WITN10350100
                                                                                         WITN10350100




  3.   Following my confirmation of the receipt of the Request by email on 31

       October 2023, on the same day I emailed the Inquiry Legal Team for express

       confirmation that Post Office Limited ("POL"), my client, had waived Legal

       Professional Privilege as regards the matters with which I am asked to deal

       in the Request. On 7 November 2023, I received an email from the Inquiry

       Legal Team "that POL has waived privilege over matters which you have

       been asked to deal with in your rule 9 request". The email from the Inquiry

       Legal Team also drew my attention to the extent of POL's agreed waiver and

       the Chair's response to it of 16 November 2021.



Background

  4.   I have been asked to set out how I first became instructed by POL in relation

       to the issues being addressed by the Inquiry, including but not limited to

       relevant dates, names of individuals who instructed me and the nature of any

       initial instructions. Before I do that, it is important to explain that from between

       2013 and 2021, different firms of solicitors acting for POL instructed me as an

       independent member of the Bar to advise on a number of discrete topics on

       which my advice was sought on areas of law and practice within my field of

       practice and expertise.

  5.   I was first instructed on behalf of POL in July 2013 by Gavin Matthews, then

       a partner of the Southampton office of Bond Dickinson ("BD"), later Womble

       Bond Dickinson ("WBD"). I later received instructions from Herbert Smith

       Freehills ("HSF") to advise on various discrete areas.

  6.   Between 2020 and 2021, I was instructed by Peters & Peters ("P&P") to

                                        Page 2 of 53
                                                                                           WITN10350100
                                                                                      WITN10350100




     represent POL's interests before the Court of Appeal Criminal Division

     ("CACD") as leading counsel in a series of references brought by the Criminal

     Cases Review Commission ("CCRC") in respect of 42 subpostmasters.

7.   I do not specially recall the nature of the approach to my clerks or of any initial

     instructions at that early stage. However, by reference to point 2 in paragraph

     4 of the Altman General Review document [POL00006803_0003], on 23

     September 2013, I received from Gavin Matthews the final Terms of

     Reference for [POL00006803_0004] by email. I believe these had been

     drafted by BD. I reviewed and agreed them by return email the following day,

     having, on 2 August 2013, refined an earlier draft in writing. The reference in

     [POL00006803_0004] is, I believe, a reference to my observations document

     - Terms of Reference for the Appointment of Brian Altman QC

     [POL00006804]. I have taken the final Terms of Reference for the

     Appointment of Brian Altman QC for this workstream to be [POL00040044],

     albeit these Terms of Reference are undated. I set out below the nature of

     the Terms of Reference and my instructions.

8.   I inserted those Terms of Reference into the body of the Altman General

     Review [POL00006803_0001-0003] and they formed my instructions for that

     first workstream.

9.   The second but allied workstream at that time resulted in the Altman Review

     of the Prosecution Role [POL00006802] dated 19 December 2013. I note the

     Terms of Reference in the index of documents to this Request

     [POL00040036], which are in draft. The final Terms of Reference which

     formed my instructions for this workstream were inserted into the body of the

     Altman Review of the Prosecution Role [POL00006802_0001-0002].

                                                                                      WITN10350100




  10_ I am asked to what extent, if any, I was instructed, asked or encouraged to

         provide general advice to POL in respect of Horizon issues (i.e., outside of

         specific instruction for advice to be produced within a particular period on

         identified issues). My attention has been invited, by way of example, to

         [POL00065929] which is an email in which I provided my views on the content

         of a Panorama Programme.

  11. The Request dates the programme as in 2016. The programme was, I believe,

         broadcast on 17 August 2015. My email to Andrew Parsons (then a managing

         associate of the Southampton office of BD), which is dated 28 August 2015,

         [POL00065929], was sent in a thread of emails bearing the subject line "Post

         Office Balancing Transactions". The email indicates I had been alerted to and

         had viewed the programme, and volunteered views on it in the email in which,

         in the first line, I responded to Andrew Parsons' request in his email to me of

         27 August 2015. I now have no recollection of how or why I was alerted to

         the programme. To the best of my knowledge, I was never asked or

         encouraged to provide general advice to POL in respect of Horizon issues

         outside of specific instruction for advice, and I cannot now recall any other

         specific examples of my having done so.




Altman     Interim   Review     FPOL000068011 and            Altman   General   Review

fPOL000068031

  12. I have already outlined how the instruction for this workstream came about.

         My    substantive    instructions    for      the   Altman   Interim   Review

         [POL00006801_0001] were "to provide an interim review of Cartwright King's

         current process". My substantive instructions for the Altman General Review

         [POL00006803_0001-0002] were, in summary: (1) by 5 August 2013, to
                                        Page 4 of 53
                                                                                       WITN10350100
                                                                                  WITN10350100




    prepare an interim review of Cartwright King's ("CK") current review process

    (this was the interim review); (2) to review, and advise, POL, in writing, on or

    by a date to be agreed but then intended to be no later than 15 October 2013,

    on (a) its strategy and process for reviewing past and current criminal

    prosecutions in light of Second Sight's Interim Report of 8 July 2013 and/or

    on the role of Gareth Jenkins and his impact on any possible appeals; (b) its

    response to the CCRC, and any subsequent action required by it in dealing

    with, or responding to, any actual or potential appeals and/or in reaching the

    appropriate resolution of any CCRC investigation, and to advise POL about

    any further steps that may be required as regards any actual or potential

    appeals against conviction; and (3) the identification of any flaws in the

    process of, or from the evidence arising from, the review of a statistically

    significant number of past prosecutions in which Horizon had been an issue

    in the proceedings.

13. My instructions as outlined in the Terms of Reference were also to meet, or

    personally report to, the Post Office Audit Committee or the Board, at the first

    available opportunity, to (1) explain the background to the criminal appeal

    process including appeals, and how I intended to fulfil my remit; and (2) on

    the efficacy of the process set out above; and (3) on or by a date to be agreed,

    but then intended to be no later than 15 October 2013, to report on the efficacy

    of past prosecutions including the preparation and conduct of past

    prosecutions set out above.

14. I had delivered the Altman Interim Review [POL00006801] by or on 2 August

    2013 and I had delivered the Altman General Review [POL00006803] on or

    by the date intended by the final Terms of Reference (15 October 2013) which

    are set out in [POL00006803_0001-0003]. The first draft of those Terms of

                                                                                   WITN10350100




    Reference, which I take to be the Draft Terms of Reference for the

     Appointment of Brian Altman QC [POL00021982], has been supplied to me

     in the index of documents to this Request. Those Draft Terms of Reference

     are dated 9 August 2013 in the index to the Request, albeit the document itself

     is undated. [POL00021982] gives the date by which I was to prepare the

    Interim Review as 5 August 2013, and it gave an unspecified date in October

    2013 as the date by which I was to review and advise POL in writing on the

    matters thereafter set out.

15. I am asked to explain any delays between instruction and finalisation of the

     Terms of Reference. I set out my observations on the Terms of Reference as

     early as 2 August 2013 (see my observations document on the Terms of

    Reference for the Appointment of Brian Altman QC [POL00006804]). In

    footnote 4 to [POL00006804_0003], I queried the precise focus of my

     instruction.

16. I have been provided with an email dated 9 August 2013 from Gavin Matthews

     to Susan Crichton, Rodric Williams, Hugh Flemington and others

     [POL00021980], to which I was not joined, and which I do not believe I have

     seen previously. The email shows that Gavin Matthews and Simon

    Richardson (a former partner of BD, I believe) advised POL that I should not

     report on the safety of past convictions, because it would, in their view, delay

    my report and potentially blur the boundary between my and CK's respective

     roles. It appears from [POL00006803 0004] that I received the final Terms

     of Reference on 23 September 2013 from Gavin Matthews.

17. Thus, albeit there was some delay between instruction and finalisation of the

     Terms of Reference, the work I was commissioned to do was delivered by the

     due date.

18. I am asked to detail meetings I had with POL as part of my investigations and

    who I met.

       (1) There was a meeting on 9 September 2013, at my Chambers, which

            from POL included Susan Crichton, who I believe was the General

            Counsel at that time, Rodric Williams and Jarnail Singh, who were

            POL lawyers, as well as lawyers from CK and BD. The Note of

            Conference with Brian Altman QC [POL00006769]has assisted me in

            recalling the meeting.       This meeting is also referred to at

            [POL00006803_0003, _0035 and _0052]. Those references also

            detail some of what we discussed.

       (2) I undertook Horizon training between 10am and 2pm on 19 September

            2013 at Guildford Counter Training Office. There I met Chris Gilding

            (Network Support team Leader) who trained me and Andy Holt

            (Business Relationship Manager). The training is referred to at

            [POL00006803_0004]. I would not otherwise have had any

            recollection of who I met there. I believe, but could be wrong about it,

            that Gavin Matthews was in attendance.

       (3) My work record (i.e., time sheet) [WITN10350105_0005] shows that

            there was a telephone conference on 4 October 2013 with Gavin

            Matthews, CK and POL lasting 30 minutes. This meeting is also

            referred to at [POL00006803_0027 and _0042]. These references

            show that I spoke to Rodric Williams and Jarnail Singh, together with

            Simon Clarke of CK and Gavin Matthews, to discuss issues

            surrounding the start date for CK's review and the extent to which CK

            should be involved in exercising a supervisory function over the

            criminal cases going to mediation (as to which, see paragraph 26(6)
                                    Page 7 of 53
                                                                                          WITN10350100
                                                                                     WITN10350100




             below).

        (4) At [POL00006803_0004], I wrote "at the time of writing I have not

             identified (or had identified to me) any other persons to meet and

             interview as part of a fact-finding exercise as relevant to the process

             of the investigation and commencement of prosecutions."

19. I am asked what, if any, discussions I had with Gareth Jenkins during this

     period, and, if no discussions took place, whether this was something I

     considered. I am asked to set out any discussions I had or advice I gave in

     this regard.

20. In my observations document on the Terms of Reference for the Appointment

     of Brian Altman QC [POL00006804_0003], I see I wrote:

             "Paragraph 2 of the 'Process' section of the overarching Terms of

             Reference (and in paragraph 2 of the 'Process' section of the

             abbreviated Terms of Reference for the shorter report, albeit

             bracketed) includes the possibility of my meeting Dr Jenkins. I note

             this is queried.

             Not meeting and hearing him, where there may be questions

             potentially impacting on non-disclosure by him, and his role as an

             expert, risks exposing the final report to criticism. However, this is not

             a judicial or public inquiry with the formal receipt of evidence. This is

             something I shall need to think about carefully; at this very early stage

             I am not unnaturally undecided. For now it may be better for the

             Terms of Reference to remain silent about him."

21. It is clear from this that early on in my instruction I did consider whether to

     meet Gareth Jenkins. I do not have a copy of the document I am referring to

     here which must be an early iteration of the draft Terms of Reference, and I
                                     Page 8 of 53
                                                                                        WITN10350100
                                                                                    WITN10350100




     do not know now what was "queried", how it was queried or by whom. In the

     event, I did not meet Gareth Jenkins and I cannot find any record that I had

     further discussions about it or any record of my reasoning for not doing so.

22. I am also asked what, if any, discussions I had with any other individuals from

     Fujitsu during this period, and, if no discussions took place, whether this was

     something I considered. I had no discussions with anyone from Fujitsu and I

     do not recall now if I considered it. However, given the nature and scope of

     my instructions and role, I doubt I would have considered meeting anyone

     from Fujitsu.

23. I am further asked to set out any information I received (whether formally or

     informally, at this time or earlier) from BD (or WBD as they became) in respect

     of any previous cases that they had been involved in where issues of bugs,

     errors or defects in Horizon had been raised. I do not recall receiving any such

     information at this time or earlier.

24. I am requested to set out the names of all lawyers at BD/WBD with whom I

     discussed issues of the reliability of Gareth Jenkins (during this period or at

     any other time) and to set out my recollections of those discussions. I have no

     recollection of discussions with anyone from BD/WBD about Gareth Jenkins

     in this period or at any other time.

25. I am asked about the extent to which I was aware of: (1) bugs, errors or defects

     in Legacy Horizon; (2) the Helen Rose Report; (3) the Second Sight Interim

     Report; (4) the August Clarke advice; and (5) the Detica report, and insofar as

     I was not aware of them, to set out if (and if so, when) I later became aware of

     them. I deal with each in turn:

        (1) 1 was aware of the Callendar Square/Falkirk bug as to which I had

             been given to understand a software fix had been distributed into the

                                                                            WITN10350100




    system by March 2006 (see [POL00006803_0042]). Certain other

    concerns and problems were suggested in Harry Bowyer's Response

    to the Interim Review of Cartwright King's Current Process by Brian

    Altman QC [POL00066807_0002] but, as I understood it, these were

    in Horizon Online, as they arose in the summer of 2013. Apart from

    this, I do not believe in this period of time I was aware of the existence

    of any other bugs, errors or defects in Legacy Horizon. I became

    aware of them much later, I believe, following the 2019 Horizon Issues

           March 2020 in the course of my work on the criminal appeals.

26. I am asked to detail any reflections I have on the advice that I gave including

   (but not limited to) in respect of each of the following: (1) the start date for

   cases reviewed as part of the CK Sift Review; (2) any other limitations in scope

   of the CK Review; (3) the independence of the CK Sift Review; (4) the test

   that had been applied by Cartwright King reviewers in respect of the safety of

   the convictions; (5) my reliance on the content of Mr Jenkins' witness

   statements to inform my review; (6) the "concern that offenders might use the

   mediation scheme to gain information as a platform from which to launch a

   fresh or new appeal"; and (7) observations regarding Cartwright King being

   given complete visibility of civil litigation and its potential impact on decisions

   made in criminal cases. While I address each of those questions below, it is

   important for me to observe that the advice that I gave in each instance was

   dependent on the information that was available to me to at the time. I now

   deal with each question in turn:

      (1) Second Sight had arrived at the preliminary conclusion in their Interim

           Report that they had so far found no evidence of system wide

           (systemic) problems with Horizon, and they were aware of two

           incidents where "defects" or "bugs" in Horizon Online had affected

           branches       [POL00029650_0005-0006             and      _0008].      At

           [POL00006803_0024-0027] I set out at some length the basis upon

           which I arrived at the view (which I still hold) that 1 January 2010 was

           a "logical and practicable" start date for the review. The rationale was

           that this date was the earliest date of the Horizon Online rollout and

           that, prior to each branch rollout, a cash audit was performed so that

           each branch balanced. However, I also made clear that if POL was
                                    Page 11of 53
                                                                                WITN10350100
                                                                           WITN10350100




    approached by individuals convicted before the start date, it would

    need to make ad hoc case-specific decisions about the need for

    disclosure and that the case of Mrs Misra was one case I had in mind

    where similar issues had been raised (see [POL00006803_0025]).

(2) As for my reflections on the existence of any other limitations in the

    scope of the CK review, I set out at [POL00006803_0023-0033] my

    understanding of the disclosure process CK had embarked on and the

    system they were employing. I set out my conclusions about the scope

    of the CK review in the Executive Summary at [POL00006803_0005].

(3) I identified certain issues regarding the independence of the review at

    [POL00006803_0032-0033] and concluded that lawyers should not

    sift or review their own cases. It was and remains my view that

    advising a review that was wholly independent of CK was

    unnecessary. I had raised concerns about the independence of the

    CK review in my Interim Review at [POL00006801_0002 and _0006-

    0007].     I   returned   to   this   theme   in   the   General   Review

    [P0L00006803_0005 and _0032-0033]. At [P0L00006803_0033],

    wrote "I have considered this issue with some care and, having met

    with representatives of CK, and having considered the many Advices

    and other material I have seen emanating from CK representatives, I

    have seen no evidence other than a professional and independent

    approach to this review. Consequently, on the material available to

    me, I would reject any suggestion that CK's solicitors and counsel

    cannot act, or have not acted, with an independent and professional

    approach to the Horizon issues, which have arisen, and to their

    review."

                                                                         WITN10350100




(4) The test that had been applied by CK reviewers in respect of the safety

    of the convictions was that which I identified at[POL00006803_0041].

    The test was there was a duty to disclose where material came to light

    after the conclusion of the proceedings "which might cast doubt on the

    safety of the conviction". I advised that the letter that was sent out

    should reflect that test (see [POL00006803_0043-0044]). My advice

    included at [POL00006803_0029] that CK "should be alive to

    changing circumstances ... and must not therefore adopt an over -rigid

    approach; each case must be approached on a case-by-case basis."

    I re-emphasised this at [POL00006803_0054].

(5) I was reviewing CK's disclosure process as a result of the revelations

    made to CK by Mr Jenkins, as set out in Simon Clarke's Legal Advice

    on the Use of Expert Evidence [POL00006798_0011]_             Why Mr

    Jenkins had failed to reveal in his witness statements or evidence the

    bugs or defects he knew about was not a matter for my review.

    However, it was the impact of those failures on his future role as an

    expert and more importantly the effect of those failures of disclosure

    on past convictions and current prosecutions that were the focus of

    attention (see [P0L00006803_0001-0003, _0018-0019, _0044-

    0049]).

(6) I am asked about the "concern that offenders might use the mediation

    scheme to gain information as a platform from which to launch a fresh

    or new appeal" (see [POL00006803_0042]). This was something CK

    had raised during the meeting of 9 September 2013 [POL00006769].

    At [POL00006769_0003], the note reads, "BA advised considerable

    caution in relation to mediation cases involving previously convicted

                                                                          WITN10350100
                                                                     WITN10350100




individuals (Seems Misra has already indicated an intention to be

within the scheme). The concern is that lawyers acting for those

individuals may be using the scheme to obtain information which they

would not normally be entitled to in order to pursue an appeal."

According to the note, my view was that CK should review the

information being given to individuals by Second Sight so CK were not

"blindsided" by evidence of which they were unaware, and that the

information being sent out to individuals should be audited by CK. This

had been the main topic of conversation during the 4 October 2013

telephone conference, as to which, in the General Review (at

[POL00006803_0042]) I reported, "There is understandable concern

that offenders might use the mediation scheme to gain information as

a platform from which to launch a fresh or new appeal, and so CK wish

to exercise a measure of control over the dissemination of information

and material during the process." However, I went on to advise at

[POL00006803_0042-0043] that "CK must consider the approach it

is to take with applicants. Mediation is not a formalised court process

and the CPIA [Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996] rules

of disclosure do not apply. However, the mediation process in a

particular case could give rise to the view that, mindful of its common

law duties, case-specific disclosure ought to be made, and POL and

CK must keep an open mind to this. The mediation process might

even give rise to consideration of making further general disclosure

within the current review, depending on the nature of the new

information." Thus, the advice was not about withholding material but

about CK supervision of the process and the "possible uncontrolled
                        Page 14 of 53
                                                                                          WITN10350100
                                                                                     WITN10350100




             dissemination       of     information      and       material"      (see

             [POL00006803_0043]). Indeed, in the Executive Summary, I

             concluded, "Cartwright King should exercise supervisory control over

             the dissemination of information and material during the mediation

             process, and should remain alive to the possibility of having to make

             case-specific disclosure in the course of that process, or even making

             additional general disclosure in the course of its current review

             depending on the nature of any new information."

        (7) The observations I made regarding CK being given complete visibility

             of civil litigation and its potential impact on decisions made in criminal

             cases [POL00006803_0007 and _0055] was, I felt, and continue to

             feel, an obvious one. My view was that without visibility of any Horizon -

             related civil litigation, CK might be denied information that bore on

             their review of criminal cases. By this, I meant the disclosure decisions

             they were making.

27. Despite the Terms of Reference, I was not invited to meet, or personally report

     to, the POL Board or the Audit Committee as regards my review or my

     findings.

28. I am asked the extent to which I consider my review was limited to conducting

     "a review of the process." My attention is invited to paragraph 14.2 of the

     Submissions on behalf of the Respondent in relation to the Application for

     Access to Papers in the Proceedings [POL00158692]. The date of the

     document is 30 November 2020. This was POL's response to an application

     made by Nick Wallis to the CACD for access, in particular, to the "Clarke

     Advice" (see [POL00006798]), which was the focus of the application and the

     submission document (see [POL00158692_0002]). The submission at
                                      Page 15 of 53
                                                                                     WITN10350100
                                                                                WITN10350100




    paragraph 14.2 was that I had been instructed "among other things, to conduct

    a review of the process (although not the individual decisions in reviewed

    cases)." That formulation does not suggest there was any limitation to my

    review.

29. I am asked to what extent I considered my review to be an independent

    investigation and to what extent, if any, did I understand those who received

    the review to have considered it to be an independent investigation. The

    Terms of Reference show that my instructions on behalf of POL were, in

    essence, to review Gareth Jenkins' role as an expert witness in future POL

    prosecutions, given the disclosure failures which had been revealed by him to

    Second Sight, and, more importantly, to advise on the impact of those

    disclosure failures on past convictions and current prosecutions and review

    the disclosure process OK had then embarked upon. I did not consider it to

    be an independent investigation as such, and the words "independent

    investigation" do not appear in my Terms of Reference for the review. Indeed,

    as was stated in the Terms of Reference at [POL00006803_0001], while there

    was a fact-finding element to my work, I was instructed to "review, and advise

    POL in writing ..." on those matters set out in the Terms of Reference. I thus

    regarded my work as advisory in nature and not in the nature of an

    independent investigation. The views I arrived at were, however, independent

    of my professional and lay clients. I have no insight into the extent to which

    those who received the review considered it to be an independent

    investigation.

30. I am asked about the extent to which drafts of my reports were amended after

    discussion with POL or others before being finalised and to describe this

    process and the nature of the comments that were received in respect of
                                   Page 16 of 53

                                                                                    WITN10350100




    drafts. The review document [POL00006803] went through various drafts,

    which is the normal course of events in any advisory or review work as

    thoughts and findings emerge. It is possible that previous drafts of

    [POL00006803] were sent to Gavin Matthews for comment. I would not have

    discussed or sent any drafts to POL I am unable to find any record of

    comments Mr Matthews might have provided me, and I cannot at this distance

    in time recall any. However, my work record for 14 October 2013

    [WITN10350106_0002] indicates that I made final revisions to my General

    Review "following telephone con with GM (16:30 for 26 minutes)".

31. I   invite   the    Inquiry's   attention        to   the   Executive   Summary

    [POL00006803_0005-0007] which summarises my conclusions in the

    General Review. Based on the information I had at that time, in particular, as

    to how CK were conducting their review, and exercising my professional

    judgement, I was of the opinion that the review was "fundamentally sound"

    and I had not detected any "systemic of fundamental flaws" in the process of

    the review, or in the evidence arising from it, but I added that, because the

    review was a continuing process, and POL had a continuing duty of

    disclosure, in current and, in practice, past conviction cases falling within the

    review, POL and CK "must be prepared to keep under review, and reconsider,

    past case reviews and disclosure decisions" At [POL00006803_0053-0054]),

    I explained this further by saying CK's review was organised and efficient, it

    was being considered at the right level in CK, and it was addressing the right

    tests. I emphasised the need to keep an open mind to reconsidering past

    disclosure decisions.

32. 1 am asked to what extent, if any, did POL implement my recommendations

    (insofar as I am aware). I believe I had no insight into this. I am asked if I saw

    responses to my recommendations by CK. My attention is drawn to

     Observations and Analysis of the Cartwright King Prosecution Review

    Process dated 5 December 2013 [POL00040194]. I am unable to say now if I

    had seen this document previously and I have no recollection now of seeing

     any other documents of that nature.

33. I did not attend any Wednesday Hub Meetings and so I cannot provide any

     view about their effectiveness and approach.

34. I am asked whether I consider that I was provided with sufficient information

     to conduct my review and to detail the reasons for my answer. The information

    I had at that time regarding bugs, errors or defects in Horizon Online was the

     Helen Rose Report [POL00030214], the Second Sight Interim Report

     [POL00029650], the information about the Callendar Square/Falkirk bug in

    Legacy Horizon, which I understood had been fixed by March 2006, as well

     as some other possible concerns or issues identified in Harry Bowyers'

    Response to my Interim Review (see [POL00066807]). Second Sight's report

     [POL00029650] was interim, and it had expressed its conclusions as

    "preliminary", and it made clear there was "much work still to be done", as I

    repeated in the General Review at [POL00006803_0017-0018].              I also

    advised that "the conclusions I arrive at in this document are necessarily

     subject to further consideration of any additional or different conclusions SS

    might reach in the future." (I had made much the same point in my

    observations document on the Terms of Reference for the Appointment of

    Brian Altman QC at [POL00006804_0004].) In its interim report, Second Sight

     said they had so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems

    with the Horizon software. That was the basis on which my review necessarily

     proceeded. I was not in any position to detect, far less foresee, the
                                    Page 18 of 53
                                                                                         WITN10350100

       catastrophic problems with Horizon that were later laid bare in the Horizon

      Issues Trial.




Altman Review of the Prosecution Role FPOL000068021


  35. I have outlined above how the instruction for this particular workstream came

      about and who instructed me. The nature of my instruction was, in essence,

       to review, and, if appropriate, to recommend changes to the existing

       investigations and conduct of future POL prosecutions, including, if

      appropriate, POL's investigative and prosecutorial role being undertaken by

      another authority. The Terms of Reference for the Appointment of Brian

      Altman QC [POL00040036], which appear to be a draft, are the genesis of

       this workstream. The Terms of Reference were, it seems, revised, as is

       evident by the final Terms of Reference I inserted into [ POL00006802] at

      [P0L00006802_0001-0002].

  36. My observations document on the Terms of Reference for the Appointment of

      Brian Altman QC [POL00006804_0002] appears to show that, originally, this

      had been envisaged to be part of one workstream. I cannot now remember

      how or why this work was separated into two parts.

  37. My work record [WITN10350106_0004] shows that, on 17 October 2013,

       there was a telephone conference lasting 30 minutes with Rob King and Andy

       Hayward both of POL, together with Gavin Matthews, in order to discuss

      issues   regarding   POL's    investigation    structure   and   function   (see

      [POL00006802_0002 and _0028]). This was followed by a telephone

       conference alone with Gavin Matthews of 10 minutes. The work record also

       shows that there was a meeting in my chambers on 22 October 2013 with

    duration. I have no note of what we discussed and cannot now recall the

    content of the meeting. The work record (at [WITN10350106_0004-0005])

    shows too that there was a 20 minute telephone conference call with Rodric

    Williams on 12 November 2013, and a telephone conference with Gavin

    Matthews on 18 November 2013 lasting 15 minutes, followed by a telephone

    conference with Rodric Williams, Jarnail Singh, Gavin Matthews and Andrew

    Parsons, which lasted one hour and 15 minutes. I have no notes or

     independent recollection of these meetings.

38. As I wrote at [POL00006802_0003], "Further to these conferences, I have not

     identified (or had identified to me by POL) anyone else I should meet or speak

    to as relevant to the issues I am asked to review. I have however received

    written answers to a variety of questions I have asked or issues I have raised

    by email in the course of my review."

39. I am asked why this advice contains a curriculum vitae at the end of my

    Review (see [POL00006802_0040])_ It is not typical of advisory work I did at

    the time. At this distance in time, I cannot recall why I included a short CV, or

    why, by comparison, I did not do so for my General Review [POL00006803].

40. I am asked when carrying out this review the extent to which I was aware of

    the information/reports identified in paragraph 25 above (and if and insofar as

    my answer is that I was not yet aware of such information, whether I had

    become aware of them by this time). My answer remains the same for items

    (1)-(4). Insofar as item (5) is concerned, I must also make clear that I had also

    not received the final Detica report. I make no reference to the draft Detica

    report dated 1 October 2013 [POL00029677] or the final Detica report dated

    28 October 2013 in my Review [POL00006802].

41. 1 am asked to detail any reflections I have on the advice I gave including (but

     not limited to) in respect of each of the following: (1) POL's conduct in carrying

     out its investigations and prosecution function; (2) the focus on Horizon

     Online; and (3) the appropriateness of the steps that POL had taken to address

     potentially affected cases. I deal with each in turn:

        (1) I note that at [POL00006802_0039], I wrote "it may be thought that

             POL's prosecution role is anachronistic, and highly problematic in light

             of recent events." However, the information I had and relied upon in

             December 2013 in order to arrive at my views about POL's own

             conduct of its investigations and prosecution function led me to

             understand and write at [POL00006802_0039], "the recent events

             have to be seen in their proper context. The serial non -disclosure of

             relevant material occurred in circumstances in which POL asserts that

             it and its advisers were wholly unaware that there might be disclosable

             material or information, and so, whatever the reason, were not placed

             in a position whereby they knew of its existence and could deal with it

             appropriately", "POL was, inevitably, in a position where it was wholly

             dependent on FSL [Fujitsu] and/or the expert to reveal material so that

             POL could perform its prosecution duties, which in the event it was

             unable to do" and that "POL, with its unique commercial arrangement

             with its IT supplier, also became somewhat hostage to it." Later events

             proved my then information and understanding to be wholly incorrect.

             The information I had led me also to the view that POL's investigations

             and prosecution function was "well-organised, structured and efficient"

             (see [POL00006802_0040]).

        (2) I have set out at paragraph 26(1) above the rationale underlying the
                                      Page 21of 53
                                                                                      WITN10350100
                                                                                 WITN10350100




            focus on Horizon Online_ Insofar as this review is concerned, it was

            about POL's prosecution function and so it was forward -looking. It

            was, therefore, inevitable that the focus was on Horizon Online.

       (3) I am asked also to reflect on the appropriateness of the steps that POL

            had taken to address potentially affected cases. These steps (as I

            understand the question) were the subject of [POL00006803].

42. I am asked to what extent I considered my review to be an independent

    investigation and to what extent, if any, did I understand those who received

    the review to have considered it to be an independent investigation. I did not

    consider it to be an independent investigation as such and the words

    "independent investigation" do not appear in my Terms of Reference for the

    review work (see [POL00006802_0001-0002]). Again, I regarded my work as

    advisory and not in the nature of an independent investigation. The views I

    arrived at were, however, independent of my professional and lay clients. I

    have no insight into the extent to which those who received the review

    considered it to be an independent investigation.

43. I am again asked about the extent to which drafts of my report were amended

    after discussion with POL or others before being finalised and to describe this

    process and the nature of the comments that were received in respect of

    drafts. The review document [POL00006802] went through various drafts,

    which, as I mention at paragraph 30 above, is not unusual as thoughts and

    findings emerge. It is possible that previous drafts of [POL00006802] were

    sent to Gavin Matthews for comment. I would not have discussed or sent any

    drafts to POL. I am unable to find any record of any comments Mr Matthews

    might have provided me, and I cannot at this distance in time recall any.

    However, my work record for 20 October 2013 [WITN10350106_0003] shows
                                   Page 22 of 53
                                                                                      WITN10350100
                                                                                 WITN10350100




     I submitted a draft of this review document to BD, and, on 21 October 2013, I

     noted, "Further revising review document [2] & submitting it to BD, following

     telecom (sic) with GM (14:15 for 17 mins)". The work record for 25 October

     2013 [WITN10350106_0003] notes "Further consideration & revision of

     review document in light of additional comments" and that for 19 December

     2013 [WITN10350106_0004] notes "Final edit as per requests and

     submission".

44. Despite the Terms of Reference, I was not invited to meet, or personally report

     to, the POL Board or the Audit Committee to give them my recommendations,

     either by 31 October 2013 (see [POL00006802_0001]), or at any time after

     the delivery of the written review.

45. I am asked to what extent, if any, POL implemented any recommendations I

     made (insofar as I am aware). In answering this question my attention has

     been drawn to Bond Dickinson — Personal Attendance Note re: POL's Policy

     including Enforcement Policy to Prosecute SPMs [POL00125442]. In

     [POL00006802_0005-0007] I made a series of recommendations as regards

     POL investigation and prosecution policies and as regards a protocol or

     memorandum of understanding with Fujitsu covering POL's duties and

     obligations of disclosure and seeking their understanding and agreement to

     revealing "any and all material or information that might undermine the

     integrity of the system, and to the requirement for the disclosure of such

     material or information in the course of criminal proceedings, as may be

     required." As [POL00125442] shows, in 2014 I was asked to assist with POL's

     prosecution policy. Indeed, in [POL00006802_0018-0029] I had commented

     upon a series of different POL enforcement and prosecution policy documents

     that had been sent to me, and remarked at [POL00006802_0028], that "The
                                     Page 23 of 53
                                                                                          WITN10350100
                                                                                     WITN10350100




      current state of affairs is unsatisfactory_ POL separated from RMG in April

      2012, yet, despite the recently OK draft policy document Post Office

      Prosecution Policy — England and Wales (document (xii)), and the Conduct of

      Criminal Investigation Policy document (document (xiii)), emanating from

      POL's Security Department, the position in late 2013 is that there exist several

      enforcement and prosecution policy documents, whose precise status, origin

      and currency are uncertain, and there is none still that is official POL policy."

      Beyond this, I am unaware of the enforcement and prosecution policy

      documents, if any, that POL finally settled upon. Equally, I do not believe I

      was told anything more about the protocol or memorandum of understanding

      with Fujitsu, referred to above.

  46. Finally, I am asked whether I consider I was provided with sufficient

      information to conduct my review and to detail the reasons for my answer. In

      terms of POL's investigation and prosecution function, I think I did have

      adequate information in general terms to make recommendations about

      POL's future role. But it is, I think, clear in light of later events, that the

      information I had been given that POL was "wholly unaware" that there might

      be disclosable material or information, and that POL was "wholly dependent

      on FSL [Fujitsu] and/or the expert to reveal material so that POL could perform

      its prosecution duties" was incorrect.




Altman Advice on Board Papers FPOL001050681


  47. I have no recollection of the background to this workstream, but my Advice

      Report on Papers for Post Office Ltd Board [POL00105068_0001] reveals

      that, at the end of January 2014, I was asked to consider two papers and

                                         Page 24 of 53
                                                                                        WITN10350100
                                                                                   WITN10350100




     appendices that were sent to me, titled Project Sparrow - Paper on Stacked

     Cases and Project Sparrow - Paper on Prosecutions Going Forward. As I say

     there, "In essence I was asked to conduct a fatal flaw analysis of the proposals

     and propositions contained in both papers". I cannot recall now if the

     instructions came through BD/WBD or POL itself_ However, the telephone

     conference set out below suggests Gavin Matthews was involved in my

     instruction.

48. The information I was provided with for this advice is set out at

     [POL00105068_0001]. The advice appears to have been self-contained.

     Therefore, the information appears to have been sufficient for the purpose.

49. I am asked to detail who I met from POL to gather information for this advice.

     My work record [WITN10350107_0001] shows that there was a telephone

     conference with Gavin Matthews on 29 January 2014 lasting 15 minutes,

     which related to advising the Board on so-called "stacking cases" and future

     prosecutions. The work record [WITN10350107_0004] also shows that there

     was a telephone conference with Rodric Williams and Gavin Matthews on 30

     January 2014 lasting 45 minutes, which I have assumed was related to the

     same topic, given its proximity in time. I have been unable to find any note of

     either conference.

50. I am asked when drafting this advice the extent to which I was aware of the

     information/reports identified in paragraphs 25 and 40 above (and if and insofar

     as my answer is that I was not yet aware of such information, whether I had

     become aware of them by this time)_ My answer remains the same for items

     (1)-(5).

51. I am asked for my reflections on this work. As I have said, the advice was a

     self-contained piece of work. It sets out what I consider to be appropriate

      advice on the material with which I was provided, such as my advice about

      elderly and vulnerable alleged victims (see [POL00105068_0003-0004]); the

      issue of delay and abuse of process (see [ POL00105068_0004-0007]); and

      financial thresholds and the two-stage test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors

      (see [POL00105068_0010-0014]).

 52. I was not invited to meet, or personally report to, the POL's Board or the Audit

      Committee or any other committee in respect of this advice.

 53. I do not know if, or the extent to which, my recommendations were

      implemented.



Altman Advice on Mediation [POL000063681

 54. It appears from the material that has been drawn to my attention, namely,

      Email Chain from Rodric Williams to Claire Webb and Johnny Gribben re: FW

      Call with Brian Altman QC of 16 and 17 July 2014 [POL00061549] and Email

      Chain between Gavin Matthews, Rodric Williams, Andrew Parsons and others

      re: Advice from Bran Altman QC on Suggested Approach to Criminal Case

      Mediation [POL00040254], as well as the Advice on Criminal Case Mediation

      [POL00006368], that following conferences on 16 July 2014 and on 31 July

      2014, I was asked to provide the advice by Gavin Matthews on behalf of POL.

      The advice I was instructed to provide related to the approach POL should

      adopt to criminal cases falling within the mediation scheme.

 55. I am asked to detail who I met from POL to gather information for this advice.

      My work record [WITN10350108_0003] shows that there was a telephone

      conference with Gavin Matthews on 15 July 2014 lasting 30 minutes. The

      work record shows also that there was a telephone conference with POL and

      Gavin Matthews on 16 July 2014 lasting one hour and 15 minutes (referred to
                                      Page 26 of 53

     in [POL00061549_0001]), and that there was a telephone conference with

     Gavin Matthews on 30 July 2014 lasting 15 minutes. Finally, the work record

     [WITN10350108_0004] shows that there was a telephone conference with

     Gavin Matthews and Rodric Williams on 31 July 2014 lasting one hour (which

     is referred to in [POL00040254_0001] and [POL00006368_0001]). I have

     been unable to find that I made any note of those telephone conferences, but

    I see that detail of the conference of 16 July 2014 is set out in an email of the

     same date [POL00061549_0001], to which I was not joined. I note too that

     detail of the telephone conference of 31 July 2014 is set out in an email of 7

     August 2014 [POL00040254_0002], to which I was also not joined.

56. I am asked when drafting this advice the extent to which I was aware of the

     information/reports identified in paragraphs 25, 40 and 50 above (and if and

     insofar as my answer is that I was not yet aware of such information, whether

    I had become aware of them by this time). My answer remains the same for

     items (1)-(5). I am also asked whether by this time I had become aware of (6)

     the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme Briefing Report - Part One

     Second Sight Report dated 25 July 2014 [POL00075178]. I had not become

     aware of this report by the time I delivered this advice, and it is not referred to

     in the advice [POL00006368].

57. I am asked for my reflections on this work on the advice I gave including (but

     not limited to) the concerns that I had in respect of allowing convicted

     subpostmasters into the mediation scheme, as well the extent to which, if any,

    I was concerned about the use of the mediation scheme to obtain disclosure

     relevant   to   criminal   appeals.    It   is   clear   from   the    advice    at

     [POL00006368_0005] that I had been provided with, and read, CK's advices

     of 9 and 15 July 2014 on the topic and I did not disagree with their advice in
                                      Page 27 of 53
                                                                                       WITN10350100
                                                                                  WITN10350100




    which they continued to maintain "a wholesale objection to the admission of

    all criminal cases to the scheme".

58. As I said also, I had expressed that same view "some months previously" (see

    [POL00006368_0005]), which I think must be a reference to the conference

    on 9 September 2013 [POL00006769]_ However, I noted also that I

    "understood that time had moved on and a practical solution had to be found

    to deal with those criminal cases that were now within the mediation scheme."

    Moreover,     in   my    General     Review     of   15   October    2013    (at

    [POL00006803_0052]), I outlined Sir Anthony Hooper's suggestion (made

    "quite firmly") that it might be more appropriate for cases that had been

    through the courts to be referred to the CCRC rather than go through the

    mediation scheme, as well as the views I had voiced during the 9 September

    2013 conference (see [POL00006769_0003]).

59. My advice was based on the information I had received. Additionally, as I

    wrote at [POL00006368_0002}, "POL has dealt with criminal cases in line with

    that process [POL's unadopted Settlement Policy], so that if material is

     identified that affects the safety of the conviction, the process is suspended,

    the material is disclosed, and the applicant considers his position as regards

    any appeal. If the process that POL has been adopting within the mediation

    scheme is limited in this way then I see no problem with it. The problem arises

    with the notion that POL should consider its position on any future appeal."

    This had been "POL's standard approach" (see [POL00006368_0001]). I

    added "The focus of our discussions on 318t July was around the practical

    utility of such an approach. The view I expressed was that I could not see any

    advantage to POL in adopting, far less being held to, a position on any criminal

    appeal during the mediation scheme. In fact, adopting such a course would
                                    Page 28 of 53
                                                                                       WITN10350100
                                                                                  WITN10350100




    be to court an unacceptable level of risk..."

60. I concluded at[POL00006368_0004]"It is for these reasons POL should only

    ever consider its position once an applicant has considered the new material

    and has in fact launched a criminal appeal. There is in my judgment an

    unacceptable risk to POL in providing or being held to a position on criminal

    appeal at the early stage of mediation. An indication by POL at such an early

    stage based on limited information risks inviting an appeal. Also, at this stage

    the applicant will almost certainly not have even considered whether the new

    information gives rise to grounds of appeal let alone whether there are any

    grounds that are reasonably arguable ... POL may find itself prematurely

    supporting an appeal when upon mature reflection the written grounds of

    appeal show it ought not to have done so or it may oppose an appeal when

    events prove it was ill judged to have done so."

61. As appears above at paragraph 26(6), my original 2013 advice had been about

    the application of the mediation scheme to those convicted of criminal

    offences_ I note from what I said in my advice (at [POL00006368_0005]) that

    those who had pleaded guilty or had been cautioned for an offence were

    admitted to the scheme.

62. The focus of my advice in [POL00006368] was on POL's practical approach

    to what Sir Anthony Hooper had suggested in cases where those who had

    admitted an offence had been admitted to the scheme.

63. The second issue on the mediation which was the subject of my advice in

    2013 was, as I set out at paragraph 26(6) above, about CK having a

    supervisory function regarding the criminal cases in the mediation and the

    "possible   uncontrolled dissemination of information and material" (see

    [POL00006803_0043])_ As appears from paragraphs 26(6) and 59 above, I

        was not concerned about the mediation scheme being used to obtain

        disclosure relevant to criminal appeals.

  64. To the direct question I am asked in the Request, whether there were any

        issues relating to my representation of POL in matters relating to criminal

        appeals and advising on mediation, my response is there was none. The CACD

        was not examining events post-2013 or the scope of the mediation scheme or

        whether POL's standard approach to the mediation scheme was fairly applied

        in those cases before the CACD. The issues before the CACD in 2021 were

        about the safety of those 42 convictions, on grounds of appeal of abuse of

        process based on failures of investigation and non -disclosure under the

        Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 at the time of prosecution.

  65.   I was not invited to meet, or personally report to, the POL's Board or the Audit

        Committee or any other committee in respect of this advice.

  66. I do not know if, or the extent to which, my recommendations were

        implemented.



Altman Advice on Theft and False Accounting [POL00006588]

  67. I was asked to advise POL on what had been termed the "equality" of the

        offences of theft and false accounting in light of a letter POL had sent to

        Second Sight on 24 February 2015. As I said in the advice (see

        [POL00006588_0001]), I had been informed that Second Sight had begun to

        advance arguments that POL was abusing its prosecutorial role by charging

        subpostmasters with theft when there was no evidence of it in order only to

        pressure them into pleading guilty to false accounting. The Email Chain from

        Brian Altman to Andrew Parsons cc'ing Gavin Matthews re: Post Office —

        False Accounting and Theft on 6 March 2015 [POL0012577] was the origin of

    the Advice on Theft and False Accounting: Brian Altman QC dated 8 March

    2015 [POL00006588]. The emails show the instructions emanated from

    Andrew Parsons, and Gavin Matthews was copied in. Those instructions are

    set out under the heading "Advice required" at[POL0012577_0003]. A formal

    advice was not required, but, as my email of 8 March 2015 to BD shows

    [POL0012577_0001], I felt it easier to put my advice into a separate

    document. My instructions were also outlined at[POL00006588_0003]. The

    sole focus of the advice I was being asked for was whether statements POL

    had made in the letter were defensible (see [POL0012577_0003] and

    [POL00006588_0003]).

68. 1 have no record of meeting anyone to gather information for the purposes of

    this advice.

69. I am asked when drafting this advice the extent to which I was aware of the

     information/reports identified in paragraphs 25,40, 50 and 56 above (and if and

     insofar as my answer is that I was not yet aware of such information, whether

    I had become aware of them by this time). My answer remains the same for

     items (1)-(6).

70. BD's email to me of 6 March 2015 [POL0012577] set out the information I

    required for this advice which was a self-contained piece of work. Therefore,

     it seems to me the information appears to have been sufficient for the purpose.

71. I am asked for my reflections on this advice. The dispute was about whether

    the offence of false accounting was a "lesser" offence to the offence of theft

    or whether they were "equal". Sir Anthony Hooper was of the view false

    accounting was a lesser offence. CK disagreed. I was being asked to advise

    POL about the letter sent by POL to Second Sight on 24 February 2015 and

    to advise whether the statement the offences were "equal" was defensible. I

       made my views clear about that proposition at [POL00006588_0003-0004]

       and referred to the examples provided by Sir Anthony Hooper in

       POL0012577_0001] where in certain circumstances false accounting may be

       more serious than theft. I developed the point at [POL00006588_0004-0006]

       and my conclusions were set out at [POL00006588_0007-0008].

  72. I was not invited to meet, or personally report to, the POL Board or the Audit

       Committee as regards my advice. I do not know what use POL made of my

       advice. I did not speak to Sir Anthony Hooper about the matter. There were

       no substantive differences between what I understood to be his views and

       mine. As I have stated above, the dispute had originated between CK's advice

       and Sir Anthony Hooper's views about it.



Altman Review of Criminal Prosecutions [POL00006394]

  73. My instructions here were, essentially, to advise POL as to whether the safety

       of a conviction for false accounting could be undermined in circumstances

       where a person was charged with theft and false accounting, but had

       pleaded guilty to the false accounting charge, following which, and/or in

       return for which, the theft charge was dropped, and where there was

       said to be no or no sufficient evidential basis to bring the theft charge. The

       background to my involvement in this review [POL00006394] was the Review

       on behalf of the Chairman of Post Office Ltd concerning steps taken in

       response to various complaints made by subpostmasters dated 8 February

       2016 undertaken by Jonathan Swift QC (now Mr Justice Swift) and

       Christopher Knight ("the Swift Review") [POL00006355]. My formal

       instructions were from Rodric Williams and dated 18 February 2016 and were

       set out in Instructions to Brian Altman QC from POL [POL00022765_0001-
                                      Page 32 of 53
                                                                                  WITN10350100
                                                                             WITN10350100




    0003]. The Swift Review had made the following recommendations on the

    issue of the sufficiency of evidence (at [POL00006355_0038]):

       (1) 113.1: "Legal advice be sought from counsel as to whether the

            decision to charge an SPMR [subpostmaster] with theft and false

            accounting could undermine the safety of any conviction for false

            accounting where (a) the conviction was on the basis of a guilty

            plea, following which and/or in return for which the theft charge

            was dropped, and (b) there had not been a sufficient evidential

            basis to bring the theft charge."

       (2) 113.2: "If such a conviction could be undermined in those

            circumstances, that counsel review the prosecution file in such

            cases to establish whether, applying the facts and law applicable

            at the relevant time, there was a sufficient evidential basis to

            conclude that a conviction for theft was a realistic prospect such

            that the charge was properly brought."

74. My instructions were to advise POL as to whether the safety of a conviction

    for false accounting could be undermined in the circumstances set out at

    paragraph 113.1, and, I was informed once POL had that advice, it could

    consider the steps (if any) it should take with respect to the prosecution

    file review referred to in paragraph 11 3.2 (see [POL00022765_0003]).

75. I have read through Email from Rodric Williams to Brian Altman QC: re:

    instructions for Brian Altman QC [POL00025755]. This is an email chain

    between Rodric Williams and me (with Gavin Matthews copied in) between

    29 February 2016 (the date I received the papers in Chambers) and 4 April

    2016.

76. Having read the instructions and file contents, and, as asked of me in my
                                   Page 33 of 53

                                                                                   WITN10350100




     instructions (see [POL00022765_0004-0005]), I then contacted Mr Williams

     by email on 20 March 2016 (see [POL00025755_0002]). As regards the first

     issue I had been asked to advise upon (the theft/false accounting issue) I

    offered the view that "The recommendation, as formulated, suggests to me

     that the only solution would be to proceed to a review of all such affected

     cases. This is because the recommendation is predicated on the basis that

    "(b) there had not been a sufficient evidential basis to bring the theft charge".

     This second limb to the recommendation is such that I could not advise other

     than to move to a review. This is because it could never have been

     appropriate, adopting the Code for Crown Prosecutors, to add a theft charge

     with no evidence of theft only to secure a plea to false accounting. The

     suggestion has been that, through CK, POL indicted theft charges without any

    evidential basis solely to encourage and secure pleas of guilty to "lesser" false

     accounting charges. The underlying allegation is that POL has manipulated

     its position as prosecutor as to amount to an abuse of the process. The safety

    of a conviction based even on a plea of guilty might be undermined by a

     serious abuse of the process_ There is, for example, authority that material

     non-disclosure might lead to the finding of an abuse even where the defendant

     had pleaded guilty. This is because the defendant has, by the non-disclosure,

     been deprived of the opportunity to deploy an argument to stay the indictment.

     So too here, if there was undisclosed evidence of a deliberate `practice' to do

     as is alleged (which is what is being said) then that could lead to finding of

     abuse. Any review would have to be by me alone (rather than one conducted

     by CK and supervised by me as suggested by Swift (para 109)) because it is

     CK's decision-making which is under the spotlight."

77. I did not advise on the second area of concern identified by the Swift Review

    [POL00006355], the reasons for which are outlined in the email chain at

    [POL00025755_0001-0002]          and     explained     in    my     advice     at

    [POL00006394_0004-0005].

78. My work record [WITN10350109_0004] shows that there was a telephone

    conference with Rodric Williams on 18 February 2016 lasting 20 minutes. This

    coincides with the date of my formal instructions, although not the receipt of

    the papers, which was on 29 February 2016. The work record shows that there

    was another call with him several weeks later on 5 April 2016 which lasted 45

    minutes. This call is referred to in the review at [ POL00006394 0005]. The

    work record shows also that there was a telephone conference with Andrew

    Parsons on 31 May 2016, but I cannot tell from the record (which simply

    characterises the conference as "re way forward") whether it was related to

    this workstream. I have no note or independent recollection of these meetings.

79. I am asked when drafting this advice the extent to which I was aware of the

    information/reports identified in paragraphs 25, 40, 50, 56 and 69 above (and if

    and insofar as my answer is that I was not yet aware of such information,

    whether I had become aware of them by this time). My answer remains the

    same for items (1)-(6). I am also asked whether by this time I had become

    aware of (7) the Part Two Second Sight Report and (8) the Swift Review.

80. I was aware of (8) the Swift Review [POL00006355], as that review document

    was the basis for my instructions, and, as Rodric Williams' instructions to me

    made clear (at [POL00022765_0001]), a copy of the Swift Review was

    provided to me with those instructions (referred to in those instructions as "the

    Report").

    Review and Mediation Scheme Briefing Report - Part Two dated 9 April 2015

    [POL00029849], both were extensively referred to in the Swift Review, in

    particular at [POL00006355_0025-0029 and 0034-0037]. I was not, however,

    provided with copies of either document.

82. I believe the case files and the material sent to me were sufficient for the

    purposes of the review. I do not know how the case files were selected for my

    review or who selected them. What is clear to me was that it was necessary

    to review cases files contrary to "POL's position" (as explained in paragraphs

    105 to 109 of the Swift Review (at [POL00006355_0035-0037]) and in my

    instructions (at [POL00022765_0003])). In my email to Rodric Williams on 4

    April 2016 [POL00025755_0001], I wrote "The recommendation, as

    formulated, suggests to me that the only solution would be to proceed to a

    review of all such affected cases."

83. I concluded (at [POL00006394_0051]) by saying that on the basis of my

    review of cases falling within the remit of the review, that the allegation that

    there had been a deliberate policy to charge theft, when there was no or

    no sufficient evidential basis to support it, just to encourage or influence

    pleas of guilty to charges of false accounting, was misplaced. Neither did I

    find any evidence in the cases I had been invited to review that theft (or fraud

    for that matter) was charged without any proper basis to do so and/or in order

    only to encourage or influence guilty pleas to offences of false accounting. I

    expressed the view (at [POL00006394_0052-0053]) that POL could be

    subject to criticism that it had been using the criminal justice system to enforce

    repayment from subpostmasters, and it could be argued that, because

    subpostmasters were contractually bound to repay losses, POL was using

    (and abusing) the criminal justice process rather than civil litigation to recover

       from offenders_ However, in the cases I reviewed, I found that where

       consideration had been given to the making of applications for confiscation

       and compensation orders, there had been a proper legal and evidential basis

       for so doing.

  84. 1 was not invited to meet, or personally report to, the POL's Board or the Audit

       Committee or any other committee in respect of this advice.

  85. I do not know if, or the extent to which, my recommendations were

       implemented.



Altman Common Issues Advice rPOL000228341, Advice on Settlement

FPOL000064011 and Horizon Issues Advice FPOL000264611

  86. I received my instructions for these pieces of work from HSF who were then

       acting for POL. I dealt with Alan Watts, a partner, and Catherine Emanuel,

       who I believe then to have been a senior associate. I am unable to identify the

       source of the instructions for this work.

  87. Two of the advices (The Post Office Group Litigation, Advice on the Common

       Issues Judgment dated 14 April 2019 [POL00022834] and Note on the

       Horizon Issues Judgment dated 8 December 2019 [POL00026461]) related

       to the judgments of Mr Justice Fraser in the High Court, and the Advice on

       Settlement dated 17 June 2019 [POL00006401] was based on information

       that had been provided to me (albeit I cannot recollect in what format) as

       outlined at [POL00006401_0001-0002]. I believe that what was provided to

       me was sufficient for the purposes of this work.

  88. I am asked if I provided any advice to POL in respect of the use of Gareth

       Jenkins in further legal proceedings. I did not provide any advice to POL in

       respect of the use of Gareth Jenkins in further legal proceedings. My only

    awareness of the involvement of Mr Jenkins in the civil proceedings was, I

    believe, from what I later read in the draft or final judgment of Mr Justice Fraser

    in Alan Bates and Others v. Post Office Limited in paragraphs 508 to 516.

89. The only work record I have of a conference relating to any of these

    workstreams is for 2 December 2019 (see [WITN10350110_0002]); this was

    a telephone conference with Rodric Williams and Catherine Emanuel and

    William Lord of HSF, and it lasted one hour and 15 minutes. I have no note or

    independent recollection of this meeting now, but it is clear from the Note on

    Horizon Issues Judgment that the meeting did relate to the issues later

    documented in my note on the judgment (see [POL00026461_0001]).

90. I am asked again about my awareness at the time of drafting these advices of

    the information/reports referred to previously. I refer to my responses at

    paragraphs 79 to 81 above.

91. The requests for advice on the two judgments of Mr Justice Fraser were

    designed to elicit my advice on their possible impact on the safety of past

    criminal convictions (see [POL00022834_0001 and _0038]) and/or of the risk

    of   criminal     appeals    or     the     CCRC     making      references   (see

    [POL00006401_0002]).

92. The advice in [POL00022834] and [POL00026461] was expressly about the

    impact of the two High Court judgments on past criminal cases and future

    criminal appeals.

93. As for the Advice on Settlement [POL00006401_0002], "Post Office wishe[d]

    to understand the risk to the safety of a conviction that might be caused by a

    settlement that directly or indirectly awards some compensation or other

    benefit to a convicted Claimant."

94. I    understood     the     Horizon       Issues   Trial   was     ongoing    (see
                                      Page 38 of 53

    risk to the safety of any conviction if Post Office enters into a settlement with

    any or all of the Claimants."

95. I added at [POL00006401_0003] "Because no structure for any settlement

    has yet been decided, far less whether in principle any settlement negotiations

     should be commenced, this advice is inevitably in the abstract. The single

     question is whether settlement risks, or is likely to risk, the safety of past

     criminal convictions. The nature of this advice may, I understand, even

    influence the decision whether to attempt a settlement." Because of this, at

    [POL00006401_0004], I made very clear "It is not for me to advise on the

     strategy of any settlement and when and in what circumstances any offer to

     settle should be made. That must be a matter for Post Office's commercial

     law advisors to advise. I am directing my attention solely at the potential risks

     to the safety of criminal convictions in settling (or even attempting to settle)

    the 61 convicted Claimants' claims against Post Office."

96. Finally, at[POL00006401_0009], I said that "In my opinion, there is some risk

    to including convicted Claimants in any settlement agreement or package." I

    added, "At this stage, and in the abstract, I am unable exactly to define or to

     quantify the risk. While it has to be a matter for others to advise and decide

    how far Post Office should go in progressing a differential approach among

     the convicted Claimants and the rest, my advice must be that reaching any

     settlement agreement with the convicted Claimants should be a red line for all

    the reasons given above." My final conclusion at paragraph 31(e) in

    [POL00006401_0010] was "There is therefore in my judgment some risk to

     the safety of convictions of including convicted Claimants in any settlement

    agreement or package."

                                                                                      WITN10350100




  97. Thus, the advice, which I had characterised more than once as "in the

       abstract", was solely about the risk to the safety of past convictions of seeking

       a settlement with convicted claimants. Consideration of settlement by POL

       was then "in its early stages" (see [POL00006401_0001]). I had no

       involvement in, or discussions about, the conduct of the civil litigation, and I

       did not consider I was providing advice that impacted on the conduct of civil

       litigation.

  98. I was not invited to meet, or personally report to, the POL's Board or the Audit

       Committee or any other committee in respect of these advices.

  99. I do not know or remember if, or the extent to which, my views were

       implemented.



Court of Appeal Criminal Division

  100. In about January 2020, following the Horizon Issues Trial judgment, POL

       instructed Nick Vamos at P&P to deal with the criminal cases. It was therefore

       through P&P that I was instructed to advise POL in the criminal matters and,

       following the references made by the CCRC to the CACD in June and July

       2020, to represent POL in the CACD_

  101. I am asked to set out my views as to the timing of the disclosure of the

       documents/information referred to at paragraphs 25, 40, 50, 56, 69 and 79-81

       above (if and insofar as they were disclosed) to appellants. They are: (1) bugs,

       errors or defects in Legacy Horizon; (2) the Helen Rose Report; (3) the Second

       Sight Interim Report; (4) the August Clarke advice; (5) the Detica report; (6)

       the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme Briefing Report - Part One

       Second Sight Report; (7) the Part Two Second Sight Report; and (8) the Swift

       Review.

                                                                                  WITN10350100




102. The Disclosure Management Document ("DMD") dated 19 August 2020 stated

    in paragraph 1 [POL00142261_0001] that it was "intended to assist in

    informing the Court and the Appellants of the way in which the Prosecutor has

    been dealing with the post-conviction disclosure exercise ("PCDE") to date

    and how it proposes to continue to fulfil its disclosure obligations in a clear,

    open and transparent way." At paragraph 8 [POL00142261_0003] , the DMD

    set out the duty of post-conviction disclosure, and the broader approach POL

    was adopting, and, at paragraphs 12 to 18 [POL00142261_0004-0005] the

    methodology for the PCDE, involving both the Case Specific Disclosure

    Review and the Generic Disclosure Review ("GDR").

103. The DMD also set out (at paragraph 19) [POL00142261_0005] the counsel

    and solicitors' team responsible for the PCDE. The team consisted of a total

    of 49 junior counsel who were engaged as first and second level reviewers;

    one senior associate, two associates and two paralegals were engaged in the

    administration and collation of review material and in reviewing material; four

    senior instructed junior counsel were engaged in second level review and

    oversight of the PCDE process; while one other Queen's Counsel and I,

    together with two P&P partners (including Nick Vamos), were involved in the

    oversight of PCDE processes and procedures.

104. The DMD then set out the sources and repositories of the information

    reviewed for disclosure purposes, the Case Specific Review, the GDR and

    other ancillary matters.

105. An Addendum to the Disclosure Management Document ("ADMD") dated 13

    January 2021 (incorrectly dated on the document as "13 January 2020"), at

    paragraph 3 [UKG100017849_0001-0002], outlined the expansion to the

    counsel, P&P and disclosure review team since August 2020 and, among
                                    Page 41of 53
                                                                                      WITN10350100
                                                                                 WITN10350100




     other matters, detailed the progress to date.

106. I set out this background to the PCDE and the functions of individual members

     of the team in order to explain why I am unable to respond to the question

     asked of me. While I have no reason to believe that the specific

     documents/information mentioned were not disclosed at some point in time to

     appellants, I cannot myself say if and when that happened as regards each

     document and, to the extent there was any delay in so doing, whether that

     was agreed to by the appellants and/or sanctioned by the CACD_ If the Inquiry

     requires the detail of the disclosure exercise before and during the CACD

     proceedings, there are members of the legal team other than me who should

     be able to assist.

107. The rationale for the cut-off date was set out in the DMD at paragraph 5

    [POL00142261_0002] , which stated "Because the appeals are limited to

     prosecutions undertaken between the introduction of Horizon and the

     Prosecutor ceasing to act as a private Prosecutor, the relevant period for the

     purposes of disclosure is 1999/2000 to 2013 (the "Relevant Period")."

108. That period was explained further at paragraphs 19 to 21 of the ADMD

     [UKGI00017849_0008-0009]: Aria Grace Law (who represented three of the

     appellants) had requested that the Relevant Period should be extended

     beyond 2013. From correspondence and submissions, it had been

     understood that it was suggested that the Relevant Period should cover POL's

     conduct during the Second Sight review, evidence being given to the Select

     Committee and during the PCDE undertaken by CK.

109. Paragraphs 19 to 21 of the ADMD stated:

        (1) 2013 had been selected as the end date for the Relevant Period since

             it marked the time by which POL had ceased prosecuting. The trials
                                    Page 42 of 53
                                                                                    WITN10350100
                                                                               WITN10350100




           of all appellants had been conducted and concluded prior to this time.

       (2) The basis for the request had been the contention that POL

           deliberately misled the inquiries and/or deliberately failed to make

           proper post-conviction disclosure at the time. Unless a document or

           an event produced or occurring post-conviction provided evidence of

           deliberate conduct or misconduct before or during the proceedings as

           could render an appellant's conviction unsafe on grounds of an abuse

           of process at the time of trial (such as a later confession to past

           wrongdoing), then it had no relevance to the issues the CACD had to

           evaluate on abuse of process.

       (3) Additionally, POL had had particular regard to the fact that extending

           the Relevant Period would necessitate a very substantial expansion

           of the PCDE which was not possible within the timetable set down by

           the CACD. Such an extension to the Relevant Period would therefore

           have inevitably delayed resolution of the appeals. POL considered

           that this would be unfair to the overwhelming majority of appellants

           who had properly and understandably expressed the clear view that

           they wished their cases to be resolved as soon as possible.

       (4) POL noted that, at the hearing on 17 December 2020, the CACD was

           not prepared to entertain wide-ranging inquiries into POL's conduct,

           particularly where that conduct occurred after POL had ceased to

           prosecute cases involving Horizon in 2013.

110. At paragraph 21 of the ADMD [UKG100017849_0009], the document added

    "For the avoidance of doubt, some material post-dating the Relevant Period

    has been reviewed (and disclosed where appropriate) where it is relevant to

    POL's conduct and/or knowledge during the Relevant Period. However, where
                                   Page 43 of 53
                                                                                          WITN10350100
                                                                                     WITN10350100




     such material is relevant only to POL's conduct/knowledge after the end of the

     Relevant Period, it is not deemed disclosable."

111. In response to the ADMD, counsel for the appellants Scott Darlington, Stanley

     Fell, Peter Holmes (deceased), Rubina Shaheen and Pamela Lock ("the five

     Appellants") served a Disclosure Management Document on behalf of

     Edward Fail, Bradshaw & Waterson Appellants dated 1 February 2021

     (incorrectly dated 1 January 2021). In it, at paragraph 18, they argued to

     extend the period of disclosure to post-2013 material, not because they

     thought material might be relevant to Ground 2 of appeal per se, but because

     they wanted to rely on examples of misconduct as a form of "bad character"

     evidence.

112. In a Response to Disclosure Request made on behalf of Appellants

     represented by Edward Fail, Bradshaw & Waterson, dated 11 February 2021

     [WITN10350111_0001-0002], P&P explained again the rationale underlying

     the Relevant Period and declined to revise it [WITN10350111_0004]. In their

     Skeleton Disclosure Argument [POL00167828], dated 25 February 2021,

     counsel for the five Appellants indicated that on 15 February 2021 they had

     invited the CACD to rule on the issue and made their argument to extend the

     period of disclosure [POL00167828_0001-0002]. In paragraphs 3 to 7 of a

     Response to Disclosure Skeleton Argument submitted on behalf of Appellants

     represented by Edward Fail, Bradshaw & Waterson, dated 3 March 2021

     [POL00133185_0001-0002], which were drafted by (then) junior counsel on

     behalf of POL, those arguments were addressed in full. At paragraph 7

     [POL00133185 0002], counsel for POL noted "that none of the other 37

     Appellants in this appeal has submitted that the Relevant Period requires

     extension, nor that the interests of justice require a delay to the hearing of the
                                      Page 44 of 53
                                                                                        WITN10350100
                                                                                   WITN10350100




     appeals in order properly to advance the grounds for which leave to appeal

     has been given."

113. In its Reasons in support of Order of 10.3.2021 regarding Disclosure

     Applications [WITN10350103], at paragraph 2 [WITN10350103_0002], the

     CACD said "we are not persuaded that the abandonment of the 2013 cut-off

     point would make a material difference to the questions which the court will

     determine." At paragraph 3 [WITN10350103_0002], the CACD added "There

     is no justification for the suggestion that the Respondent's large and

     experienced legal team (which includes a substantial number of barristers led

     by two Queen's Counsel) have failed to ensure that proper disclosure has

     been provided to the Appellants. On the contrary, it appears that the review

     has been thoroughly and professionally conducted." The CACD concluded at

     paragraph 4 [WITN10350103_0002], "We agree with the Respondent that the

     disclosure process should not become open-ended. The approach adopted

     by the Respondent and sanctioned by the court remains proportionate and

     just."

114. Moreover, it is axiomatic that misconduct after the event of a conviction cannot

     render an otherwise safe conviction unsafe. Accordingly, the ADMD made

     clear that unless a document or an event produced or occurring post -

     conviction provided evidence of deliberate conduct or misconduct before or

     during the proceedings as could render an appellant's conviction unsafe on

     grounds of an abuse of process at the time of trial (such as a later confession

     to past wrongdoing), then it had no relevance to the issues the CACD had to

     evaluate on abuse of process (see paragraph 109(2) above).

115. 1 am also asked to what extent (if any) I consider the timing of disclosure to

     appellants and any cut-off date for documentation that was considered to be
                                     Page 45 of 53
                                                                                         WITN10350100
                                                                                    WITN10350100




     disclosable (1) impacted on the decisions of some appellants as to whether or

     not to pursue Ground 2 of the appeal and (2) influenced POL's approach to the

     concessions that it made, and what, if any, advice was given in this regard.

116. Insofar as point (1) of the question is concerned, I have no insight into whether

     the timing of disclosure and the cut-off date for documentation that was

     considered to be disclosable impacted on the internal decision -making of

     some appellants to pursue Ground 2 of the appeal. However, I believe that the

     paragraphs above, not least the CACD's clear reasoning for approving the

     Relevant Period, demonstrate that the Relevant Period for disclosure as set

     out in the DMD, and further explained in the ADMD, was correct.

117. In respect of point (2) of the question, POL's concessions to Ground 1 of the

     appeal in 39 of the 42 cases, and to Ground 2 of the appeal in four of the 42

     cases, related directly to the evidence underlying the appellants' cases within

     the framework of the grounds of appeal, which the CACD was being invited

     to determine.

118. I am asked to explain why the Disclosure Note in relation to the Context for

     'the Clarke Advice' [POL00038814] (as updated at [POL00142409]) does not

     address the August 2013 Clarke Advice. The context note was expressly

     designed to accompany the Submissions Document [POL00158692] (and

     see, in particular [POL00158692_0001 and _0004]). The August 2013 advice

     [POL00006799] covered the duty to record and retain material. It was

     immaterial to the context for, and the disclosure of, the July 2013 Clarke

     Advice [POL00006798], which was the advice that was the subject of Nick

     Wallis's application of 26 November 2020 (see [POL00158692_0002]).

119. I am asked if I consider the disclosure that was made in the CACD

     proceedings to have been sufficient and appropriate (including in respect of
                                     Page 46 of 53
                                                                                              WITN10350100
                                                                                         WITN10350100




       the detail and timing). Again, I do not have the detail, or the timing of, the

       disclosure made before or during the CACD proceedings. But in very broad

       terms and, given the CACD's view in March 2021 that the review had been

       "thoroughly and professionally conducted", I have no reason to believe

       otherwise. Again, if the Inquiry requires to understand the detail of the

       disclosure exercise before and during the CACD proceedings, there are

       members of the legal team other than me who should be able to assist.



Conclusions

  120. I am asked, whether in hindsight, there is anything I would have done

       differently in respect of the matters raised in my statement and whether there

       are other matters I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair.

  121. I have considered with great care whether there is anything I would or should

       have done differently. However, I cannot say there is. I gave my professional

       advice and arrived at my conclusions at all times based only on the

       information, knowledge and belief I possessed at the material time.

  122. I have sought to help the Inquiry in providing this detailed witness statement

       in response to the Inquiry's Request. I hope the information I have provided

       will be of assistance, not only to the Inquiry in fulfilling its Terms of Reference,

       but also to those affected, as well as enabling the Inquiry to understand my

       role and the context of my involvement.
