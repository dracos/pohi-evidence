business expert for elements of this factfile I am requesting your help in compiling this information. Claire
Parmenter from Bond Dickerson is overseeing this piece of work so would you please provide the
information requested and send to Claire. I appreciate that we are fast approaching Christmas but would you
please give this your urgent attention and let Claire know when you expect to be able to provide this
