Dear All

I would appreciate it if you would read the attached (you can ignore the spreadsheet). These are cases which are likely
to go into the mediation process as a result of the Horizon/Second Sight review now known as Project Sparrow.

There are two reasons to ask you to do this: firstly because I think you should be aware and, secondly, we need to think,
as an ExCo, how we share this information and take the learnings from it, which Angela van den Bogerd is currently
working on through the business.

If we get time at Monday’s Weekly ExCo, I would like to raise it then, otherwise we will pick up during AOB on the 15
October.

Regards
Paula

Paula:

As promised in today's call, here are eight examples of the incoming Applications. I've selected
those that are more clearly expressed than most of the others that we've been receiving. I'd
have also sent Case MO41 but it hasn't been scanned yet.

I'm also enclosing a spreadsheet that shows which ‘Thematic Issues’ each Applicant has
reported to us. It's probably not worth you looking at that before your meeting with Angela
and her team tomorrow but, in case you do, you only need to look at Rows 55 to 97 (those are
the Mediation Applications). The rows above that relate to the MP-sourced cases and those
that came in from the JFSA. In some cases the Mediation Applicants were already on the
spreadsheet so are cross-referenced to their earlier appearance. Where there are more
‘Thematic Issues’ marked on an MP-sourced case than on that same case's Mediation

Application that's because we know more about the case than has as yet been revealed in the
Mediation Application.
