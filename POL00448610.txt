fAuthor: I Asha Patel — Strategic Financial Planning & Analysis Director SROSoE Kathryn Sherratt, Interim CFO
el Sought: Review

The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of the FY24/25 Business Plan including Product Profitability analysis.
This Plan is the Executive's Recommended Plan for FY24/25 which includes self-funded ‘Other Change spend’ of s set out within the report.

This Plan has been prepared against the backdrop of Business Unit Strategic Priorities (as set out in the Appendix), recognising that this will need further development and guidance
from the Executive and Board as part of the 3-5 Year Strategic Vision.

Based on Investment Committee feedback, the Executive understand that there may be appetite for additional ‘Other Change Spend’ beyond U=24 In anticipation of this discussion,
this report includes a section covering ‘options’ on where additional investment could be directed with continued consideration sought to funding requirements, sustainable
affordability, strategic alignment, risk tolerance, return on investment as well as timeframe/capacity/practicalities of delivery and would welcome the Board's feedback and guidance

on this.

Network Shape
7 FY24/25 is expected to commence with 11,776 branches in the network. Churn is forecast at c.3.5%, broadly in line with the rate for 23/24. The network plan assumes the planned exit of 7 DMBs, 10

loss-making branches on exceptional remuneration and 45 ‘Hard to Place’ branches. It also assumes 200 net Drop & Collect (D&C) openings and the targeting of 70 Mains & Locals openings, co-funded
by postmasters. Subject to carrier agreements, a stretch plan could deliver up to 200 additional D&C, creating the headroom for 200 Outreach exits. This will be managed to reflect evolving market &
financial conditions subject to quarterly review. Overall, the network in March 2025 is forecast to be close to 11,600, remaining above the 11,500 target.

1 2 Risks & Opportunities

Risks & opportunities to the FY24/25 Trading Loss position include those that are trading related (page 27) as well as operating cost related (page 39). These are not included within the FY24/25
budget as there is a probability associated with these crystallising. There are also risks identified to Change spend (page 15), including RU & Inquiry which will be mandatory and ‘self-funded’ should
DBT funding not be made available e.g. to cover administration of the £75k payments, 1,500 late HSS applications, exoneration impacting Overturned Convictions, potential extension to the Inquiry
‘timelines and Capture related investigation, legal fees and compensation payments.
POL's current position of highest areas of Enterprise risk exposure remain in the following areas: Cyber Security, Technology, Legal, People & Operations (Retail & Franchise). There are 18 out of 81
intermediate risks outside of tolerance all of which have a remediation plan to bring into tolerance by an agreed target date (November ARC). However due to increased focus on the Inquiry, Media
attention, increased pressure on colleagues it is expected that several risks will remain outside tolerance for longer - subject to change spend ‘options’ being agreed through this review.

Options and Next Steps
1 3 Based on all considerations of this Business Plan, decisions on the quantum of ‘self-funded’ FY24/25 ‘Other Change spend’ must be balanced with a view of sustainable affordability. Whilst additional
change spend of say!ssse! in FY24/25 may not breach Security Headroom in FY24/25 it erodes the ability to manage cash flow and ‘self-funded’ investments in FY25/26 and beyond. This would be
further impacted by the expectation of af iTrading loss in FY24/25 as per this Plan, which would not contribute to positive cash flow optionality for future years.
Options on where additional investment could be directed within Maintenance, Efficiency and Growth categories are provided within this Plan with continued consideration sought to strategic
alignment, risk tolerance, return on investment as well as timeframe/capacity/practicalities of delivery. Feedback from the February Investment Committee also suggested ‘Innovation’ related
investment for longer term commercial development as well as investments within ‘Digital/ Automation’ which must also be considered. Options for. ‘Maintenance’ related investments would reduce
 entified risks, bringing these inte telerance within the aareed target. date 2 owrearnnrenrnomranmrvmravnvannanvranenenin

Historical Overview: Revenue vs Operating Cost base

‘ tion with Royal Mail, Mail revenues have declined by ind revenues from Government Services (including POCA/Voucher Encashment) have declined
RRELEVANT] Despite this and excluding the sale of Telco in FY20/21, Network revenues have remained broadly flat in comparison to FY13/14 levels due to the creation of
additional revenue streams through the Banking Framework and Non-Royal Mail revenues with other carriers.

However over the last few years, Operating Costs (Staff & Non-Staff costs) as a percentage of revenue and income have been increasing — a position that is
unsupported by the P&L, unaffordable and unsustainable.

Activity Based Costing analysis estimates that 52% of the FY24/25 Operating Cost base is focused on delivering key areas of DBT policy of sustaining the network (37%)
and cost of cash access (15%) — with the Network Subsidy Payment remaining at since FY19/20. There is every opportunity to “right size” the business through

effective strategic prioritisation and delivering sustainable efficiencies.

ans will enable co-ordinated revenue opportunities and cost reduction for long term profitability.

Limitations of this analysis:
This analysis centres around an allocation of Trading Profit ie. EBITDAS level of profitability as a KPI for POL trading performance. However based on Board member feedback
there are other elements that could be considered in assessing a ‘true’ sense of profitability, including:

Network Subsidy Payment from DBT in subsidising the cost of delivering the Network Access Criteria; this sits below Trading Profit and further work on ‘branch
ieval profitability’ is being carried out to assess the total cost of the uncommercial network in preparation for the FY25/26 Spending Review.

* Cost of ‘change’ activity e.g. cost of product development that sits within Exceptional spend or Capex or the cost of NBIT/ other network technology improvements

* The Postmaster ‘cost to serve’ i.e. the true cost for the Postmaster with an understanding of the PM Rem rate % aligned to time and motion analysis

Based on Board member feedback, this analysis could also be developed further for use as a tool in scenario modelling or investment appraisal, for example in assessing the impact
of cost reduction measures such a: or the potential impact of automation. Ultimately, we recommend an approach that balances the effort in developing this for other
uses against the value it could generate.

Notes for consideration

+ IFRS doesn't explicitly specify what should / should not be included in COS. It is mentioned briefly in various IFRS agendas/papers but is vague.
Judgement is therefore involved in classifying COS vs non-COS but must be appropriate and consistent - and we need to be able to justify any judgement.
* Often, reporting entities look to US GAAP which is slightly more detailed. It puts sales / marketing type costs in admin/opex/general type line items.

Currently, we don't split COS out in the ARA — so the impact at the moment on external reporting is minimal. However, there may be a time when this changes (a new IFRS
standard is due to take effect from 2027 which is more explicit in how accounts are presented)
