Hi Andy

The schedule is saying the original data is held by Fujitsu and that you were authorised to produce the
data in a disc format for me.

The schedules are requested as certificates of authentication of the evidence.

I’m happy to put your legal department in touch with our own Solicitors if need be.

Regards

Robert

Hi Andy,
FUJ00157004
FUJ00157004

This schedule is only used in cases in Scotland as law is different to the rest of the UK, the Procurator Fiscal (PF) (this is
Scotland version of the CPS) require that any evidence submitted in a case has a schedule submitted with it, this is
regardless of any witness statements produced.

The PF will not progress this case for us until the schedule is submitted.

I have copied Robert in to the reply, he might be able to explain Scottish Law a little better than me.

Many Thanks
Andrew

Hi,

Sorry for the delay but we are waiting on a reply from our legal department regarding the
wording in the schedule document that you have asked for us to sign, as it departs from the
agreed witness statements that we supply the Post Office on request.

I believe that a witness statement has already been sent regarding ARQs 291-298 Craigton
in March 2017 (PSA) which answers the questions within the schedule document.

We are curious why this new schedule document is also needed.

Thanks,

I spoke to you briefly about this at Bradford. Nothing has been received from Andy since I’ve been on
leave. It may be that he has sent it to the Guildhall as that was the last communication address he

had for me but I have asked for it to be sent to Springburn.

Can you assist in contacting Andy as this is urgently required by the PF.

Regards

Robert

Hi Andy

FUJ00157004
FUJ00157004

Please find attached a schedule 8 certificate in relation to the CD you provided me with for Craigton

Post Office last year.

The case currently sits with the Procurator Fiscal in Scotland who has instructed me to complete
schedule 8 certificates for all productions (exhibits). As the data for Craigton was downloaded on to a

CD and produced by yourself I need you to sign and date the attached certificate.

Can you print it off, sign, date and post back to myself at the address below.

Any queries please give me a call.

Regards

Robert
