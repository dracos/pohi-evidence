Belinda

As discussed, please find attached a half-page summary of the suspense account issue. I've also included a chronology
of this issue which I know is more than you wanted but I thought it might be useful background information.

Is this the type of thing you were looking for? If you're happy with it, I'd like to send it Al as I think he would find it useful.
I've spoken to Rod and he is going to do the note on "access to legal files".

Kind regards
Andy
