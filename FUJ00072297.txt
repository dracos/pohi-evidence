IM advises that the problem started when she transfered from counter No8 (by
mistake - should have been from counter Nol) £5590 to counter No3 and £3660
Ico counter No4 - while No8 was in the process ov rolling over! Consequently,
the cash left counter No8 in CAP 18 and arrived in counters Nos3 and 4 in CAP
h?. She eventually rolled the office, accepting the £9250 discrepancy and
then transfered £9250 from counter Nol to counter No8.

How was she able to transfer out of counter No8 while it was rolling over?

[fhe problem exists on line 11366 of the message store, whereby a user has
anaged to attach to an already attached individual Stock Unit. This can be
seen in the EPOSSUsers Collection for the Stock Unit "01". This problem,
therefore, is a failure in the logon checks within EPOSSStockUnit.

IF} Response :

the problem was caused by user JCAQ01 logging in on counter 4 ( see message
GroupId:182432><Id:4><Num:9008> ) whilst a stock unit was being balanced on
counter 3 where user JCAQ01 was already logged in. A message
kGroupId:182432><Id:3><Num:9921> was produced on counter 3 saying that the
session transfer had failed but in fact the log in succeeded and hence you
lot a user logged in to two terminals at once. This is a situation not
catered for in EPOSS code and hence you get the later problems already
ltescribed.

Inf it is desired to progress this further the bug must be assigned to the
lagent team to find out why the Stop Desk Transfer service failed to prevent
[the user logging in on counter 4 ( and subsequently doing the Transfer Out
hich caused the problems ).

[there was a short period on live where the EPOSS code was out of step with
the StopDeskTransfer code. The EPOSS code was still writing USERLOCKREQUEST
bbbjects instead of using interfaces in the new UserLockRequest library. With
both sets of code now using the UserlockRequest library the problem should
not reoccur.
