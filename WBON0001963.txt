We can send the printouts electronically by printing to pdf or file. I will check if we can produce an index
electronically but it can be misleading.

Pete, Matthew

Thank you for the below.

Whilst I think Jason would like to be provided with some further KEL entries, I am not sure that he knows which ones
he would like to see. To avoid Freeths requesting the entirety of the KEL, is there a way to generate an index of the
KEL from which Jason can the entries he would like to be provided with?

Also, is there any way to electronically provide KEL entries rather than a printout?

If it would be easier to discuss this on a call please let me know.

Many thanks

Amy

And a happy new year from me too.

We gave printouts of the KELs requested by Jason on the day. We would be happy to supply others if he has
the details.

However we did not cover the KELs relating to the pre 2010 period of Horizon operation due to time and
technical issues explained to Jason at the time. We could issue printouts of these requests as part of a repeat
the face to face exercise.

Hope this answers the question

Amy,

Lovely break, thanks, happy new year to you.

I will need to leave your questions regarding KELs to Pete, but to address your question about metadata in
the documents from Dimensions which have been uploaded: by metadata, I assume you are referring to
“Document Properties” including the stats on when a file was created, modified, etc.; the documents are in
the same state as they were downloaded, no cleaning up has been done, so any such metadata that was
present in the document when in Dimensions will still be there.

Hi Matthew, Pete

I hope you both had a lovely Christmas.

We had a meeting with Freeths last week and they mentioned that Jason Coyne would like to be provided with some
of the KEL entries. Please could you let us know if you have any concerns with providing these to Jason and, so as
we can narrow the number of entries requested, is it possible to provide us with an index of the KEL entries (both
current and historic) so as Jason can choose the ones which he believes to be relevant?

In relation to providing these entries to him, we explained to Freeths that extracting the KEL entries is not a simple
process and depending on how many Jason requests it may be difficult to do so in a manner which keeps the entries

metadata intact. I think when you have previously provided us with KEL entries these have been screenshots. Do you
have a method for extracting the entries in a way which maintains the metadata?

Also, I believe that the documents which have been extracted from Dimensions and uploaded to our HighQ site still
have their metadata intact but please could you confirm this?

Kind regards

Amy
