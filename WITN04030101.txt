newsbrief ww. I GRO!

This newsbrief is being sent to all senior salary staff. Please give it as wide
a circulation as possible amongst your team.

Senior appointments

The pace and scale of our technology-driven change is picking up fast and we must
ensure we are organised properly to take full advantage. I have, therefore, decided
to strengthen our top team in this area.

Paul Rich becomes Development Director, reporting to me as a full CEC member.
His brief is to sponsor the BA/POCL programme, including accountability for its
implementation and operation, together with the commercial relationships with
both the new automation supplier and the Benefits Agency. BA/POCL will be
delivered through a new business unit to be set up jointly with the Benefits Agency,
and called the Programme Delivery Authority. This will report to Paul for POCL.
Paul will also be developing the strategic partnership with the new supplier, which
will certainly mean significant changes in many areas of the business.

Bob Peaple will hand over BA/POCL sponsorship to Paul once a decision has been
made on the choice of supplier. 1 have asked Bob to widen his responsibilities by
taking on accountability for the overall automation transformational change
programme which involves all our major technology projects. This means
developing and setting out the automation vision for the next 5 years, and co-
ordinating its delivery. This will be in addition to his existing CEC portfolio
covering information systems and human resources strategies, and sponsorship of
two regions.

As a consequence of these changes, we will also be advertising shortly for the

Director of the Financial Markets business centre post. In the interim Mark
Douglas will continue to act in that capacity.
