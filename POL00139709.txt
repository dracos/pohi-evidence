ATM Losses — Police Investigation

Investigation

Following recent meetings, a member of Post Office Ltd Security (Aftab Ali) met with Ferdinand
Rozario, the investigating officer from Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU) on
Thursday 3 October 2013.

The meeting’s purpose was to hand over an evidence package to DCPCU which has been put
together by Post Office Security Team. The package provided by Post Office Ltd is the initial step
towards building a case against the suspected offender and relates mainly to two branches in detail
(Queensbury & Greenford) which are critical to the investigation, due to CCTV and the date of visit
by the engineer respectively.

Following the brief meeting the following action points were agreed;

e Post Office Security to arrange for Wincor to provide an expert witness statement relating to
Queensbury Post Office & its CCTV footage

¢ DCPCU to review evidence provided by Post Office Ltd in week commencing 07/10

¢ DCPCU to await evidence packages from other Financial Institutions

Conclusion

DCPCU emphasised that the case and evidence against the suspect needs to be thorough and robust.
Further work will need to be completed by DCPCU, Post Office Ltd and fellow victim organisations.
Due to the vast amount of the evidence being circumstantial, it is critical that due diligence and
attention to detail prevailed over instant intervention.

Post Office Security have arranged for an expert witness statement from Wincor to be provided
directly to DCPCU which is likely to be during week commencing 21/10.

Following the meeting and a review of the evidence package provided by Post Office Security,
DCPCU have indicated that an arrest is planned for 25/10 although this is subject to change.
