Subject: FW: Project Zebra

Dear all — following the 2 longish calls that I have had with Deloitte today, they have now come back in the email below
with a revised statement of the “deliverable” that they are proposing to produce for us. From my read of matter, it looks
basically OK, but I would be interested in feedback (especially from Rod). If the general consensus is that it is OK, I
would propose to ask Alwen to circulate the email to the Board with following message from me:

Dear all ~ as was trailed last Friday, Deloitte have been running significantly behind schedule in the production of their
report for the Board. A further draft version of it was produced on Bank Holiday Monday, but unfortunately (and despite
the involvement of additional partner from the forensic team and verbal assurances to the contrary) the document
produced was both opaque and failed properly to address the “exam questions” they had been set. The matter was.
accordingly escalated further within Deloitte this week and in consequence they have now agreed to re-work the
document into a more succinct “Board Briefing” note, addressing head on the alleged failings in the system. The email
setting out their approach is set out below.

The situation is far from satisfactory and Deloitte are in no doubt that they have significantly blotted their

copy book. They are also suggesting they need until Wednesday next week to finish the job, which again we are
pushing back on, hard. That said, we felt it important to let the Board know where matters stand currently, and the
reasons for the delay. I should add that there is no suggestion from Deloitte that there is somehow something “wrong’
with the system, or that it is not fit for purpose, rather our experience is that their internal review partner approach is
such that any positive (and helpful) statements that are made in early drafts are edited out before the draft is released
to us.

lam very sorry to be the bearer of the news of yet another delay.
Regards

Chris

Chris,

Further to our conversations today, I wanted to confirm the next steps we propose to take regarding Project Zebra.
These seek to create a shorter document for you (intended for Board circulation) which focusses on certain key (and
most relevant) aspects of our wider work to date.

This “Board Briefing” document will focus on the four questions we agreed by phone, being:

1. What comfort can be taken that Horizon only allows complete transactions (baskets) to be processed?

2. What comfort can be taken that the transactions completed in Horizon are ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with?

3. What comfort can be taken that Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged
record of all sealed baskets?

4. What comfort can be taken that Horizon provides visibility to sub-postmasters of all centrally generated
transactions processed to their Branch ledgers?

For each of the above questions, we will:
e List those relevant high level system design and process control features that we identified in documentation
provided to us;
e Describe the facts relating to the extent and nature of the Assurance Work we have seen;
¢ State what additional work could be undertaken to increase the level of comfort.

Our comments will be framed in the context and limitations of our work.

We estimate that this deliverable will take until close of play on Wednesday next week to produce and issue through our
review and signoff activities.

Please confirm that these points of focus are an accurate view of the next steps discussed this afternoon.
Thanks and regards

Gareth
