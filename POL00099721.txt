Dear Ron
Thank you for this.

There is much to do to make sure we learn all the lessons and I was reassured that, as you say, Angela
and her team are making good progress. The Swansea trip was definitely worthwhile.

Thank you for your offer of a regular update. I would prefer that you call me any time you need to, and
vice versa. The team are now well engaged and I would like thern to continue their leadership of the
work,

Kind regards
Paula

Paula:

Our telephone conversation was not only reassuring but also very

constructive. Would you like to set up a regular short update telephone call...
perhaps every two weeks... with Ian and myself? We would also be delighted to
come up to Old Street if and when you'd like face-to-face meetings.

I do hope you are finding the Swansea trip helpful.

Very best regards,

Ron

Paula: I'm so pleased you found all that helpful. Though by now you must be
exhausted and your email is therefore even more appreciated. I'm sure you'll have
a great day tomorrow with Angela and her team and Ian and I are both available at
any time if you need to speak.

Very best regards, Ron

Dear Ron,

it was good to talk to you earlier. Thank you for being available.

I have just read through the attachments. Apart from finding them very disturbing (I defy anyone not
to), Iam now even better better informed. The form you have devised is very helpful as it removes some
of the emotion and highlights very clearly areas we need to address as well as investigate for the
mediation process, which I hope will bring closure for some of these people.

I'm really looking forward to seeing Angela and her team tomorrow.

As I said when we spoke, I take this very seriously as I hope my trip to Swansea demonstrates. Angela is
doing a seriously good job, and I know you think so too. Both of you have my full support and you must

not hesitate to get in touch if needed.

Kind regards,
Paula

Paula:

As promised in today's call, here are eight examples of the incoming
Applications. I've selected those that are more clearly expressed
than most of the others that we've been receiving. I'd have also sent
Case M041 but it hasn't been scanned yet.

I'm also enclosing a spreadsheet that shows which ‘Thematic Issues'
each Applicant has reported to us. It's probably not worth you
looking at that before your meeting with Angela and her team
tomorrow but, in case you do, you only need to look at Rows 55 to 97
(those are the Mediation Applications). The rows above that relate to
the MP-sourced cases and those that came in from the JFSA. In
some cases the Mediation Applicants were already on the spreadsheet
so are cross-referenced to their earlier appearance. Where there
are more ‘Thematic Issues’ marked on an MP-sourced case than on
that same case's Mediation Application that's because we know more
about the case than has as yet been revealed in the Mediation
Application.
