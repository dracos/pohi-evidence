acknowledged by Post Office Ltd as a representative body of operators. The NFSP is the only
body with which Post Office Ltd will seek to discuss and consult on matters affecting operators,
subject to any legal, regulatory or political obligations. Such discussions will take place within
the existing and developing relationship framework.

Premises but not from any other location (unless otherwise agreed in advance in writing
between the Parties).

the performance or non-performance of the Operator's obligations in the Agreement.

The Operator shall notify Post Office Ltd of any changes to the nature of the Basic Business
(including through the addition of any new category of business), and Post Office Ltd may
terminate the Agreement on not less than 1 months’ notice, or immediately, if Post Office Ltd
reasonably regards such change as bringing Post Office Ltd and/or the Branch and/or its
business into disrepute.

Assistants and Training

The Operator shall ensure at all times that only Assistants have any access to or involvement
with the Branch and Post Office Ltd’s information systems, but this shall not restrict any access
by Post Office Ltd and/or its authorised representatives to the Branch and Post Office Ltd's
information systems.

The Operator shall comply with the Manual regarding obtaining Post Office Ltd's approval of
prospective Assistants and shall also cooperate fully in any ongoing periodic checks of
Assistants required by Post Office Ltd during the Term.

Where Post Office Ltd considers it necessary, it shall initially train the first Manager and such
number of Assistants as Post Office Ltd shall determine, in the operation of the System at the
Branch.

The Operator shall ensure that the first Manager cascades the training to all other Assistants
and to any replacement Manager in order to ensure that all subsequent Managers and all other
Assistants receive sufficient initial training from properly trained Managers.

Post Office Ltd may require the Manager and/or the Assistants to undertake further training at
any reasonable location and time during the Term if Post Office Ltd:

2.5.1 reasonably considers such training to be essential; or

training referred to in clauses 2.3 and 2.5 (including, as appropriate, salary, travel,
accommodation and subsistence), but the cost of delivering the training shall be met by Post

require in order to enforce this undertaking and/or to restrain any breach of it;

2.9.6 immediately notify Post Office Ltd of any request made to the Operator, an Assistant
or any other Personnel by any person for information which may be confidential
{including any Official Information and/or Personal Data) or any request for

Office Ltd, the Agreement or any related matter and shall not comply with such a
request until it has obtained Post Office Ltd’s written consent to the disclosure;

2.9.7 if there is any allegation or evidence of fraud or dishonest conduct or criminal activity
on the part of the Operator, the Manager, the Assistants, any Customers or any other
person, including any practice undertaken by the Operator (or any Assistant) with a
view to artificially inflating the Fees (as referred to in clause 10.4 of Part 3), the
Operator shall immediately notify Post Office Ltd and co-operate fully with any
investigation which may be made by Post Office Ltd's Investigation Division, the police
and/or any investigator appointed by any Client;

Assistants. The Operator shall ensure that the Manager(s) and Assistants attend this training.

expenses of travel, staff time and overnight accommodation where required. In all cases, these

the Operator is a company, a shareholder or director of the Operator) to make good any
deficiencies identified through the late account procedure and/or repay any other debts due and
owing to Post Office Ltd or any member of the Royal Mail Group identified after the Last Day.

{f the Operator (or, as appropriate, where the Operator is a company, the shareholder(s) and/or
director(s) of the Operator) breaches any of the terms of the Existing Contract or the
Agreement, or if the Operator breaches any requirements of clause 3 or 4 of this Part 3 or fails
to ensure that the first Manager and such number of Assistants as may be determined by Post
Office Ltd attend the initial training required pursuant to clause 2.3 of Part 2 prior to the Start
Date, Post Office Ltd will have the right, acting reasonably, to:

6.2.1 reduce the amount of the Transition Payment;

6.2.2 withhold all or part of the Transition Payment until such time as the Operator has
remedied (or has procured the remedy of) such breach (if remediable) to the
reasonable satisfaction of Post Office Ltd; and/or

6.2.3 take any other action it deems appropriate which may include recovering any
payment of the Transition Payment made to the Operator.

If Post Office Ltd:

63.1 discovers that the Transition Payment specified in the Preface when assessed against
Post Office Ltd’s normal principles for calculating the Transition Payment would
result in an overpayment to the Operator, it will notify the Operator as soon as
possible and shall not be obliged to pay the Operator the incorrect amount;

6.3.2 overpays the amount of the Transition Payment relevant to the Operator, Post Office
Ltd has the right to recover from the Operator, and the Operator shall be liable to
repay on demand, any excess payment. The Operator shall notify Post Office Ltd as
soon as possible having become aware of any such over payment.

No Waiver
The offer of the Transition Payment or any payment of the Transition Payment will not:

7414 prejudice any rights or remedies Post Office Ltd may have in respect of any breach of
the Existing Contract or occupation of the Operator's premises (where appropriate)
which may exist at the date of the Agreement or which may arise at any time
hereafter; and

71.2 result in Post Office Ltd and/or any member of the Royal Mail Group waiving:
(a) any breaches of, or rights or remedies under, the Existing Contract; or

(b) any obligations owed by the Operator (or where the Operator is a company any
shareholder or director of the Operator) under the Existing Contract before or
after the Last Day; or

(the payment of any money owed by the Operator (or where the Operator is a
company any shareholder or director of the Operator) to them, whether under
the terms of the Existing Contract or lease of premises or otherwise and
whether arising and notified to the Operator before or after the payment of the
Transition Payment to the Operator.

Payment Terms
Subject to this Part 3:

814 Where practicable Post Office Ltd will always aim to pay the Transition Payment on
the pay date immediately following the Start Date or, where that is not practicable,
on the next following pay date.

8.1.2 Payment will be made via BACs or CHAPs into the Operator's bank account
nominated by the Operator.

8.13 The Transition Payment shall be paid as a lump sum and Post Office Ltd shall not
stage payments, nor shall it make payment to tie in with any particular tax year of
the Operator.

If there is any dispute in relation to the Transition Payment or payment of the Transition
Payment to the Operator then the Transition Payment will only be paid to the Operator
following resolution of the dispute.

Where the Transition Payment is subject to VAT, the Transition Payment will be exclusive of
VAT due (which shall be paid by Post Office Ltd in addition). Where the Operator is an individual
and was the Existing Agent, the Transition Payment will be subject to National Insurance
contributions. The deduction of tax from the Transition Payment will depend on the Operator's
tax code in operation at the time of payment and the Operator acknowledges that the final tax
position will not be known until after the end of the tax year in which the Transition Payment is
paid.

Repayment of Set Up Costs and the Transition Payment

If the Agreement is terminated at any time prior to, or within 18 months of the Start Date,
then unless:

944 the termination of the Agreement was by Post Office Ltd in accordance with clause
16.1.1; or

9.1.2 a New Operator is appointed by Post Office Ltd at the Branch Premises,

the Operator shall, if required by Post Office Ltd, on demand, pay to Post Office Ltd a
proportion of the Set Up Costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in respect of the Agreement.

For the purposes of this clause 9, Set Up Costs means the costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in
relation to the Post Office Ltd Funded Works, the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment and any
other costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in respect of the Operator, the Branch and the Branch
Premises pursuant to the Agreement prior to the Start Date.

The amount to be paid under clause 9.1 shall be calculated by pro-rating the total Set Up Costs
in the same proportion as the number of days from the date of termination to the date falling
18 months after the Start Date bears to the full 18 month period, but in any event the pro-
rated amount to be paid by the Operator shall not be more than £6,000, Post Office Ltd will
notify the Operator in writing of the pro-rated amount owed and provide a breakdown of the
relevant Set Up Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Agreement is terminated prior to
the Start Date, or prior to Post Office Ltd notifying the Operator of the Start Date in accordance
with the Preface, the Operator shall repay any Set Up Costs to Post Office Ltd in full.

If the Agreement is terminated within 12 months of the Start Date, the Operator shall, on
demand, repay to Post Office Ltd a proportion of the Transition Payment. The amount to be
repaid under this clause shall be calculated by pro-rating the Transition Payment in the same
proportion as the number of days from the date of termination to the date falling 12 months
after the Start Date bears to 365 days. Post Office Ltd will notify the Operator in writing of the
pro-rated amount of the Transition Payment owed.

Fees Booklet

The Fees Booklet (and the Products, Services and Fees referred to in it) may be varied by Post
Office Ltd at any time by an amendment or addition to the Fees Booklet or otherwise by
written notification by Post Office Ltd to the Operator. Any such amendment or addition to the

Fees Booklet shall take effect on the date set out in the notification to the Operator, and it is
acknowledged that any such change may take effect immediately.

10.2 The Operator acknowledges that it shall not be entitled to receive any compensation or other
sums in the event of any variation to the Fees Booklet (and the Products, Services and Fees
referred to in it).

10.3. Those Products and Services listed in the Fees Booklet and marked with an asterisk (*) (Direct
Sale Products and Services) are those in respect of which either:

10.3.1 sales cannot be concluded in the Branch by the Operator and/or its Assistants but
can only be concluded as a result of Customers subsequently contacting internet
websites or call centres operated on behalf of Post Office Ltd; or

10.3.2 (where Post Office Ltd has specified this to the Operator in writing in respect of any
Direct Sale Product or Service), sales can be concluded both in the Branch and as a
result of Customers subsequently contacting internet websites or call centres
operated on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

In relation to Direct Sale Products and Services, the references in the Fees Booklet to “per
Transaction”, “per policy”, “per bond”, “per £1 sales”, “per loan” etc are references to the actual
conclusion of the sale of the relevant Direct Sale Product or Service, whether through such
websites or call centres or (where Post Office Ltd has specified in accordance with clause
10.3.2 of this Part 3) in the Branch, and do not refer merely to any introduction of Customers
to the Direct Sale Product or Service made by the Operator or its Assistants in the Branch.

10.4 Provided that the Operator complies with the Agreement, Post Office Ltd will pay the Operator
the Fees as follows:

10.4.1 — the Fees payable in respect of each Transaction (or series of Transactions) of Direct
Sale Products and Services which is attributable to an introduction made by the
Operator or its Assistants, shall be paid no later than 3 calendar months following the
date on which the sale of the Direct Sale Product or Service is concluded;

10.4.2 the Fees payable in respect of each Transaction (or series of Transactions) of all
Products and Services conducted using a Horizon, paystation™ or other terminal
shall be paid by the end of the calendar month following the Accounting Period in
which the relevant Transaction (or series of Transactions) took place.

For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any provision in the Fees Booklet, Post
Office Ltd shall not pay any Fees to the Operator in respect of any Transaction which Post
Office Ltd reasonably believes to have been undertaken by the Operator (or any Assistant) with
a view to artificially inflating the Fees (and where such Fees have already been paid by Post
Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd shall be entitled to deduct an equivalent amount from any future
payment due to the Operator).

10.5 Unless otherwise specified in the Preface with regard to the Fees in the first and second
Accounting Periods following the Start Date:

10.5.1 the amount of Fees payable from the Start Date shall be a variable monthly payment,
calculated on a “per Transaction” basis in accordance with clauses 10.4.1 to 10.4.2 of
this Part 3 and in accordance with the Fees Booklet; and

10.5.2 the Operator shall not be entitled to receive Fees after the date of termination of the
Agreement for Transactions carried out during the last one (1) Accounting Period of
the Term. The Operator acknowledges that this is reasonable in view of the advance
payment(s) made by Post Office Ltd to the Operator (or a shareholder and/or director
of the Operator) under the Existing Contract. The Operator may receive Fees in the
last calendar month during the Term for Transactions carried out in preceding
Accounting Periods.

10.6 If the Operator is not registered for VAT on the Commencement Date and is subsequently
required to register for VAT he shall do so and shall notify Post Office Ltd of the registration in
a timely manner. If the Operator fails to register for VAT when required to do so or fails to
promptly notify Post Office Ltd of his VAT registration, the Operator, and not Post Office Ltd,
shall be responsible for the value of any claim from HMRC for VAT on the payments made to
the Operator under the Agreement and the Operator shall reimburse Post Office Ltd on
demand and in full in respect of any such claim.

10.7 Where the Operator is registered for VAT, the Fees are exclusive of any VAT (which shall be
payable by Post Office Ltd in addition where applicable).

10.8 Post Office Ltd and the Operator agree that a self-billing arrangement will operate in respect of
the Fees due under the Agreement. Therefore the Parties agree that:

10.8.1 Post Office Ltd will issue self-billing invoices showing the Operator's name, address
and VAT registration number (where applicable), together with all other details which
constitute a full VAT invoice, for the Fees due to the Operator;

10.8.2 _ the Operator will accept each self-billing invoice raised by Post Office Ltd and agrees
not to raise VAT invoices for Fees due to it under the Agreement;

10.8.3. the Operator shall promptly notify Post Office Ltd if it becomes aware of any error in
the amount of VAT (if any) shown on any self-billing invoice produced by Post Office
Ltd;

10.8.4 — the self-billing arrangement will continue until the termination of the Agreement;

10.8.5 Post Office Ltd will inform the Operator if the issue of self-billing invoices is to be
outsourced to a third party;

10.8.6 the Operator will provide Post Office Ltd with its VAT registration number and will
notify Post Office Ltd immediately if it changes its bank details, becomes VAT
registered, changes its VAT registration number, ceases to be VAT registered, or sells
the Basic Business or part of the Basic Business;

10.8.7 the Operator is responsible for accounting to HMRC for the output VAT (if applicable)
shown on each self-billing invoice produced by Post Office Ltd.

11 Training costs

11.4 The cost of the initial training referred to in clauses 2.3 and 2.5 of Part 2 shall be met by Post
Office Ltd in accordance with those clauses. The cost of all other training provided by or on
behalf of Post Office Ltd in respect of the Branch shall be met by the Operator. Such cost shall
be as notified to the Operator at the time and shall be payable by the Operator to Post Office
Ltd within 7 days of receipt of an invoice.

and/or making safe or associated works at the Branch Premises (as applicable). If the
Investment Amount paid by Post Office Ltd to the Operator or any additional amount paid by
Post Office Ltd to the Operator in accordance with clause 1.2 of this Part 3, has not been
wholly used by the Operator for the Purpose, Post Office Ltd may reclaim (pursuant to clause
12.2 of this Part 3 or otherwise) all or such part of the Investment Amount or other amount
paid by Post Office Ltd which Post Office Ltd determines has not been properly used by the
Operator for the Purpose.

12.2 If the Operator at any time owes any money to Post Office Ltd under the Agreement or any
other contract or agreement (including any amount owed to Post Office Ltd by the Operator or
a shareholder and/or director of the Operator under the Existing Contract), Post Office Ltd may
deduct such money from any amount due to the Operator under the Agreement or any other
contract or agreement between Post Office Ltd and the Operator, including from the Fees, the
Investment Amount and/or the Transition Payment.

PART 4 - EQUIPMENT FOR A LOCAL BRANCH

1 Post Office Ltd will loan to the Operator the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment for the Term for
use in the Branch, subject to the Operator complying with its obligations in this Part 4.

2 The responsibility of each of the Parties for procuring and maintaining each item of Equipment
is summarised in Appendix 2 to the Preface.

3 Post Office Ltd may from time to time after the Commencement Date add or remove items of
Equipment for use in the Branch in Appendix 2 of the Preface by issuing a Notice to Amend but
the obligations to maintain and/or repair any item of Equipment in Appendix 2 as at the
Commencement Date shall not be varied. Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for the cost of
supplying and maintaining any such additional items of Equipment.

4 The Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment shall at all times remain owned or controlled by Post
Office Ltd. The Operator shall safeguard all Equipment and keep it in good condition (fair wear
and tear excepted) in accordance with the Manual (including any ancillary items supplied with
the Equipment, for example keys to the safe). The Operator shall be liable for any loss of, or
damage to, any Equipment where Post Office Ltd reasonably believes such loss or damage is
the result of any negligence by the Operator, his Personnel or otherwise or any breach of the
Agreement, wilful default, error or criminal act of the Operator or any Personnel.

5 Where Appendix 2 of the Preface so specifies, the Operator shall be responsible for arranging
and ensuring all repairs and maintenance of, and shall observe all statutory obligations and
regulations in respect of the operation of, the relevant iter of Equipment. Post Office Ltd will
maintain the Horizon equipment and Post Office Ltd shall be responsible, at its cost, for
repairing inherent defects in any other item of the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment which are
not caused by the act or omission of the Operator or its Personnel.

unless otherwise agreed by Post Office Ltd in writing, ensure that all Post Office Ltd Funded
Equipment is used exclusively for the operation of the Branch but the Operator may use the
bidi safe for the Basic Business as well as the Branch but only in relation to small amounts of
cash, on a short term basis and at the risk of the Operator;

not move any item of Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment (other than items which are intended
to be moved as part of their day to day use or for the purposes of maintenance and repair)
without the prior written permission of Post Office Ltd. The Operator shall be responsible for
the cost of moving any Equipment where such move is at the Operator's request or is
necessary to comply with legislation or regulatory requirements, unless Post Office Ltd agrees
in writing, at its sole discretion, to contribute to such costs. Post Office Ltd shall be responsible
for the cost of moving the Equipment where such move is at Post Office Ltd’s request;

be responsible for the continued operation of all Equipment throughout the Term and shall
ensure that any Assistants are trained in basic operations, replenishment of consumables and
follow security procedures. The Operator is responsible for reporting system faults and failures
to the appropriate helpline promptly and for ensuring resolution of such faults,

As part of the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment, in addition to the Horizon equipment, Post
Office Ltd may from time to time loan the Operator (and the Operator shall accept) a
paystation™ terminal for use in conducting Transactions and/or additional terminals or self-
service equipment (together referred to as the PO Terminals). Post Office Ltd shall act
reasonably in determining which PO Terminals to loan to the Operator. Post Office Ltd will
discuss with the Operator the position within the Branch Premises where the PO Terminals are
to be located, but, in the absence of agreement, Post Office Ltd (acting reasonably) will
determine such location. Where Post Office Ltd does provide PO Terminals, the Operator shall
ensure that they are used solely to conduct Transactions. Post Office Ltd will arrange (whether
directly or through the Operator) for the PO Terminals to be installed at the specified location.

The Operator grants to Post Office Ltd, its agents and employees an irrevocable licence at any
time during the opening hours of the Branch Premises, or at any time in the case of an
emergency, during the Term or any time following the termination of the Agreement, to enter
any premises or vehicle where the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment is or may be kept for the
purpose of inspecting it or recovering it.

Post Office Ltd will supply certain consumables (being those which can be ordered via Horizon
for use in the Branch) in reasonable quantities free of charge to the Operator. Any such supply
shall be subject to such conditions as Post Office Ltd may determine and Post Office Ltd may
limit or withdraw such supply at its discretion.

Any consumables which are supplied to the Operator free of charge by Post Office Ltd or on
Post Office Ltd’s behalf must only be used in the operation of the Branch and must not be
resold or transferred to a third party. Where the Operator has surplus consumables it should
advise Post Office Ltd of this fact and, as appropriate, arrange with Post Office Ltd for the
return of the excess quantity.

Where there is a dedicated official telephone line at the Branch Premises, which is used in the
operation of the Branch, the Post Office Ltd split billing policy (as contained in the Manual or
otherwise notified to the Operator from time to time) shall apply in respect of such official
telephone line. If Post Office Ltd determines that a second telephone line (which is in addition to

the one provided by Post Office Ltd) is required in order to operate the Branch, such second
telephone line shall be arranged by the Operator but will be paid for by Post Office Ltd unless
Post Office Ltd determines that such second telephone line is only needed because the
Operator is using unnecessary equipment on the first telephone line which has not been
approved by Post Office Ltd.

12 Approval of fixtures and fittings and equipment

121 The Operator shall use only fixtures and fittings in the operation of the Branch as shall have
been previously approved in writing by Post Office Ltd.

12.2. The Operator shall use only the Equipment or such other equipment as Post Office Ltd may
approve in writing in the operation of the Branch.

13 Signage and point of sale equipment

13.1 Immediately prior to the Start Date, the Operator shall at Post Office Ltd's direction ensure, at
its own cost, that any existing obsolete Post Office internal and external branding and signage
is removed from the Branch Premises. If the Operator fails to do so, and then fails to within 14
days of a written notice from Post Office Ltd requiring the Operator to remove such obsolete
branding and signage in accordance with this clause, Post Office Ltd may enter into the Branch
Premises during the Minimum Hours and without the consent of the Operator, remove any
such items at the expense of the Operator. The Operator shall pay such expenses to Post Office
Ltd on demand or Post Office Ltd may, at its option, deduct the value of such expenses from
the amount of the Investment Amount or other sums due to the Operator.

13.2. The Operator shall display in such manner and upon such external part or parts of the Branch
Premises as Post Office Ltd may reasonably direct, a sign or signs bearing the title of the
Branch (in the format “[blank] Post Office®”) (or such other words to similar effect as may
from time to time be specified by Post Office Ltd) and if the Branch Premises are in the
principality of Wales a bi-lingual sign (in the format “[blank] Syddfa’r Post®/Post Office®").

13.3. Post Office Ltd will, at its discretion, provide the Operator with Post Office internal and external
branding and point of sale equipment (including display units and leaflet dispensers) for use at
the Branch Premises. Post Office Ltd may require the Operator to renew or replace internal
and external Post Office signage and the point of sale equipment at the Branch Premises at the
Operator's cost but shall not impose such a requirement more frequently than once every 5
years.

13.4 Post Office Ltd may require the Operator to renew the internal and external Post Office signage
and point of sale equipment at the Branch Premises more frequently than once every 5 years
but Post Office Ltd will pay for such renewal.

14 ATM

14.1 If the Operator has an ATM at the Branch Premises for which he received remuneration from
Post Office Ltd under the Existing Contract, the termination of the Existing Contract between
the Parties and the entering into of the Agreement shall not have the effect of terminating any
existing agreement between the Parties relating to the installation and operation of that ATM
at the Branch Premises, regardless of any provision to the contrary in such agreement.

Post Office Ltd may amend the list of documents set out in this Part 5 and amend the contents
of any manual or documents on that list by giving written notification (which may be by
electronic means) to the Operator. In the Agreement, unless otherwise specified, a reference to
the Manual is a reference to it as amended, consolidated or extended by Post Office Ltd from
time to time.

The Operator shall operate the System properly so as to achieve the performance standards in
accordance with the provisions of the Manual current from time to time. The Operator shall not
make use of the Manual for any purpose other than for the operation of the Branch. The
Operator shall ensure that its copy of the Manual is kept up to date at all times, subject to Post
Office Ltd complying with its obligations in clause 1.2 of this Part 5.

In addition to the Manual, Post Office Ltd may issue to the Operator instructions which deal
with various classes of Products and Services to be transacted at the Branch and the design
and operational standards required to run the Branch.

All such instructions must be complied with immediately (unless otherwise notified by Post
Office Ltd) and must be kept up to date by incorporation of updates issued by Post Office Ltd.
They must be carefully studied by the Operator, its Manager and Assistants. No breach of
instructions will be excused on the grounds of ignorance.

PART 6 - NON COMPETE RESTRICTIONS AND HOW THEY AFFECT BRANCH PREMISES
A. During the Term of the Agreement, the following provisions shall apply.

The appointment of the Operator gives the Operator the right to transact, and to receive
payment for, certain items of business on behalf of Post Office Ltd. The conditions of the
appointment also involve such non-compete restrictions on the private activities of the
Operator in relation to the Branch Premises as are fundamental and necessary to ensure the
continued viability of the Network.

It is important to the future of the Network that all operators support Post Office® products
and services. An operator who offers products or services in its private retail business from the
Branch Premises which compete with Post Office® products and services can reduce the
revenue generated by the Branch and the Network. This revenue is essential to provide a
contribution to Post Office Ltd's fixed costs of maintaining the Network. Without this
contribution, Post Office Ltd might not be able to sustain the Network. It is therefore also in the
interests of all operators to support this principle.

It is also in the interests of all operators that Post Office Ltd is able to seek and negotiate
business opportunities for the whole Network and that it does not allow Clients or suppliers to
enter into arrangements directly with selected Post Office® branches only to the disadvantage
of the rest of the Network. This would adversely affect Post Office Ltd’s ability to maintain the
Network as a whole.

Operators benefit from being part of the Network. In addition to payments which operators
receive from Post Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd invests in advertising that brings Customers into
Post Office® branches, it ensures that Post Office® products and services meet regulatory
requirements and it provides customer and business services such as helplines to support
operators.

1.5. Accordingly, except as permitted by and in compliance with any waiver granted by Post Office
Ltd in accordance with clause 1,11 of this Part 6, the Operator must not undertake in a private
capacity, or allow anyone else to undertake in relation to the Branch Premises, the types of
business listed in clause 1.6 of this Part 6, as amended by Post Office Ltd from time to time in
accordance with clause 1.8 of this Part 6.

1.6 The non-compete restrictions on private business activities in relation to the Branch Premises
are as follows:

(i) business concerned with the provision of services relating to the collection, conveyance
and/or delivery of letters, parcels and packages (collectively called “Packets” in this
clause) including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing: the sale of stamps,
pre-paid postage labels and stationery with prepaid postage; the acceptance, retention,
sortation, return and redirection of Packets (including Packets containing mail order or
other home shopping goods and other Packets); and the acceptance of payment for such
services;

(ii) services for the payment of bills, the collection of payments (including pre-payments) or
the collection of revenue (whether by the sale of stamps or meter tokens, the charging
of budget keys or by other means) in connection with services for the supply of water,
gas, fixed line telephones, electricity, cable or satellite television, or local authority
services;

(iii) the sale of National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking, Building, Industrial and Provident Society, Friendly Society or Credit Union
business or otherwise making available banking facilities including, without limitation,
cheque-cashing, bureau de change (including the selling and buying back of currency, on
demand and pre-order services), collecting deposits or providing withdrawal facilities on
behalf of deposit-takers whether over-the-counter or through an automated teller
machine (ATM) or providing loans, credit cards or other forms of credit or credit
brokerage services but not including the provision of cash-back transactions or the
provision of basic saving stamp schemes which do not involve the return of cash to
participants in the scheme. For the avoidance of doubt, a cash-back transaction is the
withdrawal of cash via a debit card scheme, from the account associated with the card
used, as part of a transaction for the purchase of goods or services through the same
scheme; and

(v) any financial services business or otherwise making available facilities which may
compete with the financial services activities carried on or to be carried on by operators
at any time for or on behalf of Post Office Ltd or through Post Office® branches or
which may compromise the regulatory status of Post Office Ltd (including for this
purpose, its operators) in its role as appointed representative of Post Office Ltd’s

of competing financial services but not including the provision of basic savings stamps
schemes which do not involve the return of cash to participants in the scheme.

1.7. These non-compete restrictions apply to all methods of transaction of the areas of business set

products or services other than Key Products and Services, as defined in clause 1.9 of this Part
6.

1.9 Key Products and Services are the core products and services offered by Post Office Ltd. The
Key Products and Services are:

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend this list of Key Products and Services from time to
time. No new products or services will be introduced to this list which are not current or future
key sources of revenue and/or contribution for Post Office Ltd.

1.10 If the Operator is considering taking up a new private retail business opportunity which may fall
within the scope of the non-compete restrictions specified in clause 1.6 of this Part 6, it should,
before taking up any such business, inform Post Office Ltd of the circumstances and seek
advice as to whether the work concerned falls within the restrictions described above.

1.41 The Operator may apply for a waiver from the non-compete restrictions in clause 1.6 of this
Part 6. Post Office Ltd's waiver policy is available on request from Post Office Ltd. The waiver
policy sets out the circumstances in which a waiver may be granted and the procedures that
must be followed. This policy is subject to amendment by Post Office Ltd from time to time. If a
waiver is granted subject to conditions, the Operator must comply with these conditions. A
failure to do so will result in the waiver being invalid from the date the Operator ceased to
comply with the conditions.

112 The Operator must not use and must ensure that no third party uses the name “Post Office” in
connection with any of its private business activities (or the private business activities of a

company with which it is associated in any way) or in such a way as to imply that Post Office
Ltd is in any way connected with these activities. Nor may the Operator transact any private
business in a way that might lead Customers to conclude that Post Office Ltd is in any way
connected with that business.

The Operator must not engage Royal Mail Group employees to undertake any work whatsoever
connected with the Operator's private business (or the private business activities of a company
with which it is associated in any way) at any time when they are employed in Post Office Ltd
or Royal Mail Group duties.

The Operator shall promptly inform Post Office Ltd of any approach or enquiry made directly by
a third party (including any Client or supplier of Post Office Ltd) concerning the Products or
Services or any similar products and services.

B. For the period of 12 months following the date of termination of the Agreement the Parties shall
continue to be bound by the provisions of clauses 1.5 to 1.7 (inclusive) of section A of this Part 6.

installation of the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment at the Branch Premises agreed
between the Parties; and

1.1.2 completed in accordance with the requirements of Appendix 11 of the Preface and any
other specification and/or requirements issued by Post Office Ltd or notified to the

and throughout the Term. If the Operator (or, as appropriate, a shareholder and/or a
director of the Operator) is suspended by Post Office Ltd under the Existing Contract
at any time before the Start Date, or prior to Post Office Ltd notifying the Operator of
the Start Date in accordance with the Preface, the Operator shall unless otherwise
instructed in writing by Post Office Ltd cease any Operator Funded Works and/or
Post Office Ltd Funded Works that it is responsible for arranging (whether or not
such works are already in progress), pending Post Office Ltd's decision whether to
reinstate the Operator (or, as appropriate, a shareholder and/or a director of the
Operator) or to terminate the Existing Contract. Post Office Ltd shall notify the
Operator of its decision in writing, and if the Operator (or, as appropriate, a
shareholder and/or a director of the Operator) is reinstated under the Existing
Contract the Operator shall promptly resume such Operator Funded Works and/or
Post Office Ltd Funded Works, and the Parties shall each use their reasonable
endeavours to agree a revised timetable for the completion of all of the Fit Out Works
and the installation of the Equipment at the Branch Premises. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Operator continues to carry out any Operator Funded Works and/or Post
Office Ltd Funded Works during any period of suspension under the Existing Contract
such works shall be solely at Operator's risk and cost.

If the Operator or its contractors fail to comply with the requirements of this clause 1.1 and
Post Office Ltd incurs additional costs as a result, the Operator shall reimburse Post Office Ltd
on demand for those additional costs.

1.2 Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for arranging those Post Office Ltd Funded Works, if any,
which are specifically and expressly indicated in Appendix 1 to the Preface as being Post Office
Ltd's responsibility to arrange, and in particular, for entering into contracts with the relevant
