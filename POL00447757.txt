Please see attached IT consultancy request to engage BDO LLP for your consideration and approval.

Post Office currently has a basic forensics and investigations capability that now needs to be scaled up in terms of
maturity and capacity to respond to growing requirements from the business for these services and as part of the GLO
response. Jeff Smyth and Tony Jowett have agreed the scope of the procurement and deliverables with Declan Salter.
Purpose

To provide the Post Office with specialist consultancy services, to set-up and operationalise a forensics and
investigations capability within Post Office based off a detailed audit exercise and gap analysis of our tower vendor
landscape.

Scope of Engagement

The initial engagement with BDO is for up to 9-month for three key deliverables commencing on 7 September 2020;

1. Horizon audit capped T&M £230k
2. Operating model capped T&M - £30k
3 Training plan capped T&M - £20k

Procurement Exercise to determine supplier

Acompliant mini tender was run by Post Office using the Health Trust Europe Consultancy framework using our
esourcing tool W3. Eleven vendors were approached as part of this exercise based on the framework’s capabilities
matrix, POL received three compliant bids these were assessed both on written responses and through face to face
presentations and included a detailed review of resource composition, resource CV’s and prior experience. By quite a
significant margin on price BDO LLP were down selected following evaluation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
