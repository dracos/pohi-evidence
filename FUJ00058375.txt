Introduction

This document details the Direct Interface Test Specification between
Pathway AP System and POCL HAPS System. It identifies the requirements
that will be used to accomplish direct interface testing between POCL and
Pathway, as such this document must be owned and approved by POCL,
Pathway and the PDA.

2 Scope

The scope of Direct Interface Testing is to ensure that the system interface
between Pathway APS and POCL HAPS works at both the technical and
application level. It excludes end-to-end, model office rehearsal and model
Office test.

Direct Interface Testing only covers the transition of transaction data,
captured at the APS counter, from Pathway Central Systems to HAPS (shown
within dotted lines).

Legacy Systems HAPS APACHI
DPC AP
Clients
APS Counter Pathway Central System

Key:

Legacy represents the provision of the Automated Payments Service using

Systems. Automated Payments Terminals, ECCO equipment or ALPS
equipment.

HAPS is the Host Automated Payments System operated by IT SERVICES
on behalf of POCL.

APACHI is the Automated Payments at Chesterfield Interface, the link to
POCL’s client accounting and settlement processes.

DPC is the Document Processing Centre, the location at which paper
Automated Payments sales vouchers are converted into electronic
format.

AP Clients is the base of Automated Payments Clients on behalf of whom
business is conducted at Post Office outlets.

APS is the Pathway Automated Payments Service at Post Office outlets.

Counter

Pathway represents the systems, located outside Post Office outlets, that

Central process APS transactions and present them to the Pathway to HAPS

Systems interface.

3 Requirements

3.1 Overview

Direct interface testing is to ensure that the Pathway AP System and
the POCL HAPS System operate in accordance with the ‘Pathway to
HAPS Interface Specification’. Interface testing must satisfy a
successful file transfer taking place and ensure the contents of the files
includes data to support the Interface Specification. Thus the DIT
objective is to prove the interface only.

Direct Interface Testing is broken down into three stages, Pre-DIT, DIT-
1 and DIT-2. Each DIT stage is progressive in it’s testing, ending with
the DIT-2. By this time all external parties, i.e. RDP, TIP etc., should
be operating with an agreed set of data for all the Pathway Direct
Interface Testing activities.

3.2. Architecture

Pathway will have a system test configuration consisting of a Sequent
Server (the Host) and a Correspondence Server supporting several
outlets, at least one outlet having more than one counter position. All
testing will be carried out by Pathway testers under the direction of the
Pathway System Test Manager. It will encompass operation at a
variety of outlets & counter positions. The full architecture solution will
be tested as soon as it is available but may be deferred until Model
Office rehearsal.

3.3. FAD Codes.

The valid FAD Code to be used in the testing interface file header
record is 9990771.

FAD codes to be used in the construction of the test counters for Direct
Interface Testing.

FAD Code Name of Post Office
504770 Portadown
501680 Newport
004038 Chelsea
505038 Tottenham
007261 Aston Villa
506880 Hearts

3.5

The tests encompass the following steps.

Perform counter transactions on the Pathway test cells.

Harvest the transactions on to the Oracle Host and generate a
transmission file.

Send the transmission file from the Gateway PC at Feltham to the
Gateway PC at Farnborough, making the AP transmission file
available to POCL HAPS.

POCL HAPS rename the files to notify Pathway that the files have
been transferred successfully.

Check the integrity and content of the file conforms to the AIS.

Testing Requirements

3.5.1 Counter Level Tests

The following tests can only be executed if they are supported
by drop 1 of the RDS supplied DIT reference data.

A magnetic card recovery transaction.
A magnetic card fall back recovery transaction.
A bar coded bill recovery transaction.
A bar coded bill fall back recovery transaction.

The above transactions will be captured from more than one Post
Office outlet. Transactions will be for more than one client including

multiple

schemes for a client that has many schemes. Counter

transactions will performed on different days although included in the
same file. Additionally some transactions will be captured at a Post
Office outlet that has not had its end of day marker set for seven days.

The Client list to be used is contained within Section 8. (The Magnetic
Cards and Bar Coded Bills are to be supplied by POCL.)

3.5.2 File Level Tests

Large transfer file (i.e. maximum size as defined in the
interface specification [ref. 1]), this file test will be covered in
Pathway System Test. It can be made available to HAPS, but
it does not form part of the test conditions required for Direct
Interface Testing.

Null transfer file (i.e. header and trailer only).

File of magnetic card transactions only. (Including reversed
and reversal transactions.)

File of bar code transactions only. (Including reversed and
reversal transactions.)

File of mixed magnetic card and bar code transactions.
(Including reversed and reversal transactions.)

More than one transfer file.

Duplicate transmission i.e. same file sent twice with the same
file name.

Transfer file sent out of sequence.
Break in transmission of transfer file.
Re-transmission of above file to same gateway PC.

Re-transmission of above file to alternative PC. (Technical
test which does not form part of Direct Interface Test.)

3.5.3 Infrastructure Tests

Hardware failures of encryption box, router, hub and gateway
PC.

Password failure at the gateway PC.
Operation with and without encryption devices.

Digital signature verification.

3.5.4 Documentation Required To Support The Tests

Reporting

Detailed transaction report per office per test day. (Receipt
copies from the counter printer.)

APS reconciliation reports.

Test timetable showing the days on which HAPS is required
for Direct Interface Testing.

The logical testing window will be March 13" to April 16": as
such all transactions in the interface file will relate to these
dates.

Test schedule showing the tests that will be performed on
each day, their sequence and their duration.

Specific Automated Payments Clients lists to be provided by
POCL. (Contained in Section 8)

Each party will use its own fault reporting system. Pathway will log any
incidents using the fault reporting system PinICL. The incident number will be
passed back for future progression and clearance.
