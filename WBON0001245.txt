Andy — I attach my mark up of the latest draft info sharing Protocol, which hopes to reflect the call I had
with UKGI on Tuesday.

Thad toyed with putting in place a mechanism for naming the UKGI personnel who can receive our info
(along with a mechanism for changing that), but decided against it given UKGI’s commitment in cl’s 1.5 and
1.6 of Appendix B to maintain records of Individual Recipients and ensure they are aware of the
confidentiality obligations.

Could you please cast your eye over it and let me know (by phone or email) of any comments?

Thanks, Rod
