Carl

Just to let you know, the Advisory Board has asked for a copy of Nick’s letter to the Lord Chancellor and the associated
legal advice. They have asked for it before their meeting tomorrow and our view is that release is entirely
appropriate. Given that, we will send both in the morning and simultaneously publish on our website.

If you would like me to advise anyone else in Government for awareness, please could you let me know.

Best wishes.
