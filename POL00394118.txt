3.4.2 Release Principles
Post Office require that Fujitsu Services shall undertake the delivery of the Services
to meet demanding business requirements. Failure to meet contracted performance
targets will incur performance penalties. In order to deliver Services which meet the
contracted requirements and performance levels at an economic price it is essential
that Fujitsu Services is empowered to manage all aspects of Service delivery and
this must include the control of new Releases. Fujitsu Services recognises that Post

Fujitsu Services Service Management Service : Service Description Ref: CS/SER/014

Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 31-Dec-2002

3.4.5

Office has a legitimate interest in the business functions that are provided by the
Service and needs to be assured that the quality of the delivered systems meets the
contracted requirements. The processes, tests and quality reviews which are
required will be open to Post Office and Fujitsu Services will particularly seek
active participation in tests of business functionality and the Human Computer
Interface. It is recommended that Fujitsu Services take complete responsibility for
the management of Releases in line with the contractual commitments requested by
Post Office.

Release Contents

Fujitsu Services recommends that the content of a Release should require the
agreement of Post Office with respect to the introduction of new Services or the
deletion of existing Services or changes to existing Services which affect the
essential business functions of Post Office. All such changes to Services should be
initiated through the Change Control Procedure.

For the reasons which are set out above Fujitsu Services should retain clear
responsibility for all other changes to Release Contents. Such changes may be
justified for many reasons but including for example: contract compliance, quality,
technical strategy and cost control.

Release Distribution Timing

There shall be only two circumstances when Post Office should determine the
timing of the distribution of new Releases. One is when a new Client is connected to
the Service for the first time, and the other is where a major new service is being
introduced which Post Office needs to manage (e.g. NBS). In all other
circumstances the control of the distribution of Releases should be at the discretion
of Fujitsu Services.

Release Activation Timing

Fujitsu Services recommends that the timing of Release activation should require
the agreement of Post Office with respect to the introduction of new Services or the
deletion of existing Services or changes to existing Services which affect the
essential business functions of Post Office. This includes the release of Reference
Data as detailed in the CCD entitled ‘Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd/Post Office
Ltd Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change-Reference Data’
(CS/PRD/058). All such changes to the Services should be initiated through the
Change Control Procedure and it is anticipated that any particular favourable or
unfavourable times for the activation of Releases will be declared in the change
request.

Fujitsu Services believes that in all other circumstances the responsibility for the
timing of the activation of new Releases should be at the discretion of Fujitsu
Services.

3.4.6 Release Testing

Fujitsu Services will provide evidence that each Release has been tested so that it is
shown to meet the Service requirements and Service Levels. Post Office will be
invited to participate in those tests associated with proving business functionality
and Human Computer Interface aspects of new Releases. Other evidence will be
provided in the form of written test reports and invitations to attend quality review
meetings. Evidence of testing for major Releases of new software and functionality
will be provided at the levels of:

Unit Tests
System Test
Representative combinations of hardware and software.

The release testing strategy above is too heavy for testing minor Releases of
software or for Reference Data and appropriate procedures will be defined for
different classes of Release.

Such testing shall be carried out in accordance with the CCDs “General Testing
Policy” (VI/POL/001) and “Testing and Integration Strategy” (VI/STR/001).

3.4.7 Preparation for Release

Fujitsu Services will complete the testing of major new Releases in three steps prior
to full distribution of major new Releases. These are:

e A Test conducted in a simulated branch and operated by real and
representative Post Office users.

e A test of implementation and live operation in a limited number of Branches
for a limited period before general distribution.

e A test of reversion to the previous Release.

The release testing strategy above is too heavy for testing minor Releases of
software or for Reference Data and appropriate procedures will be defined by
Fujitsu Services for different classes of Release.

Fujitsu Services shall provide proof of sufficient and satisfactory preparation for the
implementation of a Release. This shall include testing the implementation,
reversion, regression from the Release, and the support of any testing by Post
Office.

3.4.8 Release Planning

In respect of each Release Fujitsu Services shall provide a release plan, for
agreement by the parties prior to the Release, documenting how the parties intend
the Release be deployed in Branches and assessing the risk to and impact on the
Services. The release plan shall include details of the matters referred to in
paragraph 3.4.9 of this schedule together with details of agreed timescales or
periods (if any) during which the Fujitsu Services may revert to the previous
Release. The parties acknowledge that during deployment of most Releases, there is

3.4.12

3.4.13

a point beyond which it is impractical to revert to the previous Release and,
accordingly, the release plan will also document the parties’ agreement on the stage
at which this point will arise (if at all).

Release Approval

The following shall be approved by Post Office before any Release, this approval
not being unreasonably withheld:

a) the contents of any Release;
b) _ the upgrade path for any Release;
c) the timing of the distribution of any Release;

d) _ the timing of the activation of any Release.

No Disruption to Users and the Working Environment

Releases of software and and/or Reference Data will be distributed across the
network and therefore will require minimal user involvement and no significant
disruption to Users or to the working environment.

No Corruption to Post Office Data

The data within software and/or Reference Data is protected at source by a CRC
check key which is applied by the Riposte system. Following distribution of the
Release, the CRC is checked to ensure that no corruption of the data has taken
place. The Release of software and/or Reference Data will not cause any corruption
to data held on behalf of Post Office.

Record of Releases

A record of the Release of software and Reference Data which is in use at each
Branch will be maintained under configuration control within an asset database
which is maintained by Fujitsu Services.

Availability in Branches

Fujitsu Services shall be permitted to suspend availability in the Branches of the
NBS and/or any of the Applications (other than NBS) or Infrastructure Services
outside the Post Office Core Day, at such times and for such periods of time as
agreed in advance with Post Office (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld) in connection with implementation in Branches of each major Release.

responsibility for the integrity of the process, liaison with Post Office and

investigation of equipment and electrical supply health and safety issues) will now
be excluded from the scope of Fujitsu Services’ problem management activity and

problems;

a) Investigating and managing the resolution of exceptional volumes of incidents
experienced by individual Branches.

b) Investigating and gathering information on problems across Branches.

c) Acting as on-site Project manager for complex OBC changes to marshal

f) Monitoring of Branches that have recently experienced multiple incidents and
problems.

Fujitsu Services will manage a complaint procedure as documented in the working
document entitled ‘End to End Customer Complaints Procedure’ (CS/PRD/081).

Measurement and Management of Satisfaction

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will measure satisfaction at regular intervals by
means of the scorecard mechanism.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will agree the service areas to be measured and the
scoring and importance criteria. Where there is a disparity between the Post Office
scoring definitions and the Fujitsu Services definitions and no agreement can be
reached between the parties then the Post Office scoring definition will be used and
a mapping to Fujitsu Services definitions will be agreed.

Where the Parties agree Fujitsu Services will provide an appropriate service
improvement plan. Post Office will provide clear guidance, as an input to this plan,
actions it would expect Fujitsu Services to complete to attain a target score, such
actions to be within the scope of the current service.

Fujitsu Services will report on progress against the service improvement plans
