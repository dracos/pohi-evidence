Hi Shirley

Mrs McAlerney was pursued for the amount of £10,587.44 but the Judge only awarded Post Office Ltd £5000.00
(judgment sum) . This was over two Follio’s (land Registry) : Follio 25972 & Follio 19661. My line Senior line manager
{Alison Bolsover) was asked back in March this year to consent to the sale of Follio 25972 (sale being forced by Danske
Bank} on the understanding Mrs McAlerney proposed £200 per month to POL if consent was given. Alison gave
consent but to date no payments have been forthcoming.

Hope this helps

Kind regards

Hi Ladies

’'m assuming we would have made a claim after she became a former. Do we have any record of this claim?

Hi Andrew

Hope you’re well.......

Mrs Katherine McAlerney was subpostmaster from 30 August 2000 until 19 January 2007.

There was a civil claim raised by POL: can you advise how much the claim was for? (The final account balance was
£10,587.44 short)

Many thanks
