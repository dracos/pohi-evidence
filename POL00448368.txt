OPTIMISING THE USE OF ALBs IN 2 cvormen
SPECIALISED DELIVERY mesmens

Where government does deliver through an ALB it must optimise the set-up of, and interface with,
that ALB in order to enable its success. The policy, legislative and funding frameworks must be
right, and there must be clarity on how government interacts with the ALB

+ Inthe case of ALBs with a specialised delivery function, there are critical success factors across
seven key areas for practitioners to consider

ENHANCING GOVERNMENT AS AN UF covraan

EFFECTIVE OWNER-SHAREHOLDER mesmens

* Government as owner has a number of sponsor responsibilities: customer, policy setter, funder,
regulator, and owner / shareholder — the success of an ALB will depend in part on government
fulfilling these responsibilities effectively and with the right capabilities

+ Differentiating between the responsibilities effectively can also help to surface natural tensions, and
so enable better decision-making

+ Behaviours and expectation-setting on both sides are extremely important to shaping
performance and accountability; these need to be constantly maintained
