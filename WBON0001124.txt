Subject: Privileged - Group Action [BD-4A.FID26896945]

Angela

Just left you a VM. I was hoping that I could get an hour of your time to discuss a point for POL's defence in the Group
Action.

Its regarding the processes for SPMRs to dispute TCs / Shortfalls. We have a clear idea of how those matters are
raised in the first instance (via NBSC or by calling the contact number of the TC). If the matter isn't resolved at that
point, it then gets a little blurry how the matter is then escalated and resolved.

We've spoken with Kath who has provided some insights but we've not yet got a fully clear picture (and I think we've
exhausted Kath's knowledge in this area). Tony believes this is a key point in the Defence.

I'm reaching out to you as someone who might be able to shed some light on this subject or perhaps you could point
me in the right direction of someone else.

If you're around, please can you let me know when you might be available in the next few days.

Thanks
Andy
