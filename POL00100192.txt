Attachments: Prosecutions Policy Paper Feb 2014 CCA 04 02 14 FINAL.pdf

Please find attached a prosecutions policy paper from Chris A. We will have a full debate about this at the ExCo next
week but because of the timing of the ARC on the 11° and the circulation of paper tomorrow, Chris would like you input
asap.

Specifically he needs sign off from Kevin, Neil and Chris D, before circulation to the ARC.

Thanks
Alwen

Subject: Prosecution Policy Paper

Alwen,

On behalf of Chris Aujard please find attached a paper on Post Office’s prosecution policy. Paula has asked if ExCo could
consider this paper quickly as possible. Paula has also asked for Kevin Gilliland, Neil Hayward and Chris Day to explicitly

sign off the paper.
We need EXCO clearance to allow this paper to be amended and circulated to ARC in time for the 11 february meeting.
Many thanks

David
