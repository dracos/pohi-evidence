chris and I met today - so important that you know the team are pushing harder on all aspects, as we

agreed with the Board.

That said, this is a useful further challenge Neil - your point is well made Cie.,

thank you!

Chris, we need to look again at the agenda for the 16/9 meeting. (And also whether this might

view re the judicial review advice we considered in June?)

As you run this through, I wonder if you could also see if there is any way
that we could use this leak (seriously damaging our reputation etc) to
stop/alter the process that we are involved in. It's a long shot, but it
would be great to find a faster/better way out of Sparrow

Cheers

Neil

Dear all

Further to my note on Friday, a report on the leak has been broadcast within
the last few minutes on BBC Radio 4. It is inaccurate and clearly we will be
challenging these inaccuracies.

We will circulate a fuller update.

Best wishes

Mark
