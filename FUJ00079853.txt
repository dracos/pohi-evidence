2.1

Introduction

Not all incidents that arise at the helpdesk can easily be resolved using the
incident management process [Ref.2]. Some incidents have a wide impact,
some may be difficult and time consuming to resolve, whilst others may arise
as a result of a single underlying issue. Therefore, some incidents may
require referral into ICL Pathway Customer Service, as well as being passed
through their regular incident management support routes, to aid resolution.

A key element for success in the resolution of incidents that are referred to
ICL Pathway CS is an effective Problem Management process.

Scope

This document details the ICL Pathway CS Problem Management process.

The process begins from the point that a problem has been identified. The
process has been broken up into the major Problem Management elements
as reflected within the “Deployed Process” in Section 3.

It is important to note at this stage that, where required, each element also
distinguishes between the management of a problem that requires input from
the PON Problem Management team (Cross-Domain problems), and those
that are resolved solely as ICL Pathway problems.

Objective of Problem Management

“To identify the root cause of incidents and thus prevent the recurrence of
incidents stemming from a single source.”

- Reference: CCTA, IT Infrastructure Library - Problem Management.

5 Problem Management Process

The process followed by the Problem Manager to ensure the resolution of a
problem depends upon whether the problem is internal to ICL Pathway, or a
cross-domain problem that requires managing with a PON BSM Problem
Manager.

5.1.1 Assign Problem Manager

There are two routes to log a assign a Problem Manager to a Problem. If a
problem is identified within the CS department, the problem originator assigns
the Problem to the Problem Manager best placed to manage it. If a problem
originates outside of the CS department it is routed to the CS Duty Manager
first. The Duty Manager (DM) then assigns the Problem to the Problem
Manager best placed to manage it.

5.1.2 Provide details of the Problem

The DM or the CS problem originator provides the assigned Problem
Manager with all the available details of the Problem.

Log Problem

All the details of the problems, along with any action taken to date, must be
logged on the database [Ref.3]. This includes cross referencing the problem
to any existing incident numbers or linked PinICL numbers, and also the PON
problem number if the problem is a cross-domain problem (see Section 5.3).

Analyse Problem

The Problem Manager contacts the originator of the problem in order to
understand, if necessary, the problem more fully. It also allows the originator
to know who the Problem Manager is and be informed of the Problem
Reference number. The Problem Manager is then in a position to define the
problem. If the problem already exists, the originator is notified of the Problem
Manager dealing with the existing problem.

Assess Impact

If the problem doesn’t already exist, the Problem Manager assesses the
impact of the problem. This allows the problem Manager to decide who is
impacted by the problem so that they can be informed and kept updated.

Prioritise

Having assessed the impact of the Problem the Problem Manager assigns a
priority to the problem. The priority defines how urgent the problem is.

The Problem Manager also determines the closure criteria for the problem,
i.e. the conditions under which the problem can be closed. This is also
captured on the database.

lf required, the Problem Manager can inform the HSH to set up a Master
Incident to capture incidents arising as a result of the problem. The priority of
the problem could subsequently increase (or be lowered) if the volumes of
incidents arising changes dramatically.

5.3.1

5.3.3

Assign Resolution Owner

At this stage the Problem Manager must decide whether or not the Problem
impacts the Post Office Network (PON), i.e. a cross-domain problem.

If the problem is internal to ICL Pathway (or is a cross-domain problem for
which ICL Pathway has resolution responsibility), the Problem Manager
determines and agrees which unit is responsible for problem resolution. In
many cases, via the Incident Management process [Ref.2], the problem will
already be assigned to a unit for resolution. The Problem Manager therefore
confirms problem resolution ownership with the unit.

If the problem is identified as cross-domain the PON BSM Problem
Management team is contacted [Ref.1]. Once a PON BSM Problem Manager
has been established the Problem Managers from ICL Pathway and PON
agree the priority of the problem, and also decide which organisation is
responsible for the resolution of the problem.

Agree Action and Update plan

A plan of action (including target dates) and an update schedule is then
agreed with the Resolution Owner. The Problem Manager is then in a position
to monitor the resolution progress and take action should any delays occur.

If the Problem is cross-domain, then having agreed which organisation is
responsible for the resolution of the problem, the Problem Managers agree
the closure criteria, i.e. the conditions under which the problem can be
closed, and also an update schedule to keep each other informed of
progress.

Requirement for a Temporary Procedure

Whether the problem is cross-domain or internal to ICL Pathway, the Problem
Manager decides if a temporary procedure (TP) is required to address
incidents arising as a result of the problem whilst a permanent solution to the
problem is being developed. If a TP is required, see Section 5.7.

Identify Root Cause

If ICL Pathway is responsible for the resolution of the Problem, whether or not
it is an internal problem or a cross-domain problem, the root cause of the
problem must be determined before any feasible solution can be developed.

Develop permanent solution

Having identified the root cause of the problem the Problem Manager ensures
that the resolution owner develops and proposes a permanent solution to the
problem, all the while keeping the Problem Manager updated with progress.

If responsibility for resolution lies within PON, the PON BSM Problem
Manager ensures that a proposed solution is developed.

Agree solution

lf ICL Pathway is responsible for resolution, the Problem Manager agrees the
proposed solution with the resolution owner. If the problem is cross-domain,
the Problem Manager must also agree the solution with PON BSM Problem
Manager.

lf POCL are responsible for the resolution of the problem, after having
developed a proposed solution, the PON BSM PM will agree the solution with
the ICL Pathway CS PM.

Implement solution

If ICL Pathway is responsible for the resolution, then after having agreed the
proposed solution, the Problem Manager ensures the process for
implementing the change is initiated. In many cases, this requires the
initiation of the formal Change Management process [Ref.4].

If PON is responsible for resolution, then once the solution has been agreed
with the ICL Pathway Problem Manager, the PON BSM Problem Manager
ensures that the solution is implemented.

5.5.1 Monitor Solution Implementation
The Problem Manager monitors the resolution and implementation of the
problem to ensure constant progress against deadlines. If deadlines are not
being met, or progress is slow, then if necessary, the Problem Manager can
escalate (see Section 5.8) the problem to ensure continuous progress against
requirements.
5.5.2 Solution Implemented
Once the solution has been implemented, the Problem Manager determines
whether the problem has been resolved. If not, then action must be taken to
understand why the problem still remains and to ensure that a solution is
developed that resolves the problem. Again, escalation may be used to
ensure that resources are available to develop a solution to meet target
deadlines.
If the problem has been resolved, the Problem Manager can move on to
closing the problem.

5.6.1 Requirement for a PIR

Before the Problem is formally closed the Problem Manager decides if a Post
Implementation Review (PIR) is required. In the case of a Cross-Domain
Problem, either organisational Problem Manager can request a PIR. A PIR
should take place if the Problem Manager was unhappy with the way that the
problem was resolved. The Review should include all the main players within
the resolution of the problem with a view to running through the problem and
determining which parts of the process could have been implemented more
efficiently. The end result is to initiate improvement actions to ensure that the
process is operated as it should be or ultimately improved. The PIR is
presided over by the Problem Manager who requested it.

5.6.2 Close Problem

If a PIR is has been carried out, this should be used as the authority to close
the problem. The problem is closed after all actions arising from the PIR have
been completed.

If the problem was cross-domain, it can not be closed until agreed with the
PON BSM Problem Manager. If agreement is required from the PON BSM
Problem Manager, evidence of their agreement to close is required, i.e. letter,
email, fax etc.

Temporary Procedure Development

If a Temporary Procedure (TP) is already in place then the Problem Manager
determines whether or not the TP meets current requirements. In the case of
cross-domain problems, the Problem Manager agrees with the PON BSM
Problem if the existing Temporary Procedure meets requirements.

Note: Cross-domain temporary procedures are agreed between the Problem
Managers of both organisations. Once agreed, the TP is known as an
Authorised Temporary Procedure (ATP).

If an existing TP meets current requirements then no further action is taken
until the TP is withdrawn.

If an existing TP does not meet current requirements, or no TP is yet in place,
the Problem Manager ensures that a TP is developed, recorded and
registered, and finally implemented. Development of the Temporary
Procedure must include an implementation and withdrawal plan.

If a cross-domain problem requires an ATP to be developed, the Problem
Managers agree which organisation is responsible for developing the ATP.
The Problem Manager of the organisation responsible for the development of
the ATP ensures that an ATP is developed. This is then agreed with their
counterpart, recorded and registered, and implemented.

Until Problem resolved

The (A)TP remains in place until a permanent solution has been developed
and implemented. During this time, the Problem Manager(s) regularly review
and monitor the (A)TP to ensure that it is working as it should.

Withdrawal of the Temporary Procedure

Once a permanent solution to the problem has been developed and
implemented, the temporary procedure is withdrawn. This must be carried out
in a co-ordinated manner alongside the implementation of the permanent
solution.

Escalation

Decision to escalate

During the life of a problem, the Problem Manager constantly monitors the
progress of the problem resolution to ensure that everything is on track and
that target deadlines are being met. At any point during the Problem
Management process the Problem Manager can escalate the problem.

The process of escalation is intended to bring increasing levels of
management attention and/or expertise to bear upon the resolution of a
Problem. Escalation should be considered to be an exceptional resort.

Escalation to a higher level will normally occur either:

e When an issue is causing increased concern through time delay and
consequent impact, or

« When it has not been possible to reach agreement on some aspect of the
definition or management of the issue.

Escalate

The Problem Manager escalates the problem to the next level of
management.

Note: If a cross-domain problem is being escalated, the Problem manager
must ensure that the counterpart organisational Problem Manager is informed
so that escalation can take place to the same level within the partner
organisation. This ensures that the same management levels are aware of
the situation should they need to contact each other.

Manage Escalated Problem

The Problem Manager manages the escalated problem through to its
resolution, acting as the interface between the higher levels of management
now involved and those who are already involved in the resolution of the
problem.
