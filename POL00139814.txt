Following our meeting a couple of weeks ago, I am now getting round to sending out the information I promised.

I have attached a presentation at training for your auditors that Lindsay and I did at the end of 2013. This sets out the
prosecution process and terms used in Scotland but please do not hesitate to contact me with any queries. I have also
attached an extract from the minutes of the meeting we had with Cartwright King which highlights the differences
between Scotland and England. I am sure you are aware of these but sometime I think it is useful to have something
written down.

I have also listed our new charge out rates which will apply from 1 April 2015. As it states in our letter of engagement,
these may change from time to time and generally this happens at our year end.

Grade (Current INew Rate
STANDARD (01/03/2015
Partner £220 £230
Associate £198 £210

Sen Solicitor £176 £185
Solicitor £165 £175
[Trainee ( 2 year) £115 £120
[Trainee ( 1%* year) £104 £110

I have sent Rob a copy of the invoices which we issued last month to Jarnail along with documentation which I think
assists with finding the purchase order that has been set up in relation to bto.

I think we will be speaking in a couple of weeks but if you have any queries in the meantime please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Kind regards
Laura
