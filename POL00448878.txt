Greetings Robert,
All the best to you and for your project.

There is not a quick answer to your questions in the U.S.
It is a work in progress and not yet consistent across the U.S.

I will begin to reply here and possibly when I return from my travels next week we could get on Zoom
or WhatsApp call.

Many changes have been made and even more are being made.
In my 40 years of policing I have seen a lot of attention paid to this topic, especially in recent years,
and it is uncomfortable for many people to discuss it.

The codes have been affected by self-examination, respect, immigration, lawsuits, activists, news
media, changes to the U.S. Census, and more.

Also, there are global differences. For example, when traveling in the UK years ago I learned that
people from India are referred to as Asian. Whereas, Asian in the U.S. refers to people from China,
Korea, Japan, etc.

Another example is that in the 1960's in the U.S., the code "N" referred to "Negro," which was the
socially accepted ethnicity. It changed to "B" for "Black" early in my career in the later 1980's /
1990's, as Black or African American are the proper terms today.

M for Mexican changed to H for Hispanic to be inclusive of all Latin American countries.

POL00448878

The wording as described in the attachment you sent is not something we have done.
What is most common here from a policing perspective are codes like B (Black) , H (Hispanic), W

(White - many years ago it was C for Caucasian, A (Asian), C (Chinese). I do not know for certain
what today's code are but can find out.

There is a lot more to discuss. Here are some links to some of what I am referring to as to a variety of
aspects of thsi that are ever-changing.
In 2015, California passed the Racial and Identity Profiling act (RIPA), mandating all state and local

law enforcement agencies to collect and report detailed information about every person detained
and/or searched by police.

The five racial designations in the Hate Crime Statistics Program are: White, Black or African
American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In
addition, the (Uniform Crime Reporting) UCR Program uses the ethnic designations of “Hispanic or

We can dicuss this more if you want to.

Subject: RE: Ongoing

Good morning Trond and Mike,
Further to the below from Gavin, as he explained I am seeking to identify whether identification codes that describe a
person's ethnicity are in use by law enforcement in other countries and if they are to obtain examples of them and an

understanding as to why they are used.

The British police service started to use identification codes in the 1970's following the introduction of the Police
POL00448878

POL00448878

National Computer (PNC). Whilst in a different format, such codes are still used today in radio traffic communications to
support stop and searches and for the purpose of supporting the criminal justice system in relation to convictions.

The attached word document was used by the British Post Office in their investigations and to supply details to the

Police prior to a person appearing at court charged with offences against the Post Office. Research and enquiries

indicate that identification codes that were used by the Post office are an exact replica bar the spelling mistakes with
those used by the Police in the 1970's. Whilst the British Police service thankfully moved forward and updated the

codes, the Post office failed to keep up with modern methodology and acceptable descriptors.

You will note that the codes contain several spelling mistakes and outdated and offensive language, the latter having

been the rationale for the fact-find that Gavin was asked to support.

Whilst I have identified the use of identification codes by the Police in South Africa (These being different to the UK), I
would be grateful if you could please help me with identifying other countries that use identification codes in policing,

examples of what are used if possible and the reason why codes are used.

Happy to explain further via Teams.
Wishing you a happy Easter.

Kind regards

Rob

Hi Mike and Trond (cc Rob),

I hope you are both well? I’d like to introduce you to Rob Hazell, an ex-British Police Officer and now an investigator with
the U.K. Post Office.

Vl let Rob explain in more detail, but as part of the ongoing miscarriages of justice in a major investigation involving the
Horizon computer system, I was asked to be the Ethics Monitor in a separate ‘fact finding’ project. As part of my final
report, I recommended that Rob contact each of you to enquire if you were aware of any generic ethnic codes to
describe suspects in criminal investigations: Mike in his role as Chair of the IMPACT section of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and Trond in his role as the Scandinavian link for CEPOL.

I will let Rob make contact and hopefully you can have a good and detailed conversation around the topic area. Many
thanks,

Gavin
