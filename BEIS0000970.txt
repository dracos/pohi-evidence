Subject: Post Office - withholding funding

Hi Imogen,

lam just giving you a heads-up that we will be putting up a short submission in the next few days
recommending withholding funding to Post Office (POL) due on 1 October as it is still working
through getting control on its litigation costs which feeds in to BEIS approving POL’s annual budget.

Sarah had a meeting with POL which included discussing this topic on 2 July so hopefully fairly fresh in
her mind. We believe the decision to withhold payment should be straightforward but, ahead of 1
October, we just require Sarah’s approval and signing of a letter to POL asking them to a meeting to
understand progress on this matter (post 1 October) and reminding POL they are ensuring their
litigation cost decisions are best value for money for POL.

Please feel free to give me a call if you'd like further background.

Thanks,
Meet
