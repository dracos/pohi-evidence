Just reading the emails, I believe Peter is dealing with this in my absence, and to avoid anyone going off at a
tangent he will drive any requests for information you may have through to the relevant FJ staff concerned.

Dear Brian,
I refer to Anne's email below.

Mr Castleton has this morning made an application to resume the trial arising from the late
disclosure of the document Anne referred to in her evidence. The application must be heard by
21 December at the latest. In the circumstances, please can I ask you to supply the document
immediately so that I can send it to Mr Castleton.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards.

I do not myself have direct access to the archived system (Tivoli) event logs; they are held by our Security
team and I have not looked at the logs for Marine Drive since 2004 (before they were archived), apart from
checking 1st April 2004 following one of your queries the week before last. Until that point I was not aware
that they were available. Obviously when questioned about them in court, I had to acknowledge that they
were still available, even if not rechecked by me.

I will make sure your request has been received by the Security team on Monday.
Regards,

Anne.

Dear Anne,

Firstly, many thanks to you and Andy Dunks for attending Court to give evidence this week
which was helpful. The judge has reserved his judgment which will probably be given in the
new year. Thanks also to Brian and his team for helpfully providing information about the
Falkirk branch on short notice.

In any litigation, the parties involved have a continuing obligation pursuant to the Court rules
to disclose all documents that may help or hinder their case or the other side's case. In this
context, a "document" means anything in which information of any description is recorded, so
it includes, just for example, a computer database. Previously, I had asked Fujitsu to let me
have all the info it had and had been helpfully given HSH call logs, transaction logs and events
logs. 1 was also recently told that there was a message store which had everything else on it
and we invited Mr Castleton to look at it this, but he didn't take up the opportunity.

However, whilst giving evidence you told the Court that there was also a different sort

of events log, not included on the message store, that we had not seen or disclosed for the
Marine Drive branch. Mr Castleton has telephoned me today and asked for a copy of this to
be supplied to him immediately.

The Court has ordered Mr Castleton to make any application for a resumed hearing resulting
from the P.O's late disclosure of this document by 19 December. Going back to Court now the
trial appears to be concluded is the last thing we want, but we will do this if we need to. Iam
not sure what application Mr Castleton would make. Possibly he may say his case was
prejudiced by not having this information made available earlier.

I anticipate that nothing will probably turn on the document you referred to because you said
it didn't contain any errors that would cause the losses, but the P.O are nevertheless under an
obligation to supply it and if we don't, could face court sanction. Please can I therefore ask
for it to be emailed to me as soon as possible on Monday morning so that I can in turn send it
to Mr Castleton.

I look forward to hearing from you.
