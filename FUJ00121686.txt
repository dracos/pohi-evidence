Subject: Actions post Conference Call - Cleveleys

Keith,

As discussed during the conference call this morning I shall be endeavouring to provide the following information by
close-of-play Wednesday.

1. Overall description of support arrangements in place during 2000 for PMs from 1st line through to 4th line.

2. Numbers of staff employed at each level. I suspect there will be a ramping-up during the year to reflect the increasing
number of Outlets being rolled-out.

3. Evidence of 'clean start' to Mrs Wolstenholme's time in the Outlet.
4. Comparison of HSH calls made by Cleveleys and other 6-Counter Outlets by overall volume and profile of call types.
5. Count of ‘re-boot’ closures based on actual HSH call transcripts.

I believe that it would be beneficial for us to meet to agree the content and refine any linkage between our two sets of
information (re-boot closures is an example of where I think we'll need to get together to agree what we're actually

saying).

I then anticipate that this information will be forwarded to Weightman's for drafting into one or more Witness Statements
for us to agree and sign.

Please come back to me if this differs from your view.

Regards,

Jan Holmes
