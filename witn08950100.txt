POST OFFICE HORIZON IT ENQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF KEVIN RYAN

|, Kevin Ryan, will say as follows —

1. | have made this witness statement to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out to me in the Rule 9 Request dated 18 October
2023 (the “Request”). The Request contains 60 questions, which | have
considered and addressed within this statement. | would like to make the Inquiry
aware that | have received legal assistance to produce this statement from my
solicitor, Mr lan Manners of Ashfords LLP. When seeking to obtain assistance
from Ashfords LLP, | was assisted by the Post Office Limited (POL) with the initial
stage of confirming the availability of insurance coverage, to cover the associated

legal costs.

2. | confirm that everything that | include in this statement is to the best of my
recollection of matters. There have been instances where | have not been able to

recall something due to the amount of time that has passed and, therefore, | have

Page 1 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

had to rely on a document provided to me. Where this is the case, | have ensured

to indicate this clearly.

Background

3. 1am currently employed by POL as a Security Manager and | have worked within
the organisation for almost 40 years in many different roles. | would like to flag
to the Inquiry that the Request refers to me joining the POL Security Team in
2011 and being and Investigation Manger from 1998 to 2011, however, this is

incorrect.

4. | first joined POL in February 1985 as a Counter Clerk at a branch in Liverpool
and | stayed in this role for 5 years until August 1990. From this point until June
1991 | held various acting Branch Manager roles in a number of Post Offices on
Merseyside. | was then appointed to the Assistant Branch Manager role at
Prescot Post Office until March 1995. | was then a National Training Coordinator
for POL between March 1995 and August 1997, which involved the scheduling of
relevant classroom and in-branch training for new Subposmasters (SPMs). This
training was delivered to SPMs by POL National Field Trainers and would relate
to the role of a SPM. | then became a National Field Trainer myself in August
1997, and | would deliver this necessary training to SPMs in classrooms and at
branches all over the UK. | stayed in this position until March 2005, and then went
on to become an Area Intervention Manager for the North West Region. This was
for a period between April 2005 and August 2006 and it entailed working under a
Retail Line Manager and going in to branches to resolve issues such as balancing

difficulties and non-compliance to procedures. | cannot recall for certain, but |

Page 2 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

think that these issues would have been relayed to me by the Retail Line Manager
| was working under, who | believe would have obtained that information from
data analysis produced by Chesterfield (the POL central finance department),
customer complaints via the helpline, area managers, clerks or SPMs themselves

following self-reporting of issues via the POL helpline.

. In September 2006 | became a Business Development Manager for POL, initially
covering branches in the Mansfield and Nottingham areas before moving to the
Liverpool and Warrington areas. This role involved assisting SPMs with driving
sales of Post Office Products and services. | stayed in this position until March
2010 and then moved on to become a Horizon Migration Manager in April 2010
for a short period until early to mid-August 2010. During this role | worked on a
National POL project which involved the roll out of the new generation Horizon
software system. | would go out to branches on the day they were due to undergo
the relevant update of the Horizon system to ensure that the update ran smoothly.

This was an overnight download of software.

. Later in August 2010 | became a Transitional Manager within POL, when the
previous project ended. This was not a specified role as such - it was simply a
position whereby | remained employed by POL until a suitable role came up to
apply for internally. If a suitable role did not come around | was able to take
voluntary redundancy instead. After some time in this position | was initially going
to opt for redundancy, but around December 2010 vacancies were advertised on
the POL internal systems for Security Managers within the POL Security Team. |

recall that the job description set out that the role would entail a combination of

Page 3 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

Fraud Investigation and Physical Security. | decided to apply for the job and |
was invited to a question and answer style interview. Shortly after the interview |
was told | was successful in obtaining the role and | went on to start in late January

2011.

. | cannot recall if any specific pre-training or expertise was required in order to
apply for the role of a Security Manager, but | believe that my wide experience of
working in various POL roles by this time most likely went in my favour when
applying for the position. At the point | became a Security Manager | had been
with POL for 26 years but | had not gained any experience in investigations or

physical security.

. In terms of initial training for my role as a Security Manager, | recall going on a3
week course at some point in February 2011 which was delivered by Paul
Whitaker and Paul Southin (who were Security Managers for Royal Mail). |
remember that the course covered numerous topics including interviewing under
caution, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), Conducting
Searches, taking statements, gathering evidence, writing investigation reports
and putting investigation case files together. There were likely more topics
covered, but these are the main ones that | can recall. | deal with this in further

detail later in this statement.

. | understood at the time that the investigation side of the Security Manager role
involved looking into potential fraud or crimes committed within POL | knew that
this entailed interviewing suspected offenders, conducting searches of premises

Page 4 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

(if necessary), gathering evidence and putting together case files for submission
to the POL Legal Team. In terms of the Physical Security side of the role, |
understood that this involved implementing necessary security measures
following robberies and burglaries at branches, as well as general equipment
deployment to ensure security in branches and cash in transit centres, such as
alarms, CCTV and any other security equipment available. | would like to flag to
the Inquiry that during the years that | have been a Security Manager for POL, |

have carried out much more physical security work than investigatory work.

10.When | first became a Security Manager, | reported to a Team Leader. The Team
Leader that | reported changed many times over the years and | cannot recall
every single Team Leader that | have had, nor when they changed. | do remember
at some point the following individuals have been my Team Leader - Leslie

Frankland, Keith Gilchrist, Simon Hutchinson, Helen Dickinson and Simon Talbot.

1

a

. At some point in July 2013 | temporarily stepped in to a Team Leader role, during
which | had to report to a Senior Security Manager, who | think was Andrew
Hayward at the time. | was asked to cover the role temporarily when the current
Team Leader (Keith Gilchrist) left until a permanent replacement was found.
During my short time as a Team Leader | think | had around 3 or 4 Security
Managers reporting to me, The ones | can recall are Mike Stanway, Steve
Bradshaw and Robert Daily. | do not recall providing any in-depth supervision to
those Security Managers, but | do remember doing some of their performance
reviews and conducting one-to-one meetings with them. | note that
[POL00129337] shows a one-to-one meeting | conducted with Robert Daily, and

Page 5 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

[POL00136728] shows a one-to-one meeting | conducted with Steve Bradshaw.
| stepped back down to the position of Security Manager at my own request after

6 or 7 weeks and | have not had anyone report to me since.

12. In all of my time working within POL’s Security Team, I have never had any reason
to doubt the competence or professionalism of any Team Leaders, Senior
Management or other colleagues. | have always believed that everyone has been

highly professional and competent throughout my career within POL.

13.When an investigation was carried out, Security Managers would be required to
complete disciplinary reports as part of the case file, which were then passed to
the Contract Manager dealing with the branch and SPM involved. It would then
be the Contract Manager who would make a decision as to whether the SPM
would be suspended or not if this had not already been done. Security Managers,
including myself, had no involvement in this disciplinary process other than

providing this report.

14. In terms of interviewing suspected offenders, this was part of my Security
Manager role, however, it would be the Lead Investigator who would ask the
majority of questions when interviewing a suspect. | was only a Lead Investigator
on a small number of cases before it was decided that POL would no longer
pursue any new prosecutions. | believe this change came in late 2013. | was a
2nd officer more often in cases, meaning that | would attend interviews to assist

the Lead Investigator. | would then have either no or minimal further involvement

Page 6 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

in that case. | deal with this in further detail when addressing questions on the

prosecutions of Mr Khayyam Ishaq, Angela Sefton and Anne Neild below.

15. As far as | can recall, it was Lead Investigators on cases who would have
assisted with disclosure in criminal proceedings. In the small number of cases
where | was a Lead investigator, | would have been involved in gathering
evidence for disclosure and providing it to POL’s Legal Team to be reviewed and
disclosed to the defence. | do not believe | had involvement in directly providing
disclosure the defence — it would be the POL legal team who would do this. In the
cases where | was a 2nd Officer, | would not have been involved in the disclosure

process at all.

16. | am not aware what litigation strategy is and | do not think it is something | would

have been involved in.

17.1 do not believe | would have had any liaison with other POL departments when |
was a 2nd Officer in respect of progressing cases. However, where | was a Lead
Investigator on a matter | would have liaised with the relevant Contract Manager
to let them know when it was decided whether a prosecution would be pursued
or not and to keep them updated on the progress. | would do this because the
Contract Manger would often want to know this information before making a
decision to terminate or reinstate a suspect. By this point the Contract Manager

would have likely already suspended the particular suspect. Unfortunately, |

Page 7 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

cannot remember any specific examples of me doing this but | do recall that it is

something | did.

18. | would also have liaised with POL’s Legal Team when my casefile had been
passed across to them. For example, | would have liaised with the Legal Team
when gathering disclosure which was included as part of the casefile or about
obtaining further evidence if they requested this. | do also remember occasionally
liaising with POL Financial Investigators, to inform them about the background of

a case if they were taking it on to progress from a recovery standpoint.

The Security team’s role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions

19. | confirm that | have reviewed the following documents, but | would like to flag to
the Inquiry that the majority of them were produced before | joined the Security
Team in January 2011:

20.1 do not recall seeing any of the first 21 documents listed in paragraph 19 above,
prior to receiving these from the Inquiry. It may be that some of those 21
documents that were dated later (such as in 2009 and 2010) were provided to me
when | joined in 2011, however, due to the passage of time | cannot confirm this

for certain.

2

.| note that document [POL00105229] relates to Police National Computer Access
(PNC) access, which | believe allowed a user to see if a suspect had previous
convictions or pending prosecutions. PNC access was obtained by the Post
Office Security team not long after | joined and | do recall this document being
circulated at some point early on in my Security Manager career for reading.
However, | had no real use of this document other than as a guide for requesting
information because | did not personally have PNC access, as it was strictly
limited. Access to this was limited to the Post Office Security admin team based
in Chesterfield and if required we would request information from them that had
to be authorised. This would be authorised by a Security Operations Team Leader

or Senior Security Manager.

22. | do also recall the following documents being circulated, but | cannotremember
exactly when, nor who circulated them: [POL00104929], [POL00105226],

[POL00031005), [POL00027863), [POL00030902).

23. What | can confirm is that | had no involvement in the development of any of the

documents and polices listed in paragraph 19 above.

Page 11 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

24. | have been asked to describe the Organisational Structure of the Security Team.
| am aware that that the Physical Security Team and the Fraud and Crime
Investigation Team used to form two separate sections to the Security Team.
When | joined the Security Team in 2011 as a Security Manager, these roles
merged and became to be known as the Security Operations part of POL’s
Security Team. At this tine Security Operations consisted of three teams which
were responsible for geographical areas in the UK (North, Midlands and South).
Each of the teams had a Team Leader and approximately 18-20 Security
Managers based across the country for each geographical area. This has
changed as the years have gone by as the number of Security Managers has
gradually reduced to its current level of 8 Security Managers covering the whole
of the UK and only 1 Team leader. In terms of other sections to the Security Team,
| do recall that there was a Financial Investigation Team, a Commercial Security
Team and an Casework Team in the earlier years of my Security Manager career.
| cannot recall what any of the other sections of the POL Security Team were, but

| believe when | first started there were 4 or 5 different sections.

25. | believe that internal POL Investigation Policies governed the role and conduct
of Security Managers that were carrying out investigations. As mentioned above,
| believe that | have only seen later polices released around and after 2011. In
particular, | remember often referring to the flow charts in [POL00104929] and
[POL00105226] when | was still relatively new to the role, as | found them to be
a useful resource. | recall that there were changes over time to internal POL
procedures and policies, as the number of investigations carried out were

reduced over the years, however, | cannot recall what these changes were. In

Page 12 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

terms of legislation the main legal frame work that governed the conduct of
investigations was the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). There was likely other
legislation we were required to be aware of in addition to PACE and RIPA, but |

cannot recall what they were.

26.1 confirm that | have considered [POL00104900], [POL00105191],
[POL00123309] and the attachments at [POL00123310], [POL00123311] and
[POL00123312]. | cannot recall seeing these documents before they were
provided to me with the Request and | did not have any involvement in the
development of investigation policies within POL post-separation. | do not recall
separation having much of an impact on the way investigations were conducted,
however, | had only just been appointed as a Security Manager as separation

took place so | may not have noticed or realised any differences.

27. | do not recall ever having a complaint being raised about the conduct of an
investigation by the Security Team so | am not aware of what the process relating
to complaints would have been. | expect any complaint would have been raised

upwards to the Head of Security via Senior Security Managers.

28. Supervision was regularly provided through Team Leaders to Security Mangers
conducting criminal investigations. Team Leaders would check in with the
Security Managers and provide support if it was required and chase for updates

on matters. They would also double check case files before they were sent over

Page 13 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

to POL’s Legal Team to make sure they were in order and that all required steps

had been followed.

29.1 do also recall when | first started to take on my own investigations, | had a mentor
who would be my 2"¢ Officer at the interviews | conducted and provide guidance
and support with the next steps to take and with running the casefile in general. |
had this mentor until | was experienced enough to independently conduct

investigations as a Lead Investigator. My mentor was Steve Bradshaw.

30. | do not recall there ever being a difference to the policy and practice regarding
the investigation and prosecution of Crown Office employees in comparison to

SPMs, their managers and assistants.

Audit and investigation

31.1 have considered the document “Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance”
(version 2, October 2008) at [POL00104821]. After joining the Security Team in
2011 | only attended at a small number of POL audits. One reason for attending
was due to a significant shortage being reported during a routine audit at a
branch. If it was geographically feasible my Team Leader would ask me to attend
on the day to begin investigating the issue as an open enquiry. Sometimes the
location of the branch would make it impossible to attend at the time of the audit
and | would have to arrange attendance on an alternative date (most likely the

following day).

Page 14 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

32. There were also occasions where | was given pre notice to attend an audit which
was going to be raised due to suspicious activity being identified (for example,
Chesterfield spotting potential fraudulent activity via their data analysis of
transactions at a branch or customers (service users reported suspicions

activities in relation to their accounts).

33.In both of these examples, the role of the Security Manager when attending an
audit was to speak to the auditors to find out what had happened and if necessary,
request an interview with the SPM, request permission to carry out searches of
the SPM’s home address, and gather all available documents on the day that may
be relevant to the matter. This would include reports produced on Horizon by an
auditor as part of all audits. Interviews with a suspected offender would not always
be done on the day of the audit as sometimes the SPM would request a Post
Office friend or a solicitor to be present as was their right. If this was the case we

would arrange with the SPM a date to interview them in the near future.

34. Where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a Post Office branch, a
Team Leader would determine whether an investigation into potential criminality
was conducted by the Security Team or whether the case should be taken
forwards as a debt recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre, the Contract
Manager or the relevant legal team. If it was decided that a criminal investigation
would be pursued, the Team Leader would then allocate the investigation to a

Security Manager to run.

Page 15 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

35.1 believe that Contract Managers had no involvement in relation to the decision
on whether to pursue a criminal investigation or not. They dealt purely with
disciplinary and contract matters. They would make a decision on whether the
SPM would be suspended or not, and in the long term whether they would be
terminated or reinstated depending on the circumstances. This was the case

when | joined the Security Team in 2011 and it did not change.

36. | do not know what factors determined a Team Leader's decision to go down the
criminal investigation route when an audit shortage or suspected fraud was found
at a branch, but | imagine the severity of the loss faced by POL as a result would
be one factor. When | first joined the Security Team | recall that almost all
significant shortages were raised as a criminal investigation, but | cannot
remember if there was a minimum figure to determine this action. | believe the
level of loss required to trigger a criminal investigation did change over time but |
do not know the precise details of this. As time went on, less and less cases were
being taken down the criminal investigation route. | believe from late 2013 only a
few new investigations were raised. Any ongoing continued until the cases came

to a close.

37. Once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal investigation, the process
conducted by Security Managers during the initial investigation is contained in
the flow charts at [POL00104929] and [POL00105226]. | do recall that the
process differed slightly in some respect depending on the type of case. For
example, where there was pre-notice given of a potential shortage (for example,

a suspected fraud notified by Chesterfield, POL service users or branch

Page 16 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

employees) which resulted in an audit being scheduled, Security Managers would
speak to the necessary individuals and POL departments from the outset, such
as the relevant Contract Manger, Auditors and Chesterfield to establish as much
background information about what had been occurring at the branch. All relevant
data would be obtained such as Call Logs, Credence Data, Cash Holdings Data,
Transactional Correction data, and if an audit had already taken place, a copy of
the audit report and all relevant audit documentation. All of this information would
be studied ahead of any interview taking place with the suspected offender and
would be referred to during such interview. Any activity undertaken would also be

recorded on an event log.

38. Where a shortage was discovered following a routine audit and your Team Leader
allocated the case to you to investigate as Lead Investigator, a Security Manager
would attend the branch on the day if geographically possible, usually with at least
one other Security Manager to assist as 2™ officer. On arrival to the branch
Security Managers would speak to the Audit Team to get some background
information and would gather all the available information and documentation
available on the day such as Horizon reports obtained as part of the audit or any
documents that may help explain the shortage. Shortly after arrival Security
Managers would also speak to the SPM, assistant or staff member suspected of
an offence to inform them why they are there, explain their legal rights, request
permission to carry out a search if necessary, and arrange for an interview to take
place. Sometimes a suspected offender would request a Post Office Friend or
solicitor to be present at an interview, meaning the interview could not be carried

out on the same day. As mentioned above, in this scenario an interview would

Page 17 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

arranged in the near future. During an interview the Lead Investigator would ask
a suspected offender questions to try and establish what had happened to the

lost funds.

39.Security Mangers who were the Lead Investigator on a case would always write
up a report following the initial stages of any investigation being completed and
this would go on the casefile with all other evidence obtained. As explained earlier
in this statement, the Team Leader would review the case file before it was then
passed on to the POL Legal Team for consideration. At the end of the report there
was a conclusion section where a summary could be provided in relation to what

the facts pointed to (for example, potential theft or false accounting).

40. Once a casefile had been sent across to the POL Legal Team, they would come
back on occasion to suggest that further evidence was required. In these
circumstances, the Security Manager who was the Lead Investigator responsible

for the matter would have to gather this further evidence.

De ns about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

41. So far as I can recall, the POL Legal Team would make a recommendation as to
whether or not a matter should proceed to prosecution after they reviewed the
casefile and this would then be passed to Cartwright King and they would put
forward the charges they believed to be relevant. | believe that this
recommendation would then be passed on to the Senior Security Manager to sign

off as the prosecuting officer. When | joined the Security Team in 2011 this was

Page 18 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

Dave Pardoe. They would make comment on the case file before it was returned
to the Lead Investigator. | believe that as things changed all case files were also

being sent to the Head of Security, John Scott.

42.1 do not believe that an SPM’s local Contract Manager had any input in relation
to decision of whether to prosecute or not. As explained above, they dealt purely

with disciplinary matters in the case.

43.1 do not know what test was applied by those making prosecution and charging
decisions — Security Managers had no involvement in this. | also do not know
what advice, legal or otherwise, was given to those making decisions around

prosecution and charging.

44. The steps taken to restrain a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods
such as confiscation proceedings was a matter dealt with by the POL Financial
Investigators. Security Managers also had no involvement in this other than
providing information gained as part of the investigation and interview, so | am
not aware what these steps might have been. | know that casefiles would be
handed over to the Financial Investigators to pursue in relation to recovery of
losses and sometimes we would discuss the background of the case with them,
but | do not have any knowledge in relation to the basis upon which they would
proceed with enforcement. | also do not know if it was the Financial Investigators
who would directly decide whether criminal enforcement proceedings should be

pursed or whether they liaised with the POL Legal Team to this regard. During

Page 19 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

my time in the POL Security Team, | believe the Financial Investigators were

Dave Posnett and Helen Dickinson.

Tra

45. As mentioned earlier in this statement, when | joined the Security Team in 2011
| went on a 3 week training course. This is course is mentioned in the feedback
document at [POL00129182]. | cannot recall every topic that was taught during
this course but | believe that we covered PACE, interviewing, taking witness
statements, conducting searches, obtaining evidence, drafting investigation
reports and putting casefiles together. My training continued immediately after
this through mentoring received from Steve Bradshaw and shadowing more
experienced Investigators on cases. | believe that my knowledge and skills in
relation to the abovementioned topics were further developed through receiving
mentorship and through shadowing colleagues. | also believe | would have
learned when to seek relevant evidence from third parties and what my disclosure

obligations were through mentorship and shadowing.

47.As can be seen from [POL00126612], there was a development process in place
to provide ongoing refresher training to Security Managers on a range of topics.

Unfortunately, | cannot remember any precise details of this training.

48.[POL00129310] and [POL00129311] above relate to an invitation to a training
day run by Cartwright Kind Solicitors. | can recall that Cartwright King Solicitors
started to run and deliver useful training for the Security Managers in around
2013. [POL00122526] is a guidance document produced by Cartwright King for

Security Managers.

49.1 can see that [POL00122557] is an email from Rob King with attachments sent
to my personal email. The attachments [POL00122560] and [POL00039970]
appear to be case file review policy and guidance documents and

Page 21 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

[POL00122559] is a process map which shows the different modes by which
cases came into the Security Team. | cannot remember receiving this email, but
| do vaguely recall the attachments. At that time | may have forwarded Rob King’s
email to my personal account to enable me to print and review the documents
attached at home when working away from the office. So far as | can recall |
attended the meeting mentioned in the email and it was to go through the

documents attached to the email that were to be distributed to Security Managers.

50.1 can see that the email at [POL00122897] relates to the documents circulated
ahead of another training day delivered by Cartwright King Solicitors. | believe

that | did attend this training but | cannot recall the precise details of it.

51.The email chain including me at [POL00127081] was an invite to a training
workshop relating to Security Skills which | believe all Security Managers,
including myself, attended. | don’t recall the specific details of the training

provided in this workshop.

52.1 confirm that | have also considered the following documents:

i) The Casework Management document at [POL00104747] (version 1.0,
March 2000) and [POL00104777] (version 4.0, October 2002);

ii) Dave Posnett’s email dated 23 May 2011 at [POL00118096] and the
documents contained within the attached

ii) compliance zip file at [POL00118108], [POL00118109},
[POL00118101], [POL00118102], [POL00118103], [POL00118104],

[POL00118105), [POL00118106] and [POL00118107].

Page 22 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

53. | do not recall ever being provided with the 2000 or 2002 version of the Casework
Management Documents mentioned above. This is probably because | didn’t join
the Security Team until 2011 and by then the documents were quite old. | have
reviewed the guidance given in the second, third and fourth bullet points on page
2 of the 2000 version and the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the
2002 version, and my understanding of those points is that if Horizon Bugs or
errors were discovered or reported during the course of an investigation, this
should be disclosed. This point is also included in a 2013 guide introduced post-
separation, which | have seen previously - [POL00031005]. Even though this is
what | understood, | do not recall ever having any issues or errors with the Horizon
system being reported to me. We were always assured by POL and Fujitsu that

the Horizon system was robust.

54. Not long after | joined the Security Team in 2011 Security Managers were advised
that case files were going to be subjected to compliance checks to ensure
uniformity and that all the necessary steps in matters were being completed
correctly. | remember that there was a compliance checklist that was completed
by a Team Leader when your case file was passed over for review, Your Team
Leader would give you a score following the completion of each section of the

investigation/case file.

55. | did not play any role in relation to the development or the management of the
documents circulated in the email from David Posnett dated 23 May 2011 at
[POL00118096].

Page 23 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

56.1 have reviewed paragraph 2.15 of the document entitled “Guide to the
Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports
& Discipline reports” ([POL00118101]. | understood this to be an instruction to
record any failings discovered during an investigation (whether this be a security
issue such as theft, fraud, incompetence, lack of supervision by a SPM over staff
at the branch, or issues with a transactional process). If | had been aware of any
failings in relation to Horizon Bugs and Errors during my investigations then |
believe | would have reported this too, but | had never come across such failings
during an investigation. As well as making a Team Leader aware | would imagine
this would be entered into the Offender Report pre-amble that formed part of the

case file. If these were known | would understand them to be disclosable.

57.1 believe the Offender Report template at [POL00118102] was contained at the
front of a casefile, but due to the passage of time | cannot recall completing one

of these, but | expect that | would have done so.

58.1 have no knowledge of who drafted the “identification codes” document at
[POL00118104] and having reviewed it | consider it to be a disgrace. | do not
recall ever seeing this document before. Security Managers used identification
codes for reporting offences following prosecution and these were recorded using
the NPA0O1 at interview, and NPAO2 at conviction. If there was a conviction, |
believe this this information would be entered on to the Police databases. If no

conviction was obtained, the information would remain on the casefile.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship

with Fujitsu

59. At some point in 2013, | recall that a new set of interview questions were provided

to Security Mangers to cover in an interview with SPMs, which related to whether

the SPM had faced any difficulties with Horizon and the training they had around

the system. | cannot remember if | ever worked on a case prior to 2013 where a

SPM had attributed a shortfall to issues with Horizon. When the new interview

questions were introduced in 2013, if the SPM did raise any issues with Horizon,

Investigators would have to report this in the case file and were required to

request ARQ data for the relevant period. ARQ data is provided by Fujitsu and it

reports every transaction or entry made on Horizon at the branch for the time

period requested. | do not recall doing this on many occasions.

60.1 do vaguely remember a case | worked on based in Newcastle where a SPM had

attributed a shortfall to issues with Horizon and | had to request 2 months’ worth

of ARQ data. | can remember going through this data to rebuild the balances to

see if | could identify any issues and | do not believe | found anything. | cannot

remember the precise details of this case, including who the SPM was or when

the case was. As far as | recall, Fujitsu would not have gone through this data in

this case, but | cannot confirm this for certain. | am also unsure if they did on other

cases.

Page 25 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

61.In any case, Security Managers would use a variety of data including Credence,
HORACE and ARQ data to investigate a shortfall whether an issue with Horizon
was raised or not. So far as | am aware, Credence and HORACE data is
transactional data pulled from Chesterfield data, reporting transactions and other
information entered onto Horizon such as transfers and cash declarations. | was
able to view Credence but had to request HORACE data from the PO Security
admin team. The type of data that Security Manager's requested was dealt with

on a case by case basis.

62.1 do not know if ARQ data was requested as a matter of course on all matters
where a shortfall was attributed to problems with Horizon. | did not have sight of
cases dealt with by other Security Managers and can only comment on my own.
| believe that | only had to request ARQ data for this specific reason on one

occasion, as detailed in paragraph 60 above.

63. | am not aware if ARQ data was provided to SPMs in cases where they had
attributed a shortfall to problems with the Horizon system. | do not recall this ever
happening in any of my cases, but it may have occurred on matters dealt with by

other Security Managers. | do not know for certain.

64. Whenever | did require ARQ data on a matter, | do not recall ever requesting this
data directly from Fujitsu — | believe that | always asked our admin team to request
it from Fujitsu for me. | do not think | ever spoke with Penny Thomas or Gareth

Jenkins from Fujitsu to this regard.

Page 26 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

65.1 understood that Gareth Jenkins was a subject matter expert from Fujitsu who
would provide evidence on whether the Horizon System was working as it should
in cases. | do not recall ever having any advice or assistance in relation to the
rules governing independent expert evidence. This is probably because Gareth
Jenkins was never required to give evidence in any of the cases | took on as Lead

Investigator.

Relati a
66. Other than attending a few training session at their offices in Birmingham around
2013, | had very little involvement or interaction with Cartwright King Solicitors.
They were the external lawyers that the POL Legal Team would instruct on
matters to provide advice and representation. Very few of my cases got to the
stage where Cartwright King’s involvement was required. Due to the passage of
time, | cannot remember which of my cases did get to that stage, nor who the
main contacts | would have liaised with. The two main contacts | remember from

attending training at Cartwright Kings is Martin Smith and Andrew Bolc.

68.1 would like to flag to the Inquiry that the request indicates that | am listed as the

designated prosecution authority in The Investigation Report dated 13 May 2011

Page 29 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

at [POL00046224]. This is incorrect - | was never the designated prosecution
authority in any case and the document shows that it was David Pardoe who held

this role for this specific case.

69.1 do not remember a great deal about the background of this case and | have had
to rely on the documents provided to help me recall specific details. In terms of
setting out my recollection of the background, | defer entirely to the facts set out
in the Investigation report completed by Steve Bradshaw and dated 3 October
2011 [POL00057078]. Other than my statement at [POL00057584] | had not
previously seen any of the other documents listed in paragraph 67 above as | was
not the Lead Investigator on the case. The Lead Investigator was Steve Bradshaw
— Mr Bradshaw would have requested me to make this statement as a matter of
standard practice, following me assisting him in a follow up interview held with Mr
Ishaq on the 27th September 2011. Such interview is evidenced in

[POL00065000] and [POL00057985].

70. My involvement in the prosecution of Khayyam Ishaq was minimal. | was only the
2"4 Officer at the follow up interview with Mr Ishaq. The role of the 2" Officer is
simply to set up the room for an interview and complete any administrative tasks
required by the Lead Investigator. A 2"? Officer can interject and ask questions if
relevant during an interview but on this occasion | asked no questions of Mr Ishaq.
| had no further involvement in the initial investigation or casefile preparation after
the follow up interview. | did attend court in this matter on one occasion as a

development and training opportunity as at the time | was a relatively new to the

Page 30 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

Security Manager role and | did not have much experience of hearing attendance.

| cannot recall which hearing this was.

71.1 believe that the decision to charge and prosecute Mr Ishaq would have been
made by the POL Legal Team and signed off by David Pardoe as the designated

prosecution authority. | had no involvement in this decision.

72. | have considered the statement in [POL00059686] that the Post Office had
“absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and its
branch accounting processes.” | do believe that at the time | would have
considered this statement to be accurate because | recall we were regularly

informed the same by POL in our team meetings.

73. Other than attending the follow up interview as 2™ Officer, providing a witness
statement and observing a court hearing for experience, | had no other

involvement in the case of Mr Ishaq.

74.1 have considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton &
Others v Post Office Limited [2021 EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278]. Due to
my minimal involvement in the case involving Khayyam Ishaq, | do not feel that |
am able to provide useful comment or reflection on the way the investigation and

prosecution was conducted by the Post Office, nor on the outcome of the case.

Prosecution of Angela Sefton and Anne Neild

75.1 confirm that | have considered the following documents provided to me in
connection with this prosecution:

i) The Audit Report dated 5 September 2012 at [POL00044159];

ii) The notebook entry, dated 6 January 2012 at [POL00044052);

iii) The Record of Taped Interview Summary re interview of Angela Sefton

v) The handwritten statement from Anne Nield and Angela Sefton at
[POL00043958};

vi) The Investigation Report for Angela Sefton dated 1 February 2012 at

viii)The letter from Cartwright King to the Security Team dated 1 March
2012 at [POL00057495);

ix) The calllogs at [POL00118474].

76. Prior to receiving the abovementioned documents | only had a vague recollection
of this case. | have therefore had to rely heavily on the documents provided to me
to remember specific details, and defer to my statement at [POL00044028] for
specific details of my involvement. | recall that Steve Bradshaw was the Lead

Investigator in this matter and | understand that on the evening of 5" January

Page 32 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

2012 Anne Neild had called up Steve and asked to speak with him outside of
work about a matter. Unbeknown to Ms Neild, there was already an audit
arranged to take place at the Fazakerley branch the following day due to
suspicious fraudulent activity being raised by a service user. Steve Bradshaw
called me ahead of the audit and asked me to go into the Fazakerley branch on
the day of the audit to assist him with an investigation. He explained the
background of the circumstances to me and | vaguely remember during this
conversation he informed me that there had been customer complaints about
deposits not being placed into their accounts in a timely manner. When | arrived
at the Fazakerley branch the Audit Team were already present and carrying out
an audit. As confirmed in my witness statement at [POL00044028], | witnessed
Anne Neild hand a letter to Mr Bradshaw which was prepared by both Ms Neild
and Ms Sefton. | learned that the letter stated that they had been supressing
Girobank deposits from customers. | was then directed to a number of Girobank
Deposit slips and cheque envelopes by one of the staff, which had been placed
in a cupboard. | think this was by Ms Sefton but | cannot be certain. There were
around 40 deposit slips and cheque envelopes and | passed these on to Steve
Bradshaw who was also present at the branch. Following the completion of the
audit, a consensual search was carried out at the homes of both Anne Neild and
Angela Sefton. | was present on both searches and | do not recall anything being

seized. | do not believe that any interviews were undertaken on this day.

77.| was then present as the 2"? Officer on 20" January 2012 when Anne Neild and
Angela Sefton voluntarily attended an interview under caution at Bootle Post

Office. As explained earlier in this statement, the role of the 2nd Officer is to set

Page 33 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

up the interview room and complete any administrative tasks required by the Lead
Investigator. A 2"¢ Officer can interject and ask questions if relevant and during
the interview with Angela Sefton | can see that | asked a single question about
whether she had reported shortages to anyone at all, to which she confirmed she
had not. It appears that | did not ask any questions during the interview with Anne

Neild.

78. Following the interviews on 20" January 2012, my only further involvement in this
case was to produce my unsigned witness statement at [POL00044028]. | cannot
recall if | ever produced a signed version of this statement though | would expect
| did. Mr Bradshaw would have requested me to make this statement as matter
of standard practice, to provide an account of me assisting him on the day of the
Audit on 6" January 2012 and with the interviews under caution held with Ms
Neild and Ms Sefton on 20" January 2012. | had no involvement after this in
relation to the casefile preparation, disclosure or seeing the case through the

prosecution.

79.1 confirm that | have reviewed the visit reports contained within [POL00044222]
and [POL00044223]. As indicated earlier in this statement, between April 2005
an August 2006 | was an Area Intervention Manager. | worked under a Retail Line
Manager (who | believe was Paul Williams at the time of these reports) and the
role involved conducting visits to branches to provide support. These visits were
based on requests for assistance logged by branches, or any other issues raised
from within POL such as mails integrity, Opening Hours and Complaints from

customers. As described earlier in this statement, | think that these issues would

Page 34 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

have been relayed to me by the Retail Line Manager | was working under, who |
believe would have obtained that information from a number of sources including
data analysis produced by Chesterfield, area managers, or clerks and SPMs

themselves following self-reporting of issues vial the POL helpline.

80.Due to the passage of time | cannot recall these visits | conducted from direct
memory — | can only rely in what the visit reports say. The visit report dated 14th
September 2005 shows that | conducted a visit following a shortage discovered
by SPMs which the branch believed was due to a change to the Horizon system
or an error in declaring cash. | note that [POL00118474] shows the call logs
where the cash shortage issues were raised, which then led to my visit. It appears
that when | visited the shortage had been corrected due to an error in entering
the ATM figures. Compensating errors can occur if a mistake is made during one

balance period and rectified in the next.

8

=

. The visit report dated 6th February 2006 illustrates that my visit related to a large
shortage reported by the branch. My role in visiting was to go through the balance
documents to see if | could identify if there were any errors in balancing that could
have explained the shortage. | note that there was no mention of Horizon failure

in this visit report.

82.1 would like to emphasise to the Inquiry that my Area Intervention Manager role
was not an investigatory role — | was only there to provide support. | had no
access to the systems and data that Investigators had. | would only go through
documentation in the branch and available on Horizon and information that was

Page 35 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

provided to me in relation to a query raised and | would report back my findings

to wherever the initial visit request was generated from.

83. Other than the above mentioned visits | conducted on 14th September 2005 and
6th February 2006 as an Area Intervention Manger, | have not had any other
previous involvement with interventions at the Fazakerley branch prior to the audit

on 5 September 2012.

84. In terms of the advice received from Cartwright King in relation to this case, |
note that various correspondence from the Cartwright King Team has been
provided with the Request. | would like to flag to the Inquiry that | had never had
sight of any of this correspondence previously and | was unaware of what advice

was given.

85.1 was also not aware of the actions taken by the Post Office following advice from
Cartwright King and what charges appeared on the final indictment in this case,

until | reviewed the following documents provided with the Request:

i) The Summons for Angela Sefton dated 15 March 2012 at
[POL00044030);

ii) The Summons for Anne Nield dated 15 March 2012 at [POL00044033];

iii) The Liverpool Crown Court list showing a PCMH in the case on 25 July

2012 at [POL00058146].

86.1 note that these documents confirm that a charge of false accounting was brought
against both Anne Neild and Angela Sefton. | had not seen these official
documents before, but | do recall knowing at the time that Ms Neild and Ms Sefton
were being prosecuted. | was not aware of what the charges were but | would
have likely suspected false accounting because from my previous involvement in

the case as a 2" officer | knew they had delayed deposits.

87.1 confirm that | have also considered the following documents provided to me:

i) The list of witnesses relating to R -v- Angela Mary Sefton at

88. As | had no further involvement in this case beyond the point that | provided my
unsigned witness statement dated 21 March 2012, | am unable to provide
comment on what witness evidence was obtained and relied upon by the Post
Office in these proceedings, nor what it was obtained to address. What | can

confirm is that | was never called to give evidence in the case.

89.1 have also considered the following documents:

90.1 believe that the Disclosure Officer in this case would have been Steve
Bradshaw, as he was the Lead Investigator. | note that he is named as the
disclosure officer on a few of the abovementioned disclosure schedules. | do also
note that in the email chain at [POL00058303], Andy Bolc from Cartwright Kings
makes reference in a draft email to Helen Rose being appointed by POL as the
Disclosure Officer dealing with Horizon challenges in the case. | do not know any
details about this because as stated above, | did no further work in this matter
after providing a witness statement on 21 March 2012. What! can confirm is that

| had no involvement in the disclosure process whatsoever.

9

=

.As | did not play any role in the disclosure process, | do not know what disclosure
requests and applications were made by the Defence, how the Post Office
responded to any such requests, nor what advice was sought from and provided
by Counsel in relation to this. | defer entirely to the documents and

correspondence provided to me with the Request that relate to this.

92. | confirm that | have considered the following documents:

Page 41 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

i) The Application for Disclosure dated 12 September 2012 and
attachments at [POL00058294];

ii) The emails dated 14 and 17 September 2012 at [POL00058303);

iii) The emails dated 27 and 28 November 2012 at [POL00059421];

iv) The emails dated 30 November 2012, 3 December 2012 and 5
December 2012 at [POL00089394];

v) The Notice of Further Evidence dated 6 December 2012 at
[POL00044019);

vi) The witness statement of Gareth Jenkins dated 5 December 2012 at
[POL00059424);

vii) Exhibit GlJ/1 to Gareth Jenkins’ witness statement at [POL00044163];

viii)Exhibit GlJ/2 to Gareth Jenkins’ witness statement at [POL00044164].

93. | do not know how Gareth Jenkins came to be involved in this case and | was not
aware that he had any input until reading the documents produced to me from the
Inquiry. If | had been made aware at the time | believe | would have understood
that he was the subject matter expert witness from Fujitsu who would provide

evidence in relation to the robustness of the Horizon System.

94. At no point was any information given to me by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post
Office) during the course of the criminal proceedings against Angela Sefton and
Anne Nield about known bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or

current.

95.1 confirm that | have considered the following documents:

Page 42 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

i) The Prosecution Opening dated 21 November 2012 at [POL00044050);

ii) The Agreed Facts for the cases of Angela Sefton and Anne Nield at
[POL00043964);

iii) The letter from Stephen Bradshaw to the Security Operations Casework
Team dated 10 May 2013 at [POL00044024);

iv) The Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Roger Allen & Others v Post

Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 1874 at [POL00113343]

96. Due to me having minimal involvement in only the initial investigation stages, | do
not feel that | am able to provide useful comment or reflection on the way the
investigation and prosecution was conducted by the Post Office on the whole, nor
on the outcome of the prosecution of Angela Sefton and Anne Neild. What | can
say is that where | assisted during the initial investigation, | believe that the correct
processes and procedures were followed and from reviewing Mr Bradshaw's

investigation report, it seems to be compliant.

General

97. Following the introduction of further questions to be asked to SPM’s in an
interview relating to the Horizon System, | believe that | would have considered a
challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to others. We had
to ask them in all new cases going forwards. | cannot recall if | would have thought
the same from when | started in 2011 until the introduction of these further
interview questions in 2013. | do not recall ever being involved with a case where

a challenge to the integrity of Horizon was made during an investigation during

Page 43 of 59
WITNO08950100
WITNO08950100

this earlier period.

98. | am unsure what is meant by the following comment in [POL00124105] - “the
risk of testing a case in the criminal court prior to the civil hearing.” From reviewing
the rest of [POL00124105)], it appears that Senior Managers in the Security Team
were of the opinion that they were not prepared to risk initiating criminal
prosecutions in cases. It may have been the case that following a cease to
criminal prosecutions, Security Managers were querying whether they would ever
be reintroduced, and [POL00124105] was the response from Senior
Management that followed. However, this is just speculation and | cannot confirm
this for certain. | do not believe | held any opinion or view on this decision — | think
| would have just thought it was a decision for Senior Managers to make and |

was happy to just accept it.

99. Other than the matters | have already addressed in this statement, there are no
other matters which I consider to be relevant to the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference

that | would like to bring to the attention of the Chair.

Statement of truth

| believe the

his statement to be true.
