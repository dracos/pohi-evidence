                                                            Dated: 16 November 2023




                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT ENQUIRY




                    FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF KEVIN RYAN




I, Kevin Ryan, will say as follows —


 1. I have made this witness statement to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the

    "Inquiry") with the matters set out to me in the Rule 9 Request dated 18 October

    2023 (the "Request"). The Request contains 60 questions, which I have

     considered and addressed within this statement. I would like to make the Inquiry

     aware that I have received legal assistance to produce this statement from my

     solicitor, Mr Ian Manners of Ashfords LLP. When seeking to obtain assistance

    from Ashfords LLP, I was assisted by the Post Office Limited (POL) with the initial

     stage of confirming the availability of insurance coverage, to cover the associated

     legal costs.



 2. I confirm that everything that I include in this statement is to the best of my

     recollection of matters. There have been instances where I have not been able to

     recall something due to the amount of time that has passed and, therefore, I have

    had to rely on a document provided to me. Where this is the case, I have ensured

    to indicate this clearly.




Background


 3. I am currently employed by POL as a Security Manager and I have worked within

    the organisation for almost 40 years in many different roles. I would like to flag

    to the Inquiry that the Request refers to me joining the POL Security Team in

    2011 and being and Investigation Manger from 1998 to 2011, however, this is

    incorrect.



 4. I first joined POL in February 1985 as a Counter Clerk at a branch in Liverpool

    and I stayed in this role for 5 years until August 1990. From this point until June

    1991 I held various acting Branch Manager roles in a number of Post Offices on

    Merseyside. I was then appointed to the Assistant Branch Manager role at

    Prescot Post Office until March 1995. I was then a National Training Coordinator

    for POL between March 1995 and August 1997, which involved the scheduling of

    relevant classroom and in-branch training for new Subposmasters (SPMs). This

    training was delivered to SPMs by POL National Field Trainers and would relate

    to the role of a SPM. I then became a National Field Trainer myself in August

    1997, and I would deliver this necessary training to SPMs in classrooms and at

    branches all over the UK. I stayed in this position until March 2005, and then went

    on to become an Area Intervention Manager for the North West Region. This was

    for a period between April 2005 and August 2006 and it entailed working under a

    Retail Line Manager and going in to branches to resolve issues such as balancing

    difficulties and non-compliance to procedures. I cannot recall for certain, but I

                                     Page 2 of 59
                                                                                     WI TNO8950100
                                                                                   WI TN08950100




   think that these issues would have been relayed to me by the Retail Line Manager

   I was working under, who I believe would have obtained that information from

   data analysis produced by Chesterfield (the POL central finance department),

   customer complaints via the helpline, area managers, clerks or SPMs themselves

   following self-reporting of issues via the POL helpline.



5. In September 2006 I became a Business Development Manager for POL, initially

   covering branches in the Mansfield and Nottingham areas before moving to the

   Liverpool and Warrington areas. This role involved assisting SPMs with driving

   sales of Post Office Products and services. I stayed in this position until March

   2010 and then moved on to become a Horizon Migration Manager in April 2010

   for a short period until early to mid-August 2010. During this role I worked on a

   National POL project which involved the roll out of the new generation Horizon

   software system. I would go out to branches on the day they were due to undergo

   the relevant update of the Horizon system to ensure that the update ran smoothly.

   This was an overnight download of software.



6. Later in August 2010 I became a Transitional Manager within POL, when the

   previous project ended. This was not a specified role as such - it was simply a

   position whereby I remained employed by POL until a suitable role came up to

   apply for internally. If a suitable role did not come around I was able to take

   voluntary redundancy instead. After some time in this position I was initially going

   to opt for redundancy, but around December 2010 vacancies were advertised on

   the POL internal systems for Security Managers within the POL Security Team. I

   recall that the job description set out that the role would entail a combination of


                                    Page 3 of 59
                                                                                       WI TNO8950100
                                                                                     WI TN08950100




   Fraud Investigation and Physical Security. I decided to apply for the job and I

   was invited to a question and answer style interview. Shortly after the interview I

   was told I was successful in obtaining the role and I went on to start in late January

   2011.



7. 1 cannot recall if any specific pre-training or expertise was required in order to

   apply for the role of a Security Manager, but I believe that my wide experience of

   working in various POL roles by this time most likely went in my favour when

   applying for the position. At the point I became a Security Manager I had been

   with POL for 26 years but I had not gained any experience in investigations or

   physical security.




8. In terms of initial training for my role as a Security Manager, I recall going on a 3

   week course at some point in February 2011 which was delivered by Paul

   Whitaker and Paul Southin (who were Security Managers for Royal Mail). I

   remember that the course covered numerous topics including interviewing under

   caution, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), Conducting

   Searches, taking statements, gathering evidence, writing investigation reports

   and putting investigation case files together. There were likely more topics

   covered, but these are the main ones that I can recall_ I deal with this in further

   detail later in this statement.



9_ I understood at the time that the investigation side of the Security Manager role

   involved looking into potential fraud or crimes committed within POL I knew that

   this entailed interviewing suspected offenders, conducting searches of premises

                                     Page 4 of 59
                                                                                  WI TN08950100
                                                                                WI TN08950100




   (if necessary), gathering evidence and putting together case files for submission

   to the POL Legal Team. In terms of the Physical Security side of the role, I

   understood that this involved implementing necessary security measures

   following robberies and burglaries at branches, as well as general equipment

   deployment to ensure security in branches and cash in transit centres, such as

   alarms, CCTV and any other security equipment available. I would like to flag to

   the Inquiry that during the years that I have been a Security Manager for POL, I

   have carried out much more physical security work than investigatory work.



10. When I first became a Security Manager, I reported to a Team Leader. The Team

   Leader that I reported changed many times over the years and I cannot recall

   every single Team Leader that I have had, nor when they changed. I do remember

   at some point the following individuals have been my Team Leader — Leslie

   Frankland, Keith Gilchrist, Simon Hutchinson, Helen Dickinson and Simon Talbot.




11.At some point in July 2013 I temporarily stepped in to a Team Leader role, during

   which I had to report to a Senior Security Manager, who I think was Andrew

   Hayward at the time. I was asked to cover the role temporarily when the current

   Team Leader (Keith Gilchrist) left until a permanent replacement was found.

   During my short time as a Team Leader I think I had around 3 or 4 Security

   Managers reporting to me, The ones I can recall are Mike Stanway, Steve

   Bradshaw and Robert Daily. I do not recall providing any in-depth supervision to

   those Security Managers, but I do remember doing some of their performance

   reviews and conducting one-to-one meetings with them. I note that

   [POL00129337] shows a one-to-one meeting I conducted with Robert Daily, and

                                    Page 5 of 59
                                                                                   WI TN08950100
                                                                                 WI TN08950100




   [POL00136728] shows a one-to-one meeting I conducted with Steve Bradshaw.

   I stepped back down to the position of Security Manager at my own request after

   6 or 7 weeks and I have not had anyone report to me since_



12. In all of my time working within POL's Security Team, I have never had any reason

   to doubt the competence or professionalism of any Team Leaders, Senior

   Management or other colleagues. I have always believed that everyone has been

   highly professional and competent throughout my career within POL.




13. When an investigation was carried out, Security Managers would be required to

   complete disciplinary reports as part of the case file, which were then passed to

   the Contract Manager dealing with the branch and SPM involved. It would then

   be the Contract Manager who would make a decision as to whether the SPM

   would be suspended or not if this had not already been done. Security Managers,

   including myself, had no involvement in this disciplinary process other than

   providing this report.



14. In terms of interviewing suspected offenders, this was part of my Security

   Manager role, however, it would be the Lead Investigator who would ask the

   majority of questions when interviewing a suspect. I was only a Lead Investigator

   on a small number of cases before it was decided that POL would no longer

   pursue any new prosecutions. I believe this change came in late 2013. I was a

   2nd officer more often in cases, meaning that I would attend interviews to assist

   the Lead Investigator. I would then have either no or minimal further involvement



                                    Page 6 of 59
                                                                                       WI TNO8950100
                                                                                     WI TN08950100




   in that case. I deal with this in further detail when addressing questions on the

   prosecutions of Mr Khayyam Ishaq, Angela Sefton and Anne Neild below.




15. As far as I can recall, it was Lead Investigators on cases who would have

   assisted with disclosure in criminal proceedings. In the small number of cases

   where I was a Lead investigator, I would have been involved in gathering

   evidence for disclosure and providing it to POL's Legal Team to be reviewed and

   disclosed to the defence. I do not believe I had involvement in directly providing

   disclosure the defence — it would be the POL legal team who would do this. In the

   cases where I was a 2nd Officer, I would not have been involved in the disclosure

   process at all.



16. I am not aware what litigation strategy is and I do not think it is something I would

   have been involved in.




17. 1 do not believe I would have had any liaison with other POL departments when I

   was a 2nd Officer in respect of progressing cases. However, where I was a Lead

   Investigator on a matter I would have liaised with the relevant Contract Manager

   to let them know when it was decided whether a prosecution would be pursued

   or not and to keep them updated on the progress. I would do this because the

   Contract Manger would often want to know this information before making a

   decision to terminate or reinstate a suspect. By this point the Contract Manager

   would have likely already suspended the particular suspect. Unfortunately, I

                                                                                           WI TN08950100
                                                                                         WI TN08950100




   cannot remember any specific examples of me doing this but I do recall that it is

   something I did.




18_ I would also have liaised with POL's Legal Team when my casefile had been

   passed across to them. For example, I would have liaised with the Legal Team

   when gathering disclosure which was included as part of the casefile or about

   obtaining further evidence if they requested this. I do also remember occasionally

   liaising with POL Financial Investigators, to inform them about the background of

   a case if they were taking it on to progress from a recovery standpoint.




The Security team's role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions




19. I confirm that I have reviewed the following documents, but I would like to flag to

   the Inquiry that the majority of them were produced before I joined the Security

20. 1 do not recall seeing any of the first 21 documents listed in paragraph 19 above,

   prior to receiving these from the Inquiry. It may be that some of those 21

   documents that were dated later (such as in 2009 and 2010) were provided to me

   when I joined in 2011, however, due to the passage of time I cannot confirm this

   for certain.



21. 1 note that document [POL00105229] relates to Police National Computer Access

   (PNC) access, which I believe allowed a user to see if a suspect had previous

   convictions or pending prosecutions. PNC access was obtained by the Post

   Office Security team not long after I joined and I do recall this document being

   circulated at some point early on in my Security Manager career for reading.

   However, I had no real use of this document other than as a guide for requesting

   information because I did not personally have PNC access, as it was strictly

   limited. Access to this was limited to the Post Office Security admin team based

   in Chesterfield and if required we would request information from them that had

   to be authorised. This would be authorised by a Security Operations Team Leader

   or Senior Security Manager.




22. I do also recall the following documents being circulated, but I cannot remember

   exactly when, nor who circulated them: [POL00104929], [POL00105226],

   [P0L00031005], [P0L00027863], [P0L00030902].



23. What I can confirm is that I had no involvement in the development of any of the

   documents and polices listed in paragraph 19 above.

24. 1 have been asked to describe the Organisational Structure of the Security Team.

   I am aware that that the Physical Security Team and the Fraud and Crime

   Investigation Team used to form two separate sections to the Security Team.

   When I joined the Security Team in 2011 as a Security Manager, these roles

   merged and became to be known as the Security Operations part of POL's

   Security Team. At this time Security Operations consisted of three teams which

   were responsible for geographical areas in the UK (North, Midlands and South).

   Each of the teams had a Team Leader and approximately 18-20 Security

   Managers based across the country for each geographical area. This has

   changed as the years have gone by as the number of Security Managers has

   gradually reduced to its current level of 8 Security Managers covering the whole

   of the UK and only 1 Team leader. In terms of other sections to the Security Team,

   I do recall that there was a Financial Investigation Team, a Commercial Security

   Team and an Casework Team in the earlier years of my Security Manager career.

   I cannot recall what any of the other sections of the POL Security Team were, but

   I believe when I first started there were 4 or 5 different sections.



25. I believe that internal POL Investigation Policies governed the role and conduct

   of Security Managers that were carrying out investigations. As mentioned above,

   I believe that I have only seen later polices released around and after 2011. In

   particular, I remember often referring to the flow charts in [POL00104929] and

   [POL00105226] when I was still relatively new to the role, as I found them to be

   a useful resource. I recall that there were changes over time to internal POL

   procedures and policies, as the number of investigations carried out were

   reduced over the years, however, I cannot recall what these changes were. In

                                                                                WI TN08950100




   terms of legislation the main legal frame work that governed the conduct of

   investigations was the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the

   Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)_        There was likely other

   legislation we were required to be aware of in addition to PACE and RIPA, but I

   cannot recall what they were.




26. I   confirm   that   I   have   considered      [POL00104900],   [POL00105191],

   [POL00123309] and the attachments at [POL00123310], [POL00123311] and

   [POL00123312]. I cannot recall seeing these documents before they were

   provided to me with the Request and I did not have any involvement in the

   development of investigation policies within POL post-separation. I do not recall

   separation having much of an impact on the way investigations were conducted,

   however, I had only just been appointed as a Security Manager as separation

   took place so I may not have noticed or realised any differences.



27_ I do not recall ever having a complaint being raised about the conduct of an

   investigation by the Security Team so I am not aware of what the process relating

   to complaints would have been. I expect any complaint would have been raised

   upwards to the Head of Security via Senior Security Managers.



28. Supervision was regularly provided through Team Leaders to Security Mangers

   conducting criminal investigations.    Team Leaders would check in with the

   Security Managers and provide support if it was required and chase for updates

   on matters. They would also double check case files before they were sent over

                                                                                      WI TN08950100




   to POL's Legal Team to make sure they were in order and that all required steps

   had been followed.



29. I do also recall when I first started to take on my own investigations, I had a mentor

   who would be my 2nd Officer at the interviews I conducted and provide guidance

   and support with the next steps to take and with running the casefile in general. I

   had this mentor until I was experienced enough to independently conduct

   investigations as a Lead Investigator. My mentor was Steve Bradshaw.



30. I do not recall there ever being a difference to the policy and practice regarding

   the investigation and prosecution of Crown Office employees in comparison to

   SPMs, their managers and assistants.




Audit and investigation



31. 1 have considered the document "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance"

   (version 2, October 2008) at [POL00104821]. After joining the Security Team in

   2011 1 only attended at a small number of POL audits. One reason for attending

   was due to a significant shortage being reported during a routine audit at a

   branch. If it was geographically feasible my Team Leader would ask me to attend

   on the day to begin investigating the issue as an open enquiry. Sometimes the

   location of the branch would make it impossible to attend at the time of the audit

   and I would have to arrange attendance on an alternative date (most likely the

   following day).




                                      Page 14 of 59
                                                                                       WI TNO8950100
                                                                                     WI TN08950100




32. There were also occasions where I was given pre notice to attend an audit which

   was going to be raised due to suspicious activity being identified (for example,

   Chesterfield spotting potential fraudulent activity via their data analysis of

   transactions at a branch or customers (service users reported suspicions

   activities in relation to their accounts).



33. In both of these examples, the role of the Security Manager when attending an

   audit was to speak to the auditors to find out what had happened and if necessary,

   request an interview with the SPM, request permission to carry out searches of

   the SPM's home address, and gather all available documents on the day that may

   be relevant to the matter. This would include reports produced on Horizon by an

   auditor as part of all audits. Interviews with a suspected offender would not always

   be done on the day of the audit as sometimes the SPM would request a Post

   Office friend or a solicitor to be present as was their right. If this was the case we

   would arrange with the SPM a date to interview them in the near future.



34. Where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a Post Office branch, a

   Team Leader would determine whether an investigation into potential criminality

   was conducted by the Security Team or whether the case should be taken

   forwards as a debt recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre, the Contract

   Manager or the relevant legal team. If it was decided that a criminal investigation

   would be pursued, the Team Leader would then allocate the investigation to a

   Security Manager to run_




                                      Page 15 of 59
                                                                                      WI TN08950100
                                                                                    WI TN08950100




35. I believe that Contract Managers had no involvement in relation to the decision

   on whether to pursue a criminal investigation or not. They dealt purely with

   disciplinary and contract matters. They would make a decision on whether the

   SPM would be suspended or not, and in the long term whether they would be

   terminated or reinstated depending on the circumstances. This was the case

   when I joined the Security Team in 2011 and it did not change.



36. I do not know what factors determined a Team Leader's decision to go down the

   criminal investigation route when an audit shortage or suspected fraud was found

   at a branch, but I imagine the severity of the loss faced by POL as a result would

   be one factor. When I first joined the Security Team I recall that almost all

   significant shortages were raised as a criminal investigation, but I cannot

   remember if there was a minimum figure to determine this action. I believe the

   level of loss required to trigger a criminal investigation did change over time but I

   do not know the precise details of this. As time went on, less and less cases were

   being taken down the criminal investigation route. I believe from late 2013 only a

   few new investigations were raised. Any ongoing continued until the cases came

   to a close.



37. Once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal investigation, the process

   conducted by Security Managers during the initial investigation is contained in

   the flow charts at [POL00104929] and [POL00105226]. I do recall that the

   process differed slightly in some respect depending on the type of case. For

   example, where there was pre-notice given of a potential shortage (for example,

   a suspected fraud notified by Chesterfield, POL service users or branch


                                    Page 16 of 59
                                                                                     WI TNO8950100
                                                                                   WI TN08950100




   employees) which resulted in an audit being scheduled, Security Managers would

   speak to the necessary individuals and POL departments from the outset, such

   as the relevant Contract Manger, Auditors and Chesterfield to establish as much

   background information about what had been occurring at the branch. All relevant

   data would be obtained such as Call Logs, Credence Data, Cash Holdings Data,

   Transactional Correction data, and if an audit had already taken place, a copy of

   the audit report and all relevant audit documentation. All of this information would

   be studied ahead of any interview taking place with the suspected offender and

   would be referred to during such interview. Any activity undertaken would also be

   recorded on an event log.



38. Where a shortage was discovered following a routine audit and your Team Leader

   allocated the case to you to investigate as Lead Investigator, a Security Manager

   would attend the branch on the day if geographically possible, usually with at least

   one other Security Manager to assist as 2 nd officer. On arrival to the branch

   Security Managers would speak to the Audit Team to get some background

   information and would gather all the available information and documentation

   available on the day such as Horizon reports obtained as part of the audit or any

   documents that may help explain the shortage. Shortly after arrival Security

   Managers would also speak to the SPM, assistant or staff member suspected of

   an offence to inform them why they are there, explain their legal rights, request

   permission to carry out a search if necessary, and arrange for an interview to take

   place. Sometimes a suspected offender would request a Post Office Friend or

   solicitor to be present at an interview, meaning the interview could not be carried

   out on the same day. As mentioned above, in this scenario an interview would


                                    Page 17 of 59
                                                                                     WI TNO8950100
                                                                                   WI TN08950100




   arranged in the near future. During an interview the Lead Investigator would ask

   a suspected offender questions to try and establish what had happened to the

   lost funds.



39. Security Mangers who were the Lead Investigator on a case would always write

   up a report following the initial stages of any investigation being completed and

   this would go on the casefile with all other evidence obtained_ As explained earlier

   in this statement, the Team Leader would review the case file before it was then

   passed on to the POL Legal Team for consideration. At the end of the report there

   was a conclusion section where a summary could be provided in relation to what

   the facts pointed to (for example, potential theft or false accounting).




40. Once a casefile had been sent across to the POL Legal Team, they would come

   back on occasion to suggest that further evidence was required. In these

   circumstances, the Security Manager who was the Lead Investigator responsible

   for the matter would have to gather this further evidence.




 Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings


41. So far as I can recall, the POL Legal Team would make a recommendation as to

   whether or not a matter should proceed to prosecution after they reviewed the

   casefile and this would then be passed to Cartwright King and they would put

   forward the charges they believed to be relevant. I believe that this

   recommendation would then be passed on to the Senior Security Manager to sign

   off as the prosecuting officer. When I joined the Security Team in 2011 this was

                                    Page 18 of 59
                                                                                    WI TNO8950100
                                                                                  WI TN08950100




   Dave Pardoe. They would make comment on the case file before it was returned

   to the Lead Investigator. I believe that as things changed all case files were also

   being sent to the Head of Security, John Scott.



42. 1 do not believe that an SPM's local Contract Manager had any input in relation

   to decision of whether to prosecute or not. As explained above, they dealt purely

   with disciplinary matters in the case.



43. 1 do not know what test was applied by those making prosecution and charging

   decisions — Security Managers had no involvement in this. I also do not know

   what advice, legal or otherwise, was given to those making decisions around

   prosecution and charging.



44. The steps taken to restrain a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods

   such as confiscation proceedings was a matter dealt with by the POL Financial

   Investigators. Security Managers also had no involvement in this other than

   providing information gained as part of the investigation and interview, so I am

   not aware what these steps might have been. I know that casefiles would be

   handed over to the Financial Investigators to pursue in relation to recovery of

   losses and sometimes we would discuss the background of the case with them,

   but I do not have any knowledge in relation to the basis upon which they would

   proceed with enforcement. I also do not know if it was the Financial Investigators

   who would directly decide whether criminal enforcement proceedings should be

   pursed or whether they liaised with the POL Legal Team to this regard. During

   my time in the POL Security Team, I believe the Financial Investigators were

   Dave Posnett and Helen Dickinson.




Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team




45. As mentioned earlier in this statement, when I joined the Security Team in 2011

   I went on a 3 week training course. This is course is mentioned in the feedback

   document at [POL00129182]. I cannot recall every topic that was taught during

   this course but I believe that we covered PACE, interviewing, taking witness

   statements, conducting searches, obtaining evidence, drafting investigation

   reports and putting casefiles together. My training continued immediately after

   this through mentoring received from Steve Bradshaw and shadowing more

   experienced Investigators on cases. I believe that my knowledge and skills in

   relation to the abovementioned topics were further developed through receiving

   mentorship and through shadowing colleagues. I also believe I would have

   learned when to seek relevant evidence from third parties and what my disclosure

   obligations were through mentorship and shadowing.



46. I confirm that I have considered the following documents:

        i) The feedback in respect of an investigation workshop, dated 2011 at

            [POL00129182];

        ii) The email from Tony Newman to me at [POL00126612];

        iii) The email from Dave Posnett to me and others, dated 22 March 2013,

            at [POL00129310] and invitation at [POL00129311];

        iv) The email from Rob King to me and others, dated 25 June 2013, at

            [POL00122529] and attachment at [POL00122526];

        v) The email from Rob King to me and others, dated 21 July 2013 at

            [POL00122557]       and           the attachments at [POL00039970],

            [P0L00122559] and [P0L00122560];

        vi) The email from Rob King to me and others, dated 20 September

            2013, at [POL00122897];

        vii) The email chain including me at [POL00127081];

        viii)The email from Andrew Wise to me and others, dated 11 November

            2013, at [POL00123042];

        ix) The email from Andrew Wise to me and others, dated 25 April 2014, at

            [POL00123282]



47.As can be seen from [POL00126612], there was a development process in place

   to provide ongoing refresher training to Security Managers on a range of topics.

   Unfortunately, I cannot remember any precise details of this training.



48. [POL00129310] and [POL00129311] above relate to an invitation to a training

   day run by Cartwright Kind Solicitors. I can recall that Cartwright King Solicitors

   started to run and deliver useful training for the Security Managers in around

   2013. [POL00122526] is a guidance document produced by Cartwright King for

   Security Managers.


49. 1 can see that [POL00122557] is an email from Rob King with attachments sent

   to my personal email. The attachments [POL00122560] and [POL00039970]

   appear to be case file review policy and guidance documents and

   [POL00122559] is a process map which shows the different modes by which

   cases came into the Security Team. I cannot remember receiving this email, but

   I do vaguely recall the attachments_ At that time I may have forwarded Rob King's

   email to my personal account to enable me to print and review the documents

   attached at home when working away from the office. So far as I can recall I

   attended the meeting mentioned in the email and it was to go through the

   documents attached to the email that were to be distributed to Security Managers.


50. 1 can see that the email at [POL00122897] relates to the documents circulated

   ahead of another training day delivered by Cartwright King Solicitors. I believe

   that I did attend this training but I cannot recall the precise details of it.


51.The email chain including me at [POL00127081] was an invite to a training

   workshop relating to Security Skills which I believe all Security Managers,

   including myself, attended. I don't recall the specific details of the training

   provided in this workshop.



52. 1 confirm that I have also considered the following documents:



         i) The Casework Management document at [POL00104747] (version 1.0,

            March 2000) and [POL00104777] (version 4.0, October 2002);

         ii) Dave Posnett's email dated 23 May 2011 at [POL00118096] and the

            documents contained within the attached

            [P0L00118105], [P0L00118106] and [P0L00118107].

53. 1 do not recall ever being provided with the 2000 or 2002 version of the Casework

   Management Documents mentioned above. This is probably because I didn't join

   the Security Team until 2011 and by then the documents were quite old. I have

   reviewed the guidance given in the second, third and fourth bullet points on page

   2 of the 2000 version and the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the

   2002 version, and my understanding of those points is that if Horizon Bugs or

   errors were discovered or reported during the course of an investigation, this

   should be disclosed. This point is also included in a 2013 guide introduced post-

   separation, which I have seen previously - [POL00031005]. Even though this is

   what I understood, I do not recall ever having any issues or errors with the Horizon

   system being reported to me. We were always assured by POL and Fujitsu that

   the Horizon system was robust.



54_ Not long after I joined the Security Team in 2011 Security Managers were advised

   that case files were going to be subjected to compliance checks to ensure

   uniformity and that all the necessary steps in matters were being completed

   correctly. I remember that there was a compliance checklist that was completed

   by a Team Leader when your case file was passed over for review, Your Team

   Leader would give you a score following the completion of each section of the

   investigation/case file.




55. I did not play any role in relation to the development or the management of the

   documents circulated in the email from David Posnett dated 23 May 2011 at

   [POL00118096].

56. 1 have reviewed paragraph 2.15 of the document entitled "Guide to the

   Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports

   & Discipline reports" ([POL00118101]. I understood this to be an instruction to

   record any failings discovered during an investigation (whether this be a security

   issue such as theft, fraud, incompetence, lack of supervision by a SPM over staff

   at the branch, or issues with a transactional process). If I had been aware of any

   failings in relation to Horizon Bugs and Errors during my investigations then I

   believe I would have reported this too, but I had never come across such failings

   during an investigation. As well as making a Team Leader aware I would imagine

   this would be entered into the Offender Report pre-amble that formed part of the

   case file. If these were known I would understand them to be disclosable.




57. 1 believe the Offender Report template at [POL00118102] was contained at the

   front of a casefile, but due to the passage of time I cannot recall completing one

   of these, but I expect that I would have done so.



58. 1 have no knowledge of who drafted the "identification codes" document at

   [POL00118104] and having reviewed it I consider it to be a disgrace. I do not

   recall ever seeing this document before. Security Managers used identification

   codes for reporting offences following prosecution and these were recorded using

   the NPA01 at interview, and NPA02 at conviction. If there was a conviction, I

   believe this this information would be entered on to the Police databases. If no

   conviction was obtained, the information would remain on the casefile.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship

with Fujitsu




59. At some point in 2013, I recall that a new set of interview questions were provided

   to Security Mangers to cover in an interview with SPMs, which related to whether

   the SPM had faced any difficulties with Horizon and the training they had around

   the system. I cannot remember if I ever worked on a case prior to 2013 where a

   SPM had attributed a shortfall to issues with Horizon. When the new interview

   questions were introduced in 2013, if the SPM did raise any issues with Horizon,

   Investigators would have to report this in the case file and were required to

   request ARQ data for the relevant period. ARQ data is provided by Fujitsu and it

   reports every transaction or entry made on Horizon at the branch for the time

   period requested. I do not recall doing this on many occasions.



60. 1 do vaguely remember a case I worked on based in Newcastle where a SPM had

   attributed a shortfall to issues with Horizon and I had to request 2 months' worth

   of ARQ data. I can remember going through this data to rebuild the balances to

   see if I could identify any issues and I do not believe I found anything. I cannot

   remember the precise details of this case, including who the SPM was or when

   the case was. As far as I recall, Fujitsu would not have gone through this data in

   this case, but I cannot confirm this for certain. I am also unsure if they did on other

   cases.

                                                                                    WI TN08950100




61. In any case, Security Managers would use a variety of data including Credence,

   HORACE and ARQ data to investigate a shortfall whether an issue with Horizon

   was raised or not. So far as I am aware, Credence and HORACE data is

   transactional data pulled from Chesterfield data, reporting transactions and other

   information entered onto Horizon such as transfers and cash declarations. I was

   able to view Credence but had to request HORACE data from the PO Security

   admin team. The type of data that Security Manager's requested was dealt with

   on a case by case basis.



62. I do not know if ARQ data was requested as a matter of course on all matters

   where a shortfall was attributed to problems with Horizon. I did not have sight of

   cases dealt with by other Security Managers and can only comment on my own.

   I believe that I only had to request ARQ data for this specific reason on one

   occasion, as detailed in paragraph 60 above.



63. I am not aware if ARQ data was provided to SPMs in cases where they had

   attributed a shortfall to problems with the Horizon system. I do not recall this ever

   happening in any of my cases, but it may have occurred on matters dealt with by

   other Security Managers. I do not know for certain.



64. Whenever I did require ARQ data on a matter, I do not recall ever requesting this

   data directly from Fujitsu — I believe that I always asked our admin team to request

   it from Fujitsu for me. I do not think I ever spoke with Penny Thomas or Gareth

   Jenkins from Fujitsu to this regard.

 65. I understood that Gareth Jenkins was a subject matter expert from Fujitsu who

    would provide evidence on whether the Horizon System was working as it should

    in cases. I do not recall ever having any advice or assistance in relation to the

    rules governing independent expert evidence. This is probably because Gareth

    Jenkins was never required to give evidence in any of the cases I took on as Lead

    Investigator.


Relationship with others

 66. Other than attending a few training session at their offices in Birmingham around

    2013, I had very little involvement or interaction with Cartwright King Solicitors.

    They were the external lawyers that the POL Legal Team would instruct on

    matters to provide advice and representation. Very few of my cases got to the

    stage where Cartwright King's involvement was required. Due to the passage of

    time, I cannot remember which of my cases did get to that stage, nor who the

    main contacts I would have liaised with. The two main contacts I remember from

    attending training at Cartwright Kings is Martin Smith and Andrew Bolc_

68. I would like to flag to the Inquiry that the request indicates that I am listed as the

   designated prosecution authority in The Investigation Report dated 13 May 2011

                                      Page 29 of 59

   at [POL00046224]. This is incorrect - I was never the designated prosecution

   authority in any case and the document shows that it was David Pardoe who held

   this role for this specific case.



69. 1 do not remember a great deal about the background of this case and I have had

   to rely on the documents provided to help me recall specific details. In terms of

   setting out my recollection of the background, I defer entirely to the facts set out

   in the Investigation report completed by Steve Bradshaw and dated 3 October

   2011 [POL00057078]. Other than my statement at [POL00057584] I had not

   previously seen any of the other documents listed in paragraph 67 above as I was

   not the Lead Investigator on the case. The Lead Investigator was Steve Bradshaw

   — Mr Bradshaw would have requested me to make this statement as a matter of

   standard practice, following me assisting him in a follow up interview held with Mr

   Ishaq on the 27th September 2011. Such interview is evidenced in

   [P0L00065000] and [P0L00057985].



70. My involvement in the prosecution of Khayyam Ishaq was minimal. I was only the
   2nd Officer at the follow up interview with Mr Ishaq. The role of the 2nd Officer is

   simply to set up the room for an interview and complete any administrative tasks

   required by the Lead Investigator. A 2nd Officer can interject and ask questions if

   relevant during an interview but on this occasion I asked no questions of Mr Ishaq.

   I had no further involvement in the initial investigation or casefile preparation after

   the follow up interview. I did attend court in this matter on one occasion as a

   development and training opportunity as at the time I was a relatively new to the

   Security Manager role and I did not have much experience of hearing attendance.

   I cannot recall which hearing this was.



71. 1 believe that the decision to charge and prosecute Mr Ishaq would have been

   made by the POL Legal Team and signed off by David Pardoe as the designated

   prosecution authority. I had no involvement in this decision.



72. I have considered the statement in [POL00059686] that the Post Office had

   "absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and its

   branch accounting processes." I do believe that at the time I would have

   considered this statement to be accurate because I recall we were regularly

   informed the same by POL in our team meetings.



73.Other than attending the follow up interview as 2nd Officer, providing a witness

   statement and observing a court hearing for experience, I had no other

   involvement in the case of Mr Ishaq.



74. I have considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton &

   Others v Post Office Limited [2021 EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278]. Due to

   my minimal involvement in the case involving Khayyam Ishaq, I do not feel that I

   am able to provide useful comment or reflection on the way the investigation and

   prosecution was conducted by the Post Office, nor on the outcome of the case.

Prosecution of Angela Sefton and Anne Neild



75_ I confirm that I have considered the following documents provided to me in

   connection with this prosecution:

        i) The Audit Report dated 5 September 2012 at [POL00044159];

        ii) The notebook entry, dated 6 January 2012 at [POL00044052];

        iii) The Record of Taped Interview Summary re interview of Angela Sefton

            on 20 January 2012 at [POL00044010] and [POL00057435];

            [P0L00043958];

        vi) The Investigation Report for Angela Sefton dated 1 February 2012 at

            2012 at [POL00057495];

        ix) The call logs at [POL00118474].



76. Prior to receiving the abovementioned documents I only had a vague recollection

   of this case. I have therefore had to rely heavily on the documents provided to me

   to remember specific details, and defer to my statement at [POL00044028] for

   specific details of my involvement. I recall that Steve Bradshaw was the Lead

   Investigator in this matter and I understand that on the evening of 5th January

   2012 Anne Neild had called up Steve and asked to speak with him outside of

   work about a matter. Unbeknown to Ms Neild, there was already an audit

   arranged to take place at the Fazakerley branch the following day due to

   suspicious fraudulent activity being raised by a service user. Steve Bradshaw

   called me ahead of the audit and asked me to go into the Fazakerley branch on

   the day of the audit to assist him with an investigation. He explained the

   background of the circumstances to me and I vaguely remember during this

   conversation he informed me that there had been customer complaints about

   deposits not being placed into their accounts in a timely manner. When I arrived

   at the Fazakerley branch the Audit Team were already present and carrying out

   an audit. As confirmed in my witness statement at [POL00044028], I witnessed

   Anne Neild hand a letter to Mr Bradshaw which was prepared by both Ms Neild

   and Ms Sefton. I learned that the letter stated that they had been supressing

   Girobank deposits from customers. I was then directed to a number of Girobank

   Deposit slips and cheque envelopes by one of the staff, which had been placed

   in a cupboard. I think this was by Ms Sefton but I cannot be certain. There were

   around 40 deposit slips and cheque envelopes and I passed these on to Steve

   Bradshaw who was also present at the branch. Following the completion of the

   audit, a consensual search was carried out at the homes of both Anne Neild and

   Angela Sefton. I was present on both searches and I do not recall anything being

   seized. I do not believe that any interviews were undertaken on this day.



77. I was then present as the 2nd Officer on 20th January 2012 when Anne Neild and

   Angela Sefton voluntarily attended an interview under caution at Bootle Post

   Office. As explained earlier in this statement, the role of the 2nd Officer is to set

                                                                                    WI TN08950100
                                                                                  WI TN08950100




   up the interview room and complete any administrative tasks required by the Lead

   Investigator. A 2nd Officer can interject and ask questions if relevant and during

   the interview with Angela Sefton I can see that I asked a single question about

   whether she had reported shortages to anyone at all, to which she confirmed she

   had not. It appears that I did not ask any questions during the interview with Anne

   Neild.



78. Following the interviews on 20th January 2012, my only further involvement in this

   case was to produce my unsigned witness statement at [POL00044028]. I cannot

   recall if I ever produced a signed version of this statement though I would expect

   I did. Mr Bradshaw would have requested me to make this statement as matter

   of standard practice, to provide an account of me assisting him on the day of the

   Audit on 6th January 2012 and with the interviews under caution held with Ms

   Neild and Ms Sefton on 20th January 2012. I had no involvement after this in

   relation to the casefile preparation, disclosure or seeing the case through the

   prosecution.



79. I confirm that I have reviewed the visit reports contained within [POL00044222]

   and [POL00044223]. As indicated earlier in this statement, between April 2005

   an August 2006 I was an Area Intervention Manager. I worked under a Retail Line

   Manager (who I believe was Paul Williams at the time of these reports) and the

   role involved conducting visits to branches to provide support. These visits were

   based on requests for assistance logged by branches, or any other issues raised

   from within POL such as mails integrity, Opening Hours and Complaints from

   customers. As described earlier in this statement, I think that these issues would


                                    Page 34 of 59
                                                                                       WI TN08950100
                                                                                     WI TN08950100




   have been relayed to me by the Retail Line Manager I was working under, who I

   believe would have obtained that information from a number of sources including

   data analysis produced by Chesterfield, area managers, or clerks and SPMs

   themselves following self-reporting of issues vial the POL helpline.




80. Due to the passage of time I cannot recall these visits I conducted from direct

   memory — I can only rely in what the visit reports say. The visit report dated 14th

   September 2005 shows that I conducted a visit following a shortage discovered

   by SPMs which the branch believed was due to a change to the Horizon system

   or an error in declaring cash. I note that [POL00118474] shows the call logs

   where the cash shortage issues were raised, which then led to my visit. It appears

   that when I visited the shortage had been corrected due to an error in entering

   the ATM figures. Compensating errors can occur if a mistake is made during one

   balance period and rectified in the next.



81. The visit report dated 6th February 2006 illustrates that my visit related to a large

   shortage reported by the branch. My role in visiting was to go through the balance

   documents to see if I could identify if there were any errors in balancing that could

   have explained the shortage. I note that there was no mention of Horizon failure

   in this visit report.



82. I would like to emphasise to the Inquiry that my Area Intervention Manager role

   was not an investigatory role — I was only there to provide support. I had no

   access to the systems and data that Investigators had. I would only go through

   documentation in the branch and available on Horizon and information that was

                                     Page 35 of 59

                                                                                  WI TN08950100




   provided to me in relation to a query raised and I would report back my findings

   to wherever the initial visit request was generated from.




83 Other than the above mentioned visits I conducted on 14th September 2005 and

   6th February 2006 as an Area Intervention Manger, I have not had any other

   previous involvement with interventions at the Fazakerley branch prior to the audit

   on 5 September 2012.




84. In terms of the advice received from Cartwright King in relation to this case, I

   note that various correspondence from the Cartwright King Team has been

   provided with the Request. I would like to flag to the Inquiry that I had never had

   sight of any of this correspondence previously and I was unaware of what advice

   was given.



85. I was also not aware of the actions taken by the Post Office following advice from

   Cartwright King and what charges appeared on the final indictment in this case,

   until I reviewed the following documents provided with the Request:



         i) The Summons for Angela Sefton dated 15 March 2012 at

            [P0L00044030];

         ii) The Summons for Anne Nield dated 15 March 2012 at [POL00044033];

         iii) The Liverpool Crown Court list showing a PCMH in the case on 25 July

            2012 at [POL00058146].

86. I note that these documents confirm that a charge of false accounting was brought

   against both Anne Neild and Angela Sefton. I had not seen these official

   documents before, but I do recall knowing at the time that Ms Neild and Ms Sefton

   were being prosecuted. I was not aware of what the charges were but I would

   have likely suspected false accounting because from my previous involvement in

   the case as a 2nd officer I knew they had delayed deposits.



87. I confirm that I have also considered the following documents provided to me:

        i) The list of witnesses relating to R -v- Angela Mary Sefton at

            [POL00059525];

        ii) The list of exhibits relating to R -v- Angela Mary Sefton at

        xiv)       The unsigned witness statement of Stephen Bradshaw dated 10

            April 2013 at [POL00060275].



88. As I had no further invo►vement in this case beyond the point that I provided my

   unsigned witness statement dated 21 March 2012, I am unable to provide

   comment on what witness evidence was obtained and relied upon by the Post

   Office in these proceedings, nor what it was obtained to address. What I can

   confirm is that I was never called to give evidence in the case.

90.I believe that the Disclosure Officer in this case would have been Steve

   Bradshaw, as he was the Lead Investigator. I note that he is named as the

   disclosure officer on a few of the abovementioned disclosure schedules. I do also

   note that in the email chain at [POL00058303], Andy Bolc from Cartwright Kings

   makes reference in a draft email to Helen Rose being appointed by POL as the

   Disclosure Officer dealing with Horizon challenges in the case. I do not know any

   details about this because as stated above, I did no further work in this matter

   after providing a witness statement on 21 March 2012. What I can confirm is that

   I had no involvement in the disclosure process whatsoever.



91.As I did not play any role in the disclosure process, I do not know what disclosure

   requests and applications were made by the Defence, how the Post Office

   responded to any such requests, nor what advice was sought from and provided

   by Counsel in relation to this. I defer entirely to the documents and

   correspondence provided to me with the Request that relate to this.



92. I confirm that I have considered the following documents:

        i) The Application for Disclosure dated 12 September 2012 and

              attachments at [POL00058294];

        ii) The emails dated 14 and 17 September 2012 at [POL00058303];

        iii) The emails dated 27 and 28 November 2012 at [POL00059421];

        iv) The emails dated 30 November 2012, 3 December 2012 and 5

              December 2012 at [POL00089394];

        v) The Notice of Further Evidence dated 6 December 2012 at

              [POL00044019];

        vi) The witness statement of Gareth Jenkins dated 5 December 2012 at

              [P0L00059424];

        vii) Exhibit GIJ/1 to Gareth Jenkins' witness statement at [POL00044163];

        viii)Exhibit GIJ/2 to Gareth Jenkins' witness statement at [POL00044164].



93. I do not know how Gareth Jenkins came to be involved in this case and I was not

   aware that he had any input until reading the documents produced to me from the

   Inquiry. If I had been made aware at the time I believe I would have understood

   that he was the subject matter expert witness from Fujitsu who would provide

   evidence in relation to the robustness of the Horizon System.



94. At no point was any information given to me by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post

   Office) during the course of the criminal proceedings against Angela Sefton and

   Anne Nield about known bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or

   current.



95. I confirm that I have considered the following documents:

          iii) The letter from Stephen Bradshaw to the Security Operations Casework

             Team dated 10 May 2013 at [POL00044024];

          iv) The Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Roger Allen & Others v Post

             Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 1874 at [POL00113343]



96. Due to me having minimal involvement in only the initial investigation stages, I do

   not feel that I am able to provide useful comment or reflection on the way the

   investigation and prosecution was conducted by the Post Office on the whole, nor

   on the outcome of the prosecution of Angela Sefton and Anne Neild. What I can

   say is that where I assisted during the initial investigation, I believe that the correct

   processes and procedures were followed and from reviewing Mr Bradshaw's

   investigation report, it seems to be compliant.



General



97_ Following the introduction of further questions to be asked to SPM's in an

   interview relating to the Horizon System, I believe that I would have considered a

   challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to others. We had

   to ask them in all new cases going forwards. I cannot recall if I would have thought

   the same from when I started in 2011 until the introduction of these further

   interview questions in 2013. 1 do not recall ever being involved with a case where

   a challenge to the integrity of Horizon was made during an investigation during

                                                                                        WI TN08950100




    this earlier period.



 98. 1 am unsure what is meant by the following comment in [POL00124105] - "the

    risk of testing a case in the criminal court prior to the civil hearing." From reviewing

    the rest of [POL00124105], it appears that Senior Managers in the Security Team

    were of the opinion that they were not prepared to risk initiating criminal

    prosecutions in cases. It may have been the case that following a cease to

    criminal prosecutions, Security Managers were querying whether they would ever

    be reintroduced, and [POL00124105] was the response from Senior

    Management that followed. However, this is just speculation and I cannot confirm

    this for certain. I do not believe I held any opinion or view on this decision — I think

    I would have just thought it was a decision for Senior Managers to make and I

    was happy to just accept it.



 99. Other than the matters I have already addressed in this statement, there are no

    other matters which I consider to be relevant to the Inquiry's Terms of Reference

    that I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair.
