Although we have been discussing the EBT transaction drop-off and bursts with Fujitsu, I have
just remembered that the original email I sent detailed also the issue of counter position
Horizon terminal clock times.

I'm mindful that JPM have a service level to perform transactions at 95% within 2 seconds and
100% within 10 seconds so terminal time offset can impact this.

My original email is below and JPM’s analysis by FAD Code attached. I think there is an
understanding that JPM’s EBT and Horizon at the Data Centre hold slightly different clock times,
but I’m not sure just how counter terminals are clocked and why there should be some
discrepancies of up to 5 minutes and in one case, 21 minutes.

How should we take this forward with Fujitsu?

1. Transaction time offsets - see attached document for JP Morgan analysis

Summary: JP Morgan are reporting that out of a sample of 865,731 transactions from
10,643 FAD codes, 1,640 FAD codes had at least one terminal with ‘its time out by more
than 1 minute (+1.0 second). And of those, 36 FAD codes had at least one terminal with its
time out by more than 5 minutes, with the worst one being out by nearly 21 minutes.

This indicates that clock synchronisation at the counter is not always what it should be. Of
course for banking transactions, the time stamp on the receipt is important in relation to
disputes, but if this is offset considerably to the time of the transaction recorded by the
bank this could further complicate any dispute.
