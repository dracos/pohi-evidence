1 Purpose

This PPD describes the operation of the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH), in
accordance with ICL Pathway Core System Release Plus (CSR+).

This PPD provides a description of all the processes involved in order to
enable the contractual agreement of operations and to be a source from
which authors can develop any further user documentation needed.

2 Scope

This PPD contains high-level information on the Horizon System Helpdesk.

For brevity, the Horizon System Helpdesk is referred to in this document as
‘the HSH’.

This PPD is one of a set of PPDs provided for CSR+. The way in which the
set fits together is described in the CSR+ Introduction PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/093].

The procedure for the post office staff calling the HSH is described in the
CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

3 Overview

The following helpdesk service will be provided by ICL Pathway:

« The HSH, which provides Post Office Counters Ltd outlet staff with a single
point of contact for dealing with all problems relating to the Horizon system
procedures and the Horizon system installed in outlets, and also for OBCS
fallback encashments. Additionally it provides a single point of contact for
operational issues concerning the Horizon system from pre-determined
sources within Post Office Counters Ltd. Any calls received which are
inappropriate to this helpdesk may be re-directed to the NBSC (Network
Business Support Centre).

4 HSH information

The HSH deals with all technical and operational calls related to the ICL
Pathway environment or the data feeds into ICL Pathway from Post Office
Counters Ltd and their clients. It provides a single point of contact for outlet
staff (for the calls described in Section 3 Overview) and ICL Pathway
operation staff. For further information for non-outlet staff and non-ICL staff,
see Section 4.3.4 Non-outlet callers to the HSH.

4.1 HSH telephone number

Outlet staff contact the HSH by telephoning the NBSC telephone number and
selecting the option for the HSH.

4.2 HSH service hours

The service hours of the HSH are:

Full Service 0800 - 2000 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0500 - 0800 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 2000 - 2400 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0700 - 2200 Sunday

Arrangements for Bank Holidays shall only vary from a normal POCL working
day where agreed with POCL, having regard to the applicability throughout
the United Kingdom. No HSH service shall be provided on Christmas day.

The full range of HSH services are provided during the POCL core day.
During these hours of operation, all calls will be handled by ICL Pathway
operators with the telephone equipment relaying messages to callers in
exceptional circumstances.

The skeleton service is provided outside of the POCL core day. The skeleton
service will respond to calls concerning operational incidents that are non-
outlet-related. Calls that are outlet-related will be logged. Advice and
guidance calls will be responded to within the skeleton service, but not
necessarily according to the Service Levels that are applicable to the normal
service. Other outlet-related calls will be dealt with at the beginning of the
next POCL core day.

The HSH is available to take and record calls outside the hours shown above,
but diagnosis and action on those calls will not occur until the next defined
period of cover.

4.3 Contacting the HSH

4.3.1 Call validation

The HSH is available to receive calls from any of its authorised sources and
will take calls that are described in Section 5 HSH calls of this PPD.

All callers to the HSH will be subject to initial validation. Callers failing
validation will not gain access to the HSH and the call will be recorded as
inappropriate.

FUJ00001579
FUJ00001579

The validation performed for each call is as follows:

Outlet staff

erifies the identity of outlet staff by asking questions
lbased on the post office FAD (Financial Accounts
Division) code, post office address, name and
telephone number.

POCL non-outlet
staff

IPOCL non-outlet staff are normally filtered through the
INBSC. The NBSC will register a call with the HSH on
behalf of non-outlet staff. TIP (Transaction Information
Processing) and OSG (Outlet Systems Group) have
facilities to log calls direct with the HSH.

\Circumstances surrounding when these callers request
la call to be logged on the HSH are described in Section
4.3.5.1 POCL.

NBSC

lIn cases of emergency closure, NBSC staff are
required to contact the HSH on behalf of an outlet. The
INBSC caller must provide a PATH code, name and
telephone number to enable the HSH to validate the
caller. The HSH will also require the outlet’s FAD and
Iname, and details of the nature of the incident.

(Circumstances surrounding when the NBSC should
contact the HSH are described in Section 4.3.5.2
INBSC.

Password requests [Callers requesting the issue of authorised-user

passwords must contact the NBSC for verification.

[They will then be issued with a reference number and
lasked to contact the HSH. This process is described

more fully in Section 4.3.3 Authorised-user password
laccess.

(Callers contacting the HSH without verification will be
refused access to the authorised-user password
service.

ICL Pathway
Suppliers

These groups are provided with a PATH code and will
lbe subject to the same verification procedures as
IPOCL non-outlet staff.

(Circumstances surrounding when these callers contact
he HSH are described in Section 4.3.5.3 ICL Pathway.

Before calling the HSH, the caller should gather as much information as
possible to enable the HSH operator to diagnose the nature of the problem

swiftly.

4.3.2

4.3.3

4.3.4

Call logging

The operator will attempt to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone call. The information will be recorded as an incident onto a
helpdesk system and allocated a unique call reference number.

At the end of the call the operator will inform the caller of the call identity
number and what action to expect next. This identity number should be
recorded by the caller and quoted if the caller needs to ring the HSH about
this incident.

If the caller's query/problem is not resolved within the initial telephone call,
the HSH will advise the caller the date/time by which they will next receive
contact. (This contact will take the form of either a site visit by an engineer or
a telephone call from someone in the ICL Pathway support chain.)

Authorised-user password access
There are two types of requirement for authorised-user password access:

e Planned, i.e. from POCL Auditors in the case of an Audit visit, or Retail
Network Managers/Retail Line Managers/Performance Improvement
Advisors in the case of a planned outlet closure.

e Unplanned, i.e. when an outlet manager forgets their password or
becomes locked out of the system by repeated incorrect entry of their
password.

The authorised-user password is issued by the HSH once the caller has been
verified by the NBSC.

The caller requiring authorised-user password access will call the NBSC and
obtain verification and a unique reference number. The caller will then call
the HSH quoting this unique reference number and will be asked to perform
the authorised-user password procedure sequence following instructions from
the HSH. This will allow access to the system.

The authorised-user password is valid for one session only. When the caller
logs out, the authorised-user password can no longer be used. Where the
caller has forgotten the password it is a priority for them to set up a new
password for normal use, using the procedures described in the CSR+ ACUA
PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/090].

The system requires the authorised-user procedure sequence to be
completed within five minutes of being started.

Non-outlet callers to the HSH

The HSH is available to take incident calls from sources other than POCL
outlets. These sources are NBSC, TIP and OSG for POCL operational calls
and from within ICL Pathway.

These non-outlet callers will be pre-authorised by the allocation of a dummy
FAD code (PATH code). This PATH code is allocated by ICL Pathway who
will agree the incident types available to be registered via this route.

4.3.5 Non-outlet call sources

4.3.5.1 POCL

POCL incidents affecting the EPOSS (Electronic Point of Sale Service), APS
(Automated Payments Service) or reference data services that arise in the
POCL environment will also be reported to the HSH in accordance with
agreed procedures.

4.3.5.2 NBSC

In the event of an unplanned post office closure, the affected post office will
contact the NBSC and inform them. The NBSC will then contact the HSH on
behalf of the affected post office to register an incident. The NBSC operator
will need to quote the post office FAD code, their name and telephone
number and the nature of the problem (see the CSR+ Operating Environment
PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097]. Additionally, NBSC staff will undergo the caller
authentication process which requires them to provide a pre-agreed pass
code before the HSH will activate an emergency closure.

4.3.5.3ICL Pathway
Incidents arising from within the ICL Pathway operation will result in a call to
the HSH. Callers from within the ICL Pathway operation will also have to pass
the same verification procedure as an outlet by providing a dummy FAD code
or PATH code and name to access the HSH.

4.3.6 Call escalation
Call escalation can be interpreted in three separate ways:
e Anincident passed through the support chain for resolution.
« SLA (Service Level Agreement) targets in jeopardy.

e Acustomer unhappy with the service.

4.3.6.1 Incident passed through the support chain

Once an incident is registered onto the HSH incident management system, it
is likely to be passed along the support chain to different support groups who
are responsible for different areas of the system, e.g. Networks. The HSH
staff have visibility of all incidents and will track progress of the call
throughout its life.

Version: 4.0
Commercial in Confidence Date: 20/09/01

4.3.6.2 SLA targets in jeopardy

Should the SLA targets of a particular incident approach or pass minimum
SLA levels, the HSH staff will begin to escalate visibility of this situation,
using a manual escalation process to ensure timely escalation into ICL
Pathway, its supplier, and Post Office Counters Ltd where appropriate.

This escalation procedure may utilise a problem manager at a predetermined
point. The problem manager will be responsible for ensuring that the correct
management and resources are in place to resolve the problem and restore
the service levels. The problem manager will be supported by an agreed
cross-boundary escalation process that covers the Post Office Counters Ltd
and ICL Pathway organisations, should disputes of ownership and
responsibility arise.

4.3.6.3 Customer unhappy with service

4.3.7

The caller's view of escalation will arise should the caller be unhappy with the
service provided or disagree with the progress or actions taken to resolve a
particular incident. The caller will contact the HSH to register his or her
dissatisfaction. The HSH telephone operator will log a complaint incident and
then pass the caller onto a supervisor. The supervisor will attempt to correct
the situation. If the situation cannot be corrected by the supervisor, the call
will be terminated and the caller will then be contacted by an ICL Pathway
manager within two hours.

All complaint calls will be brought to the attention of ICL Pathway Service
Management and are available to the Service Management Forum if
requested.

Inappropriate calls

The HSH may be mistakenly contacted by persons not authorised to use the
HSH. These callers will be unable to pass verification and will be refused
access, an incident call will be recorded on the HSH incident management
system.

Should the caller be authorised to contact the HSH and pass verification the
HSH operator will establish the nature of the caller and if the issue is outside
of the responsibility of the HSH the caller will, where applicable, be re-
directed to the correct helpdesk. An incident will be recorded on the HSH
incident management system.

Callers requiring re-direction to another helpdesk will be supplied with the
phone number of the appropriate desk, if known.

4.3.8 Call redirecting
If the HSH receives a call that is not appropriate to the HSH, where possible
the HSH operator will advise the caller to ring the appropriate number. Where
applicable the HSH operator will supply the phone number of the appropriate
desk.

4.1.9 Contingency

In conventional circumstances the HSH service is provided from one site with
a second site being used to deal with overspill at peak times. These sites are
geographically separated, but linked by common computer and telephony
systems. Should the first site become unable to operate, the second site will
take over.

Depending on the nature and extent of the problem, there may be a period of
around two hours during which only a reduced service will be possible.

5.13 Security

Incident

Description

Authorised-user
password
required

Passwords within an office are controlled by the
manager, and if a member of staff forgets their
password the manager can reset it. If the manager
forgets their password they should contact the NBSC;
an emergency password can then be issued by the
HSH using the authorised-user password procedure to
allow them to reset their own password. Audit staff will
also need access to the system and require use of the
authorised-user service to gain access. Each person
authorised to use this service will be pre-registered and
will have to undergo a verification procedure before
access to the authorised-user service is permitted.

Once verified the caller will be issued with a password
that is valid for only one session and cannot be used
again. (Further information on using authorised-user
passwords is given in the CSR+ Access Control and
User Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/090].)

Caller fails initial
verification

Callers who ring the HSH in error and are not
authorised to use the HSH, will be refused access to
the HSH and directed to the NBSC.

Clerk/supervisor
access issue

If clerks/supervisors forget their passwords/get locked
out, the manager can sort it out. Any calls received by
HSH relating to this issue are directed to the NBSC to
have the procedures reinforced and to resolve any
issues.

failed, could not
get security data

If a member of outlet staff reports that the system
displayed a message during a POLO procedure to say
that communication with the centre failed and it could
not get new security data, the HSH will establish the
cause of the failure.

e Ifthe outlet is not currently authorised to collect the
security data (for example, because an authorisation
granted by the automated systems has expired), the
HSH will invoke the necessary authorisation (known
as ‘opening the door’). If the HSH are unable to do
this, the incident will be passed into the ICL Pathway
support organisation.

e If the outlet cannot communicate with the centre via
the WAN, then the HSH will ensure that the

¢ communications problem is resolved.

The HSH may advise the outlet to continue using the
old security data whilst the problem is being resolved.

Equipment stolen

Post offices that have equipment stolen must follow
existing Post Office Counters Ltd procedures to report
the theft (e.g. contact the Police and NBSC). ICL
Pathway will replace the stolen equipment once the
incident has been reported to the HSH by the NBSC.
Should the counter or the ICL Pathway wiring be
undamaged, ICL Pathway will arrange for the counter
system to be installed quickly to bring the post office
back into operation. However work may have to be
scheduled to correct any physical damage: this will be
arranged at a suitable time and agreed with the outlet
manager. In some cases this may result in a short-term
closure.

Manager access
issue

If a member of the outlet staff requests manager access
then, if there is no manager available, the caller is
referred to the NBSC for the provision of an authorised-
user password.

OBCS stop list
enquiry

If the customer wishes to make an OBCS encashment
during a period of system failure, the HSH will ask the
caller for the Customer Reference Number, Order Book
Serial Number and Common Payment Package
Number. The HSH will then check the database and
advise the caller of the following:

e Ifthere is no stop in place, to make the encashment.

e Ifthere is a stop in place, not to make any
encashments but to impound the book.

e If there is a recall in place with the effective date
earlier than today, to encash one valid foil and
impound the book.

e If there is a recall in place with the effective date of
today or later, to encash valid foils dated prior to
and including today and impound the book.

PMMC or PIN lost Each time a PC is powered on, the Post Office Log On

(POLO) procedure must be performed. The outlet
manager is issued with a PMMC card plus a spare and
PIN when the equipment is installed. This card and PIN
must be kept in separate secure locations and used
when the equipment is powered on after being switched
off as described in the CSR+ Access Control and User
Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/090].

ICL Pathway CSR+ HORIZON SYSTEM HELPDESK Processes Ref: CS/PRO/092

and Procedures Description
Version: 4.0
Commercial in Confidence Date: 20/09/01

If the card or PIN is lost, the HSH must be contacted.
The HSH operator will ask a series of questions to
verify the identity of the caller and then pass the caller
on to a supervisor. The supervisor will then assist the
outlet manager to generate a new PIN or allocate a PIN
to the spare card. This process involves the caller
following verbal instructions from the HSH Supervisor.
In extreme cases, where the system cannot generate
the PIN easily, the caller will be taken through the
underlying recovery process that involves typing a 15-
character Fallback Response Code into the Horizon
system.

The new PIN must be stored securely as instructed in
the CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/090]. In the case of a lost card, this
procedure invalidates the lost card and a replacement
card is ordered for issue to the post office to use as a
spare.

If both cards are lost, stolen or damaged, then the
system will be declared down and an engineer
dispatched to replace the cards and bring the system
back into operation. The outlet manager, when
completing the Service Visit Report Card, will declare
whether the cards were lost, stolen or damaged and will
surrender any damaged cards to the engineer.

Secure ISDN box

If an outlet manager reports that there is a problem with
the secure ISDN box (the lockable cabinet that contains
the robust socket at insecure locations e.g. serving
points for trolleys and mobiles, then an engineer will be
sent to secure or replace the box as necessary.

Security breach

If the outlet manager or Post Office Counters Ltd
representative suspects a security breach, for example,
passwords have become known to an unauthorised
person, the Horizon system has been tampered with or
someone suspects their user name has been used
without their knowledge, the HSH must be informed
immediately.

The matter will be escalated according to ICL Pathway
escalation procedures. The caller will be contacted
during this investigation and is advised to make notes
of the circumstances surrounding the suspected
security breach. ICL Pathway may remove any system
access at this point and the post office may be
prevented from using the system until authorisation is
given.

If a problem arises in using the trolley containing the
equipment for a moveable outlet, the outlet manager
will ring the HSH to gain access to suitable support.

In the event that an item needs to be repaired or
replaced, the HSH will allocate an engineer to attend
the post office. The caller will be told when the
engineer is expected to arrive.

The engineer will normally carry spare parts with him;
however occasionally spare parts may need to be
couriered to the post office. In this instance the
engineer will arrive shortly after the spare part has
been delivered. The post office will be informed in
advance to expect a spare part to be delivered. Once
at the post office the engineer will replace the faulty
part, test its operation and then check that the outlet
manager is happy that the trolley is now operational.
The engineer will remove any broken equipment when
he leaves.

If equipment is damaged the engineer will complete a
report on the circumstances surrounding the damage
which will be agreed and signed by the outlet manager.

Priority depends on whether the site is a single or
double location trolley, and whether the trolley can be
used for trading.
