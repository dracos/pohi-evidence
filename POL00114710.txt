All

See e-mail below which confirms full repayment from Wilson in respect of the outstanding confiscation
order.

Paul — please arrange for the restraint order to be discharged at Croydon CC. An RX4 will also need to be
sent off in respect of the property at Lineholt Close. The other property lease was not registered to Wilson
so no need for RX’s. Have attached a draft discharge and RX4.

I agree that this matter should be listed for a default hearing as the time to pay has long since passed.

I was under the impression that the enforcement of orders is down to the RART as the Post Office® has not
appointed anyone to lead on enforcement hearings previously. There were assets held under restraint, which
at the time were valued in excess of the order and I am not aware of any applications to vary the restraint
order, so I do not understand why the order has not been paid.

Feel free to ring if you wish to discuss.

Hello Graham,

We have not received any payments from Julian Wilson since last year. Would you have any comments to
make on us listing him for a default hearing at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court?

If we did go ahead with this, would you appoint someone to lead for the prosecution? I can send you a list of
possible court dates if you agree that a court listing would be appropriate.

Regards, Graham
