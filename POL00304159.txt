Deloitte's were recently appointed by Post Office to consider whether our current assurance work covers the key risks
relating to the HNGx processing environment. The report which has been loaded onto BoardPad is currently a
summary of the draft report and is for discussion at tomorrow's Board meeting. Apologies for the delay in forwarding
the draft.

Recognising that work of this nature cannot give total assurance, the Board can take comfort from the initial findings
that the work undertaken on the IT Control Environment, HNGx Implementation and Specific Risks is comparable with
similar organisations, and that in particular the IT control environment adopts best practice.

This draft reflects the position at this point in time. We will be working with Deloitte with the aim of providing
greater comfort by completing the work and addressing (as appropriate) the areas which Deloitte’s have highlighted
to improve the control environment, e.g. by taking a holistic view across the business operational areas and the IT
control environment for HNGx.

The full report is expected in May.

Lesley Sewell/Chris Aujard
