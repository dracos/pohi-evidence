CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED I + fe
POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
Steering Group Meeting: 24 May 2017

DECISION: Should Post Office continue to preserve the Horizon data held by Fujitsu?

SUMMARY

Transaction data is normally held by Fujitsu for 7 years, following which it is purged. In October 2014
and as part of the Mediation Scheme, Post Office placed a three year hold on the purging of this data.
As such, Fujitsu have continued to hold the transaction data for all branches which has been generated
since October 2007.

The three year hold placed on the data ends in October 2017 and Fujitsu have queried whether Post
Office wishes to re-start purging the data. Fujitsu believe that they have enough storage space to hold
the data from another year but the costs of this storage are not yet known. After this point, new hardware
will be needed.

The transaction data is of critical importance to the Group Action. Allowing it to be deleted would have
serious repercussions on Post Office's Defence in the Group Action and expose Post Office to massive
criticism by the Court (and may be the media).

RECOMMENDATION

Subject to the costs of the storage not being extremely high, it is strongly recommended that Fujitsu
continue to hold the data until at least October 2018.
