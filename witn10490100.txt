                               FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF KEITH GILCHRIST




            I, Keith Gilchrist, will say as follows:


            Introduction


                  1. I am a former employee of the Post Office Limited and I worked within the

                      business for around 3 years between June 2010 and June 2013. During this

                      time I held the following positions: Security Manager and Team Leader.


                 2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the

                      "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 2 November

                      2023 (the "Request"). In order to produce this statement I have received

                      legal assistance from Ashfords LLP. When seeking their assistance, I was

                      assisted by the Post Office in the initial stage of confirming availability of

                      insurance coverage, in order to cover the associated legal costs.


                  3. What I include in this statement is to the best of my recollection.

                      Nevertheless, the Request relates to matters that occurred over 10 years

                      ago, so there have been times where I have found it difficult to recall precise

                                                                                                     WI TN10490100

                      details and I have had to defer to the accompanying documents enclosed to

                      me. I have indicated clearly where this is the case.


            Background


                 4. At some point in the first quarter of 2010 1 applied externally for a part time

                      role in the Post Office Limited. I recall the role being advertised as a part-time

                      Security Manager, to look after the security of Northern Ireland Post Office

                      cash in transit operations. I attended an interview conducted by Dave Pardoe

                      and Lesley Frankland and by the time my vetting was completed I was

                      offered a full time role as a Physical Security Manager for Northern Ireland. I

                      accepted the job and started in June 2010.


                  5. My role of Security Manger entailed physical security of the Post Office. I was

                      responsible for implementing security measures for the business in its cash in

                      transit operations, its property, for its people and its assets. I was based in

                      Belfast but after several months in post I was asked to cover the Northern

                      parts of the UK, again from a physical security perspective only.


                 6. To the best of my recollection, there were three occasions where I carried out

                      a role which did not relate to physical security. These are the three

                      occasions where I attended interviews under caution as a second officer

                      carried out as part of an investigation - I deal with this in more detail in

                      paragraph 14 below.


                 7. During my time as a Security Manager I also delivered training to sub

                      postmasters and other post office staff on security and risk management. I

                                                                                                    WI TN10490100

                      have a Masters in Security and Risk Management, which I obtained from

                      Leicester University in 2003.


                  8. When in my post as Security Manager I reported to my Team Leader, Lesley

                      Frankland , who was based in Manchester. I recall that Lesley reported up to

                      Dave Pardoe who was Senior Management within the Security Team and

                      Dave Pardoe reported up to John Scott, who was the Post Office Head of

                      Security.


                  9. At some point in early 2012 my Team Leader, Lesley Frankland, transferred

                      to a different Post Office position outside of the Security Team. This may

                      have been around April 2012 but I cannot recall for certain. At this time I was

                      asked by Andy Hayward to temporarily step into a Team Leader position,

                      where I would report to the following line managers: Andy Hayward, Rob King

                      and Dave Pardoe. I primarily reported to Andy Hayward but I was also

                      involved in a project where I reported to Rob King. This was project

                      Grapevine, which I comment briefly upon in paragraph 20 below. If both Andy

                      and Rob were off on leave I would report to Dave Pardoe. I believe this

                      temporary Team Leader position was intended to last for a few months,

                      during which there was an application process within the Security Team to fill

                      the role permanently. I was successful in obtaining the role on a permanent

                      basis, but I cannot remember if others applied or if I was just the most

                      appropriate person for the job at that time. I cannot recall the exact date that I

                      was appointed in to the role permanently, but I believe this was around the

                      summer months in 2012.

                  10. 1 note that on documentation I have received from the Inquiry my role is

                      referred to as a 'Fraud Team Manager.' I always referred to myself as a

                      Team Leader, but for the avoidance of doubt, I believe that `Team Leader'

                      and `Fraud Team Manger' mean the same thing. Simon Hutchinson (who

                      was based in Northern Ireland) was recruited into the Security Manger

                      position that I had vacated, to deal with physical security.


                  11. When in my Team Leader position, the following regional Security Mangers

                      reported to me: Kevin Ryan (Greater Manchester) Michael Stanway (North

                      England), Andrew Wise, (Midlands) Steve Bradshaw, (Liverpool, Cheshire

                      and North Wales), Suzanne Winters (Northern Ireland) and Robert Daley

                      (Scotland). At this time my recollection was that these Security Managers

                      were primarily engaged in Post Office investigations, with the exception of

                      Kevin Ryan who I think also did physical security.


                  12. From the outset I made clear to Andy Hayward that I would only agree to step

                      into a Team Leader role on the proviso that I would not have to provide any

                      in-depth investigation supervision to Security Managers unless I was properly

                      trained on the processes and procedures followed by the Post Office in

                      relation to investigations and the in-depth workings of a Post Office. I never

                      received extensive training on these processes and procedures so my role as

                      a Team Leader was to help manage the Security Managers mentioned in

                      paragraph 11 above, in terms of logistical and administrative matters

                      including carrying out team meetings to discuss workloads and progress. For

                      example, I would look at how many cases they had on to see if workloads

                      were manageable and I would check who would be best placed to attend

                                                                                                     WI TN10490100

                      interviews as a second officer based on everyone's workloads and the

                      location of the interview. I would also conduct one to one meetings on

                      performance_ I would also approve holiday leave and carry out other general

                      administration. By the time I left the Post Office in June 2013, I do not believe

                      I had provided supervision to any Security Mangers in my Team as to the

                      substance of the investigations they carried out. As far as I can recall the

                      arrangement was that Andrew Daley would provide this supervision, who was

                      a Team Leader in Case Management. I deal with this in more detail below

                      within the section of my statement headed 'The Security Team's role in

                      relation to criminal investigations'.


                  13. During my time in the roles of both Security Manager and Team Leader, I do

                      not believe I had any department or sub-postmaster disciplinary matters to

                      address. I also never had any involvement in litigation case strategy or

                      disclosure in criminal or civil proceedings.


                  14. I was not involved in the conduct of criminal investigations in general, apart

                      from on three occasions where I sat in on interviews under caution with Sub

                      Postmasters as a second officer; one in Scotland and two in Northern Ireland.

                      I have no recollection of the Sub Postmasters interviewed on these

                      occasions, except to say they were in relation to Post Offices in Strabane,

                      Belfast and Glasgow. I believe that the reason I would have attended the

                      interviews in Northern Ireland was due to my location, and the interview in

                      Glasgow due to the unavailability of any other investigator to assist. My

                      involvement in these interviews was to assist with setting up the room and

                      taking the taped recording. I do not believe I asked the interviewee any

                                                                                                       WI TN10490100
                                                                                                   WI TN10490100

                      questions and I played no further role in these investigations beyond sitting

                      as a second officer in the interviews.


                  15. 1 do not recall ever liaising with other Post Office departments in respect of

                      the progress of any investigations in both my time as a Security Manager and

                      a Team Leader.


                  16. Throughout my time as a Security Manager and Team Leader I received no

                      extensive training on the operational practices and procedures of the Post

                      Office Security Team, in relation to both physical security and investigations. I

                      did receive a week's worth of brief training on the Police and Criminal

                      Evidence Act (PACE) and other matters relating to investigations at some

                      point towards the end of 2012, but I cannot recall exactly when. I comment

                      further on this training under the heading Training, instructions and guidance

                      to investigators within the Security team' below.

                  18. I would like to make the Inquiry aware that a lot of the documents listed in

                      paragraph 17 above were created before I started the working at the Post

                      Office in June 2010, and I cannot recall ever seeing them. There are also

                      documents in this list that are dated after I left in June 2013. Again, I do not

                      recall ever seeing these. For those documents that were created within the

                      time I worked at the Post Office, it is likely I would have received them if they

                      were circulated to the Security Team, but I am unable now to recall when or if

                      I was aware of them at the time.


                  19. In terms of the organisational structure of the Post Office Security Team, I

                      recall that there were various sub-departments within it, all reporting

                      ultimately to John Scott, Head of Security. I believe that Dave Pardoe was

                      senior management responsible for the criminal investigations and physical

                      security side of the Post Office Security Team. I believe that John Bigley was

                      senior management responsible for policy and strategy within the Security

                      Team, with strategic and policy support also being provided by Dave Posnett

                      and Graham Ward to John Scott, Dave Pardoe and John Bigley.


                 20. I also recall that there were North and South UK regional Mangers, Andy

                      Hayward and Rob King, who would report to Dave Pardoe. I cannot recall

                      everything that Andy and Rob were responsible for, but I was aware that they

                      looked after physical security and they worked on the introduction of

                      Grapevine, which was a system based on a national intelligence model by

                      which the Post Office could be briefed on crime in their area. I believe that

                      Andy Hayward also had day to day supervision of the 3 regional security

                      teams (the make-up of which I set out in paragraph 23 below) and was more

                      hands on with looking after the investigations side of the Post Office Security

                      Team.


                  21. I also recall that there were specific members who were responsible for

                      training within the Security Team. This was Paul Southin and Paul Whitaker

                      and I think they reported to John Bigley_


                  22. There was also a Case Management sub-department within the Security

                      Team, which consisted of Jane Banbury, Jane Owen and Andrew Daley as

                      their Team Leader. The role of Case Management was to assign case

                      management arrangements and assist with managing and responding to

                      communications between the Security Team and the Post Office Legal

                      department. They did this on behalf of the Security Team, removing

                      significant administration obligations from Security Managers and the Team

                      Leaders. As far as I can recall, the Case Management sub-department

                      always existed when I worked within the Security Team. I do not know if there

                      was a point before I joined where that department did not exist.


                 23. From my recollection, when I was a Team Leader the investigations side of

                      the Security Team were split into the following three regional areas:


                        i_    South UK, where the Team Leader was originally Jason Collins and

                              latterly Darrell Kennedy and he had 6 to 8 security managers reporting

                              to him;


                       ii.    Mid UK, where the Team Leader was Helen Dickinson and she had 6

                              to 8 security managers reporting to her; and

                                                                                                  WI TN10490100

                       iii.   North UK (including Scotland and Northern Ireland) where the Team

                              leader was myself and I had the 7 security managers previously

                              outlined in this witness statement reporting to me.


                  24. I would like to flag to the Inquiry that when I was a Team Leader in the

                      Security Team, Andrew Daley (Team Leader in Case Management) reviewed

                      the content of the North Region criminal investigation files on my behalf due

                      to my lack of experience and knowledge of Post Office procedures and

                      processes relating to criminal investigations and Horizon. He also assisted

                      with providing supervision in investigations for the North UK Team. I believe

                      Andy Hayward also provided supervision to the Security Managers in my

                      team on occasion. As mentioned earlier in this statement, my experience as

                      a Security Manager prior to me becoming a Team Leader only related to

                      physical security and when I became a Team Leader I only really dealt with

                      logistical and administration matters for my team.


                 25. The only other sub-department I recall is the Financial Investigation Unit who

                      I believe were involved in recovering financial losses faced by the Post

                      Office. I do not believe I had any involvement or interaction with that team so

                      I am unable to comment on their specific roles.


                 26. I confirm that I have reviewed the following: [POL00122075],

                      [P0L00122078], [P0L00122170], [P0L00122037], [POL00118289],

                      [POL00118377], [POL00118290] and [POL00122103]. I can see that

                      [POL00118290], [POL00118377] and [POL00118289] is email

                      correspondence from 18.12.2012 relating to the renaming of Post Office

                      investigating and reporting documents. I believe I am simply copied in to this

                      correspondence due to my role as Team Leader. It appears to be `catch all'

                      correspondence and I do not believe that I had any involvement in renaming

                      or carrying out any review of the documents. I can see from the emails that it

                      was Suzanne and Robert who were requested to review the Northern Ireland

                      and Scotland forms referred to within this correspondence.


                  27. I can see that the email from me to Andy Hayward dated 06.02.2013 in the

                      chain at [POL00122103] relates to the identification of a legal firm in Northern

                      Ireland to assist and represent the Post Office in criminal investigations and

                      prosecutions in Northern Ireland. McCarten Turkington and Breen was the

                      firm who entered into discussions with Post Office but I do not think this was

                      formalised prior to my departure from the Post Office in June 2013. I believe

                      the rationale for this was that historically the Police Service of Northern

                      Ireland (PSNI) assisted the Post Office by accepting their investigation files at

                      their Central Processing Office where I believe they conducted a check of the

                      papers and then electronically submitted them to the Director of Public

                      Prosecutions. I believe the Security Managers working on cases in Northern

                      Ireland would have sent their investigation file to the PSNI directly, perhaps

                      with the assistance or on advice from Case Management. Due to reducing

                      numbers of police officers and budget strains the PSNI were reviewing all

                      services provided and this was one under threat of termination. If the police

                      were not going to assist in this way, the Post Office would need other

                 28. I have no recollection of the em ails at [PO 00122078] dated 05.02.2013 and

                      at [POL00122170] dated 11.03.2013, nor of the meeting mentioned within by

                      Andy Hayward. I could have attended this meeting but I do not remember if I

                      did. It looks like it related to having a final review meeting to make sure all

                      amendments to the Post Office policy had been addressed. I cannot recall if

                      had any direct involvement in the formulation or amendment of this policy,

                      apart from the submission of opinions and ideas to Andy Wise via email, as

                      mentioned directly below.


                  29. 1 can see that the email dated 03.01.2013 at [POL00122037] is an email from

                      me to Andrew Wise, who with Rob King was reviewing the Post Office

                      investigation polices for the Security Team. I note that I am seeking

                      clarification as to why we were required to report discipline matters to a

                      contract manager prior to court proceedings. I do not believe that this is me

                      playing a part in managing and or developing the procedure around this. To

                      the best of my recollection I was providing my opinion on the required course

                      of action and it is clear from this email that I believed it was nonsensical and

                      unnecessary. I believe the rationale I had for sending this email was that I

                      thought that allowing discipline matters to be progressed beyond a

                      suspension prior to the outcome of a criminal matter would be unfair on the

                      person subject to an investigation. I also thought it could potentially interfere

                      with the criminal investigation and any potential proceedings, as the discipline

                      reports were available to the Sub postmaster prior to the completion of the

                      investigation. I would like to emphasise that this email was not an attempt by

                      me to prohibit appropriate disclosure at interview stage, on completion of an

                      investigation or subsequently at court. I just did not think it was appropriate to

                      be sharing the details of a criminal investigation with anyone outside of the

                      Security Team, beyond advising interested Post Office departments that a

                      criminal matter was being investigated and that any subsequent proceedings

                      were pending or yet to be decided. I believe that any further discipline

                      procedures beyond a suspension should only have been implemented

                      following the ultimate outcome of a prosecution and whatever those further

                      discipline procedures were should have been picked up by the Contract

                      Manager then.


                  30. I believe that the following legislation, policies and / or guidance governed the

                      conduct of investigations conducted by the Security Team during the period I

                      worked within it:


                        i.    Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1989;

                       ii.    Theft Act 1968;

                       iii.   Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989

                              [POL00121591];

                       iv.    Post Office Prosecution Policy 2012 [POL0031034]; and

                       v.     Post Office Ltd PNC Security Operating Procedures [POL00105229].


                  31. I believe elements of the legislation and policies outlined above may have

                      been covered in the week's training course I received in late 2012 on PACE

                      and investigations in general, which I deal with later in this statement. I know

                      that there is likely to be other legislation, policies and guidance that governed

                      the conduct of investigations conducted by the Security Team, but I am not

                      aware of what these are. As stated above, I did not really get involved in the

                      substance of criminal investigations_

                  32. The only difference I was aware of between the policies and legislation

                      governing investigations conducted by the Post Office Security Team in

                      England and Wales and Northern Ireland was the submission of investigation

                      files in Northern Ireland to the Police Service in that jurisdiction. The Northern

                      Ireland Police Service would then put the matter onto their electronic case file

                      system and would then forward the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions

                      to obtain a decision on whether to pursue a prosecution_ There was a similar

                      process in Scotland via the Procurator Fiscal. As far as I can recall, it was the

                      Post Office Security leaders, John Scott and Dave Pardoe who made the

                      decision to prosecute for England and Wales in consultation with the Post

                      Office Legal department. They may also have had some role for Scotland

                      and N. Ireland but I am unaware of that process if they did.


                  33. I cannot recall there being any impact of the separation of the Post Office

                      from Royal Mail in relation to the way investigations were conducted within

                      the Post Office. I had only been employed for 6 months by the time the split

                      occurred and I was not involved in investigations at all.


                  34. I do not know what the process was to deal with any complaints raised

                      against the Post Office Security Team in relation to the conduct of an

                      investigation. As far as I can recall I never received or dealt with any

                      complaints to this regard.


                  35. In terms of the supervision provided to Security Managers, each Security

                      Manager had a Team Leader who they could go to in relation to any queries

                      on their cases or in relation to any other day to day issues. In turn, Team

                      Leaders had line managers who they could contact if they needed assistance

                                                             Page 16 of 41

                      or guidance with the supervision they were providing to Security Mangers.

                      There was also the Post Office Legal Team who could provide professional

                      assistance and guidance to Security Managers and Team Leaders in relation

                      to investigations upon request, but I am not sure what sort of requests these

                      would have been. I presume, for example, it could have related to what other

                      evidence was needed in a case. I believe that these were the supervision

                      arrangements in place for Security Managers in all regions, however, as

                      explained above it was slightly different for my team as whilst I was the Team

                      Leader for the North UK region, I did not provide supervision on the

                      substance of investigations to the Security Managers within that team. I only

                      dealt with logistical and administrative matters, but the arrangement was that

                      the Security Mangers within my team could go to Andrew Daley or Andy

                      Hayward for support and supervision on their files.


                  36. I have no experience or recollection of any difference in policy and practice

                      regarding the investigation and prosecution of Crown Office employees in

                      comparison with the investigation and prosecution of SPMs and/or their

                      assistants.


            Audit and investigation


                  37. I confirm that I have considered the document "Condensed Guide for Audit

                      Attendance" (version 2, October 2008) [POL00104821]. I would like to flag to

                      the Inquiry that I was never an auditor in the Post Office, and I have no

                      recollection of ever attending an audit during my time as a Security Manager

                      and a Team Leader. From review of the documents provided to me I believe

                      that the circumstances in which a Security Manager would attend an audit

                                                             Page 17 of 41
                                                                                                          WI TN10490100
                                                                                                      WI TN10490100

                      would be where there was a suspected crime after a cash shortage or

                      potential fraud was discovered by the audit team. Reflecting on my time as a

                      Team Leader, I do not think it would have been logistically possible for the

                      Security Managers in my team to always attend an audit on the day, as they

                      covered a very wide area within the UK.


                  38. As already alluded to above, I was not heavily involved in the substance of

                      investigations in general, so I am unable to set out all the steps that would

                      have been taken by the Security Manager when attending an audit.

                      However, I would have assumed that where they did attend their role would

                      be to search for and seize appropriate evidence of any potential criminal

                      wrong doing. I believe that they would have had to treat anything seized as

                      an exhibit and would have labelled and secured it for future reference in an

                      interview, and to be included in their investigation files. I think this evidence

                      could have been receipts and stock books and information from the auditors,

                      but I am not sure of this for certain. I was not aware that this also would have

                      included printouts obtained on the day by the auditors from the Horizon

                      system - I learned this recently from following other evidence provided in the

                      Inquiry. I would assume that upon having a suspicion of a criminal offence

                      having been committed by the SPM, deputy or staff, the Security Manager in

                      attendance at the audit would also have the responsibility to caution those

                      who were suspected before they could proceed to ask any further questions.

                      I believe that Security Managers may have also requested to search home

                      addresses if considered appropriate and with the property owner's

                      permission.

                  39. As far as I am aware, following an audit and a shortfall being found, the

                      Auditors would report their findings to Case Management or directly to the

                      Team Leader or one of the Security Managers for that area and I believe a

                      case would then be commenced. Whether that commencement into an

                      investigation was approved by the Security Manager's Team Leader or

                      Regional or Senior Manager in consultation with Case Management I cannot

                      recall. Being a Team Leader, I may well have got phone calls from Auditors

                      to say they believed there was a short fall at a branch, but if I did I believe I

                      would have reported this to Case Management to allocate it out to a

                      respective Security Manager to investigate. I think I only ever allocated a

                      case out to Security Mangers directly on one occasion. This was the case

                      involving the Whitehaven branch.


                 40. As far as I can recall I was never involved in debt recovery and have no

                      knowledge of how and when instances would be referred to there.


                 41. From my recollection, the Contract Manager took a decision whether to

                      suspend the SPM when an investigation had been raised, but they had no

                      input into the decision as to whether to commence a criminal investigation.


                 42. I believe that the trigger for commencing an investigation was an

                      `unexplained loss', but I do not recall a specific figure that would trigger this.

                      There was no change to this during my time with the Post Office as far as

                      can recall.


                 43. I have considered section 7 of [POL00085977]_ Unfortunately I have no

                      knowledge of the differences between the audit process between Northern

                      Ireland and England and Wales.

            Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings


                 44. In England and Wales, I was under the impression that decisions on whether

                      to prosecute any SPM or Post Office employee were taken by senior

                      management in the Post Office (for example, John Scott and Dave Pardoe) in

                      full consultation with the Post Office Legal department. From recollection I

                      was never involved in the decision making process and I am unaware of the

                      criteria they used when deciding on whether to prosecute. In Northern Ireland

                      I believe that the decision to prosecute was ultimately taken by the Director of

                      Public Prosecutions. In Scotland, prosecutorial decisions were ultimately

                      taken by the Procurator Fiscal. Northern Ireland and Scottish case files may

                      well have been marked from a compliance standpoint and potentially

                      reviewed by Dave Pardoe first, but I do not know for certain. I have no

                      recollection of these processes changing during my time at the Post Office.


                 45. I have considered paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of [POL00031034]. I have no

                      recollection of any disagreement arising in relation to investigations and

                      prosecutions between Post Office and prosecutorial authorities. During my

                      time with the Post Office I do not recall experiencing any variance from the

                      prosecution policies put in place by the Post Office in any part of the UK.


                 46. I do not have any knowledge of the circumstances in which steps were taken

                      to restrain a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods such as

                      confiscation proceedings. I believe this was dealt with by the Financial

                      Investigation Unit, and I do not recall having any involvement in their work,

                      nor do I know who decided whether criminal enforcement proceedings should

                      be pursued and what factors were considered when deciding this.

             Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team


                 47.As mentioned earlier in this statement, my only experience of training during

                      my time with the Post Office was a one week course towards the end of 2012

                      which covered PACE and other matters relating to investigations. I believe it

                      was Paul Southin and Graham Ward who delivered this training to me

                      internally and it formed the first part of my induction when appointed

                      permanently into my Team Leader role. I was then meant to receive further

                      training on the workings of a Post Office and the relevant Post Office policies

                      and procedures relating to investigations, but this never occurred. I recall that

                      the week's training course covered elements of PACE, taped interviewing,

                      the taking of witness statements, the caution, seizing and recording of

                      exhibits, giving evidence in court and possibly the definition of theft. I

                      remember that obtaining corroborating evidence where required was also

                      part of the training course, but I do not remember this covering obtaining

                      evidence from Fujitsu. I think it was more focussed upon obtaining evidence

                      from other witnesses such as other employees at the branch.


                 48. I am unable to recall if the training included anything on investigating a case

                      'fully', but I imagine that emphasis would have been placed on the

                      responsibility to make sure that all lines of Inquiry were identified, followed

                      and further investigated where necessary.


                 49. I believe that the Post Office did train and advise staff on their disclosure

                      responsibilities, but I cannot recall if I received this training during the week's

                      training course. I believe that training on disclosure may have been provided

                      by circulation of explanatory training material or training conducted by the law

                      firm Cartwright King. If it was delivered by Cartwright King, I do not think I

                      attended. I only ever recall going to their offices once and I think it was for a

                      Christmas networking event. I do vaguely remember discussions being held

                      on disclosure in internal meetings on the need for material to be fully

                      disclosed whether it is positive or negative in a case. I remember that items

                      could be put on sensitive schedules, but I cannot recall what evidence this

                      was specifically. I think it may have related to whistleblowing type evidence.

                      Unfortunately I cannot remember when this was or who conducted these

                      discussions. What I do recall is that I was never responsible for obtaining

                      disclosure in any investigation and I never completed or reviewed any

                      disclosure schedules in my role as a Security Manager or Team Leader.


                  50. I can recall circulars and/or directions being disseminated within the Security

                      Team on file preparation, structure and guides on what needed to be

                      included in a prosecution file, but I cannot recall when this was. I would not

                      have been required to consider any criminal investigation document prior to

                      my appointment as Team Leader. Any that I did receive when I was Team

                      leader I would have disseminated to the Security Managers within my team

                      and would have discussed them, if necessary, at team meetings. I would

                      have also raised issues on my line manager's behalf, had that been

                      necessary for clarification purposes.


                  51. 1 have considered [POL00121467], [POL00121485], [POL00129311],

                      [POL00158977] and [POL00158978]. Prior to receiving the request, I do not

                      recall ever seeing [POL00121467] and [POL00121485] previously. In terms

                      of [POL00129311], I can see I was invited to attend a Cartwright King training

                      session, but I do not recall attending. By the 11 June 2013 I would have had

                      handed in my notice of resignation and I doubt I would have travelled for

                      training that would not have been of any future use or relevance to me.


                  52. With reference to the email at [POL00158977] and the attached document at

                      [POL00158978] I have no recollection of receiving both of these emails. It

                      seems to have been a 'catch all' communication email within the Security

                      Team, at which time I was merely involved in physical security and would

                      have most likely disregarded the content as it would not have been relevant

                      to my role.


                  53. I have considered David Posnett's email to me and others dated 23 May

                      2011 at [POL00118096] and the documents contained within the attached

                      compliance zip file at [POL00118108], [POL00118109], [POL00118101],

                      [P0L00118102], [P0L00118103], [POL00118104], [P0L00118105],

                      [POL00118106] and [POL00118107]. 1 do not recall the email at

                      [POL00118096], nor do I recall the conference call on 26 May 2011 for the

                      North Security Team that the email refers to. I was at this time only dealing

                      with physical security and if this call was not relevant to my role it is likely I

                      would not have attended. As I was only doing physical security and this

                      related to the compliance of investigations, I believe it is likely I would have

                      disregarded the email altogether.


                  54. 1 am aware of the form contained at [POL00118108] existing as I knew that

                      the Security Managers had their casefiles scored from a compliance

                      standpoint. The scoring may have been used in one to one performance

                      reviews but I cannot fully recall. I had seen some of these later in my career

                      with the Post Office as Team Leader, but from my recollection I do not

                      believe I ever marked a Security Manager's file. I remember on one occasion

                      I challenged a mark received by, Steve Bradshaw on the compliance of one

                      of his files. He would have informed me about it as I was his Team Leader. I

                      cannot remember the specific details of that file, but I remember feeling that

                      the mark was unfair.


                  55. 1 confirm I have considered [POL00118109], [POL00118101],

                      [POL00118102], [POL00118103], [POL00118104], [POL00118105]. 1 cannot

                      recall if I ever received these documents. I was aware of the systems

                      revolving around putting together a case file, but not in any detail.


                  56. 1 do not recall ever seeing [POL00118106]. From my recollection I did not

                      ever maintain a notebook in my role as a physical Security Manager or as

                      Team Leader, although, I could have been provided with one. I believe that I

                      may have signed the Security Managers' notebooks for the three interviews I

                      sat in on as a second officer (mentioned in paragraph 14 above).


                  57. I have considered the Casework Management document from 2000 at

                      [POL00104747] and the 2002 Casework Management document at

                      [POL00104777], including the sections relevant to Northern Ireland. I do not

                      recall seeing these documents previously. I have reviewed the second, third

                      and fourth bullet points on page 2 of the 2000 version but as I do not think I

                      ever saw this document, I am unable to say what I would have understood

                      the guidance given within these bullet points to mean at the time.


                  58. I have also reviewed the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the

                      2002 version. I cannot remember seeing this document but later when I

                      became a Team Leader I must have considered the particular guidance

                      which was in force at the time and understood it to mean that discipline

                      matters were to be sent to a contract manager prior to court proceedings

                      being commenced. As dealt with in paragraph 29 above, I did not agree with

                      this process and I raised my concerns in the email dated 03.01.2013 at

                      [POL00122037] to Andrew Wise.


                  59. I am unsure of the circumstances in which investigations became subject to

                      compliance checks, their purpose, the process for those checks being

                      conducted and who conducted them. I believe that it is likely that compliance

                      checks were required to ensure consistency over case files and to identify if

                      any extra training was needed in certain areas.


                 60. I do not know what the status of the suite of compliance documents attached

                      to the email from David Posnett dated 23 May 2011 was at the time they

                      were circulated; I had no involvement in developing or managing any of these

                      documents. It is likely that the purpose of those documents were to achieve

                      standardisation and identify areas of required training.


                 61. 1 have considered paragraph 2.15 of the document entitled "Guide to the

                      Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender

                      reports & Discipline reports" at [POL00118101]. I do not recall seeing this

                      previously and I do not know how this related to the Offender Report template

                      at [POL00118102] as I never had to complete one of these reports. I also do

                      not understand its relevance to the Post Office's disclosure obligations in

                      relation to information about Horizon bugs, errors and defects. I had very little

                      knowledge on the processes followed by the Post Office in relation to

                      disclosure and I did not really know anything about the Horizon system

                      because as stated earlier in this statement, I never conducted criminal

                      investigations as Security Manger, nor did I supervise on the substance of

                      any when I was a Team Leader.


                 62. 1 have considered the "Identification Codes" at [POL00118104] and I do not

                      know who wrote this. I do not remember ever seeing this document because

                      if I had I would have raised concerns about it to management as the

                      identification codes used within it are entirely inappropriate. I do not think I

                      would forget seeing something like this, which makes me think it even more

                      likely that I would have disregarded the email from Dave Posnett on 23 May

                      2011, to which this document was attached. I do not know if anyone else

                      raised concerns to management to say this document needed to be

                      amended.


                 63. 1 have considered [POL00122145] and [POL00122150] and I can see that I

                      sent these emails following an incident at the Whitehaven branch. I believe

                      this was a Crown Office branch and I think I appointed Steve Bradshaw to be

                      the Lead Investigator. I think I asked Dave Posnett to supply me with the

                      relevant policy documents around Crown Branches as I had no idea about

                      crime policy at the time. It is clear that he sent me these documents and after

                      my review I was not happy with the circumstances. From memory I think the

                      suspect offender in this matter was able to be disciplined and they resigned

                      before the matter could be investigated. This just didn't make sense to me

                      and I was not sure if it was a one off. I wanted to know why it had happened

                      and that is why I asked Andrew Wise to include it in his casework review.

            Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship

             with Fujitsu


                 64. 1 confirm that I have considered [FUJ00225012] and I can see that I am

                      copied in to an email in this chain from Andrew Wise on 10 January 2012. I

                      believe I am copied in due to being the Team Leader, to keep me in the loop

                      about the progress of the file from a work load perspective and the difficulties

                      being experienced in obtaining ARQ data in this matter. However, this email

                      appears to be directed specifically to Jayne Bradbury and Andy Hayward. As

                      mentioned earlier in this statement, Andy Hayward would provide supervision

                      and support to Security Managers who fell within my region if it related to the

                      substance of an investigation. I have no direct recollection of this email and I

                      do not have any knowledge of what analysis was done by Security Managers

                      of Horizon data when a SPM I SPM's manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown

                      Office employee(s) attributed a shortfall to problems with Horizon. I was not

                      trained in this and from my recollection I had no direct involvement with

                      Fujitsu, or in obtaining any sort of data from them_ The only thing I can

                      vaguely remember is that there may have been a cost to obtain data from

                      Fujitsu.


                 65. I have no knowledge of whether ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu as a

                      matter of course when an SPM / SPM's manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown

                      Office employee(s) had attributed any shortfall discovered to problems with

                      Horizon_ I also do not know if ARQ data was provided to SPMs if it was

                      obtained from Fujitsu following the identification of a shortfall.

                 66. I have considered [POL00121881] and I have no direct recollection of this

                      email. From reading it I believe that I would have cascaded this email to the

                      North Team of Security Managers at the next team meeting or by email to

                      make sure the instructions were followed, but I cannot recall. I remember

                      sitting with Suzanne Winters at some point and her boxing stuff up but I

                      cannot be sure if it was ARQ data or when this was.


                 67. During all of my time working in the Post Office as both a Security Manager

                      and a Team Leader, I do not recall ever having any contact with Gareth

                      Jenkins, Penny Thomas or any other member of Fujitsu management or staff.


                 68. I did not know who Gareth Jenkins was before receiving the Request, and I

                      had no knowledge of his role in relation to criminal prosecutions. I knew at

                      the time that the Post Office had cases on where the integrity of Horizon was

                      being challenged at court and experts were required to rebut this challenge,

                      but I was unaware of Gareth Jenkins' involvement.


            Relationship with others


                 69. As far as I recall, I never had any dealings with any external solicitors in any

                      investigation matters, whether those investigations were based on Horizon

                      data showing apparent shortfalls or not. The only time I spoke with solicitors

                      was when I assisted with the identification of a law firm in Northern Ireland to

                      assist and represent the Post Office in criminal investigations and

                      prosecutions in that region. I have dealt with this in detail in paragraph 27

                      above.

            Prosecutions in Devolved Nations


                 70. As explained earlier in this statement, I did not get involved with the conduct

                      of investigations as a Security Manager, except on the three occasions where

                      I sat in on an interview as a second officer. I did not conduct the interview

                      and I do not believe I interjected to ask my own questions. After assisting in

                      these interviews I played no further role in the investigation.


                 71. As far as I am aware the process in which investigations were conducted in

                      all Regions were the same, but there were minor variances between PACE

                      being applied in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. For example, I

                      believe there was a slight difference of wording in the cautions to be

                      provided. I believe this was covered in the week's training I received, as

                      covered under the above heading - `Training, instructions and guidance to

                      investigators within the Security team'. I cannot recall what the other minor

                      differences were. The primary difference from my recollection related to who

                      took the prosecutorial decisions, which I have set out in paragraphs 32 and

                      44 above.


                 72. 1 have considered [POL00158388], but I am unable to explain what

                      instructions were complied with in preparing a prosecution file to support

                      criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland as I had no direct involvement in

                      preparing any prosecution files as a Security Manager, nor of reviewing them

                      in my role as a Team Leader. As far as I am aware the Post Office in England

                      & Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all followed the same file preparation

                      process. I managed Security Managers for North England, Scotland and

                      Northern Ireland (albeit not on the content of casefiles) and I don't remember

                                                             Page 29 of 41

                      having instructions from my line manger or anyone else that a different

                      approach should be taken in each nation.


                 73. I worked with Suzanne Winters on two cases in Northern Ireland, supported

                      by other North Team Security Managers as required. These are the cases

                      involving branches in Belfast and Strabane where I only sat in as a second

                      officer in an interview, as mentioned in paragraph 14 above.


                 74. I do not recall encountering any difficulties while providing support to

                      Suzanne Winters on the two cases in Northern Ireland. I did not work on any

                      other cases, but there might have been issues with logistics to get people to

                      attend branches on an audit or to carry out an interview due to the location of

                      the office and the workload of the team of Security Managers who cover the

                      particular region.


            Involvement in criminal prosecution case studies being examined by the

            Inquiry


                 75. I have considered [POL00044025], [POL00046250] and [POL00046635].

                      These are case closure reports forwarded to me by Steve Bradshaw, merely

                      to update me on his work load to assist me in my logistical role as Team

                      Leader. I do not know why I am referred to as a Security Programme

                      Manager in these documents. I always referred to myself as a Team Leader

                      and I assume `Security Programme Manager' is just another variation to the

                      job role name.

                 76. I confirm I have considered the following documents provided in connection

                      with this prosecution:


                        i.    The Audit Report dated 2 February 2012 at [POL00089081];

                        ii.   The email dated 7 February 2012 at [POL00089237];

                       iii.   The Record of Taped Interview re. interview of 19 April 2012 at

                              [POL00089670] (part 1), [POL00089671] (part 2);

                       iv.    The Investigation report dated 1 May 2012 at [POL00089426];

                       v.     The email from Andrew Bolc dated 4 July 2012 at [POL00089294] and

                              the attachments at [POL00089454], [POL00089057] and

                              [POL00089455];

                       vi.    The summons dated 19 July 2012 at [POL00089072];

                      vii.    The report dated 16 August 2012 at [POL00089259] (in which I am

                              mentioned);

                     viii.    The unsigned witness statement of Stephen Bradshaw dated 1 May

                              2012 at [POL00089560];

                       ix.    The unsigned statements of Richard Cross and Andrew Wise dated 17

                              September 2012 and 1 May 2012 respectively at [POL00089561]; and

                       x.     The list of witnesses at [POL00089346] and the list of exhibits at

                              [POL00089351].


                 77. I have no direct memory of the specific facts or background to this case and

                      therefore am reliant on the documents above to aid my memory. What I do

                      recall is that I was appointed to a temporary Team Leader role for the North

                      Security Team in April 2012, and the Grant Allen case was being investigated

                      at this time by Stephen Bradshaw, who was a Security Manager within the

                      North Team. I do not believe that I had any direct or indirect dealings with Mr

                      Allen. I also had no input in relation to the conduct of the investigation

                      whatsoever, with the exception of authorising the interview of Mr Allen merely

                      from a risk perspective for the Security Managers working on the case —

                      Stephen Bradshaw and Michael Stanway. This is why my name appears on

                      the Risk Assessment report at [POL00089259]. I believe that a risk

                      assessment would be carried out before all interviews to ensure the safety of

                      Security Managers, for example, if there was a potential risk of the

                      interviewee being aggressive. I can see that as the interview was to be

                      conducted in the Post Office premises, I identified no risks. At team meetings

                      chaired by me I would have asked for an update on all investigations for the

                      Security Managers within my Team and I assume the progress of Mr Allen's

                      investigation would have been updated to me accordingly by Steve

                      Bradshaw. I would have been asking for updates of this sort in order to give

                      me an indication on the Security Managers' workloads within the Team, to

                      assist me with dealing with logistical and administrative matters such as who

                      had best availability within the team to be the second officer in an interview in

                      another case that had arisen etc.


                 78. My first involvement in the case was my authorisation on the interview risk

                      assessment on the 16th April 2012. I do not believe that I had any previous

                      involvement in the investigation.


                 79. I have considered the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Grant Ian Allen &

                      Others v Post Office Limited [2022] EWCA Crim 1197 at [RLIT0000039]. I do

                      not feel in a position to comment upon how the investigation and prosecution

                      of Grant Allen was conducted. The reason for this is because I do not have

                      any real experience of conducting investigations myself within the Post Office

                      and I do not have enough knowledge of the particular Post Office processes

                      and procedures implemented in relation to conducting investigations and

                      prosecutions. For those who were convicted and subsequently acquitted, I

                      have every sympathy.


             General


                  80. I was aware from team meetings that the integrity of the Horizon system was

                      being challenged in some cases and that the Post Office was working with an

                      expert or experts to respond to those allegations. I did not know any further

                      detail beyond this. As I was not involved in conducting any Post Office

                      investigations or seeing a case through a prosecution I do not think that I

                      would have thought about a challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case

                      being relevant to other ongoing or future cases at that time. I can remember

                      that the general Post Office position was that Horizon was an accurate

                      computer system. Looking at this with hindsight, in my opinion there should

                      have been no further prosecutions if there was any doubt that there could

                      have been an issue with Horizon until this was verified for certain.


                  81. Other than the matters already contained within this statement, there are no

                      other matters relevant to Phase 4 of the Inquiry that I would like to draw to

                      the attention of the Chair.
