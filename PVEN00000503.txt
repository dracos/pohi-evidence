Hello Paula, sorry to bother you at a weekend, but I wanted to draw PO attention to a problem in
Cumbria where a PO has not received any cash for too long, and the sub master/mistress is using
their own money apparently to meet customer needs. I would appreciate it if you could forward this
text on to whoever is responsible and I can deal with the matter with them.

Hope you are well and had a good summer, Margot

Hi Margot, this sounds serious and I'd prefer to be in the loop. We have systems that should pick it

up, so after we've resolved the immediate problem, we'll need to look at what's gone wrong.
Can you take a call - probably easier if we speak?
Paula

MJ to PV
Yes absolutely, can do around midday or late PM Margot

PV to MJ
Great, thanks Margot.
I can make anytime after 1pm through to 10pm - except 5.30-7.30. Let me know? P

Sorry to bother you, I should also have said: if you could text the name and location of the PO, I can
look into tomorrow's delivery schedule. Paula

(See previous text if you can make a call - otherwise tomorrow anytime.)

MJ to PV

Thanks very much Paula, the PO concerned is Moresby in Cumbria. Apparently they have had no
money delivered for a long time and are due to close this week. I will call later this pm hopefully from
a landline

Ps will call before 5.30

Hi Margot.

We briefed Trudy Harrison in June as to exactly what was happening. The Post office never ran out of
cash.

However, the postmaster was suspended in May, as an audit showed she was missing over £130k.
That possibly explains why she was putting in her own money. She has since lodged a request to join
the PMs' group litigation - not unusual in this kind of situation.

I don't want to put more details into a text but am happy to explain.

The location has been supported by a temporary post office so customers are ok.

The postmaster is vociferous and has been sharing various and varying accounts of what has
happened.

Trudy may want to hear the full story.

I have an experienced colleague Pam Heap who would be happy to talk to you or Trudy if it helps.

Hope helpful?
Paula

Hi Margot, I hope you had a great break?

To update you re Trudy Harrison, I've received the text copied below from Pam Heap my senior
manager on the case. Any questions let me know.

I hope the conference goes well.

Best wishes,
Paula

Follows:
“Paula. I have just spoken to Trudy Harrison, I have updated her on the legal position. She is going to
contact Patrick Bourke (political affairs) if she needs any further information.

She understands it is in the hands of solicitors.

Have a good weekend and let me know if you need any further info.
Pam"

MJ to PV

Thanks very much for setting all this up Paula, I will let you know if there are any further
developments. Yes I had a lovely break thanks

Margot

Lastly, after I congratulated Margot on her promotion to DCMS:

Thanks so much Paula, I am very sorry to be losing Postal Services too, I loved working with you
personally and the Royal Mail team also, but yes it is a great opportunity at DCMS.

Thanks very much for your support throughout my time at BEIS, Margot
