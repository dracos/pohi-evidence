I found our meeting on 17 September to discuss the Post Office and the Horizon IT system very
useful and enlightening. I am grateful to you for taking the time to set out your experience of the
matter.

I have reflected on your request to meet with Second Sight. As you felt so strongly about this, I
will be writing to Mr Warmington to offer a meeting, but it will be on the basis that it is a private
meeting.

You also indicated that you might mention Horizon in your Maiden Speech. If you let me or my
office know when you plan to speak I will try to be present, if my diary allows it.

I am aware of how instrumental you have been in championing the cases of subpostmasters
who have raised concerns about Post Office. I hope that we can continue to work constructively
to ensure that the right outcome is reached for all parties involved.

\f anything further arises which you think I should be aware then I would invite you to contact me
or my office.

Congratulations again on your elevation to the Lords. I look forward to working with you on
matters of mutual interest.

BARONESS NEVILLE-ROLFE DBE CMG
