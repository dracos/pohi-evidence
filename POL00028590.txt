BUSINESS SERVICE MANAGEMENT

1. Introduction
This report is produced by the POCL Service Management team and provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any
threats to overall business continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues
(actual or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway services. It should be noted
that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report.utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

No Threat to Business Continuity

O

The next full Horizon Service Report is scheduled for W/C 26 October 1998.

4. End to End Business Continuity

The status of business continuity remains at ‘Amber’, dué to the continuing presence of ITs. However categories of ITs have seen a
significant reduction this period.

BUSINESS SERVICE MANAGEMENT

Software fixes were released to the counter on Friday 9th October and will be effective and robust in preventing ITs in
the categories they were designed to address. It is foreseen that no ITs will appear in these areas.

However 16 were generated in the category of incomplete receipts (BES). These incidents involve premature removal of
the receipt, by the user, during the printing process. BSM are, however, investigating incidents to determine if printer
failures were the cause. Incomplete transactions have now largely moved away from user non conformance and system
software errors towards examination and resolution of the user friendliness of system prompts. These may be
misleading the user into incorrect procedures causing non committals to occur. This issue is being examined closely by
BSM.

Baseline for Incomplete Transactions

To provide a baseline against which incomplete transactions can be assessed figures have been produced to show the
volume of incomplete transactions per 10,000 encashments. The baseline is adjusted to reflect actual monthly ITs.
Secondly a target figure is shown of incomplete transactions that POCL should be aiming to receive prior to the advent
of Live Trial.

Current month level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 3.0
Target level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 0

Incomplete Transactions

Amber level remains unchanged with the continuing presence and extent of ITs the primary cause.
Accounting & Reconciliation

Appendix ‘A’ details an agreed summary of accounting & reconciliation for the September period.

BES: Volumetrics
Definitions for the purpose of this report.

A transaction is an incident of “a recorded and auditable instance of business activity, involving Service provision or Stock
movement across organisational or Service boundaries”.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (in the case of a four- weekly
allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the payment card to
returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save
several payments before visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

NB 2
Volumes of calls to the PCHL show 3.6% of the total of monthly encashments, up 0.6%. The increase of customer
calls are quoted as being, in part, due to inquiries about entitlement for school leavers. The second contributing
factor were the incidents of customers being advised to call the Child Benefit Centre (CBC) and subsequently
calling again due to an unsuccessful attempt to reach the CBC.

Incomplete transactions - Incomplete Receipts
Incomplete transactions - New Card Activation
Incomplete transactions - BES/OBCS Corruption
Incomplete transactions - User Logout

Current Problems awaiting Resolution (Open)
° Identify Process for outlet changes

. Incomplete transactions - User Set-Up.
° Printer robustness and possible linkage to ITs.
° Determine whether system design (prompts/icons) are misleading users towards non committal of transactions.

11. Concerns
Categories of ITs have shown a significant decrease. While the categories of Incomplete Transactions have reduced for
the September period their existence is still cause for concern. Business Service Management objectives remain at
reducing ITs to zero. Activity here remains heavily focused through the Incomplete Transaction working group.

Reconciliation performance remains consistently high.

e Improvements

This period - ratio of incidents to transactions 1:2252. Last period showed 1:2161.

e Concerns

Incomplete Transactions form over 68% of all incidents received this month and are still a cause for concern. The focus,
however has shifted from the categories of user non conformance and system errors to that of system user friendliness so

that system prompts should not give rise to user error.
