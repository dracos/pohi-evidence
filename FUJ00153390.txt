(Start of Response]

This is another occurrence of last week's problem (PC0126042), where messages
were not replicated due to Riposte errors. Last week the PM did some duplicate
ransfer In transactions which caused reconciliation errors - fortunately this
eek he has not done so. The PM wants to know why these problems have occurred
twice within 2 weeks. I will pass the call to development for comment.

lare not responsible for

pdating Julie Dart on this call.

It Julie requires further information for reconciliation

urposes, she should raise her own query through the

reconciliation process, the desk will NOT be providing her with any

pdates on this call.

lTulie Welsh has passed this information on to Jez Murray

ate:10-Nov-2005 11:58:30 User:Jez Murray
/ This problem is the route cause of the reconciliation error closed in

Pco126042
I2/ Presumably the route cause is deemed to be software not hardware

3/ The Postmaster has a workaround in place which is not to duplicate
transactions (e.g. Transfer In) just because the original attempts were
Isuccessful but not showing on all nodes

I4/ POA CS MSU have a workaround in place which is that if 3/ above is not
followed & PC0126042 reoccurs, a BIMS will be issued advising POL to issue a
[Transaction Correction

Is/ There is no SLT for software fixes as they are delivered based upon the
riority or severity of the issue and could remain open until both businesses
decide a fix is necessary or the work around is adequate

Inez Murray has advised Julie Dart of this by email as could not voice at the
