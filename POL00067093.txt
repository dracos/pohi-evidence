Dear Debbie
SENT ON BEHALF OF TOM CLEARY

I refer to the above matter and the recent fax which you should now be in receipt of in respect of the
draft admissions.

In respect of no. 3) we wish to point out that our admission is on the basis for transactions to the value
of less than £5k and not all transactions. Unfortunately, this was omitted from the draft admission
that were sent by fax.

Apologies for any confusion caused.

Regards

LISA BADDEVITHANA
