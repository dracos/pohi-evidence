Gareth

Hope you are well. | have an update for you on the Wylie case. The trial date has been adjourned to the 7 October 2013, so the
4th - 8th March can come out of your diary. Please could you book the week of the 7th October 2013 in your diary instead.

URGENT - Please see attached.

The defence solicitors in the case of Ishaq have served an addendum defence case statement on us this morning, which attempts
to particularise the problems with the Horizon system.

Please could you have a look at the comments that they have made and try to address as many of the points as you can, in
order that we can email that to our counsel Mark Ford ahead of Monday's trial.

My apologies for such a last minute request, | think there is no coincidence that the service of this addendum DCS is last minute.
Thank you for your continued assistance with these cases.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries.
Kind regards

Rachael

Rachael,

I’m now booked into Bradford (Holiday Inn) from Sunday to Wednesday with an option to leave early and an open
return train ticket.

What time should | get to court (presumably the Crown Court at Drake Street BD1 1JA) and who do | need to contact?
Presumably | look for the court holding the case for Khayyam Ishaq? | should be contactable on my mobile (number
below) if that makes contact simpler.

Also, what is the situation regarding the case of Kim Wylie scheduled for 4" to 8 March in Newcastle? Am | required
for this and if so what do | need to do when? If you don’t know yet, when are you likely to be able to give me an
update?

Hi Gareth

| have an update for you on the Ishaq trial. Our counsel Mark Ford would like you to attend court on the Monday
morning before the start of the trial to allow you to discuss the case with the defence ‘expert’. | think the rationale
behind this is to narrow any issues that we may have with the defence from the outset so as to try and reduce the
amount of time that you are required to attend.

Our counsel is still waiting to hear from defence counsel and will update us if any issues arise. However your
presence on the first day will still be required so you can make your travel arrangements. | don't know if you will be
required for the full three days, that will become clearer on the first day of trial.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries.
Kind regards

Jishaan Patel - It is highly unlikely that you will be required to attend in this case. We have served your statement, the
defence have acknowledged receipt, but have not stated that they wish to call you as a witness. They have 7 days
upon receipt of your statement in which to inform us if they would like you to attend. As they have not done so, and
the 7 days has more than expired, we have done all that we can in the circumstances. To that end, we will need you
for the Ishaq case, and would like you to attend the Ishaq trial on 25th February 2013 at Bradford Crown Court.

Ishaq Trial - | have made enquiries this morning to see if you will be required for the full 3 days and to be there early
on the Monday. | believe that our counsel is in the process of liaising with defence counsel over the issue of the
Horizon system as Ishaq's defence is that it was necessary for him to make adjustments due to the faults with the
Horizon system. Once both barristers have liased with each other over the salient issues in this case, our counsel will
have a better idea of how long you will be needed, and which date that might be. | appreciate that you will want to
make your arrangements as soon as possible. What | propose to do is wait until Monday 18th Feb, | will call our
counsel to establish what the position is, and ask him to advise me on when you will be required to attend. | will send
you an email on Monday, so that it will give you the rest of that week to organise a hotel etc.

Thomas Brown - The defence do not have to serve a defence case statement setting out the nature of their defence
until the 31st March 2013. | am in the process of obtaining more evidence from the investigators to bolster our case.
Please could you provide a generic report as you did in the Nemesh Patel case, as we know that they have a general
criticism of the Horizon system, but will not know any particulars for some time.

Jamie Dixon - | would still like a statement from you in this case, that considers any issues that Dixon has set out in his
DCS. In terms of the fact that you knew Dixon, | would add a single line in your statement that sets out how you knew
him, ie that you are aware that Dixon worked for Fujitsu for a period of time,..... A line which covers how/ the extent of
how you knew him will be fine. If it is the case that Dixon would have a better working knowledge of the Fujitsu
system compared to other Subpostmasters, you could say that, ie | expect that as Jamie Dixon worked for Fujitsu for x
amount of years, his knowledge of the system would be....

Just write a line or two that covers your knowledge of the fact that Dixon worked for Fujitsu and what effect that may
have if any. You could include that line in the concluding stages of your report, wherever you feel it is most
appropriate.

It will not make much of a difference to the content of your report, as the main purpose of your statement is provide
expertise on the workings of the system. | would not like to omit the fact that you are aware of Dixon's experience at
Fujitsu as there is no reason for us not to reveal that fact.

| hope this assists, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries. | will be in touch next week with an
update on the Ishaq trial arrangements.

Many thanks

Rachael,
Thanks for the update and the new case to add to the list!

Feb 25" is getting quite close. When is this likely to firm up and when should | be looking at putting together travel
plans and booking hotels? Am | required for the full 3 days and if so what time do | need to get there on Monday
(earliest train from home gets there around 11am, but | might drive or travel on Sunday). Similar questions apply for
the following week.

| also have Jishaan Patel down for 26/2/13. This clashes with Ishaq (in terms of dates). Is this still continuing or can |
cross it off the list?

For your info, |am on leave for 11" to 13" March (which doesn’t clash with any existing dates).

| had a quick look at the Thomas Brown files. | think | can guess what is being referred to but | don’t feel able to make
anything other than a generic statement (as for the Nemesh Patel case) without any further info or investigating the
logs from the time. Do you want such a statement at this time or do you want me to wait for more info? Similarly, do
you want me to produce a statement for the Jamie Dixon case? Does the fact that | knew him from when he worked
for Post Office Ltd make any difference?

Hi Gareth

Hope you are well. There haven't been any new developments recently on the existing cases that you have prepared
a report on.

In terms of the dates referred to in your email, the following cases are still listed for trial:

POL v. Wylie - trial at Newcastle CC, currently listed for 4-8th March 2013.

POL v. Ishaq - trial at Bradford Crown Court, 25th February 2013 and is due to last for 3 days.

There is another POL case that requires a copy of your generic report, the case of POL v. Thomas Brown. | have
attached a copy of the case summary and draft charges.

At present the defence have not been ordered to serve a defence case statement until the 31st March, so | haven't
been able to attach a copy for your consideration.

Please see the email correspondence below between myself and counsel.

Please could you prepare a report that deals with the generic criticism of the Horizon system and any detail that may
deal with the relationship between the Camelot and Horizon system.

| have a copy of your report from the Nemesh Patel case which covered these issues.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries.
Kind regards

Rachael

Hi Rachel,

the judge has allowed the defence until the 31st March to serve a defence statement and any defence report which
they intend to rely upon. The reasoning behind this timetabling is to allow us to serve any unused material dealing
with the Horizon system first as part of preliminary disclosure. The defence however will be a general allegation of
unreliability on the part of the Horizon system.

Could the report cover the system for transfering money from the main account to the lottery account and how such
transfers could be affected - i.e. would it be possible for the transfer that occured during the audit to have happened
without the D's involvement, which would appear to be the defence.

| have skype, if you want to join in the conference next Friday.
Best wishes,

Chris.

Thank you for your email containing your comments on the Ishaq DCS. | appreciate that there are only specific
elements of the DCS that you can comment on.

My colleague Martin Smith is attending a mention tomorrow for this case during which the issue of disclosure will be
discussed with all parties present. | think the best thing to do is to await the outcome of that hearing, as | imagine the
true elements of the defence will come to the fore.

Attached is my initial response to the Defence Case Statement you sent me.

| don’t think there is anything in it that could be added to the statement (but you may disagree). | also note that this
is dated August 2012 and so was produced some time before my Statement. Is there any later statement | need to
look at?

As | said yesterday, |’ll be out of the Office all of next week, but may pick up emails in the evenings, so won’t be able
to do much more until the 11" Feb.

Hi Gareth
Hope you are well. Just to let you know where we are with a couple of cases.
Grant Allen - this case has concluded now so you will not need to attend.

Ishaq - Having served your report, the defence have queried it and are claiming that Ishaq had to
make false entries in order for the figures to reconcile, as the Horizon system kept malfunctioning.

The trial is listed for the 25th February 2013 for 3-4 days. Please could you make a note in your
diary, as you will be needed to attend to clarify our position with Horizon.

Our barrister has asked if you could read the Defence case statement attached and make a list of
your initial thoughts on the assertions that he is making. We may need you to add a few of those
comments into your report so that each issue is addressed.

Ihave attached a copy of the case summary for your assistance.

Sefton & Nield - This trial is listed for week commencing 22 April 2013, but it may start on the 18
April 2013, please could you pencil in your diary to attend court for the two weeks beginning
15/4/13.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.
