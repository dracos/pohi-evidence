Thanks Mark.

We've slightly tweaked the "Remote Access" wording in our Letter to Freeths in relation to the Super Users point. New
wording below. Are you happy with this?

A

1. The majority of transactions that make up the branch accounts are generated in branch. There are
however four ways in which Post Office (or Fujitsu on Post Office's instruction) can influence those accounts:

[..]

1.3.4 Administer access to databases. Database and server access and edit permission is provided, within strict
controls (including logging user access), to a small, controlled number of specialist Fujitsu (not Post Office)
administrators. As far as we are currently aware, privileged administrator access has not been used to alter
branch transaction data. We are seeking further assurance from Fujitsu on this point.

Hello all,

Please find attached the revised version of the report which I have now been authorised to release. Apologies for
the small delay, but one of your requests prompted some fairly in-depth conversations required on our side.

Hopefully the new code name is acceptable (!).
Many thanks,

Mark, Lewis

Further to below, would you be able to supply an updated version of your Interim Report having made the small
amendments in the email below. We are holding off circulating the report insider POL until these points are tidied up
‘so it would be good to get these sorted sooner rather than later.

Thanks

As promised, please find attached our questions on the Interim Report. We've not yet addressed Scope Area 8 as this
is not pressing at the moment — we'll come back to you separately on this.

Please could you review and confirm which questions are inside and outside your current scope of work. We can then

discuss

whether / how to progress any of out of scope work.

We'd also be grateful if you could make the changes below and re-circulate the Interim Report. These are hopefully

non-cont

troversial stylistic points.

Generally — can we re-number the Scope Areas as 1, 2, 3 and 4 so that we break any connection to the QC
report?

Page 5 & the Report Generally — can we remove the term ‘Sparrow’ and reference to it as a ‘code name’.
Page 6 — table refers to QC — Please remove
Page 7 — i) — could we use an alternative work to “embellish” - perhaps “advance” or “enhance”?

Page 7 — under “Phase 1” — could we ask that Deloitte qualify that paragraph as the procedures to be
performed in relation to Scope area 8 are TBC.

Page 8 — bottom of the page — could “risks” be changed to “Potential Risks” (in the title & subsequent
paragraph). We're trying to avoid soundbites from being created, should the report ever make its way outside
of POL.
Page 9 — above table refers to QC. Please remove
Page 9 — change “key to risks” to “key to potential risks”
Page 9 - Could we change the wording for each potential risk to the following:
= R1. If Horizon does not process transactions correctly and these are not identified and resolved, these
could lead to sub postmaster financial loss
= R2. If inappropriate transactions can be created centrally.....
= R3. If data flow to the audit store is not complete, accurate or valid, the conclusions....
= R4. If once data is in the audit store...
= R65. If suspense accounts are mismanaged...
Page 9 — penultimate paragraph — could we please qualify “risks” with “Potential”
Page 15 — First column title of the table references “QC” — please remove
Page 21 — First column title of the table references “QC” — please remove

Page 27 — First column title of the table references “QC” — please remove

Page 35 — First column title of the table references “QC” — please remove

Kind regards
