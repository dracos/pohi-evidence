Chris

Yes I did receive the statements thank you.

With regard to the hearing, I will prepare a section18 staement which only needs to be served at the sentence hearing,
prior to the sentence being passed. This is unlikely to be at the first hearing as even if an agreement is reached, they will
postpone sentence for reports etc. But I will send to you before the 30th and you can print it off and take to court with you.

Paul,

Did you get the bank statement I posted to you?

Miss Hall's has been charged with Theft and has pleaded not guilty in Magistrates Court. Her case has been committed to
Crown Court for it's 18 hearing on Thursday 30" June.

As Miss HALL admitted false accounting in the interview and the evidence is sufficient to back it up I understand that if
this is offered by the defence the theft charge will be dropped in favour of one for False Accounting.

Should she plead at this next hearing is there something from yourself that I need or do we just go for an adjournment? I
don’t want to get caught like last time when the Barrister accepted the guilty plea there and then and the case was only
adjourned for sentencing losing the opportunity for POCA.

Your advice would be welcomed please.

Regards,
