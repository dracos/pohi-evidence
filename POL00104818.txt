GROUP SECURITY INVESTIGATION CIRCULAR 5-2008
Date: 20 November 2008
Issued to: All Royal Mail Group Security Investigators

SUBJECT: WRITTEN RECORDS OF TAPE RECORDED INTERVIEWS

In line with reducing bureaucracy the Procedures and Standards (P&S)
on the subject of Summarising Tape Recorded Interviews has been
reviewed and rewritten. The new P&S are titled “Written Records of
Tape Recorded Interviews” and they introduce the process of Short
Descriptive Notes (SDN). SDN will much reduce the time required to
produce a Written Record of Taped Interview in appropriate cases.
Examples of SDN have been produced and can be found in an appendix
associated with the P&S. The P&S can be found on the Group Security
Database under Criminal Investigations, Investigations Procedures &
Standards, Casework Reporting & Records of Interview, 8.3 Written
Records of Tape Recorded Interviews.

In addition a new form, GS015 Written Record of Taped Interview has
been produced which is again on the Group Security Database. This
form should be brought in to immediate use.

A Worktime Time Learning (WTL) presentation has been prepared in
respect of the P&S and this will be forwarded to appropriate Line
Managers.
