ICL Pathway Memorandum

DATE: 7th January Ref: jhb/Jan.97/102
TO: Pathway Staff
FROM: John Bennett

SUBJECT: 1997 Programme Plans

At the PDA Board meeting in December, it was proposed that a joint review should be
undertaken between ICL Pathway and the PDA to assess all the remaining risks which
must be handled prior to a successful implementation starting with the Live Trial and
leading in to National Roll-out.

We have agreed to this, and work has started between our programme offices and will
continue over the next few weeks. The review will also take into account progress
within DSS on CAPS and within POCL on Reference Data, TIP and HAPS.

It is very likely that you will hear views expressed that the programme will be delayed
be anything between one to as much as six months. At this stage, I must ask you to
treat any such views as speculative. If additional time is considered appropriate, it
will be handled through our formal change control process.

In the meantime, we must forge ahead on our current baseline in terms of functionality
and schedule. Terry Austin and Barrie Vaughan must be kept informed of any
difficulties this presents with external dependencies, including suppliers to ICL
Pathway.
