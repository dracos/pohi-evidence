It is noted that the telephone call logs recently served by the prosecution deal
only with specific identifiable transaction problems (for example a DVLA tax
disc issued incorrectly) and not with problems experienced with the Horizon
Online system generally whereby erroneous and/or inexplicable results
appeared to be produced by the system ;

When a balance and/or trading report produced by the system showed there
was a shortage of cash the system would give the defendant an option to

“make good the discrepancies’ ;

vi. On occasions the defendant did not accept that he had made an error and
requested that the issue be dealt with centrally by the Post Office. On such
occasions he received a letter from Chesterfield (‘Central’) ;

vii. Approximately twice the defendant called Chesterfield (‘Central”) on the

telephone number I to discuss the

discrepancies and shortfalls and in order to explain the problems he was
encountering with the system. No reference numbers were provided by the
Chesterfield staff to the defendant but he was assured the matter would be

investigated ;

vii. Specifically in relation to the indictment period the defendant estimates the
dates to be Mid September 2010 and Mid December 2010 when such calls
were made.

ix. Prior to the indictment period, the problems and issues were discussed by the
defendant with Post Office staff in Chesterfield during the middle of each
calendar month from about November 2009 to August 2010.

This addendum defence statement has been read and approved by me.
