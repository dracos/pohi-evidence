Subject: Panorama and the Post Office

Dear all

You will remember that I was in touch a couple of months ago about a programme being planned by the BBC’s
Panorama programme (not to be confused with the Signed, Sealed and Delivered documentary which I am sure you
will all be tuning in for at 9pm on BBC2 this evening!) on the Horizon system.

I wanted to drop you a quick line to let you know that — regrettably — Panorama has returned to the subject and plans
a programme on August 17. This will clearly contain damaging yet unsubstantiated allegations about the Post Office.

The communications team continues to engage robustly with Panorama and we will do everything we can to protect
our business and its reputation. I have had several long conversations with the programme and we will do more
ahead of any broadcast. I wanted to let you know about the programme, though, as it is likely to appear in BBC
schedules over the next few days.

I will be in touch again later this week or next with more details and the ‘script’ which was circulated last time round.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me at any time with any questions.
Best wishes,

Mark
