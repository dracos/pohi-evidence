Agenda Title

Minutes from Previous Meeting

Discussion held around the contractual need for Fujitsu to
undertake the audit work. Agreed that this is within the contract
for Fujitsu to support audit work but the definition of what is
‘reasonable’ required and actioned in the RAID log (ACGBOO01).

In terms of efficiency we discussed the possibility of getting one
auditor to cover off the needs of many audits through a
framework agreement. This may work initially for the ISQ.,
potentially PCI audits plus RMG and need to discuss the
possibility of the E&Y audit inclusion. Actianed in the RAID log
(ACGBO10)

In terms of POL testing Fujitsu's cornpliance with the
recommendations from the audit and to embed that in BAU the
best method would be to include these ‘reporting’ needs to the
existing PCI reporting spreadsheet that is part of the Service
Review Book. POL to add the reporting needs from the
recommendations to this spreadsheet. Actioned in the RAID log
(ACGBO11)

The CISP (POL information security policy) and the Audit
Framework needs to be aligned and also the Fujitsu Security
Policy. This is actioned in the RAID (ACGBO12)

Additionally, is to incorporate where possible the IT General Controls

required by E&Y into an audit framework solution along side the existing
ramework for ISO 27001, 20000 & 9000. PCI and LINK. This will bring
much more efficiency to the audit process for all parties. This is a longer
‘erm initiative as part of a strategic plan.

POL and Fujitsu will determine the end to end process for change and
identify the risk areas and controls we have in those areas. This will be
lutilised initially by the Ernst & Young auditors but also maintained thereafter
for control purposes. This again is a longer term initiative for the strategic
Kdirection.

Finally, and not part of the E&Y findings, there is a corporate dashboard
being developed between POL and Fujitsu that is currently with POL for
iews.
