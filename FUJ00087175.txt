Second Sight Part 2 response from Fujitsu 150914.docx

Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Legal Privilege

Mark

Updates below:

Fujitsu to:

share its previously supplied comments on the Second Sight Reports (Monday / Tuesday); Attached

detail the number of branches affected by the ‘Falkirk bug’ vs its ‘capability’ to affect, with reasons (Monday / Tuesday);
Due to the date of this issue we do not have exact details of the number of branches affected. The following answer is
being currently ratified by the support team but we believe at this moment in time to be correct .“This particular bug
however could have affected all branches who have multiple stock units. The Misra case where this issue was mentioned
was dismissed as the branch had a single stock unit.’

provide the number of system errors identified, by year, that could affect branch accounts together with the number of
branches that were affected and were capable of being affected by these errors, together with reasons (Wednesday); Fujitsu
is endeavouring to provide detail as to the number of Hotfixes (fixes to the software where it has been agreed with Post
Office that an urgent change is required due to some aspect of the operation of the software) that have been issued with
some examples of the type of fixes issued. I am still awaiting agreement on when this information will be available. If a
more detailed report of what each fix was and whether it affected branch accounts I would be able to commission this in
January and at that point deliver costs and timescales for such an activity.

investigate its email / data retention policy and how this would, if asked for the information, affect its ability to provide the
emails for those Fujitsu employees who worked at Bracknell in 2008/09 (Monday / Tuesday); Save for particular matters
(which this particular matter was not one), Fujitsu leaves much of this to the individual particularly in archiving to local
storage. If Post Office has a request for email information it would therefore need to be dealt with on a case by case basis
checked against other legal and data protection criteria.

answer the questions posed in Jonathan’s letter of 16/12/2015 (the letter was forwarded on 17/12/2015. I will call Fujitsu
on Monday morning to obtain an ETA); Mike Harvey has supplied an answer for this question and

Comment on Page 6 of Deloitte’s Board Briefing Paper. I understand Fujitsu were approached and provided comment at
the time this paper was issued. We have requested this is shared with us (Monday / Tuesday). Answer to follow ina
separate email.

Will call tomorrow to discuss further
