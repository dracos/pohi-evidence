Duncan spoke with the new CEO, David Smith, this morning. A constructive session I believe, of course focussed on
the issues of the last two weeks but ended with the CEO saying "once we have these issues sorted we should meet
and discuss futures”.

David will be speaking with Richard in the next week or so, date/time still to be confirmed.

Mike Young, POL Ops Director, returns from leave on Monday. David told Duncan that Mike will present his view on
the issues to the board next week. Duncan and I meet with Mike at 2pm on Monday.

We have had a couple of days stability now, we had a short outage today but the cause was known (a process we run
called Streams) and very quickly remedied when we switched it off. POL had understood the risk and agreed to us
running Streams. We are working now with a number of work arounds and root cause analysis is underway.

I hope this helps.

Kind regards,

Gavin
