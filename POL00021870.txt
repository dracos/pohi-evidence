I have tracked in a few more changes. I am happy for this to go to Fujitsu as a matter of urgency. I have, in the interests
of expediency, changed very little so I think that although there will be a need for a bit of tweaking to correct typos etc,
this should be sufficient for Fujitsu to comment.

We are still awaiting a few small tweaks from Andy Parsons, as I understand it but they will be minor.

Rod, can you send to them for an urgent look please? The aim is to get this out today.

Thanks

Best wishes
Belinda
