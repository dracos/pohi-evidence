MIGRATION 1C TO 2 - Bruce McNiven

In-Office Migration Strategy
* sign off was due on 16 March

- development hampered due to continuing changes of management personnel within Pathway

sourced on information provided by Horizon Staff

Migration Strategy for 1c to 2

* although the strategy has been signed off, significant additional detail needs to be developed
* subsequent documentation is still thin

- expecting a wide range of comments from reviewers with inevitable impact on production
timescales

- Pathway have not taken up POCL’s offer of informed resource to support their document
production
