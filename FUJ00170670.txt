In answer to the request for access to KELs for the period between June 2005 and January 2008 we may
have a number available in the system. To this end the support team have produced the Q&A section below
to give a more full explanation of the KEL system and how it is used within the Fujitsu support teams. The
headlines are:

@ The Horizon (pre-HNGX KELs) that were still active when the system was retired are accessible from
a ‘archived’ database but not through the user interface so the interpretation and presentation of
this data may have lost some of its context

e Some KELs for that period may not have been archived we have no way of knowing if the data set is
complete

e There is no easy way of analysing the data either by branch or type article, particularly in the
‘archived’ data

We therefore may not be able to find any relationship between any data still held and a particular branch or
time or even potentially if the information was not included in the text as to when certain articles were
active. We are however happy to give supervised access to what we have under NDA as per the group
action.

I hope this helps
Regards

Pete

What are we currently using for KEL system?

We use a custom developed solution that allows us to record support knowledge into a structure known as a KEL
(Known Error Log). KELs record known issues from incident tickets originating from live and test services and general
support knowledge. The KEL system is developed in-house by the Fujitsu SSC team and is utilised by all 2nd, 3rd and
Ath line support teams. Knowledge entries are created via a web interface using both fixed fields and free format
fields utilising a mark-up language.

When was it last updated or migrated?
The service is under continuous development for service improvement. The infrastructure supporting the service
changed from physical servers housed and maintained by the SSC to a cloud based infrastructure in late 2014.

What happens to old KEL’s?

Old KELs are deactivated once they are no longer required. This ensures that they do not show up in normal searches
but are accessible if specifically requested via an additional interface. A regular KEL review forum ensures KELs follow
a certain template, include the correct terminology and are not out of date.

What is the backup and storage policy?

The system is supported by two servers in the IPH (internal Fujitsu private hosted) cloud. The primary server
continuously updates a copy of the database on the secondary server (AKA log-shipping) and a nightly full database
back-up is taken to the stand-by server. Both servers also have their disk media backed up and retained by the Fujitsu
Internal IT group (ITG) with incremental backups taken each day and a full back-up each week.

How long do we retain any copies?
Database backups are retained for 7 days.
Server backups (ITG) are retained for 2 weeks.

Is it possible to view KELs from between June 2005 and January 2008
Yes. In 2010 a migration exercise took place to deactivate all pre-HNG-X KELs that were no longer relevant to the new
system. You can still search these deactivated HORIZON KELs from the historic menu.

Is it possible to search for KELs by the date raised or by year?
Not via the user interface.

Is it possible to look at calls raised against a particular branch, from 1, 3, 6 or 10 years ago?
Affected branch is not a field captured in the KEL database.

Subject RE:

Dear Pete/ Chris

isting Paul in relation to the CCRC's review of certain Post Office prosecutions whilst Paul is away on
leave.

Following the questions that the CCRC asked about the KEL, the CCRC are now asking some more questions about
this, with particular reference to Seema Misra of the West Byfleet branch. They want to know: "is it possible to search
for KELs dating from the time of Ms Misra’s indictment period? If so, we would be grateful if we could be provided with
/ given access to all KELs raised or updated in the period June 2005-January 2008."

From our discussions in relation to the KEL for the Group Action, I understand that it is not something that can be
handed over, and the only real way of facilitating access would be for them to come and have a look at it at your
premises. We are happy to make the offer for inspection to take place, but please could you let us know whether this
is also acceptable to you and on what terms? If you require an NDA we will give some thought to how this will work
given the CCRC's purpose / discuss it with the CCRC. Please let me know.

I also understand that the KEL is not recorded on a branch by branch basis, but that you keep a log of issues which
you have assisted with in branches and this links to the KEL entry which was referred to. I was therefore wondering
whether it was possible for this log to be reviewed in relation to West Byfleet between June 2005 and January 2008, so
that you could work out whether you do have any KEL entries in relation to Misra / West Byfleet, and whether these
have been retained (given I understand that it is a living database and changes)?

Many thanks in advance for your assistance.
Kind regards

Victoria

Subject: Questions on the KEL [BD-4A.FID26610170]

Dear Pete,
I hope you are well.
You may recall you have kindly helped me out in the past with some queries on the Known Error Log.

Would you be able to assist please with a few quick follow up questions?

1. Is it more accurate to call the KEL a database rather than a document? Yes it is a database which changes with
new KELs being added, changed, and removed on a regular basis.

2. Is it right to say that the KEL exists as one single database/document rather than multiple different logs? It is
one database.

3.I understand the KEL runs to thousands of entries. Is it possible to say how many pages the KEL would run to?
Stats below.
