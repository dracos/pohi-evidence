Please see below — Cs trying to secure some tactical advantage by running to the Judge.

I would not be able to make it to Court by 12:15. If they go ahead, someone else would have to go along or
Cs would be forced to apply for some kind of relief ex parte.

I doubt they will go ahead.

It shows just how much they think the Judge will do whatever they want.
Best,

Dear Ms Fraser

Bates & others v Post Office Limited
Recusal application - Court availability

May I enquire as to the possible availability of the Managing Judge to accommodate a short mention of this
case (maximum 30 mins) during the course of this afternoon, if that were necessary?

The Claimants are seeking to clarify whether the matters set out in Mr Parsons' 15th Witness Statement are a
complete statement of the matters to be relied upon or not.

The Claimants are due to notify the Defendant and the Court whether or not they will oppose the application
by 12:00 noon today. The Claimants may need an extension of that deadline, but do not anticipate that any
such extension or any other directions which may be necessary will affect the time for service of responsive
evidence by the Claimants or the time for Skeleton Arguments.

Against that background, we would be very grateful for an indication as to whether a mention this afternoon
could be accommodated, if it were to prove necessary.

Yours sincerely

Henry Warwick
