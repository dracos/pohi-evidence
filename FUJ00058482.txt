5. Change'to Roll Out Sequence. Pathway’s paper relating to
this was tabled at the PDA on 9 October 1996. Tony Oppenheim
bricfly stated the content of his papcr. The paper contained an
impact statement suggesting that costs would be increased by £2.2
million, The PDA Board were not happy with this potential I
inerease in costs’ and had asked ‘its staff to revisit the whole
question to remove constraints 10 try to limit the cost impact. The

only constraint definitely to be rclained would be to have four tl

‘implementation teams (rather than three). In addition, there might

be a relaxation in the coupling between site surveys, ISDN and post:
office implementation. As a result of this change in the constraints,

Pathway suggested that the change in Roll Out Scquence could
proceed without ‘any financial impact. Tony Oppenheim was Vy,
concerned to eaiure that POCL and DSS agreed this method of Nas
proceeding since the lack of confirmation has‘caused Pathway real
problems. For example, it is causing uncertainty with Pathway’s
Subcontractors, Pat Kelsey agreed to speak with Bruce McNevan
to facilitate confirmation by POCL and DSS of the removal of

constraints.

Tony Oppenhcim confirmed that the start date for Roll Out is to
remain 1 July 1997.

6. Generic Acceptance Criteria. Jim Marley has written to Pat
Kelsey conceming this.

7. Changes to Requirements. Jim Morley has contacted Alan

Fowler conccrning requirements 511 and 906.

Pat Kelsey
The Programme is to redraft service definitions to include a {Sohn Cook
drafting note suggesting the insertion of further requirements. \\
Pathway will then comment on the drafting note.

ICL PATHWAY ACTION POINTS

1. Agreements to Agree. The list of Agreements to agree has
now been sent by Jim Morlcy to Pat Kelsey. It was agreed that this

would be discussed later in the mecting.

3. Implementation Requirements J

3.4 Releases, It was apreed that this would be covered in a Gor TS

discussion of the agreements to agree. Pat Kelsey

3.2 TIP. Pat Kelsey has spoken to Jahn Mcagher concerning
this issue. TIP is subject to several specifications being
discussed between the parties. Tony Oppenheim pointcd
out that the original CAR date was the 30 August.
Although progress has began nade the CAR is still late and
therefore e,may hot be put into release one. Tony
Oppenheim would like the TIP requirement agreed by the
end of October. Pat Kelsey to discuss with collcagucs, Pat Kelsey

33 Requirement 902. Keith Baines has becn working with
POCL to agree benchmark times. At the moment, he is
awaiting a Pathway document on a proposed alternative
method of measuring times, Tony Oppenheim confirmed

that thc paper on measurement would be tabled before the \ \
next_CNT mecting next wock. Keith Baines and Tony
Oppenheim agreed that this is extremely urgent and must
be accurate. Tony Oppenheim pointed out the issue was
the whole process of recording all the transaction times
whereas the Agrccment shows.only a representative few.

There arc two issues arising from this.

@ First, for services excluding EPOSS, it is
necessary lo agree a representative transaction
time. Account must be taken of porallcl
processing and other counter clerk work and

interruptions.

Gi) EPOSS services. This issue has been discussed
in previous CNT meetings (i:¢ that thé transaction Keith Baines
time is presently y + 5 with no indication of the
definition of y).

It was agreed that’ Keith Baines would deal with this issue with
Tony Oppenheim. The issuc cari now be removed from the agenda
although it should continue to be monitored by CNT.

4.1 Contracting Authorities’ Responsibilities. Tony Oppenhcim
tabled a paper entitled “Top CARs”. Tony Oppenheim emphasiscd
that it would be necessary to galvanisc the process of resolution of
CARs. Some points on the Top CARs list are Pathway’s actions.
However, some Programme members are taking the resolution of
CARs more seriously than others. Further problems are that
difficult items are holding up the resolution of CARs. For
example, while 80% might bc agreed on one CAR with 20%
outslanding , the 20% may be critical. Tony Oppenheim said thet
Pathway has stressed to Programme members that the CARs arc
time critical, however, there are problems in ensuring that DSS and
POCL agree on the resolution of CARs.

The CNT then reviewed thc paper and commented on some of the eo
CARs.: e

Hamish Sandison reported thatthe Programme is stil considering = /

internally the suggested changes to Change Control Process.

Hamish Sandison’s paper is not yct finalised but will follow the

broad gist of the minutes of the meeting held on 19 September.

in the minutes of the CNT meeting held on 19°Septcmber it was
suggested that the Change Control Process be presented to the PDA
on 9 October. The Change Control Process Paper was not
presented to the Board on that date since. Peter Crahan wantcd to
deal with internal comments first. As the PDA Board will not meet
again until the cnd of November and the change to the Change
Control Process will need to be agreed beforc 15 November, it was
agreed that this would need to be dealt with outside thc PDA
Board,

Acceptance Process. This was an issue raised in the minutes of
the CNT meeting held on 19 September. Pat Kelscy received
internal comments on Jim Morley’s papers but had not had an
opportunity to rcvicw these. Pat Kelsey to discuss the internal
comments with Jim Morley by the end of Friday 11 October.

Actions brought:forward.

Please see above.

Drop Down Process

Hamish Sandison introduced this item by suggesting that it would

be helpful to look back at the last walkthrough and look forward to
the next and come to consensus on the role of the dropdown

process and what would be.classified as successful completion of

the process.

The AUTHORITIES’ Agreement calls for transposition and
extrapolation aimed mainly at devcloping scrvice definitions.
Other points and issues may arise during the drop down process but
are not part of the process, for example, reference to extraneous
referenced documents. The Programme's view was that thc last
walkthrough had been completed successfully. Hamish Sandison

invited Pathway’s view.

Tony Oppenheim responded by saying that there were many issues
outstanding from the last walkthrough. For example, the CARs,
agreements: to agree-and Peter Elliott’s list of actions from. the
walkthroughs, although there was some overlap between these
three areas. Pathway's view was more cautious over the
completion of the last walkthrough.

There are requircments which are now out of date and need to be

sorted out. Of the listed agreements to agree, approximately 75% _
will need to be completed. Some agreements to agrec rcfcr to a
process which needs only guidelines but others arc necessary for

Roll Out or development and therefore nced to be agreed in detail.
Thesc.are necessary, irrespective of whether or not the drap down ‘I
process has been completed.

Pat Kelsey. said that the drop down process was necessary to enable

the Authorities to award a contract based on requirements and .

solutions without service definitions, The drop down process is to
complete service definitions. Other information may be needed for
the busincss but not to define the Services. Tony Oppenhcim
responded by saying that the Scrvicc definitions needed
clarification Pat Kelsey pointed out that the Service Sinton
should be broad sincc this is a PFI project. = ——~ lee ce. MN

Hamish Sandison and Warren Spencer agrecd that there was 2
difference between the legal consequences of failing to agree drop
down issues and failing to agree other issues. The former yave
Pathway rights of termination and compensation; the latter did not.
Warren Spencer stated that Pathway’s concern was that it could not
hit a moving target. After successful completion of the drop down
process, Pathway would lose its right to walk away and claim
compensation. Without agrecmcnt on the further issues, Tony

Oppenheim would not be able to confirm that the drop down SO
process had been completed on 15 November 1996,

Warren Spencer and Tony Oppenheim argued that the contract
assumed in the drop down process that the agreements to agree

would be completed by the end of the drop down process. If this
is not completed, then the drop down process will be dclaycd. a
Pathway will request a CCN [or a 30 day extension and additional
compensation. In order ‘to progress this, and without the

Programme agrecing Pathway’s legal position, it was agreed that

besal'd

the Programme could look on a “without prejudice” basis at the list
of essential items for drop down, in Pathway’s vicw, and what

would be nice to have but not necessary.

There then followed a break in the meeting, after which Hamish
Sandison restated the Programmc’s vicw of the contractual
position. Under Clausc 201.7 of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement,
both partics must usc rcasonable cndeavours to complete the drop
down proccss. Drop down includes clarifying requirements,
transposition and extrapolation, Clause 201.10 refers to clarifying
Tequirements so as to provide agreed mechanisms for completing
any agreements to agree. It is Bird & Bird’s advice that it is not
mecessary To resolve all agreements to agree but only to have
mechanisms in phaeg. This _has been dons. If the agreements to
agree hayc not been agreed by the date set for their agreement, this
would not be a failure to drop down under the AUTHORITIES*
“Agreement. Therefore, Pathway would not have a right to refuse
to complete the drop down proccss, nor any right to compensation
or termination.

Warren Spencer and Tony Oppenheim responded by saying that the
clarification and cxtrapolation must include resolving agreements
to agree. Hamish Sandison and Warren Spencer agreed to disagree
on this point.

There followed a without prejudice discussion concerning the
issues which Pathway now wish to resolve beforc 15 November
1996, Pat Kelsey made an initial point that after the thrce day walk
through in September she had believed that the walkthrough had
been successful Tt appeared that Pathway were going back on this
agreement. Tony Oppenheim did not agree with this analysis.
——

Although the walkthrough had been a success, he had, he said,
sought to make it clear that time was of the essence to ensure that
the action point matters were agreed. No progrcss had apparently
been made over the last two weeks.

containing the content list of Release 1. This document was Q; eim
discussed with John Meagher on 9 October.

There followed a discussion on the obligation to deliver Services
where Scrvices were not adequately defined Hamish Sandison
gave his view that it would not.be-possible for the Programme to
tequire delivery of I a specific item if that item had not been

specified. For cxample, if music were required, the Programme TR eae ston y

could not then require Mozart but only music. Warrcn Spencer Peco

Service Definition (Schedule D1)

This issuc was discussed between Pat Kelsey and
Tony Oppenheim on the telephone. It was agreed
that the Authoritics should know where the
service boundaries arc and which characteristics
arc monitored, If the Authorities decide to
terminate a service then they should receive 6
months of reports. Tony Oppenheim said that he
did not think it would be possible to present six
months of reports since the oumber of reports
accrued within 6 months might be too’ many.
Tony Oppenheim will consider how many reports
he will be able to provide given the number of
transactions completed each month, This will be
reported by Tony Oppenheim to Pat Kelsey

Change Control

Hamish Sandison provided a table relating to Change Control. This
had not yet been approved by BA/POCL. Hamish Sandison invited
comments on the table of Change Contro! notes. Comments on
both the format and the method of numbering Change Control
notes were invited to be sent to Bird & Bird before the ncxt CNT.
Hamish Sandison suggested that the present numbering which

resulted in each Agreement having its own separate numbering
Own separa numberine

system for Change Control _notcs could be improved. It was
suggested that Change Control become a regular agenda item.

Hamish Sandison suggesied the changes from the three documents
referred to above (the list of Agreements to agree, the Controlled
documents list and the list of issues arising from the walkthrough)

could be incorporated in one omnibus Change Control note.

Bird & Bird will incorporate the information thrown up by thc
three lists in the Change Control table.

The table will be amended to show in the action column the

owners, from both sides, of each item.

Tony Oppenheim pointed out that a further CCN would need to be
included to cover the increase in terminals. Kcith Baines said that
he expected the maximum number of terminals to be up to 41,000
rather than 40,000. In his-opinion, it was likely that this change

would be incorporated in an omnibus change to Schedule A6.
Next Meeting
The next CNT meeting is to be held at Feltham at 2 pm on

Thursday 17 October 1996. The Programme will attend a pre-
mecting at Feltham at 1 pm.

71 Acceptance Crterig papers

Jim Morley had tabled documents in previous CNT meetings
relating to the drafting of Acccptance Critcria Specifications, It
was necessary for Jim Morlcy to obtain agreement in principle to
his documents so that Acccptance Test Specifications could be
drafted. At the moment, Pathway is producing Acceptance
Specifications on the basis set out in Jim Morley’s papers. Jim
Morley either requires agrccment to thc principles so that Pathway
can carry out the sifting of Acecptance Criteria to decide which
ones can be tested or the Programme and Pathway must work
together to sift the Criteria. Tony Oppenheim suggesting that a
meeting should take place so that the process can be agreed and_
specifications already prepared can be discussed.

Jim Morley_

Although Jim Morley is happy with the Acccptance Spccification
there is a problem relating to the assignment of severity Icvels’to
the tests before the tests are carried out, Pathway would like to
have severity levels assigned. However, the problem will be
deciding on the type of failure. A failurc could be severe or non-

severe, Therefore, it is not practical to assign severity levels now.

72 Drop Down

Warren Spencer then discussed an issuc relating to drop down.
Tony Oppenheim had gone through a large subset of the required
items for-Release 1. However, there remained a-subset which will
be outstanding once Release I had been agreed. Hamish Sandison
had said thet Pathway cannot be held liable for [ailurc to meet
something which has n¢ ified. Warren Spencer would
like this confirmed: in writing. Hamish will discuss this with-Pat
Kelsey.

Tony Oppenheim would like confirmation that the Release 1
content-document is correct. This is especially the case since it
docs not deal with the Fraud Risk:’Management Policy or reporting
since these are not agrecd,

Tony Oppenheim then discusscd his concems relating to thc’drop
down process. Oncc the drop down process has become “with
prejudice”, the balance of risk transfers to Pathway. Pathway will
have to pay for the infrastructure and then run the risk that
Agreements to agree arc not resolved which then results in a delay.
There is agrecment at the moment that CAPS will not be on line
and sinart cards will not be available in Release 1. However, this
does not track the Requirement. The problem which concerned
Tony Oppenheim is that the Contract does not plug this hole. Tony
Oppenheim intends to deliver the.remaining functions in Release
