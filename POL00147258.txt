lan
Further to my previous email, please find attached a further draft letter of engagement which we hope addresses the
point we discussed last Wednesday.

We still consider this a draft for your consideration, and, subject to any further comments you might have, we would
propose (as you suggested) to put this in draft to the Working Group (with any information, such as fees, which is not

appropriate to be shared redacted or removed).

Because I was keen to get this to you today, I have not double checked formatting and typos so my apologies if some
remain. I will do a further check tomorrow.

We would be grateful for your comments and, as ever, Chris and I will be happy to discuss.

Best wishes
Belinda
