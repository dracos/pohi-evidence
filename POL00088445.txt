1. Background

This document provides a summary of the end to end Agent Debt process and relevant controls at Post Office Limited (‘POL’).
For all sub processes noted below, underlying processes and controls have been documented. Note, the process resulting in the creation of agent

debt balances has not been covered within this document, as this falls within the remit of the Transaction Correction process flow — please see this for
further details. This document therefore looks at Agent Debt from the inception to recovery (or legal action) phase.

The Agent Debt process includes the following sub-processes:

Branch Corrections ducts (Sub-Processes)

6.1 Current agent

6.2 Former agent

6.3 Disputed balance
6.4 Agent surplus

6.5 Loan to POL

6.6 Fraud investigation
6.7 Reporting

All processes above relate to Post Office Limited (company number 1000)
Each of the sub-processes is supported by:

= Flow chart - This outlines the end-to-end flow of transactions, the process and control steps within the process.

= Narrative - Details the flow chart and allows the reader to better understand the who, how, why, what and when of the process.
a Risk and Controls Matrix — A tracker collating all the main risks and controls identified through the process mapping exercise.
= Remediation tracker — A collation of the control gaps identified and remediation plans.

6. Process flow

The process flow documents the GL accounts primarily impacted by each element of the agent debt monitoring and recovery process. It is worth
noting that agent debt balances often arise as a result of errors in branch and therefore the process is inherently linked with the Transaction
Correction (TC) process. In order to avoid repetition, where there is a clear link with the TC process a reference is made and the process is not
documented in detail. In these instances please review the TC process flow diagrams for details on how these are processed and the related controls
in place. Agent debt can also arise due to central costs and invoices being allocated to the agent, however for the purposes of this process flow this
has not been documented given these are simple underlying transactions.

Note there is a probity reconciliation process covering all balance sheet accounts. This is documented in detail within the TC process flow.
Responsibilities of balance sheet reconciliations and analytics are spread across various teams within the FSC. Every product is associated with a
GL account or range of GL accounts and at Month End these are subject to Probity Reconciliation which are reviewed by team lead and operation
managers to ensure accuracy. Completeness is ensured via the Record to Report team who as per closing timetable ensure all GL accounts have
been reconciled and sample check a set of accounts each month.

The agent debt process has been split into a few key areas, however there is interaction across each:

6.1 Current agent — documents the process undertaken to monitor and recover debt for current agents.

6.2 Former agent — documents the process undertaken to monitor and recover debt from former agents, as identified by the Agent Accounting Team.
6.3 Disputed balance — documents the dispute process that can occur at any point in 6.1 as instigated by the agent.

6.4 Agent surplus — documents the process undertaken to monitor and reimburse surpluses associated with agents.

6.5 Loan to POL — documents the process of monitoring and investigating unapproved loans from POL to Postmaster.

6.6 Fraud investigation — documents the process undertaken by the internal audit / fraud team where agents are investigated.

6.7 Agent debt reporting — documents the process and interaction between teams regarding reporting around agent debt balances.

POL00088445

& Agent Debt

6.1 Current agent

Background

Process covers debt owed by current agents from the initial identification through to collection of balance. Agent debt build up during a month and the
monitoring begins the following month. The process from initial monitoring through to collection should take a maximum of 35 days in the case of full
settlement, but can extend for a significantly longer period where a payment plan is put in place.

Branches are split into 4 categories — A, B, C and D. The below process outlines that of branches in the A category, however for B, C and D the same process is
followed at 1 week intervals i.e. the process begins 1 week later for B, 2 weeks later for C and 3 weeks later for D.

IPOLSAP GL codes:
- 539590 — weekly build-up of agent debt, swept into 539591 monthly through the branch monthly close down process (mandatory process).
- 539591—built up agent debt balance, used for monitoring

(CFS GL codes:
- 13160
- 13000 — agent accounts

(Chronological steps in the process:
1. Agent incurs debt (deficit in branch, central invoices or choose to settle credits centrally) and choose to settle at the endof the day, in horizon, via either:

a) make good cash / cheque (required for all debt < £150— horizon driven option)

b) settle centrally

If debt isn’t settled, recorded in 539590.

Balances swept from 539590 into 539591 on a monthly basis (part of branch close down process)

Balances selected as “settle centrally” in horizon are swept into customer account codes in CFS (13000codes)

POLSAP account 539591 is mirrored in CFS within the customer account codes (13000 codes)

10. Identify other current agents (new multiple partner branches, singletons, operator self-funded). Send “Dunning Letter 1” requesting settlement of debt
within 7 days.

11. Second Tuesday of the month, ADT run “Dunning Run 2” report from CFS for A branches.

12. Identify other current agents. Send “Dunning Letter 2” requesting settlement of debt within 7 days.

13. Third Wednesday of the month, ADT run “Worklist” report from CFS for A branches.

14. AAT team call the SPMR (number of attempted calls dependent on size of debt) to request payment.

15. Debt not settled, AAT assess the debt against SPMR monthly remuneration and calculate time period to repay using 25% of monthly remuneration as a
basis.

16. Case passed to contract advisor if agent currently on or has had a payment plan in the last 12 months (manud check) or has directly refused to settle the
debt.

17. Obtain approval for payment plan based on the payment plan approval matrix.

18. Contact SPMR to advise of payment plan put in place— mail merge letter sent.

19. Spreadsheet completed by AAT and sent to HR to setup payment / payment plan.

Background
Process covers debt owed by former agents from the initial identification through to collection of balance. Agents are identfied as being former agents based
jon the type of agent they are registered as on the system. Master data controls are therefore keyto the identification elements of this process (not
documented within this process — see IT / Masterdata process flows). The process can be lengthy (potentially years) and therefore monitoring of the ongoing
jcases and maintaining robust documentation is key to success in the process.

POL00088445
POL00088445

Agent Debt

Background

At any point in the agent debt process (6.1 and 6.2 above) the agent (or former agent) can dispute thedebt balance. The process can result in no changes to the
case, such as when there is no evidence to the agent’s claims / queries, or it may result in a transaction correction and subsequent change in the balance
requested from the agent. There is no specific timeframe for completion, with cases taking as long as required to resolve. Debt collection is halted whilst

\disputes are being investigated.

Background

Agent accounts can be ina deficit position (agent debt) or a surplus position. A surplus is where the branch have excess funds and assuming no subsequent
transaction correction is received or a deficit is offset by surplus then the funds should become the property of the SPMR. The SPMR may choose to accept these
funds or decline them, with the latter resulting in a creditor on POL BS.

Once a month AAT run a “customer account” report in CFS and identify accounts in surplus:

a) Surplus < £150, refunded to SPMR by AAT.

b) Surplus > £150 an < £500, balance is held on the account for 6 months prior to refund by AAT (on the basis that a TC / other correction will filter
through to resolve the surplus in this period).

c) Surplus > £500 and < £1000, balance retained for 12 months before refund issued.

d) Surplus > £1000, balance retained for 12 months then SPMR contacted to ask if they want refund. If they don’t, balance transferred to 626210 and

6.6 Fraud investigation / branch audit process

Background

[The Fraud Analysis Team (FT) perform continual analysis relating to branches in order to identify branches requiring audit. Where these are identified Network
Support Admin Team (NSAT) arrange for the audits to be undertaken, in order to identify if there are any discrepancies in the financials within branch.

(Any discrepancies over the agreed threshold are reported initially to the Contract Advisor (CA) and when a final audit figureis known over the agreed threshold
ithe CA will discuss the case with the Agent Contracts Deployment Manager South (ACDMS) or Head of Agency Contracts Deployment (HAC) and make a decisio!
jon whether to suspend the Postmaster or not.

IACDMS/HAC monitor and track discrepancies identified through the process and work closely with the CA to identify follow up action (non-suspension cases
lonly) for branches and with the FSC regarding debt collection and monitoring. HACreports directly to the Ops Board via the Ops Board pack each period
regarding debt identified at suspension and non-suspension cases along with the amount recovered. This section includes details on the end to end process for
ithe fraud investigation / branch audit process, the possible resulting action following an audit loss and the interaction between various teams and processes.

IPOLSAP GL codes:

6.6.2 Fraud investigation / branch audit — Process Narrative

vestigation / branch aud
Chronological steps in the process:
1. Fraud analysis team (FT) determine branches requiring an audit. Determined via use of a fraud risk model, considering factors such as cash and stock
anomalies, agent debt > 3 times annual salary (note audit is not rotational, selection based on risk model).
2. Ona Friday, the Network Support Admin Team (NSAT) and FT inform the Head of Agency Contracts Deployment (HAC), Agent Contracts Deployment
Manager South (ACDMS) and Contract Advisors (CA) of the branches to be audited the following week. The notification is via an email list.
3. Audit team (AT) visit the branch and complete an audit.
If financial loss noted > £1k then audit team contact Contract Advisor (CA) regarding Tier 2 audit requirement (will be a “yes” response based on value)
i) Further audit work performed in branch in line with Tier 2 as required
5. AT advise CA of results of audit. CA gathers information on the case and discusses with HAC or ACDMS who decide if the Postmaster is to be suspended or
not (a proforma is signed off to support the decision to suspend or not suspend). Decision informed on a number of factors which include:
i) Fraudulent activity suspected, e.g. borrowing POL funds
ii) Whether debt can be explained
iii) If any mitigation is offered
iv) Level of risk involved — will intervention activity address the issues identified
v) Whether the debt can be repaid or not

Non suspension (e.g. risk is deemed acceptable and Postmaster agrees to repay):

6. CA advise branch that debt requires settlement

7. Branch decision on settlement method made same day:
i) settle in branch in full—no impact on financials and therefore no impact on FSC;
ii) settle in branch in part, remainder settled centrally — FSC impacted as balance “settled centrally” on horizon;
iii) setup payment plan— FSC impacted as balance “settled centrally” on horizon;

iv) settle in full via deduction from agent remuneration— FSC impacted as balance “settled centrally” on hori:

os) 6) John Breeden / Keith Bridges, 7) Dawn Wall (FAAT team leader).
Form includes details of how discrepancy settled (in branch, cheque, via FSC).
9. HAC or ACDMS maintain their central tracker regarding status of non-suspension and suspension cases.

POL00088445
POL00088445

& Agent Debt

10. On a weekly basis an email is sent to the FSC identifying agents where payment plan setup or settlement should have occurred. This is then updated for
relevant payment plans or settlements by the FSC and then returned. Contract advisers then follow up acordingly with the agents.

Suspension:

11. Following point 5, the HAC or ACDMS make the decision as to whether an agent should be suspended (evidenced via signoff on agent suspension proforma).

12. CA notifies branch of suspension, same day.

13. Branch asked if debt can be repaid - unlikely to repay and therefore debt “settled centrally” and therefore appears within financials for FSC

14. Email sent by CA to all key stakeholders (including FSC Agent Debt team leaders and Alison Bolsover) to advise of suspension. Email includes date of
suspension, debt value identified in audit (this may move at a later date when all TC’s etc are settled) ard details of the fraudulent activity.

15. Agent accounting team send letter to suspended agent requesting payment (see Former agent process).

16. CA then begins the formal conduct process and will request repayment of the debt.

17. Where the CA is contacted by suspended agent to make a payment towards debt, the central tracker(held by GAC and ACDMS) is updated in respect of total
debt.

18. Where the FSC is contacted to make a payment towards debt the CA is not updated (Note CA does not have access to POLSAP/CFS). Therefore on a weekly
basis (every Monday) the FSC email a list of all payments received the previous week, in relation to newly suspended agents, to the HAC and ACDMS
(included in the same report as point 10). Update is provided monthly for previously suspended agents.

6.7 Agent debt reporting

Background

For the purposes of this section, reporting relates to the interaction between the agent debt andagent deployment teams in order to monitor and maintain
accurate reporting for current and former agent debt. Reporting requirements are also documented, incliding details of how the reports are pulled together.
Process flows and risks have not been documented for this section, instead this has been presented in written format.

Review

Reporting requirements / process:
-  AAT/FAAT:

© Monthly reporting pack created by Dawn Wall and Dawn Phillips.

©. Standard format, rolled forward monthly.

© Reports the total agent debt figures, split by type (former, current) and includes ageing profiles.

o. Figures pulled directly from CFS “customer account report” and then split into relevant ageing categories and types, therefore agrees through to

the GL (Risk A)

o Only manual figures included are those representing “former agent, still in ledger as current” — reclassification between current and former:

¢ Figures pulled from CFS as being agents with an “F block” on CFS. “F block” indicates a dunning block as the agent is being investigated /
suspended.

e Suspension report received from audit team identifying those agents that are suspended (Risk B).

0 Risks and controls
© A-—Risk: GL does not reflect all known factors impacting the agent debt balance.Control: Report is pulled directly from CFS and tied back

o Report the “audit loss declared” and the “recoveries” figure separately, however these figures include those recovered on the day of the audit in

branch. This results in a mismatch with the FSC report as recovery in branch doesn’t flow into the accounts and therefore doesn’t feature as adebt
or recovery in the financials (Risk B)

System GL Account Overview

IPOLSAP

[539590

On a daily basis, branches declare a surplus or deficit as a result of
mis-keys and other errors. This code is used to track the surplus or}
deficit arising. When a deficit arises the branch can choose to
ectify the issue in branch by topping up the cash from their own
unds, effectively making good the error. TC’s can also be issued

here it is a known error, therefore correcting the issue. The
emaining balance is a net surplus or deficit. The account is swept
into 539591 on a monthly basis and should therefore always be nil
at period end.

N/A — should be nil at period end.

IPOLSAP

[539591

Balances are swept into this account at month end from 539590.
The branch then chooses to settle surplus / deficit locally or
centrally. If locally this should then be cleared down and if
centrally it is transferred to 559552. Balances in this account
epresent errors in branch when rolling forward the month end.

Balances should be corrected within a few weeks of month end. Only
rite off that should occur is to former agent balances where the debt
recover case has been closed. Other open items relate to historic branch
roll forward issues (Fujitsu now perform roll forward for the branch) —
‘hese should be cleared down / corrected.

IPOLSAP

Holding account for branch surplus balances. Balances are
ransferred into here at the point where:
- Branch state they do not want the refund
- Balance becomes 12 months old within code 529591 and
is > £1000

Balances are written off when they become aged 5 yearswithin this
jaccount (6 years in total). It is deemed that the surplus will not be
reclaimed after such a period of time and therefore a release is deemed
reasonable.

IPOLSAP

621020

Holding account for balances loaned to POL from SPMR. Cr
balance represents a loan from SPMR to branch. Dr balance
epresents a loan balance from branch to SPMR.

Potential policy:
- Cr balance and current agent— no write off
- Cr balance and former agent— write off after 12 months
-__Dr balance —no write off.

IPOLSAP

intersystem control account. When agent debt is settled in
Horizon it is recorded in this account. This balance interfaces with
CFS (13160) netting off the customer account balances and
effectively transferring the balance to CFS. There should be no
aged items as balances that don’t match between POLSAP and

IN/A as no aged items — just an interface account.

CFS will remain in 531100.
