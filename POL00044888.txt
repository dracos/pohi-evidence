I have now had an opportunity to consider the matter raised in your letter of the
15" February 2006.

Dealing with the matters in the order raised.

1 The prosecution takes the view that the case summary is provided in
accordance within the Rules on Advance Information. Should the case be
committed to the Crown Court then statements will be prepared, these will
include a statement from Fujitsu.

2 1 am enclosing a colour copy of the balancing record which should assist.
I understand this schedule was drawn up by the Officer in the course of
enquiries. It reflects what errors were made and whether amounts were
reflected in the balancing figure achieved at the Office, The position
regarding statements is as above.

3 The print outs to which I believe you refer relates to calls made by Gaerwen
to the National Business Support Centre the final page shows calls logged to
the Horizon System Helpdesk.

4 As referred above a statement will be provided by Fujitsu.
