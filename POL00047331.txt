Paper numbers: 7746/3415

see minute from Steve Bradshaw. Before I can properly advise on the sufficiency of

evidence and likely prospect of conviction, I would like to know:-

1.
2.

a

The result of the further pension and allowance checks.

How did Mr Bradshaw know that the above-named had not made mistakes in her other
work? What checks had been made in respect of that work?

How can you rule out that another member of staff stole the missing money or dockets
from the above-named's till?

How many other people (if any) had access to the above-named’s till and dockets?

What were the security arrangements like in respect of the individual tills, stock and
accounting documents at Huyton Post Office?

Do you have any evidence to show whether the above-named was stealing Post Office
money or covering up shortages? Is there any further evidence to prove that the above-
named was acting “dishonestly” rather than “incompetently’?

Have any financial checks been performed in respect of the above-named?

What was Miss Brennan's accounting record like? How did it compare to her colleague’s
accounting record?

Has Miss Brennan received any warnings or extra training for accounting irregularities?
What was the average level of pension and allowance discrepancies for other counter
clerks at Huyton Post Office?

I accordingly return the papers to you in the first instance for further enquiries to be made.
