Dear Mr Arbuthnot

POST OFFICE HORIZON SYSTEM

Many thanks for your letter dated 28 June 2012, I appreciate you taking the time to respond at
what must be a very busy time for you.

I do of course fully understand the need for any investigating accountants in this matter to be
100% independent and free from any accusation by the Post Office of bias.

However, should you require any further assistance in any aspect that I might be free to help
you with, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I wish you and your constituents all the best in the investigation and await with interest its
outcome.

Regards

Yours sincerely
