Dear Mrs Hamilton

As discussed with you earlier today, I am writing to confirm that I wish to formally interview you
with regard to a £36,644.89 deficiency in the accounts at South Warnborough Post Office,
identified following an audit on Thursday 09 March 2006.

The interview will be tape-recorded, conducted under caution and in accordance with the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Codes of Practice. As such you are entitled to Legal
Representation at the interview, should you so wish

You are also entitled to have a ‘Post Office Friend’ present at the interview. Any ‘Friend’ invited
to attend a Post Office Ltd interview must be at least 18 years of age and not already involved
in the enquiry. He or she must be a Post Office Ltd employee, who may be from the National
Federation of Subpostmasters. The right to a ‘Friend’ is additional to your right to seek legal
advice.

I would therefore be grateful, if you would contact me, to agree a time and venue in which to
conduct the interview.

Yours Sincerely

Graham Brander
Investigation. Manager
