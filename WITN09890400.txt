POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FOURTH WITNESS STATEMENT

OF SIMON RECALDIN

I, Simon Recaldin, of 100 Wood Street, London say as follows:

Introduction

1 Except where I indicate to the contrary, the facts and matters contained in this
witness statement are within my own knowledge. Where any information is not
within my personal knowledge, I have identified the source of that information
or the basis for my belief. In particular, the content of this statement is
substantially informed by the enquires and disclosure review of Burges Salmon
LLP and their contractor Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFf"), who are instructed
by Post Office Limited ("POL") and who represent POL in the Inquiry. The facts

in this witness statement are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

2 I have provided three previous witness statements to the Inquiry. I continue to
be employed by POL as Remediation Unit Director, leading the business unit

which POL established to administer its redress schemes. This is now known

Page 1 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

as the Remediation Unit (or ‘RU’) but was previously known as the Historical
Matters Unit (sometimes also referred to as the Historical Matters Business Unit

or ‘HMU’).

3 This witness statement has been prepared in response to paragraph 3(c) of
Annex A to the Notice given by the Inquiry on 9 October 2023 pursuant to
Section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 ("Notice No.8"). Notice No.8 was amended
by the Inquiry’s letter of 23 October 2023. Its terms were amended so that
references to a “Convicted SPM” were replaced with references to a Potential
Future Appellant “PFA”, meaning an appellant or potential future appellant as
defined in paragraph 15 to 16 of my first witness statement to this Inquiry. The
Inquiry also amended the time for compliance with Notice No.8 so that all limbs

of that notice were required to be complied with by 4pm on 15 November 2023".

4 This witness statement briefly sets of the scope of Notice No.8, the scope of
enquiries undertaken to comply with it, the resulting document review, the
results of that review and the information sought at paragraphs 3(a) and (b) of

Annex A of the Notice.
Notice No.8

5 Paraphrasing and adopting the same defined (capitalised) terms of Notice No.8,

it required that POL provide (or if already provided identify):

1 This was via its letter of 23 October 2023 extending the deadline to 13 November
2023, and email of 09 November 2023 extending the deadline by a further 48 hours.

Page 2 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

(a) Any Relevant Documents or Redacted Relevant Documents sent by
POL? to a PFA, pursuant to POL’s duty of post-conviction disclosure,

between 1 January 2000 and 16 December 2019.

(b) Any correspondence’ sent by POL, to a PFA or their agents, with or
further to the disclosure of such Relevant Documents or Redacted
Relevant Documents that provided details of: (i) the nature or content of
the disclosure; (ii) the reason for the disclosure; (iii) the timing of the

disclosure; or (iv) the existence of or reason for any redactions.

(c) A statement with a schedule setting out, for each Relevant Document
and Redacted Relevant Document, and for each piece of

correspondence, to which PFA it was sent and on what date.
The scope of enquiries undertaken

6 The scope of the post-conviction duty applies to any material affecting the safety
of aconviction of a PFA. There are known to be some 700 PFAs and the scope

of Notice No.8 applies to a period just short of 20 years.

rd To respond to Notice No.8 POL (internally and through BSFf) has undertaken

enquires of relevant personnel and organisations to establish whether any such

2 In 6(a) and 6(b) the references to POL should be read as including any of its

predecessor organisations or parent companies, or its agents.

3 Paragraph 4 provided that where there are multiple identical (save for addressee and
date) or materially similar letters, POL is only required to produce one version of that
letter.

Page 3 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

post-conviction disclosure exercises or instances had taken place, and then
conducted targeted searches in response to the exercises and/or instances

identified.

8 Enquiries were made of:

(a) Peters & Peters ("P&P") and Simon Baker KC, who as explained in my
first witness statement to the Inquiry were instructed by POL to conduct
the post-conviction disclosure exercise (or ‘PCDE’) following the Horizon

Issues judgment’, and who have acted for POL during the Inquiry;

(b) Herbert Smith Freehills (“HSF”) as the former recognised legal

representative of POL in previous phases of the Inquiry;

(c) The firm which now trades as Cartwright King solicitors (‘Current CK”).
Cartwright King was instructed by POL in relation to a large number of

prosecutions during the period covered by the scope of Notice No.8;

(d) I Andy Cash, formerly of Cartwright King who has been assisting P&P with

its enquiries in relation to Cartwright King’s work for POL; and

4 Bates & Others v Post Office Limited [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB) which was handed
down on 16 December 2019.

5 Cartwright King Ltd went into Administration in 2022 and the entity which now trades
as Cartwright King is a phoenix company. To reflect this I refer to the entity which now
trades as Cartwright King as ‘Current CK’ in distinction to the original entity which I

refer to as ‘Cartwright King’.

WITNO09890400

(e) — Simon Clarke, formerly of Cartwright King, who had deep involvement in
Cartwright King’s work for POL for a large part of the period covered by

Notice No.8.

9 In addition, enquiry has been made of relevant individuals/repositories of data

within POL.

Summary outcome of enquiries

10 As a result of these enquiries POL can confirm that one post-conviction
disclosure exercise was undertaken during the relevant period. This exercise
was conducted by Cartwright King in two phases between 2013 and 2015 and

is known as the Cartwright King Sift Review (the “CK Sift’).

11 The scope, process and outcomes of the CK Sift are described in the following

contemporaneous documents:

(a) A Cartwright King document titled “Observations and analysis of the
Cartwright King Prosecution Review Process” dated 5 December 2013°

(the “2013 CK Observations”);

(b) I Adocument titled ‘General Review’ dated 15 October 2013’ produced by

Brian Altman QC®; and,

® POL00040194.
7 POL00040042.

8 As he then was.

Page 5 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

(c) An update to the 2013 CK Observations document also titled
“Observations and analysis of the Cartwright King Prosecution Review

Process” dated 19 September 2014 (“2014 CK Observations’)’.

12 In addition to these documents, Simon Clarke prepared a document titled “The
Sift Review -— an Explanation” dated 15 July 20191 Whilst not
contemporaneous to the CK Sift being conducted, this document is, I believe,
useful in establishing that no similar review exercise was conducted after the
CK Sift concluded in late 2014. I am informed by BSFf that Mr Clarke has

confirmed that this is correct.
13 Having identified the CK Sift, I am informed that BSFf sought to identify both:

(a) whether any post-conviction disclosure exercises or instances were

known to have been undertaken other than the CK Sift; and,

(b) where documents relating to the CK Sift and any post-conviction

disclosure instances would now be located.

14 None of the parties of whom enquiries were made were, to the best of their
knowledge and belief, aware of any post-conviction disclosure review or

exercise other than the CK Sift. Supporting this position, BSFf did not identify

® POL00169034: “Observations and analysis of the Cartwright King Prosecution

Review Process” dated 5 December 2013.

10 POL00169024: “The Sift Review — An Explanation”.

Page 6 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

any other post-conviction disclosure exercises or instances during the course of

its review of relevant documents/document repositories.

15 In relation to the location of documents:

(a) _ it was identified that all of Cartwright King’s electronic and hardcopy files
relating to instructions by Royal Mail Group (‘RMG’) and POL, insofar as
still retained by Cartwright King at the date of request, had been
requested by one or other of HSF and P&P during the Inquiry such that
all of those files now exist in POL’s Relativity Platform (the “CK Files’).

This includes:

(i) two very large single pdf extractions of what Current CK believed
to be the electronic client matter files for the each phase of the CK

Sift (the “CK Sift Files”); and

(ii) either hardcopy or electronic files for some of those individuals in
whose cases post-conviction disclosure had been advised by
Cartwright King (the “CK’s Individual Files”), although BSFf and

POL were not able to locate files for all such individuals.

(b) Further hardcopy files labelled with the names of some individuals where
post-conviction disclosure had been advised by Cartwright King were
also held by POL’s hardcopy archive provider Oasis (the “POL Individual

Files”).

The CK Sift

16 As summarised in the 2013 CK Observations document and its subsequent

update:

(a) _ the CK Sift involved 533 cases, within which 83 cases were subjected to

a ‘full review’;

(b) the CK Sift was conducted on the premise that, if post-conviction
disclosure was to be provided, the documents that would be disclosed
were the Second Sight Interim Report and potentially also the Helen

Rose Report;
(c) disclosure of the Second Sight Interim Report was advised in 36 cases";

(d) in a subset of 12 of those 36 cases" it was also advised that the Helen

Rose Report should be disclosed’; and

‘1 The 2013 and 2014 CK Observations documents report that disclosure was advised
in 36 cases. However, for the reasons explained below there is some uncertainty as

to exactly how that figure is derived.

12 The 12 cases shown in Appendix 1: Allen, Boyle, D'Arcy, Dixon, Hirani, Hutchings,
Ishaq, Robinson, Sefton, Neild, Threlfall and McQue, all of which were ‘first phase’

cases save for McQue.

13 For an example of a case in which disclosure of the Second Sight Interim Report
and Helen Rose Report were advised, and were disclosed in correspondence, see
document POL00040055 / POL00029112 / POLO0029128 / POL00091391 which is
a signed version of the post conviction disclosure letter from Cartwright King to the

solicitors of record for Susan Knight and which encloses copies of both reports. The

Page 8 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

(e) in one case it appears that disclosure of materials relating to the

Callendar Square bug (also called the Falkirk bug) was advised.

17 In seeking to identify all cases in which post-conviction disclosure was provided
to a PFA, BSFf undertook a manual document-by-document review of both CK
Sift Files. In doing so, it identified what appeared to be 36 cases in which
disclosure was advised by Cartwright King during the CK Sift, of which 26 were
advised in the first phase of the review, and the further 10 cases during the

second phase.

18 In the case of each individual listed in the CK Sift Files as being a person in
whose case post-conviction disclosure was advised BSFf looked at the list of all
CK Files and POL Individual Files identified and undertook a full manual review

of each of those files.

19 BSFf also reviewed the POL mailboxes" of the following members of POL’s
legal team: Susan Crichton, Chris Aujard, Jarnail Singh and Rodric Williams.
This is because BSFf had identified during the document reviews summarised

above that correspondence on the CK Sift Files concerning the outcomes of

Helen Rose Report was redacted to remove the name of the author and of the

postmaster involved.

14 For the avoidance of doubt, mailboxes here means both the emails stored in
Mimecast and in Exchange, save in the case of Jarnail Singh where, at the time of
review, Mimecast emails had been extracted but not Exchange data. Based on the
material found on Mimecast, a review of Exchange data once available is not

expected to identify further relevant material.

Page 9 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

these file reviews was primarily between Cartwright King and Jarnail Singh, but
often also copying one or more of Susan Crichton, Chris Aujard, and Rodric

Williams.

20 As a ‘sweeper search’ BSFf then undertook a further review of all documents
within the CK Files (excluding the CK Sift Files and CK Individual Files which
had been reviewed manually) applying the keywords at Appendix 2, and

reviewing responsive documents.
Post Conviction Disclosures to PFAs as a result of the CK Sift

21 Before explaining the outcome of the CK Sift, it is useful to explain that when
counting the number of instances for disclosure there is a distinction to be made

between:

(a) the number of cases and the number of individuals (because some cases

involved co-Defendants); and

(b) instances in which disclosure was advised and instance in which it was
given (because there was one case in which disclosure was advised but

not given).
First Phase

22 There are 16 cases, concerning 17 individuals'®, in which post-conviction

disclosure was provided (being the first 17 listed individuals in Appendix 1).

15 Angela Sefton and Ann Neild were co-Defendants, treated as a single case (see for
example the Full Review Case Note / Opinion at POL00168974) but each individual

received separate post-conviction disclosures (see Appendix 1).

Page 10 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

23 Although not requested by the terms of the Notice No.8, because they are not
cases of post-conviction disclosure, I am informed by BSFf that there are 9

cases concerning 12 individuals where disclosure was advised as follows:

(a) five further cases (involving five individuals) in which it appears from
contemporaneous documents that disclosure of the Second Sight Report
was advised and provided during an ongoing prosecution, and that in
each case those prosecutions were then either discontinued or the
prosecution offered no evidence and a not guilty verdict was therefore

entered’®.

(b) one case (involving one individual) in which disclosure was advised but

the case was discontinued before disclosure was given’’;

(c) three cases (involving six individuals) which were, at the time, at a pre-
trial stage, in which POL was not the prosecuting entity, this being either

the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) or Procurator Fiscal, and in which

1® These cases concerned Rita Threlfall, Susan Knight, Nicola Grech, Danielle King
and Balvinder Kaur Samra. For completeness, I understand from BSFf that voluntarily
disclosure has been included within the documents produced in response to Notice
No.8 which evidence both the advice given by Cartwright King concerning disclosure
of the Second Sight Interim Report and Helen Rose Report in these cases, and the

letters or attendance notes of oral disclosures made in these cases.

17 In the case of George Thomas Brown disclosure of the Second Sight Interim Report
and Helen Rose Report was advised (see POL00168896) but did not occur in light of
the decision to discontinue that case (see POL00168901 and POL00169054).

Page 11 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

POL made the disclosure to the CPS or Procurator Fiscal for the relevant

prosecuting body to make disclosure to the PFA or their legal adviser'®.

24 We note this appears to be confirmed by paragraphs 31 and 32 of the 2013 CK

Observations document which states:

“There are a number of cases which have been prosecuted by the Crown
Prosecution Service. ...we have ensured that the Crown prosecution
Service Branches are aware of the issues with which the review process
is concerned and have disclosed to them copies of the Second Sight

Interim Report and the Helen Rose Report.”

25 The above gives rise to some uncertainty as to how Cartwright King came to
summarise the number of disclosures advised as being “26”, as it appears that
disclosure was advised in respect of 29 individuals in 25 cases, and disclosure

was then given to 28 individuals in 24 cases"?.

18 These cases concerned individuals called: (1) Gould, Townley, Renshaw &
Renshaw, (2) Rerrie and (3) Ali. For completeness, I understand from BSFf that
voluntarily disclosure has been included within the documents produced in response
to Notice No.8 which evidence the disclosure of information from POL to the CPS and
Procurator Fiscal respectively in these cases. Further I understand from BSFf that it
is understood that Renshaw & Renshaw may be treated as a single case (being the
same family) which is why this is reported as a total of 26 cases in which disclosure
was advised, rather than 27. See in particular CK’s internal summary at
POL00169021 which lists these three cases and six individuals, and provides details

of the ways in which disclosure was provided.

19 Per paragraphs 23 and 24 above:

Page 12 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

Second Phase

26 ‘The 10 cases in which disclosure was advised by Cartwright King during the
second phase are those 10 individuals listed as such in Appendix 1. However,
despite the searches described above, POL (and BSFf) has been unable to
locate a letter or other evidence of any post-conviction disclosure being
provided to Jerry Kwame Hosi (one of the PFA’s) although BSFf have identified
the opinion document produced by Cartwright King in which it was advised

disclosure should be given”°.

oF During the manual review of the CK Sift Files and the wider review described
below, BSFf did not identify any cases other than those listed in Appendix 1 in
which it appeared post-conviction disclosure had been given, nor to the best of

my knowledge and belief is POL aware of any such further cases.

Letters to PFAs or their legal advisers

28 lam informed by BSFf that:

(i) 16 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 25 cases in which disclosure was advised, within which
disclosure was given in 24 cases.
(ii) 17 +5 + 1 + 6 = 29 individuals in respect of whom disclosure was advised, within

which disclosure was given to 28.

20 In particular, it was advised that disclosure should be given not only of the Second
Sight Interim Report and Helen Rose Report but also materials relating the Callendar
Square bug.

Page 13 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

(a) The letter that went from Cartwright King to a PFA or their legal adviser
was materially the same letter in all instances, tailored to the post-

conviction disclosure provided in that instance;

(b) Save for the case of Jerry Kwame Hosi referred to above, BSFf have
been able to locate unsigned letters to a PFA or their legal adviser

providing post-conviction disclosure in all cases;

(c) It was not the practice of Cartwright King to retain copies of signed letters
to PFAs or their legal advisers as proof that such disclosure had been
provided. Rather, BSFf inform me that the Cartwright King practice was
that an unsigned copy of a letter to a PFA or his or her legal adviser would
stand as the ‘office copy’ record of the letter that was sent. I am informed
Cartwright King sought to operate a paperless office and that this

approach was part of that practice;

(d) I Cartwright King produced two schedules to record progress of the CK
Sift, the relevant extracts of which have been disclosed as POL00169054
(First Phase CK Sift) and POL00169055 (Second Phase CK Sift). In most
cases?! these record: (i) its advice as to whether or not post-conviction
disclosure should be provided and, if so, what the disclosure should be;

and (ii) whether or not the disclosure was provided. Accordingly, in those

21 Both schedules are incomplete in some respects.

Page 14 of 28
WITNO9890400
WITN09890400

WITNO09890400

cases where the schedules are complete, they serve as a useful way of

checking whether post-conviction disclosure was in fact provided.

(e) In 3 cases BSFf has located a signed letter to a PFA or their legal adviser.
It appears that POL holds these signed copies only as a result of the
relevant legal advisers to those PFAs providing them to POL as
enclosures to correspondence flowing from POL’s post-conviction

disclosure.

29 In all the circumstances there are therefore reasonable grounds for POL to be
confident that post-conviction disclosure was provided as described above, to
the 29 individuals listed in Appendix 1 of this statement. As I have noted above,
although the CK Sift resulted in disclosures being made in 36 cases, the

remaining seven cases were pre-trial disclosures.

Information sought by Notice No.8

30 lam advised by BSFf that the tables in Appendix 1 below contain all information
POL has been able to obtain responsive to the requests at paragraphs 3(a) and

3(b) of Annex A to the Notice.

Statement of truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
