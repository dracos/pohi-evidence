HNGX R1 Exec Summary FUJITSU

Key Challenges:

BTS issue from Low Volume Pilot has to be fixed to enable start of MVP.

Slip to start of MVP results in slip to R1 rollout (20/05/10). Options to mitigate investigated — Account
decision on how to proceed.

Delay in increasing 3rd line support team for Branch Connectivity solution

Current VOL plan to mitigate delay of VOL rig build requires VOL Test Team to work all weekends
through February and March

Overall Plan faces a number of risks

* Completion of Vol Test Cycle 1 (High Volume Pilot)
* Completion of Vol Test Cycle 2 (Rollout)

* Completion of MVP without major issues

* Testing of 0108 Maintenance Release

* Completion of HVP without major issues

Key Progress:

Extended Small Volume pilot - 28 live branches on HNG-X, 22 trading, 6 Model Office
Next 10 branches for start of MVP scheduled to migrate 11/02/10

2,383 Branch Routers installed, 25% of estate

Branch Router install success rate now consistently above 85%

Branch router rollout approaching full beat rate (1,130 this week, 1,200 next week)
Volume Testing Cycle 1 started

First Maintenance Release (0108) — Datacentre fixes scheduled into LST 14/02/10

HNGX R1 Key Risks & Issues FUJITSU

“im Key Risks —

Vol Testing may slip — potentially
slipping HVP and Rollout

Current maintenance release
content will increase/change
through counter pilot

Significant live issues (Horizon or
HNGX) may result in the rollout
being delayed

Beat rate during full rollout cannot
be sustained, leading to delays

Slip to programme puts exit from
Wigan/Bootle Datacentres by
31/07/10 at risk

POLFS migration weekend occurs
immediately after start of HVP —
potential resource contention

POLSAP Exec Summary FUJITSU

m Key Challenges:

No agreed plan as yet between Fujitsu, POL and POL’s suppliers (including low-level
cutover plan). This is POL’s responsibility to pull together. However, the Fujitsu elements
have been sent to POL (Cutover weekend elements to follow shortly). We await feedback
from POL.

Financial forecasts will be revised in line with the revised plan as it is built. These will
exceed the figures agreed during previous BAR which raises concerns over POL’s
Business Case.

Commercially, Fujitsu are only covered until the end of March 2010. CT required to
provide proper cover.

Need to initiate Phase 2 initial stages and provide indicative figures.
Huthwaite:- Need a circuit delivery date, approved CT, and orders placed for routers.
Need focus from key resources on POLSAP now as we are at a critical part of the project.

m Key Progress:

Fujitsu elements of the POLSAP re-plan have been sent to POL (with the exception of the
cutover weekend). Initial Cutover weekend planning session has been held.

Data Migration: All Test Data outstanding from CSC/Steria were received w/c 18 Jan and
load completed. This means the only outstanding items for test cycle 1 and 2 are CMS
data.

POLSAP Key Risks & Issues Summary

Key Risks

Premature closure of POLSAP due to business
case erosion (escalating costs). Action: Agree
revised plan and costs with POL and formalise
commercially.

Potential for Post-Go Live Operational Issues due
to concessions made with testing scope. Action:
Addendum added to CBBP. Consideration of
SAP ‘Early Watch’ is under way.

Potential for reputational damage to Fujitsu due to
POL’s view that Fujitsu should be taking the lead
role. Action: Fujitsu to ensure that the
appropriate stakeholders within POL are aware of
their role and obligations as the lead and
integrator for POLSAP.

Continued slippage to infrastructure components
of plan due to reliance on shared resource pool
with HNG-X. Action: Continue to review
opportunities to progress POLSAP alongside
wider programme schedule.

Lack of an installation date for the Huthwaite link
and getting the CT agreed are increasing the risk
that the expanded link will not be in place prior to
Go Live. Action: Continue to push for CT
approval & link installation date. Consider
approval of router procurement @ commercial
risk. Push C&W for an installation date. Update

Key Issues

Insufficient resource levels and focus being
placed on POLSAP for key areas at a critical
stage of the project. Action: Need more cover
in these areas. The project is working with
management to address these issues and
prioritise where required.

Customer is currently trying to shift blame to
Fujitsu for POLSAP slippages. Action: Project
to liaise with management and commercial to
ensure appropriate protection for Fujitsu’s
interests.

Continued slippage to plan due to lack of
delivery / missed milestones from POL and their
sub-contractors. Action: Agree revised plan
and costs with POL and formalise
commercially.

-POLSAP Help Needed FUJITSU

I Continuation of assistance with prioritisation of programme resources to enable
POLSAP to meet it’s objectives.

@ Assistance with stakeholder management at the senior management level within
POL so they understand the nature of the challenges we face, with particular
reference to POL’s role as integrator and for POL to manage their suppliers
(CSC/Steria) to deliver within time and quality constraints, something that they have
not managed successfully to date.

@ Establish full commercial cover for by gaining CT/CCN approval.

@ Huthwaite CT: Need a date from C&W for installation and also need to place the
routers on order ASAP.

™@ Need resource commitment / help in key areas to help the project’s chances for
success.
