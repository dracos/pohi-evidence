A/2 MATTERS ARISING FROM THE REPORTS
There were no matters arising.
AI3. REPORTS OF MEETINGS OF THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE

MR BURROWS, Chairman of the NC, referred to the minutes of the meetings of the
Negotiating Committee held on 6th July, 20th July, 24th August 1998 and 5th October 1998
which had been circulated.

1 POST OFFICE BOARD
4(a) ANNUAL REPORT - PO BD 01

‘The correspondence referred to conflicting information provided by POCL in their Report and
Accounts. The letter from Tim Brown, Head Office Financial Controller, put the record
straight and the information had been provided to members in the General Secretary's Notes
in the “Subpostmaster”. A meeting had taken place the Chairman of The Post Office and the
General Secretary on 17th August 1998.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY reported there had been no agenda for the informal
meeting scheduled for one hour. However, he had sketched out a number of
subjects that he had wanted to discuss:

Future of The Post Office What the Corporation was doing in
Future of Horizon allowing one Business to compete
Future of the Counters Business with another (raiding parties)

Size and shape of the Network Mailwork

It appeared the Chairman of The Post Office had structured the same agenda
without Mailwork or What the Corporation was doing to the competition within the
Business, but he had also included Security and Signage and Presentation.
Dr Neville Bain had been well briefed; it had been a good session as he had
displayed an understanding of the position of Sub-Postmasters. There had been
excellent discussion on all the subjects and a commitment to talk again when more
was known about the political scenario. THE GENERAL SECRETARY had asked
him how it felt to be the Chairman of the biggest retail network in the UK yet having
to say the Business could not afford to protect staff with proper security and he had
replied it did not feel good and the matter would be looked at.

MR BURROWS continued by drawing attention to the minutes and the report that
The Post Office Corporation was planning a significant upheaval of the Businesses
under the Corporate umbrella.

IN CONFIDENCE, THE GENERAL SECRETARY reported the discussions which
had centred on the subjects of:

1. Privatisation 3. Post Office Re-organisation
2. Honzon 4. Vision

In thanking the General Secretary for his explanation and efforts in ferreting out
information, MR BURROWS mentioned that it was right the senior representatives
of the Federation should be brought up to date with developments but reiterated

NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

2 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998
NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

that the information was confidential and should not be passed on. Post offices had
28 million people coming through their door each week and those customers had to
be retained. Sub-Postmasters’ investments must not be put at risk and, depending
on answers to question, the Federation would have to react.

2 GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS - PO PZ
2(a) GOVERNMENT REVIEW

zINDIVIDUAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
>THE MINIMUM WAGE - LOW PAY COMMISSION

There was nothing further to report on the Individual Savings Account, nor the Minimum
Wage and the Federation was walting to see the full impact the Minimum Wage would have
on the network.

= THE POST OFFICE INQUIRY - TRADE & INDUSTRY COMMITTEE

Regarding the Post Office Inquiry, the Federation was awaiting the results of the
deliberations of the various Departments in Government and particularly the Department of
Trade and Industry.

A number of leaks suggested, as in The Independent's article, that a 49% share sale option
was the one preferred by Government. This was only speculation. The Federation remained
close to the Department of Trade and Industry and would be in a position to meet with the
Ministers concerned as soon as an announcement was made.

It appeared, however, that the re-grading of Crown Offices which had been stopped because
of a moratorium applied by the DT! was now back on the agenda. Details were awaited of I
the decision of the Department of Trade and Industry on precisely what was in store for the !
Crown Office network and the NC would report to the Executive Council when there was a

broader knowledge on the subject.

3 POST OFFICE COUNTERS
3(a) POST OFFICE COUNTERS BOARD - PO PC 02

3(b) ORGANISATION DEVELOPMENT - PO PC 03

Because of the need to devote resources into the centre working on the various requirements
of the Government there had been a number of senior appointment changes which have
been the result of Newsbriefs. As could be seen from the circulation, Phil Smith had taken
over as temporary Regional Manager in the Midlands during John Main’s secondment, and
John Cooley temporarily appointed to cover for Paul Rayner as Regional General Manager in
SE Region, and Bert Bertoloni had been replaced by Alex Docherty, Although a number of
changes were titled “temporary” it was tradition in The Post Office for people not go back to
the job they vacated,

The major proposals for POCL were those set out In Newsbrief No, 37/98 concerning POCL's
Vision resulting from the work undertaken by McKinsey. Keith Hardie would give a
presentation of their Vision on Tuesday afternoon at 2 pm. However, some information could
be gleaned from various publications being put out by POCL. There would be organisation
development changes which will stem from Post Office Counters’ Vision and the changes
being planned by the Corporate Board,

6 HUMAN RESOURCES
6(a) TRAINING FOR SUBPOSTMASTERS - PC HR 04

Under this heading there were 2 specific subjects related to Sub-Postmasters’ training: the
Transactional Knowledge Review trial which was currently underway in the Midland Region,
and the trial in the South East of classroom style training. Insofar as the Transactional
Knowledge Review was concemed, a written report has been received from Pam Jervis and
circulated to the Executive Council for which Mrs Jervis was thanked. Mr Peberdy had also
provided a verbal report along similar lines. These 2 reports and the on-going experiences in
the Midland Region would be fed back to Post Office Counters when the trial was reviewed.

Correspondence of the 3 September from Kathryn Cook gave details of the current status of
the trial within the South East Region. She had indicated that a full range of data on which
the analysis of the trial would be made available to the Federation.

4 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING ~ OCTOBER 1998
NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

MR BURROWS advised the Executive Council that a quite separate form of training was
being introduced in North Thames & East Anglia Region which involved classroom-style
training but for a 4-week period. The NC was concermed that training seemed to be
becoming fragmented and variations Introduced on a Regional basis, It was the intention to
seek to clarify the current situation and policy of Post Office Counters towards training of
Sub-Postmasters in order that the Federation could ensure that Sub-Postmasters received
the proper training they required to meet their responsibilities.

it was reported by MR MARSHALL that in SWSW training events were called
“Awareness Events” to avoid paying Sub-Postmasters expenses - a letter had been
sent to Tim Thorpe. MR BURROWS agreed with taking the matter up in the Region
and asked to be made aware of the Region's reaction, ie, Tim Thorpe’s philosophy.
If there were problems in Regions they should be reported, He himself was aware
of one event billed as Transactional Knowledge which turned out to be Priority
Services training.

MR PEBERDY advised the Midland Region was paying for attendance as usual and
MR WILLSHAW undertook to report back on the subject for the South East.
MR BRADBROOK thought classroom style training was going well in the SE but it
was important that Sub-Postmasters attending had the right attitude.

The Federation wanted Sub-Postmasters well trained but, MR BURROWS
commented, training was an emotional subject. Under the old Transactional i
Knowledge training Sub-Postmasters and their staff should be paid but Sub- j
Postmasters often voluntarily attended Awareness events.

MR JANNETTA said although Sub-Postmasters in Scotland had been paid for
Transactional training on Priority Services, the training was one week after the I
service had been launched.

MR EDMONDSON advised of a lack of training in the NE, particularly the Newcastle
area of which THE GENERAL SECRETARY had already been advised.

8(b) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW_06 01

The result of the work being done by various Government Departments was awaited and it
was hoped that very shortly there would be a decision on Horizon enabling a positive
message to be communicated to the network.

The General Secretary and MR BURROWS had met with Bruce McNiven on 23 September
1998:to discuss the way in which the trial was going and what difficulties were ensuing as a
result. The notes of that meeting had been circulated on 28 September 1998 together with
the action points. It should be noted, however, that in Paragraph 10, the fifth bullet point
referred to a 3 fi restriction - this should read a 3 metre restriction.

Correspondence dated 18 September 1998 was confirmation that the current arrangements i
for paying Sub-Postmasters in the trial offices would continue. ;

The Federation continued to remain involved in all tiers of activity with Horizon from the {
Government through the whole area of the trial and installation. Details were awaited from
Post Office Counters on a package to assist Sub-Postmasters with any modifications
required in their offices. From the work done so far there was an attempt to establish if it was
possible to establish an amount per serving position which every office would be entitled to
expend on Horizon modifications. Over that, consideration would be given to whether and
how much a Sub-Postmaster might contribute for any significant modifications required,

As a late piece of news, THE GENERAL SECRETARY added a note of a verbal
agreement following negotiating involving Emillions which, he acknowledged, had
yet to be confirmed in writing. The majority of surveys involved shelving and
electricity work, the costs of which were being met. A minority required re-surveying
and additional work. Although POCL expected offices to be up to a basic standard,
if the survey identified additional modification costs, the Report Team would have
the authority to spend a further £1,000, for a 2-position office a further £1,500;
3-position £2,000; 4-position £2,500, on top of sums spent on shelving and
electricity work. If the work required was outside that, the Horizon Implementation
Manager had the authority to authorise further £1,000 for 1-position office; £2,500

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998 7

for 2-position; £3,000 for 3-position, etc, with £8,000 for 8-position office. If even
this was not enough, the National Implementation Team had further authority to
assist 1-position offices with £2,500; 2-position £3,500; 3-position £4,000; 4-position
£4,500 up to 8-position or more £8,500. And if that still was not enough there were
a number of options available. One option was for the post office to be closed and
re-established in larger premises close by - in which case the Sub-Postmaster would
be eligible for a payment for 26 months remuneration from the discretionary fund.
A second option was relocation with the expectancy that the Sub-Postmaster would
receive the maximum amount discussed to help him. A further thing that could
happen was that an additional spent could be authorised for a particular post office
and/or a Sub-Postmaster could apply for a grant in a newly formed safety
mechanism similar to ISIS.

MR CHALLINOR was pleased to see that the positioning of the back office printer
had been pursued as he did not think a location under the counter was good
because dust could cause it to clog up. He challenged the practice of putting the
main computer and printer on the opposite side.

MISS LINDON said she had agreed with POCL’s Horizon Manager to put an update
on the Horizon Programme in the journal! - one article was ready for the November
edition. Mark Kelly maintained that Sub-Postmasters were making modifications/
upgrading their offices after the first survey, which interfered with the plans. If Sub-
Postmasters were thinking of upgrading offices they should tell their RNM's before
the survey took place, she had been told,

MR MARSHALL mentioned that in SWSW 20 offices planned for inclusion in the
programme had been dropped because of refurbishment and 364 offices had been
surveyed using the incorrect measurement of 3 ft instead of 3 metres. Would
Horizon Implementation being going back to offices affected, he queried.

Returning to the question of who made the decisions, MR BURROWS advised a tier
was the POCL Support person in the Survey Team. If that was not satisfactory, it
was the Horizon Implementation Manager in the Region and, after that, it was a
national decision. {It would not be the local RNM. Regarding the 300+ offices in
SWSW surveyed using 3 ft for the cable length, there were difficulties, as with the
printer position attached to the main computer. The position next to the parcel
hatch was often the prime position and had been thought ideal because Sub-
Postmasters often did their accounting/writing work at the other/further end of the
counter in the afternoon.

The length of time taken to correct the 33m description had caused problems,
MR INGHAM added. He had been assured that the positioning of the printer under
the counter was only a trial and that people would be allowed to put the printer
where they wanted it. Although he was prepared to put up with difficult
circumstances for a short time, when he had said he wanted a long-term
arrangement, he had been told the kit had to fit and he was being awkward. Many
faced with the situation would sign, particularly when they were told, as he had
been, they might be dropped out of the system. Moreover, he had been prepared to
spend money to modify his office for Horizon but had not been able to get any
specifications.

8 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998
Operational aspects were being picked up With Bruce McNiven, THE GENERAL
SECRETARY confirmed. When details were in writing they would be communicated
quickly but there might be insufficient time to seek EC approval. Therefore, what he
sought was approval of the verbal form.

THE CHAIRMAN appreciated the need for expediency and asked the Council for it
approval of the adoption of the proposal.

e THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL APPROVED the proposal as outlined by the
General Secretary verbally.

8(c) AUTOMATED PAYMENT TERMINALS - PC NW 06 02

The Federation had been advised verbally that some 700 APTs have been delivered to
offices and of those 700 over 200 have been installed with a programme rolling out to install
the remainder. 76 APTs had been identified as having faults. These had now been checked,
repaired and would be rolling into the network. POCL's information was they were on time
with these APTs and a written definitive position was awaited.

Various faults with APT’s were advised by Executive Officers. MR CHALLINOR
advised of a Sub-Postmaster with 824 error notices because the nought on his APT
did not work and he did not have a barcode reader. The case had been reported to
the Region who had said no barcode reader was available, so it appeared no action
was being taken to remedy the fault and the Sub-Postmaster had no choice but to
process them via Pivot Code 18. MRS JENKINS advised of a similar situation
where the Sub-Postmaster had not been supplied with a barcode reader and, once
again, the Region said it was unable to provide one. That Sub-Postmaster was
doing in excess of 100 barcode transactions per week and having to key in was
entering transaction as Giros as having to key in the number would adversely affect
waiting times for serving. .

« Given the details of the cases, MR BURROWS confirmed action would be
taken; if APT’s needed repairing the work should be done.

B) Finance

(i) Treasurer's Report

MR EDMONDSON advised that the Federation's accounts for the quarter ended

dune 1998 showed the Federation was ticking over but losing money: a deficit i

running at £110,000 per year. The Chairman of the Federation Trustees would I

advise on the investment portfolio. The details contained within the accounts were i

comprehensive and if Officers had queries which Mr Bloor had not covered, he

would attempt to answer them. Since Annual Conference and the June EC, he had
t given attention to looking at where savings could be made and, at the end of the
: day, considered that meant looking at the Executive Council and Branches.

The Executive Council was the same size as when there had been 17,500
members, The membership figures were as follows: 1998 - 16,854, 1990 - 16,106,
1992 - 15,773, 1994 - 14,644, 1996 - 14,594, 1997 - 13,449, 1998 - 13,500,
If membership could be brought up by 1,000 there would be no need for discussion
but the Council had to face the fact that there was no magic wand and membership
was not going to shoot up and provide the money needed.

Prepared, he had a list of what reserves Branches were holding in balance. He
commented he had been surprised to see that as Bradford had some £6,000
someone doing a remarkable job. The figures showed that since 1993, apart from
1994, the amounts had risen each year and would rise again in 1998 - by some
£21,000 but there would be some contribution to the Benevolent Fund and
Centenary Fund, This meant that combined total figures held in balance by
Branches would be some £500,000.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998 23

The total Subscription Income paid to Branches was: 1993 - £245,738,
1994 - £235,763, 1995 - £253,493, 1996 - 237,793, 1997 - £274,360 and the
estimate for 1998 was £299,183.

From these figures he concluded that there were funds in the Federation and it was
up to the Council as to whether to draw any back. Meanwhile, he suggested that
the per capita should be reduced from 30% to 25%.

Looking at the Executive Council itself: there was currently one Officer per 1,000
members and he had considered 1:1200, 1:1400, 1:1600 and 1:1800. On 1:1800
there was no reduction in number of EO’s over the previous ratio,

He had circulated a letter to Executive Officers advising of the situation in order to
focus attention. He also confirmed what that letter had said, and which the General
Secretary would back it up, ie, that until he had sent the letter out no-one else had
seen it and it was the first time Colin Baker had seen it or anyone else at Federation
Headquarters at Shoreham. Since the previous Monday he had had positive
responses from Executive Officers and the one thing that had become clear was
that a majority had requested him to make some recommendations - which he had
previously been reluctant to do. Therefore, he had put his case to the Federation
Trustees who had back him up with a recommendation that the Federation should
look at one Executive Officer per 1400 members.

{n answer to a query which Mr Willshaw had raised regarding Resolution 99 of 1998
and the re-establishment of a London Region, when he had put forward the
recommendation/s he had not been aware of the meeting taking place in London
and in fact his letter was dated prior to the date of that meeting. He had since
asked Mr Darvill to convey that to Phil Gubbings because the last thing he wanted
was for those in London to think his letter was some sort of reaction to what they
wished.

The Trustees backed his recommendations. Anything put to the January Executive
Council Meeting would, if planned properly, have time to be put to Annual
Conference in May, for example, Rules changes, etc.

MR PEBERDY agreed something had to be done rapidly. He queried what impact
the savings, particular those relating to Executive Officers’ expenses, could have on
the Union Facilities payment received from the Post Office. in relation to the
recommendation of one EO per 1400 he perceived there were large areas of the
country, eg, Scotland, where it would be particularly difficult for just one EO to travel
around without a motorway network. Therefore, he thought a better situation would
be 2 Executive Officers to a Region. Perhaps one could try to get some money
back from Branches. He was concerned that the Federation should serve the
membership in the right manner in size, number, internal structure, Board of
Benevolence, etc - all of which carried some cost/s. It was for the Executive Council
to decide the on size and structure of its own committees.

As Chairman of the Trustees, MR ABERNETHY reported the Trustees had
deliberated long and hard about the matter because no one liked to be in a position
where money was flowing out without doing anything. More members were needed.
He had said in his report that he was willing to help any Region in any way possible.
He had been pleased to see so many wanna-be’s at the Sub Post Office Exhibition

wishing to become members. Until the membership did increase, he supported the
suggestion of 1:1400 members - otherwise the Federation was living far beyond its
means. Unless there was a new influx of cash, the Federation would have fo cut its
Suit according to the cloth. The Trustees had been unanimous.

Northern Ireland’s balance was currently £7,200, At the end of the day money held
by Branches was the Federation’s. The Federation was in a state and what was the
money laying there for anyway? That was one of the reason he supported dropping
the per capita to 25%. Conference would have to be shown that the Executive
Council was putting its own house in order too to make that easier fo swallow. He
fully supported what the Treasurer was doing; no treasurer liked to be in the position
in which Mr Edmondson found himself with more funds going out than coming in.

Turning to the amount held by Wey Valley Branch, MR WILLSHAW considered it
was because the Branch had collapsed resulting in money going in, without being
paid out. However, as the Branch was being reconstituted the position would
change and he wondered how they would feel if asked for the money back. When
he had first become an Executive Officer, some years previously, he had proposed
a motion on the size of the committees. Costs would be reduced if committees only
consisted of 3, instead of 5, members.

MR CYRIL JONES had seen the discussion on saving money as resting on pious
hopes of increasing membership. There had been some extremely hard work to
increase membership throughout the organisation but the results had been very
little. People were not dying to join, the rationale was against increasing the
membership. Personally, he would not like to be the only other Executive Officer in
his Region.. Any organisation which was looking at cutting, cutting, cutting was a
failing organisation. The services to members provided were costing money and the
Council was too frightened to go to members and say “we want more money”. The
Federation must say to members if you want all these things, you only have to pay
£7 for it. Membership was hardly £1.50 per week. Subscription to other
organisations, eg, newsagents federation, were more. The Federation was
spending money contributed years ago. He suggested putting the subscription up
by 25%,

MR BURFORD supported the Treasurer and Chairman of the Trustees and agreed
that some of what Mr Cyril Jones had said was true. The reality was the Federation
was bleeding to death. In the days when there had been 17,000 members,
Executive Officer representation was 1:1400, now it was 1:1000. Admittedly 1:1400
in Scotland would be difficult but his colleague and he would manage. Branch
Secretaries must be educated too. Referring to the reduction to 25% for Branches,
he recalled having been s/aughtered at Annual Conference when, as Treasurer, he
had made that proposal - but the climate was different now and Conference might
be more receptive. The point had been reached when there was little choice,

The Council had been talking about membership for 18 months, MR BUTLIN was
disappointed to relate, yet nothing had happened. A Recruitment Pack had been
wanted, trainers needed training, but again nothing had happened. Had the
membership been given what it wanted, he asked.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998

NFSP00000550

Looking at a membership increase of 2,000 (as 4,000 was impossible), there was
no financial (only statistical) benefit in increasing the number of community/rural
office members on the lower rate. During 1998 (for SWSW) there had been
26 transfers of which 15 went into multiples. MR BUTLIN had asked the Treasurer
for a list of funds of Branches. He thought Branches should be asked for 50% of
the money back - particularly when they were not using it. One recommendation
was to reduce Branch income and he wished good luck to whoever took that to
Conference.

The Federation re-organised every time around POCL boundaries but MR BUTLIN
asked rhetorically about Regions in, say, 3 years time - when there might be entirely
different structures/areas to cover. With regard to the number of EO’s per Region, if
there were one EO full time that would create no saving at all. There could be 2
EO’s per Region but he did not think that would be a guarantee of saving as their
costs would escalate to cover the territory. Similarly, although he had no objection
to 1:1400, but was not sure of any real long term saving. He had been
flabbergasted to learn it cost £5,000 per day for the Executive Council to meet and
queried whether that was value for the Federation. He could see no reason why the
Council should not meet for only 2 days which would save £5,000 per meeting,
£20,000 per year. Those were the things which could be done currently.

Regarding committee meetings, MR BUTLIN believed 3 members was too small to
work effectively. Committees did split to cover different topics, eg, as with different
aspects of Girobank and the LBU the NC split, and was doing its own housekeeping
by no longer having overnight meetings - officers catching the last transport home.

Being realistic, members always wanted more, but MR BUTLIN agreed
subscriptions needed to be increased or there could be a reduction in some of the
benefits, such as the Helpline. The organisation needed financial pruning but, when
pruning a tree, one did not start at the roots but by lopping back excess foliage. He
was not making any recommendations as he would like to hear other comments.

MR CHALLINOR agreed with Mr Cyril Jones that subscriptions should go up to
match the service members received. The Federation had one of the lowest
subscription rates in the country yet provided one of the best services. He wished
to see the presentation to be given by Paul Heasman following his research as
there was a bigger picture to the future of the Organisation, The Federation needed
a target. It did not have a plan either long-term or short-term to meet the obligations
of living within its finances. He had a mission of a business plan to contain budgets,
to estimate income and correctly budget and he floated that idea for future use.
The Federation should review consistently and constantly. Meanwhile, it should
have come as no surprise that the Federation found itself in the current straits.

Turing to per capita and a voluntary claw-back of Branch funds, MR CHALLINOR
wondered whether this would bring in money in real terms or just create bad feeling.
His own Branch had struggled for money in the past, convening meetings in village
halls. Admittedly a free dinner had been provided at a recent event and that was
totally wrong, but Shropshire was not alone in doing that; Chester Branch had
ordered 50 meals when only 9 people tumed up. Branches were provided with
money by the per capita facility when it could be based on a percentage for the
subscriptions for the Branches.

NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

26 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998
THE CHAIRMAN thought Paul Heasman's presentation should be taken as
something entirely on its own and not as impacting on the measures currently being
considered.

MR JANNETTA felt the debate stood in danger of throwing the baby out with the
bath water, ie, not focusing on the problem that the Federation was spending more
money than it was getting in and the prospects of future income were Irrelevant if
the current drain meant there might be no Federation in the future. With regard to
the suggestion of clawing money back from Branches as a one-off, it would be
difficult to do that without a package from the Executive Council. He could not see
that the membership numbers would go up as people were not interested in
organised labour. Even the Treasurer's current proposals could not be effective
until Conference 1999.

Referring to what Mr Burford had said about Conference’s previous rejection of the
reduction in per capita rate, MR EDMONDSON felt the climate was such that there
was more chance of acceptance, particularly if it could be demonstrated that the
economies were not hitting just Branches.

At the request of THE CHAIRMAN, THE GENERAL SECRETARY explained
Federation Rules relating to representation and said if a decline in EO numbers was
agreed (say, 1:1400), according to the current rules the number of EO’s would not
decrease until 2000, so there would need to be a rule change for it to be effective
immediately but the reduction in per capita to 25% could be brought into effect
immediately.

Then, MR JANNETTA added, he recommended those measures should be
undertaken as a saving now, together with a Business Plan.

MR WILLSHAW thanked Mr Edmondson for his good report. He believed
subscriptions should be looked at, 1 EO per 1400 members, 25% per capita, but he
did not agree with taking money back from Branches.

MISS LINDON saw that drastic action was needed, Certainly membership could not
easily be increased, There was money in the Branches which was the Federation's
but it would be difficult to ask for it back without a new package. She suggested a
system where Branches had enough working capital to run the Branch but not give
free dinners. People must realise the Federation was a working organisation.
Branch Secretaries should be educated - that had been talked about before but not
done. - Executive Officers were needed - also Branch Secretaries, who needed
proper laid-down training. POCL Regions constantly changed so the Federation
needed to decide how many EO's there should be throughout the country and then
decide which area/s each would cover bearing in mind there were difficult areas to
get around, eg, Scotland. If there were, for instance, 2 EO’s in Scotland and 1 in
the NWNW, why could not one of those in Scotland cover, say, Cumbria.
Suggestions could be radical but there was a need to look ahead. She thought a
Committee should be set up to put forward a long-term plan.

It seemed to MR BRADBROOK that the same people spoke at Annual Conference
every year with many other delegates making no contribution at all which meant it
was perhaps for them a glorified holiday. “No Conference, no Helpline”, he said,
Mr Bloor often knew more to answer problems; £47,500 for Conference -
(delegations should be 1:60, not 1:50 Branch members). increase subscriptions:

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998

NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

43,500 x £2 = £27,000 + £47,500 for Conference = £74,500 and the reduction 2 EO

= £94,500 + cut-out Keele = £100,000! He thought trying to take money back from

the Branches a dangerous route to pursue. Some Branches had been prudent: his .
own did not pay travelling or other expenses and found the cheapest venues.

London was sponsored as they had no funds. Some Branch Secretaries got £700,

he himself charged nothing in fees so the money went into Branch funds.

MR DARVILL considered a large proportion of a Branch's funds did come out of
payments made for Conference and there was too much money in some Branches .
Subscription increases had been looked at 12 months previously but discarded
because of the fight to increase membership. An awful lot of offices paid the
minimum rate of £24 so if a Branch picked up 30% in per capita, money was being
lost on small offices, Even the average of £24 and £84 paid by members, across
the country, was £60 so to then to give back 30% nearly took up that average. He
perceived that Sub-Postmasters’ aspirations had changed since he first became an
Executive Officer: although pay had increased, their disposable incomes had
lessened. Therefore, Branch Secretaries would not attend appeals/interview in
office hours because of that pressure and those imposed by POCL, ie QPA, etc, - (
although they were willing to attend meetings in the evening. On the other hand,
members sometimes thought Federation officials were full-time and at their beck
and call. Witness what was said at Conference citing the gravy train. Long-term
measures were needed which, he thought, meant pruning the roots rather than the
top of the tree. The Rules needed to be changed so action could be taken quickly.
It was a dangerous move to try to get money back from the Branches but that
money should not be used for social functions, (Some Branches had a dedicated
social fund, which was OK.) When Branches had been asked for money back
following the last re-organisation, many had not complied. if Executive Council
Officer numbers were cut back, that could mean more travelling expenses, etc.

MRS JENKINS believed the money was given to Branches to operate for the
Federation’s benefit. If a Branch had £16,500, she wondered what it was doing to

further that purpose. There should be no harm in asking for some of the money

back and, if one did not ask, one did not get. Could not a rule be brought in

proposing funding Branches to whatever capacity but, at the end of the financial

year, any funds in excess of a certain figure should be sent back to Federation
Headquarters. She herself recalled how amazed she had been about the amount (
of paperwork EO’s were given and, although it was necessary to see the papers,

she thought the cost of Executive Council meetings could be cut by having a more

structured agenda in 2 rather than 3 days.

MRS KENDALL saw that no immediate decision/s could be taken to solve the
problems and proposed an ad hoc committee to report back by January so that
recommendations could be put to Annual Conference in May. Mr Abernethy’s
efforts were exceptional and Northern Ireland had enrolled 20 more members but
how many Branches could say that every non-member had been visited, she
wondered, and how could there be a change of culture when people did not want to
join? If people did not believe in the Federation then the Federation should be
wound up, offices sold, an all go home! Branches Secretaries were not educated,
and not motivated. How many passed on Reasons to Urge interviews to EO's?
If Branch Secretaries were educated, EO’s would not have to travel so many miles.
During her presidency next year, she did not want to be President of the Titantic!

28 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998
NFSP00000550
NFSP00000550

If there was less stock on the shelves, people did not want to buy, so even less
stock was needed.

MR MARSHALL thought the Council did not have sufficient information. In his letter
the Treasurer had quoted a saving of £10,000 per Executive Officer but if one in a
Region was dispensed with there would be inroads into expenses of other/s.
Business Plans were needed for the short-term, medium-term and long-term;
explanations and explorations with proper facts and figures. The membership had
to be shown what was being done at Shoreham, by the Executive Council, etc.
Either subscription had to be increased or services had to go.

MR BUTLIN supported the suggestion put forward by Miss Lindon and proposed
Mrs Kendall for an ad hoc committee to discuss and made recommendations before
Christmas for the short and long-term finances of the Federation over the entire
spectrum. 5 people: possibly the General Secretary, Treasurer, Chairman of the
GPC and 2 others. This did not necessarily change what the Treasurer
recommended.

Both MR DARVILL and MR MARSHALL supported the proposal.

At the beginning of the debate, MRS JERVIS had written down: “We need to have a
rains-up on the Federation's Executive Council - do we spent our time efficiently?”
and she expressed concern about forming another committee. The P&D had been
charged with looking at the Purpose and Format of Executive Council Meetings, but i
nothing had happened. Committees sat, considered, made recommendations
which were put forward and then rejected by the Executive Council. She thought a j
better idea was for each EO to write down thoughts and send them to the President
to be collated and put to next Executive Council meeting. She was concemed that I
there was talk of quick fixes. Members, realising the Federation was in a mess, 1
wanted to be led by example.

MR BURROWS felt Officers ideas and thoughts had been expressed during the
debate. There needed to be an in-depth examination of the Federation, of
alternatives, to formulate policy, to report back to the January Executive Council
meeting, so that measures could be put into place by March in readiness for Annual
Conference 1999. There would never be concurrence in a group such as the
current one.

MR WILLSHAW was definitely against a sub committee. It should be a decision
made by the whole group, The sub committee would bring its recommendations
back and the debate would start all over again. He seconded a proposal of 1 EO to
1400 members.

MR CYRIL JONES did not think making policy on the hoof was to be recommended
as the repercussions of 1:1400 went through the organisation. An ad hoc
committee needed to be in a tight format. He thought it should consist of those
members with a head for figures and, at the end of the day, the Council should
accept what was recommended - otherwise the current debate would take place all
over again.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998 29

MR PEBERDY was not sure that 5 members was sufficient and advocated it should
be larger. Regarding Executive Officer representation, it was not clear how POCL
Regions/borders/organisations would be defined in the future. It had been said that
the funds in Branches belonged to the Federation; strictly speaking they belonged
to the members as it was they who had given the money - which the Federation had
then put back into the Branches for the benefit of the membership.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY listed 3 suggestions as having been raised: (i) ad
hoc committee to consist of 7 people, (ji) 1 EO per 1400 members, (iii) reduction in
per capita from 30% to 25%.

MR BUTLIN did not believe that he had specified the number of people on the
committee should be 7, and commented the Council had spent £1,500 that morning
in discussing the subject.

THE CHAIRMAN quoted the proposal as being that “An ad hoc committee be
appointed to discuss and make recommendation for the short and long term
finances of the Federation” - to consist of 7 members.

MR EDMONDSON in referring to what had been said, and in relation to a Business
Plan, pointed out that the Federation’s income was largely dependent upon
membership, the next traunch normally coming from the Post Office in the form of
Union Facilities and he had awaited that information before writing his letter.
Expenditure was exceeding income, There had been some goods ideas but the
crux was that decisions, to bring in income or save income, would affect the
federation and the right message must be sent out. Following on to what he had
said at Conference, the figures which he had produced had been researched. The
Federation knew what it spent, there was a surfeit of information. He was sorry to
say he perceived a shirking of the issue. True, it was not known how/what the
Regions would be in the future but the Federation had to act on what it knew now.
Although it would have been beneficial to have put subscriptions up, that had not
been advisable last year because of the membership crisis. Some Branches might
give some money back voluntarily, others would not and if forced to do so would
spend it! Some Branches did give free meals but were probably doing so to draw
people in. He had drew Officers attention to questions/alternatives at the last 2
meetings, for instance, the Federation Helpline which members had wanted but was
it being used wisely. If the Council was throwing everything back into an ad hoc
committee, it was sending out the wrong signals. It should be sending out the
message that the Federation was taking action.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY understood Mr Edmondson's dilemma but pointed
out that having an ad hoc committee did not conflict with the 1 per 1400 proposal.

e THE CHAIRMAN took a vote on the proposal THAT an ad hoc
committee be appointed to discuss and make recommendations on
the short term and long term structure and finances of the Federation
and make proposals which was ACCEPTED (10 for and 7 against).

MR EDMONDSON put forward his proposal to include 1 EO per 1400 members and
a reduction in per capita to Branches from 30% to 25%, which was seconded,

MR BURFORD could see no harm in giving the ad hoc committee. a steer and felt
the Treasurer should have the Council’s support as it seemed there was some
reluctance to grasp the nettle. MR CYRIL JONES advocated not limiting the ad hoc
committee before its deliberations and MR BUTLIN, whilst agreeing the Treasurer
should be supported, could not see it was necessary to bind the committee by
making an immediate decision, MR JANNETTA backed the Treasurer's proposal as
otherwise he felt the committee might run all over the place.

The proposal was put to the Council by THE CHAIRMAN and lost.

« There was then a discussion of the constituents of the Ad Hoc Committee in
which it emerged that it should consist of 7 Executive Officers, decide its own
terms of reference, and report in writing in good time for the January 1999
Executive Council Meeting. Following a ballot vote, held later in the
meeting, the following were elected as members: Mr Abernethy,

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1998 37

Federation Helpline

MR MORGAN JONES drew to the Executive Council's attention circulation’s they had
received of financial details of two organisations’ proposals. The continuation of the current
system with Peter Abraham and IRPC, and secondly the one from Membership Services
Direct. The latter was marginally cheaper but it had been decided to recommend continuing
with the current arrangement because it was known. It was felt that Peter Abraham provided
added value by visiting branches, conference and the exhibition, and the relationship between
his organisation and the Federation produced an income which reduced the difference in the
two quotes to a nominal level. !f the numbers of members opting for the Contract of
Employment service continued to rise, then the income that produced could ultimately make
the overall relationship with Peter Abraham cheaper than it would be with Management
Services Direct.

The third option would be to cancel the helpline altogether. However, it was THE
COMMITTEE's view that the numbers using it were continuing to rise and it was increasingly
seen by members, whether they used it or not, as a valuable benefit of membership. THE
COMMITTEE therefore considered it would be unwise to cancel it.

Bearing in mind the Federation's current financial situation MR BRADBROOK wondered
whether the helpline should be cancelled and the calls be dealt with by Philip Bloor at
Shoreham. MR EDMONDSON asked for a break down of the types of calls that Peter
Abraham received. How many were there about The Post Office, Tax, and Insurance, and
what proportion did he refer to RPC?

MR HEASMAN reported that approximately two thirds of all calls were dealt with by
Peter Abraham because they fell within his personal experience about contracts of
employment and employment law. The remainder were referred to IRPC and
covered most other areas. A detailed analysis could be obtained if necessary, as
Peter Abraham recorded all the calls. He advised that the possibility of Philip Bloor
handling the queries regarding tax and other areas within his responsibilities had
been investigated but the percentage of these types of enquiries were minimal and
therefore any saving made would be minimal. He reminded the Executive Council
that they were receiving a service that operated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,

which, of course, Philip Bloor could not provide. It would also be impossible for
Shoreham to cope with the 4,000 calls it was anticipated would be received should
the whole helpline operation be transferred to Shoreham.

MR BUTLIN was happy to accept that The Committee had checked the market and
recommended what they considered to be the best option, Peter Abraham had saved
him and other sub postmasters thousands of pounds.

¢ He therefore proposed that his offer be accepted for a further year. This
was seconded and CARRIED.

MR MORGAN JONES urged the Executive Council, when attending branch meetings
or any other, to stress to people that every sub postmaster who employed staff must
provide them with a Contract of Employment. The majority of people were not aware
that they could be prosecuted if they didn’t comply to this legislation.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY reported that Peter Abraham wanted the Federation to
put their brand on two contracts for holiday reliefs:

1. To cover cases where a holiday relief didn't turn up. At present nothing could
be done about this as reliefs were only on a verbal contract. Once produced
the contracts could be held at Shoreham and provided to members as part of
the Membership Services package.

2. — The introduction of a contract whereby an individual assistant could be held
personally responsible for shortages in the till.

« MR MORGAN JONES advised that these could be agreed and offered as a
Federation Service.
