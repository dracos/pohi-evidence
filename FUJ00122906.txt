Further to my statement of 9th March 2010 | would like to add the following. “

Pathway Ltd, since 1996 as a Customer Solutions architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon. This is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

Fujitsu have a Security Department which is responsible for providing audit data to the Post
Office Limited’s Fraud Team.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to
archive media. This creates a record of all completed outlet transaction details including its
origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
TMS journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all completed transaction records that occurred in every Outlet.. They
therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded
in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. Records of all transactions are

written to audit archive media.

With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which data is audited has always worked on the
principle that it is acceptable to audit the same data more than once — in particular if in doubt
as to whether or not it has been previously audited successfully. The Mechanism used on
Horizon to retrieve the audit data took this into account and only presented one instance of
such duplicate data in the ARQ extracts. The Audit Mechanism cannot alter the base
information and therefore.a re-running of the audit process will always produce the same

result.

In January 2010 a new HNG-X application was introduced to filter transaction records for
presentation to Post Office Limited. It has recently been noticed that this HNG-X retrieval
mechanism does not remove such duplicates. An enhancement to the extraction toolset will
be developed, tested and deployed and will remove such duplicate data in the future. However
until this enhancement is deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated. The reliable
way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used to generate
the unique sequence numbers. This will be included in all future transaction record returns
until the retrieval mechanism is enhanced. A semi-automated process to copy the returned
data, and then to identify and remove any duplicated records which may. be present from this
copy by using the <NUM> attribute, has been agreed with Post Office Limited for use in the

interim period. |

A transaction log data disc has been produced as exhibit PT/02 in the trial of Seema
Misra. The transaction log data disc is made up of ARQ’s 436 to 448. It should be noted |
that ARQ 447 which records the transactions between 1st November 2007 to 30th
November 2007 does contain some duplications of audited records.

It is emphasised that the duplication of audited records has not, in any way, affected actual

physical transactions recorded on any counter at any outlet. The duplication of records has

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
