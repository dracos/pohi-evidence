Hi Sally

Thanks for raising this matter with us. An investigation has taken place with Julie Welsh, our contact
at Fujitsu, and she accepts that the PM did call the Helpdesk to state that transactions were
appearing on the sales stack, but kit was swapped out and the problem did not reoccur. As no further
problems were reported, she thought that was the end of the matter.

As the losses occurred back in January, information relating to this branch has now been archived,
but your concerns have today been raised with the Problem Management Team who have more
experience in dealing with phantom transactions. 1 am unsure which member of the team will be
assigned to the case, but if you have any further queries, the Line Manager for the team is Andy
Winn. The code to quote for any queries regarding this is: P10001091.

Sorry the Customer Relations Team cannot be of more help on this occasion, but I am sure Andy and
his team will do their best to resolve this.

Kind Regards
Terry Rudd

Are you able to help me with this office or let me know who can help

The office had a major software problem back in week 41 (January 2003). After numerous phone
calls to NBSC and engineer visits to change cables, monitor etc, a software problem was identified
and the processor changed. Apparently the screen would take on a mind of its own, jump screens,
add items to the sales stack etc. The office balanced £422.74 short that week, which is very unusual
for the office - they are normally within £20 each week.

The subpostmistress has waited for an error notice to come back, nothing has been received yet and
'have checked with Chesterfield several times - nothing so far. I have also checked the paperwork in
the office for week 41, along with week 40 and week 42 and I can't find anything. Is there anything
you can do at Deame Valley to have that weeks work checked on the system to see if this has been
caused by a systems fault. The only other thing I can think of is that if the system was going daft and
putting things onto the sales stack, this wasn't picked up everytime by the person serving and one or
more customers have been given money they were not entitled to and have just kept it.

can you let me know if you can help please.
thanks
