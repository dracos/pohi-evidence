fe Post Office first cut for James R

ubject:
Hi there

Just picking up for James as he is out the office today. Some initial thoughts from me — afraid I can’t comment on
policy but I’ve made some suggestions in terms of layout etc.

It’s probably easier to send up what we need in 3 separate docs so the page numbering is clear. So....
One doc with the cover and contents page (no need for page numbers)

One doc with the speech (pg numers x of x) — this means Margot can pull the pages out etc without them getting
swept up into the pack

One separate doc with the briefing etc starting from page 1

Michael — we had a quick chat about the speech. I think it’s best on second thoughts to just remove the ‘if raised’ bits
given this makes up her full speech. Margot is quite good at sifting out bits of the speech (and adding bits in if
needed) that don’t appear to be relevant after hearing everyone speak and it’s something that James can flag to her if
needed. I’Il also touch base with the MP’s office to see if they are happy to share pointers or a copy of their speech.

Josh — copying you in, in case there’s anything you want to feed in on the comms side.

Do you know who will be accompanying James in the box on the day? Appreciate that’s a way away and it may
already have been sorted but I’Il push along as much as I can in his absence.

Many thanks,
Claire
