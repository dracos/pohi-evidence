this. If, on the 8th of May at 15:39 you conducted that transaction-,

(TC: 00:11:59)
M: Yeah.

(TC: 00:12:00)
Moderator: By telephone, right?

(TC: 00:12:02)
M: No, he asked me (inaudible 12.03) phone up, ' How much is €36,000 gonna cost me?’

(TC: 00:12:06)
Moderator: Yeah, that's what I mean.

(TC: 00:12:06)
M: Yeah, okay.

(TC: 00:12:07)
Moderator: He rang you on the Thursday, sorry, on Wednesday the 8th.

(TC: 00:12:09)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:12:10)
Moderator: Said, 'How much, Carl, €36,000?' You put it in to-, tapped it into the machine, right?

(TC: 00:12:13)

(TC: 00:12:15)
M: Yeah.

(TC: 00:12:16)

(TC: 00:12:19)
M: Yeah, he usually comes in the morning, yeah.

(TC: 00:12:20)
Moderator: Okay. Why didn't you reverse it then, straight after that?

(TC: 00:12:25)
M: I may have been answering the phone. I might have been serving. I might have been balancing some
other till. I mean, it's a busy office, isn't it?

(TC: 00:12:31)

Moderator: Right, yeah, but I mean, how long does it take to do a reversal at, err, straight after
that? I mean, presumably you would have just put the telephone down because he didn't wanna go
head with the transaction, so-,

(TC: 00:12:41)
M: What do you mean (inaudible 12.42) with the transaction? He might have said, 'I'll you tomorrow,
Carl.’

(TC: 00:12:44)
Moderator: Sorry?

(TC: 00:12:48)
Moderator: Right, but if, if he-, if he said, 'I'll see you tomorrow, to do that transaction,’ wouldn't
you still reverse that out, because he hasn't bought it on the 8th, has he?

(TC: 00:12:57)
M: Yeah, but I reversed it out before he came in in the morning, before I balanced the till.

(TC: 00:13:00)
Moderator: Right.

(TC: 00:13:01)

M: So, there's no difference between that timing, as long as you balance-, I mean, let's put it this way,
what happens if, um, I put, um, four savings stamps in on the till and somebody's only-, I've only sold
two, and I think, 'I' ve got to reverse that, I' ve got to reverse that,’ and before you balance the end of the
week, or that night, or whatever, you reverse the two stamps.

(TC: 00:13:18)
Moderator: But, but that's why I'm asking. Why didn't you reverse it straight after?

(TC: 00:13:21)
M: As I just said to you, you might have forgot, or whatever. I might have forgot all about it, and you
come to the next morning, you balance off and you find out you're 21,000 short. The amount of times
you' ve gone through your tills, or whatever, you think to yourself, 'I reversed a cheque from there,’ or
whatever, like that, it! s-, you know that as well as I do.

(TC: 00:13:37)
Moderator: Okay.

(TC: 00:13:38)
M: It's standard practice in the Post Office.

(TC: 00:13:39)
Moderator: Yeah, that's fine. Let's move on to a little bit further along, err, on the 9th of May,
then. Now at, um, now at 10:17 hours on the 9th of May, okay?

(TC: 00:14:00)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:14:01)

Moderator: So, I, I assume then, um, and correct me if I'm wrong, I assume he came in at 09:07
hours, bought 36,000 euros, went away, and he came back at 10:17, so within 50 (ph 14.16) minutes
and bought another 80,000?

M: You're asking me to remember one certain transaction, aren't you?

(TC: 00:14:28)
Moderator: No, what I'm suggesting, I'm saying that that's how the till roll works.

Moderator: It's all a continuous sheet of paper, isn't it?

(TC: 00:21:22)
M: That's correct, yes.

(TC: 00:21:23)

transaction no longer exists in the previous cash account, does it?

(TC: 00:21:32)
M: No,it wouldn't.

(TC: 00:21:32)

(TC: 00:21:40)
M: Yes, but why would (talking over each other 21.41).

(TC: 00:21:41)

Now, I'm not a businessman, Carl, right, but that, to me, doesn't make sense. Your argument is
that, 'I'm turning over vast amounts of money for I therefore making a bigger profit
for the Post Office.' Well, clearly you're not. .

(TC: 00:39:04)

M: Mr Page has already answered the question. He's told you in terms, in previous interviews and during
this interview why those transactions have been undertaken and you' re just conjecturing and seeking to
use another example that doesn't actually amount to a question. Ask him a proper question, please.

(TC: 00:39:27)
Moderator: I thought I had.

(TC: 00:39:29)
M: Well, Mr Page has already answered the question in previous interviews and in this interview.

(TC: 00:39:33)
Moderator: Okay. Let's move onto Saturday 10th of August, then.

(TC: 00:39:45)
M: Could I ask a question? Are you going to go through saying this is how much I' ve lost the Post
Office-,

(TC: 00:39:48)
Moderator: I'm picking some examples out, yes. Yeah. Is that a problem?

(TC: 00:39:52)
M: No. [haven't got a problem with that, no.

(TC: 00:39:54)
Moderator: Okay. Um. Saturday the 10th of August. Um. We start with (TC 00:40:00) the transfer
in on the 9th of August, okay, at 08:58am hours. You transfer in €85,000.

(TC: 00:40:11)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:40:12)
Moderator: Okay? At 1.6685, which gives a sterling value of £50,943.96.

(TC: 00:40:19)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:40:20)
Moderator: Oka:
presumably with

it. Then, on the 10th of August, right, a day later, at 09:36am, you sell,
GRO __ I €80,000 at 1.67.

(TC: 00:40:35)
M: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:40:36)
Moderator: Yeah? And the sterling value is £47,904.19. If you flick that over you'll probably get to
the 8th of August. Is it there? There it is. Okay? Here. Now, having a look at those two figures,
right, and again, they're different-, sorry. They're exactly the same amounts this time, €80,000
(talking over each other 40.58).

(TC: 00:40:57)
M: Does that €80,000 correspond to that transfer, or is it £80,000 from earlier on?

(TC: 00:41:03)
Moderator: Sorry? How do you mean?

(TC: 00:41:05)

M: Does that €80,000 there-, I mean, what you' re going to say is that,’ You bought in at that, Mr Page (ph
41.09), but you sold it at that,’ but how do you-, that €80,000 might correspond to something earlier. It
might be 1.674 or .679 or something else like that.

(TC: 00:41:19)
Moderator: Well-,

(TC: 00:41:18)
M: And I might have sold €80,000 (inaudible 41.21) at 1.66.

(TC: 00:41:23)
Moderator: No. Well, I've gone through the till rolls. What I've been doing is extracting when you
transfer something in, right, and the next time you do a transaction, which is that.

(TC: 00:41:31)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:41:31)
Moderator: So from when you transferred it in at 8:58am on the 9th, there wasn't any more
transfers in.

(TC: 00:41:37)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:41:38)
Moderator: And there isn't any other transfer (talking over each other 41.39).

(TC: 00:41:39)
M: How much stock did I have in from previous, from the previous week or anything?

(TC: 00:41:43)
Moderator: That I don't know.

(TC: 00:41:45)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:41:46)
Moderator: No, but-,

(TC: 00:41:46)
M: So that could've been from the previous week, couldn't it?

(TC: 00:41:49)
Moderator: I don't know. I don't follow. How could it have been previous? But it doesn't matter,
does it, because here on the 9th you're transferring-, see, you said before to us, right, you get in

(TC: 00:42:01)
M: Yeah.

(TC: 00:42:01)
Moderator: So-,

(TC: 00:42:01)
M: But in August you get a lot of-, I would get-, keep getting a lot of euros in over August because of the
holidays.

(TC: 00:42:08)
Moderator: Right, but you, you ordered these euros specifically for him, and (talking over each
other 42.12).

(TC: 00:42:13)
M: Yeah. Okay. The majority of it for him, yes.

(TC: 00:42:15)
Moderator: Right.

(TC: 00:42:16)

M: But what I'm trying to say is that you saying, ' There's €80,000 there you' ve sold at 1.67.’ If I made a
mistake, I made a mistake, but that 1.67, it might have been 1.68 for something earlier in the week or
previous week. You' re trying to point out that I'm giving the euros away at a loss.

(TC: 00:42:34)
Moderator: Yeah.

(TC: 00:42:35)
M: What I'm trying to say is that maybe that €80,000 might correspond to euros I transferred on a
Monday (ph 42.40) before that.

(TC: 00:42:42)
Moderator: But, but why should those come into the equation? So, you're saying they could have
been euros transferred in on the 8th of August, right.

(TC: 00:42:50)
M: Maybe, yeah.

(TC: 00:42:51)
Moderator: But why do they come into the equation for this?

(TC: 00:42:53)
M: Because they're still trying to-,

(TC: 00:42:55)
Moderator: That's two days later, and you, in the meantime, you had a transfer in on the 9th for
€85,000.

(TC: 00:43:01)
M: (Talking over each other 43.02) have €80,000 in stock and I bought at 1.67, and because I wanted to
still make a profit for the Post Office I' ve only sold (ph 43.08) at 1.67.

(TC: 00:43:09)

Moderator: Well, I mean, just demonstrating that very briefly before this tape runs out, um, that
€85,000 transferred in, but if we equate that to €80,000 transferred in, right, the sterling value
would have been £47,947.26. You sell for £47,904.19, which gives us a difference of £43.07, and as
before, you would only need to sell €700 to make £44.44,

(TC: 00:43:37)
M: Okay.

(TC: 00:43:38)
Moderator: So that's €80,000, and you made £43 on it.

(TC: 00:43:42)
M: So the Post Office have only made £44 out of it?

(TC: 00:43:44)
Moderator: They haven't, in fact, because as I said to you, that by the time you work out overheads
and all the other bits and pieces-,

(TC: 00:43:48)
M: So the Post Office, you said to me the Post Office-, say, I bought-, I transferred in all that (ph 43.52)
at 1.6685, that's the rate the Post Office buy it in at?

(TC: 00:43:56)
Moderator: Yeah.

(TC: 00:43:56)
M: That's what you said.

(TC: 00:43:57)
Moderator: Yeah.

(TC: 00:43:58)
M: Okay

(TC: 00:44:00)
Moderator: Err, this tape's surely gonna run out, so can I just ask you again, Carl, to sign that
tape serial number on the top for us, please? Um, 05803. Thank you, and Patrick. Thank you.

(TC: 00:44:12)
F: Thank you.

(TC: 00:44:17)
Moderator: Okay, and the time now, then, being 17:15pm hours. I'm suspending this tape. Cheers.
