SECRETARY OF STATE’S VISIT TO JAPAN 13-16 JUNE: MEETING

WITH FUJITSU

I sent to you earlier today speaking notes and background briefing on project
Horizon for the Secretary of State’s meeting with Mr Akikusa, President of Fujitsu
and Mr Naruto, Vice Chairman of Fujitsu and Chairman of ICL on 13 June at 1800

As discussed, Alastair Macdonald has asked that I add some further points to the
speaking notes incorporating supportive words given the difficulties which have
been experienced by Fujitsu over the Horizon issue. He also asked that the steering
brief highlights why it would be politic for the Secretary of State to make clear his
recognition of the efforts of ICL’s friends within Fujitsu.

A note for the cover brief, and revised speaking notes along with the original

background briefing are attached .
