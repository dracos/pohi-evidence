Steve I have copied you into this e-mail to POL because it may be that you might have to do a repeat
performance tomorrow once the FAD codes have been identified and the name of the branches revealed.
Incidentally can you identify branches from FAD codes? as if so this might give you a head start.

Stephen and Richard our legal team at the Court will be doing their best to persuade the Court not to allow
Castleton to call this evidence because it is filed late and does not relate to the problems at his branch office. If
they are successful there will be no need to progress any further with these investigations but as Castleton is a
litigant in person it is common for Judges to be sympathetic and may allow him to rely on his evidence. If so you
will have to pull out all the stops to investigate what if anything went wrong at these branches and why we can
distinguish them from Mr Castleton at Marine Drive.

Regards

Lynne further to our chat can you advise what are the names of the postmasters and addresses of the branches if
possible of the following FAD Codes.

442614, 152508, 059025, 132941

In Feb of this year you wrote to Gary Blackburn and he wrote to Shaun Turner and then Sandra MacKay about
these branches which had apparently registered complaints about the HORIZON system. Fujitsu have told us that
in respect of Callendar squarethat there was a problem when stock was transferred from one stock unit to another
but this would only apply when there was more than one stock unit,iemore than one position at the counter.

Did any of you find out what the problems were at the other branches and what did POL and Fujitsu do to correct
them.

Regards

Mandy Talbot
