CASES FOR DISCUSSION AT F2F

17 OCTOBER 2014

A. Scene Setter and Objectives

This discussion has the potential to be fraught. Not only we will be voting against mediation in all but
one case (and only then if pushed), but a majority also involve criminal convictions and/or cautions

However, the meeting does provide the opportunity to communicate some important messages the
Working Group as a whole and to its constituent parts. The hope, no matter how forlorn, is that we

begin to address some of the major challenges we face in operating the Scheme successfully and
fairly, for Applicants and for Post Office. While the Working Group’s proceedings are confidential, we
know that information finds its way to third parties.

Those issues are, together with a speaking note on each, appear below:

PO approach to Criminal Cases!

¢ Aware that PO decisions in criminal cases have been source of discussion

© Once again remind WG that, once its decision is made, it has no further role in the process —
the parties are free to decide what to do next

* PO decisions not taken lightly — we have re-investigated cases thoroughly and had the
benefit of SS’ own independent review — in cases so far, nothing has emerged which is
capable of questioning the safety of the convictions

* Each and every case will benefit from these additional and thorough investigations

¢ PO already under a duty to disclose any matters which come to its attention which could cast
doubt on the safety of a conviction

* Said at the outset, and say again, that the Scheme is not an appropriate platform from which
to challenge a conviction — that properly with the Courts

* POLnever filtered cases entering the Scheme by pre-guessing which cases merited
mediation. All Applicants were given a fair chance to prove that their complaint had merit

e If acase merited mediation (ie. there were questions around the safety of a conviction) then
a case may be mediated. However, no case so far has presented these circumstances

e JFSA have been clear about the limitations of the Scheme (reference their communication to
Applicants below) and we would ask that the WG as a whole also register this

False accounting

e In those criminal cases with false accounting, POL considers the critical factor is the existence

of false accounting in a branch not the existence of a conviction:

¢ False accounting makes determining the underlying error that caused a loss almost
impossible

© Indeed, false accounting makes correcting errors in branch much more difficult which causes
losses to be incurred that might otherwise have been avoided. False accounting is therefore
an operative reason for why losses occur in a branch

* The Scheme is about Horizon not criminal cases. The fact there has been false accounting
makes the Applicant's task of showing that Horizon is defective impossible because the
branch accounts have been corrupted by the false accounting

* In conclusion, where there is established false accounting, it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to have a constructive conversation at mediation that will lead to a resolution or
closure for an Applicant

Default Recommendation to Mediate

e Anumber of cases have come through in which SS recommend mediation despite the weight
of evidence pointing, on any reasonable consideration, to the conclusion that the Applicant
was responsible for the losses

* While we do still see the potential value in allowing some of these applicants to voice their
concerns and benefit from a conversation, it cannot always be sensible to do so in the
context of a mediation

¢ The difficulty for PO is that, the near-default recommendation to mediate from SS places it in
the invidious position of appearing to say ‘no’ at each turn when, plainly, a number of these
simply do not identify issues which can sensibly be the subject of mediation
POL00211024
POL00211024

© Subject to the facts of each case, Post Office is well-disposed to mediation but it is not
reasonable to expect it to accept responsibility for matters where there is no evidence to
support such a finding

B. Headline Position on Cases

There are a total of 10 cases for discussion, 6 of which are criminal cases. One further case (M021) is
inextricably linked to a criminal case (M003) and legal advice is to refuse mediation in this case too.

Of the remainder, PO considers that all of them are unsuitable for mediation but is prepared to

accept mediation in! , we do not consider this suitable for mediation on
Second Sight’s reasoning but we would mediate this as a means of avoiding debt recovery
proceedings against the Applicant. This is one of those cases in which the Applicant might have been
better off remaining outside of the Scheme. We should register a general reservation about the
likelihood of success in j"™if we eventually accept mediation.

Second Sight recommend all cases for mediation, save for one (M017), in which they changed their
recommendation following our response to the draft CRR.
