Hannah,

I am not aware of any formal statement having been made on this specific matter but if one is needed then I can get
Legal to craft one — with my help. We did recently explain the matter of gaps in the Audit Archives in a formal
communication to POL and it was mentioned implicitly in that response. We still await POL’s response to that comms.

It is true that the Audit Archive stores in our 2 DCs for the Horizon time period (2007-2010) are different so for this
specific point, IRE11 and IRE19 are not mirrored. However, we are currently only aware of one difference in the 2
Audit Archive stores and we have copied that specific data from IRE19 to IRE11. Therefore, based on what we know
today, there is a full Audit Archive copy in both DCs but in subtly different formats.

l asked Ed/Gerald to give me a VROM to create a true and full mirror and it looks like we could be looking at a piece of
work spanning 4 months (including procurement, provisioning, testing, copying) as we will need new hardware**. I do
not know when the AWS $3 work is due to start and finish but it would seem likely that the AWS S3 work will need to
take the Audit Archive for 2007-2010 from both DCs to ensure it has all data. In so doing, it would become pointless to
mirror the 2 DCs for this Audit Archive content.

I would prefer that this information was not just sent to POL but handled carefully to avoid unnecessary concern. I do
believe that POL know this so it will not be news. I would just advise that we avoid making written or attributable
statements without prior approval so we do not send incomplete or inconsistent messages.

** this makes our response to the extending of the audit archive CWO very challenging too which I am sure is being
handled by the relevant PM.

Hi Both,

The below came up on a call with POL yesterday and there was an ask whether or not we have issued a problem
statement to note the fact our DCs do not hold identical data, as was initially assumed? This will likely impact how we
respond to the Tactical Audit CWO, and POL have asked our PM to raise as a project risk...

Kind Regards,
Hannah

Hi,

It's a bit complicated at the moment. Gerald and I have a request from Steve Browell around remediation of the Audit
Gaps, and one possible solution is to run a retrieval on ARC201 for all "Bootle only" tracks (mainly correspondence
servers, i.e Riposte) and robocopy them to ARC202 which will result in them being stored in the 19PROD CSHE, and in
parallel running a retrieval on ARC202 for all "Wigan only" tracks (ditto) and robocopy them to ARC201 for storage in
the 11PROD CSHE.

This is obviously less than doubling the storage used as we're only considering October 2007 to September 2010
(approx), but we do not have an accurate estimate of the requirement.

The Audit Tactical project is also looking to make a copy of the data in AWS S3 CDE at some stage. Ideally this would
sooner rather than later.

We are well past CSHE EOSL (31-DEC-2020) and I don't think we can offer any guarantees on the reliability of the CSHE
beyond end March 2022, so really I think we should be turning down this request and asking POL to accelerate the

Audit Tactical programme, at least the initial part of it which adds the $3 storage as additional data stores for Belfast
ARC201 and ARC202 and initiates the (well known) process of copying the CSHE data to the new stores.

Regards

Ed

Well as long as Unix prepare their pre-impacts for the Eternuses it may be OK.

Hi,
FUJ00176531
FUJ00176531

I do not think this was pre-impacted before.

As I wrote there is little issue with the audit configuration file but there may be an issue with disk space on
the Eternuses. This needs to be properly considered by the Unix team.

Thanks Gerald
Can I ask Sunil to act as solution owner for the CP, and support James Guy in prepping it.
@Barnes, Gerald — what was the previous CP for this the last time?

It was possibly a pre-impacted CP to which we can refer

Hi Steve,

This is a very easy thing from an audit perspective. It is just increasing by another year (in hours) the
FUJ00176531
FUJ00176531

NumExtraHoursToKeeptTracks in the EternusPurger.config file.

However you also need to run it past the Unix team (Ed Ashford is most knowledgeable) to confirm that the
Eternuses on which the files are stored has the capacity to store another year of data. This bit is totally outside of my
control.

So my bit is very easy (deliver a new EternusPurger.config) but Ed’s may not be.
Regards,

Gerald Barnes

Can you please confirm that an extension to the prevention of Audit Archive deletion, 30 April 2023, would still
be within your remit.

Perhaps you could brief Sunil on what needs to be done here, to support a CP (James Guy is the PM),
and what would need to be done to implement.

Steve
