Assessment of Current Help Arrangements

ICL PATHWAY

*. Pathway are capable of delivering against current demand profiles

+ No assessment has been made on the impact of differing demand profiles
POCL REGIONAL HELPLINES

* Noclear definition of the role and scope of Helplines in supporting Horizon

* Regional Helplines are currently failing their service levels (this is being actively

addressed), additional demand will have a significant impact

* Helpline staff will be diverted to support the implementation of Horizon into
Outlets - reducing current capability

OTHER HELP SERVICES

* Transaction Processing & POITS - role and responsibilities have yet to be
determined in respect of Horizon

* Service Management - will fill in the current void but this is not scaleable
