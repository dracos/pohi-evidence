BACKGROUND

Post Office's Chairman, Tim Parker, is receiving legal advice from Jonathan Swift QC on Post Office's
handling of the complaints made by Sub-Postmasters as part of the Complaint Review & Mediation
Scheme (the Scheme).

To inform and support this advice, some further areas of investigation have been identified, to which end
Bond Dickinson have been asked to:

“cross reference specific complaints about misleading advice from NBSC call-handlers with the
possible employees who provided that advice and consider their personnel files, where available,
for evidence as to the likelihood that the complaint may be well founded”.

It was agreed this task could be discharged through making the following queries, in the sequence they
are set out:

(i) identify those applicants who included, in their complaint to the Scheme, an allegation
about the advice they received from the NBSC helpline;

(ii) identify, from the above list of applicants, those who had made sufficiently particularised
complaints to allow for further investigation (ie they provided dates and/or other
identifying information about specific calls on which, they allege, they received
inadequate advice);

(iii) for those applicants who had particularised their complaints to a sufficient level of detail to
enable further investigation, cross reference the calls made to the NBSC helpline (in
respect of which the allegations have been made) against the call handlers who took the
calls; and

(iv) check the relevant call handlers’ Personal Development Reviews (PDRs) / Coaching
Records to see if they had had any complaints made against them in respect of the
advice they were providing.

Bond Dickinson have co-ordinated this process and produced the following paper, which sets out the
findings of these investigations.

PROCESS

1. Identify those applicants who included, in their complaint to the Scheme, an allegation
about the advice they had received from the NBSC helpline.

Post Office provided Bond Dickinson with a spreadsheet which detailed, from the 150
applications made to the Scheme, 107 applicants who had made allegations about the advice
they had received from the NBSC Helpline.

2. Identify those applicants who had made sufficiently particularised complaints to allow for
further investigation (ie they provided dates and/or other identifying information about
specific calls on which, they allege, they received inadequate advice).

Bond Dickinson reviewed the core Scheme documentation (the CQRs and Post Office
Investigation Reports) for each of the 107 Scheme cases which contained complaints about the
NBSC and identified, from these documents, those cases where applicants made sufficiently
particularised complaints to allow for further investigation.

Bond Dickinson then drew up a schedule (appendix 1 to this report) to detail the results of this
initial review. In short, it was established that:

CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

(a) 16' of the applicants provided sufficiently detailed information in their CQR to
allow a further investigation; and

(b) 11? further applicants included vague un-particularised complaints in their CQR.

Bond Dickinson advised that it would be reasonable for Post Office to investigate the 16 cases in
category A above but not those in category B as, given the level of presumption required, further
investigation of these complaints would involve disproportionate time and expense, with little
chance of being able to reach definitive conclusions.

The next stage involved:

. reviewing the NBSC call logs for each of the category A cases to try to identify the NBSC
call reference ID numbers for any specific calls mentioned by the applicants;

° reviewing the POIR and CRR for the category A cases to determine what had been said
about these calls/issues already; and

. providing an updated schedule to Post Office which included this additional information.

Of the 16 category A cases, it was determined, from our investigations, that only M007, M045
and M144 included a direct allegation of incompetence against the helpline staff. However, for
the sake of completeness, it was decided that we would continue to investigate the complaints
included in the other 13 cases.

Post Office also requested that Bond Dickinson, as part of their investigations into the remaining
13 cases, pay particular attention to resolving specific queries arising out of the information Bond
Dickinson had extracted from the POIRs / CRRs in respect of Applicants M001, M035, M042,
M080 and M143. Post Office's queries in respect of these cases were as follows:

. M001: a reference in the scheme documentation about a “complaint” made by the
applicant on 22.12.2003. This complaint was found to relate to a Post Office Card
Account application rather than the NBSC so no further investigation was necessary.

. M035: a call placed on 23.12.2003 where the applicant alleged the advice caused the
discrepancy to double.

. M042: a call placed on 1.6.2011 where the applicant alleged the advice caused the
discrepancy to double.

. M080: a letter dated 5.5.2009 made the allegation that the applicant received “conflicting
advice”. Post Office asked if any further specifics (eg. dates) were contained in the letter
to enable it to identify the relevant calls. The letter did not give any specifics in relation to
the advice so no further investigation was possible.

. M143: A call placed on 03.06.2009 where the applicant claims she was told to carry out a
certain process on Horizon and was subsequently told this process was incorrect.

For those applicants who had particularised their complaints in a sufficient level of detail to
enable further investigation, the next stage was to cross reference the calls made to the NBSC
helpline, in respect of which the allegations were made, against the call handler who took the call
The results of this exercise are contained in a table at Appendix 2 to this report. This list includes

the call references in respect of Post Office's specific queries above in relation to M035, M042
and M143.

It was not possible to identify the call handlers in respect of the complaints made by M011, M080
and M144. This is because the dates provided by applicants did not correlate with any calls
received by the NBSC.

3. Check the relevant call handlers’ Personal Development Reviews (PDRs) / Coaching
Records to see if they had had any complaints made against them in respect of the advice
they were providing.

Bond Dickinson is instructed that personnel files of call handlers would not contain any records of
concerns raised about their performance. The personnel file would simply be a record of that
individual's personal data and any disciplinary actions or warnings for attendance.

If complaints were made against NBSC personnel, or concerns were raised internally about the
performance of a call handler, Bond Dickinson are instructed that those complaints and concerns
could be recorded in the following places:

. The NBSC call logs themselves; and
. Coaching records

Coaching records are based on a random selection of calls that have been recorded and
analysed by a call handler's team leader. Each call handler is marked using a quality framework
and feedback is delivered by the team leader in a coaching session, with the advisor also
listening to the recorded calls.

The areas reviewed are call handling techniques (politeness, listening skills etc.) and knowledge
provided and logged. There is a scoring mechanism that is levelled across all teams and team
leaders to ensure consistency.

Having determined the names of the call handlers, Post Office searched the coaching files, to
ascertain if there were any concerns about that individual's performance generally or in relation to
any specific advice they had given during their time on the NBSC helpdesk. The sources
searched and the results of those searches are set out in the table at Annex 3. Where a call
handler appears more than once in relation to a specific applicant they are only listed once.
Where a call handler appears on the logs for multiple applicants, they are listed against each
separate applicant for the sake of having a complete record for each applicant.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the findings of this exercise are as follows:

. Many of the call handlers identified were employees of Royal Mail at the relevant time so Post
Office is unable to investigate their personal performance records.

. In relation to those call handlers who did work for Post Office, based on the above searches there
is no evidence (aside from the applicants’ claims) of complaints having been lodged against
specific advisors nor any concerns raised internally at Post Office about the performance of those
advisors.

. In the three cases identified where specific allegations of incompetence were made against
NBSC staff it has not been possible to identify the call handler who was the subject of the
allegation from the information provided by the applicants.

These conclusions are unsurprising as the NBSC staff are comprehensively trained and draw on

a central body of information called the Knowledge Base to ensure that the advice they give to
postmasters is consistent and accurate.

2013 — 1 call in January 2013 blaming
Horizon for on-going shortages in branch
(Refer to Doc 021).

It would be expected that as a
Subpostmaster became more
experienced in his role, the level of calls
to the NBSC would decrease; it appears
the opposite in this case as the level has
increased.

Page 5

Post Office records show that the
Applicant lodged a complaint with the
NBSC (Refer to Doc 037), and requested
a good will payment as Horizon was not
working in his branch for one week. At
the time, this was investigated by Laura
Darby (Post

Office Service Support, IT and Change);

complained that the
display would skip from
one transaction screen
to an unrelated one. If
this has occurred (and
we cannot reasonably
expect the Applicant to
have produced evidence
to prove that it did), it is
clear that it would have
materially increased the
possibility that the wrong
keys might be pressed
and data would be
incorrectly entered into
the system. The
question as to whether
or not one or more of
this branch's terminals
was sufficiently faulty to
generate transactional
errors is pivotal in this
case. Absent the further
investigative work
sought by the Applicant,
we have been unable to
determine whether there
really was a localised
but serious fault here. If
there was, then it seems
to us probable that it
would have contributed
to what Post Office
describes as the
“operational errors" that
caused this branch's
losses.

at the branch, this only affected one

terminals.

On the 14th July 2010, the Applicant
reported a fault to the NBSC regarding
an issue with a payment of a Post Office
Credit Card; he claims the transaction for
£1022.99 settled itself. On this occasion,
it appears the Applicant reversed the
transaction at the time so suffered no
financial loss. However he states he
keeps getting issues like this (Refer to
Doc 023).

At the time, the NBSC and HSD tried to
resolve the issue. The Applicant asserts
that the HSD offered as an explanation
that the Horizon screen could be “settling
itself’. This may not have been the best
terminology to use as it may have related
to an old issue around screen calibration.

There is a record of a complaint the
Applicant made to the NBSC in April
2007. The Applicant claimed a software
problem with E-Top transactions
However the explanation given and
highlighted at the time (Refer to Doc 038)
is the most likely explanation. The
Applicant claimed that Horizon was
producing E-Top vouchers without
having to swipe an E-Top card through
the system and this proved a fault with
Horizon. This is incorrect as Icons are
available on Horizon that enables
vouchers to be printed without the use of
a swipe card.

were properly addressed
and complains that Post
Office staff were, in his
opinion, poorly trained

occasions, abusive and
rude. He lodged a formal

action was taken. Post
Office states that the call
logs indicate that calls
were transferred

advice was given,
adding that, when the
Applicant reported
problems with banking
transactions, training
visits were delivered.

In 2005, Rachael Oyston was the Area
Intervention Manager for the Applicant's
branch. The role was reactive and
involved visiting branches, who had
either raised issues themselves via the
NBSC which required a visit, or visiting
on behalf of different teams within Post
Office who escalated issues such as
rolling losses, suspense account, audit
follow up and post appointment visits.
Post Office records available on the EFC
for this time are not detailed; however
Rachael has provided her recollection of
events (Refer to Doc 036).

On the 27th January 2014, the Applicant
contacted NBSC regarding an issue with
incorrect number of postage labels being
printed in the branch. Post Office
Management Information Reporting
System (Credence)(Refer to Doc 044)
shows that at 12:49 on the 27th January
2014, the branch did indeed process
seven postage labels at £1.10 each by
user IGA002; the Applicant's user ID is
RBI002. No other transactions are made
on the 27th January 2014 for this amount
so it would be reasonable to assume that
this is the transaction the Applicant is
alleging there was an issue with. NBSC
advised the Applicant that the user must
have said yes to all seven labels printing
successfully. Postage Labels are of no
monetary value until they have been
processed through Horizon; once a label
has been produced it then becomes of
value and is added to the customer
basket for settlement. After every label is
printed, Horizon prompts the user to

YES, then Horizon will add the value of
that label to the basket. If a postage label
does not print correctly or does not print
at all, the user can select NO. Horizon
will automatically reject the postage
label, and generate a ‘Rejected’ postage
label transaction. The user will then be
returned to the Post Mails screen where
they can insert another label and print
the postage label again. Three
transactions will appear in the basket;
two will have positive values (one for the
production of the correctly printed label,
and one for the incorrectly printed label),
and the third will have a negative value
(for the rejected postage label). The
positive value for the incorrectly printed
label and the negative value for the
rejected label will cancel each other out,
and as a result only the amount of the
correctly printed label will be charged. It's
impossible to say

exactly what happened in the branch on
the 27th January 2014;however the most
likely explanation is that one of the labels

selected YES when prompted.

At some point, a complaint was raised by
a Co-Op customer that the branch was

Applicant to the correct page on Horizon
Help that explained how to complete the
transaction. Horizon Help is an integral
facility within Horizon which allows
individuals to find and also print Post
Office instructions on products and
services, which can be accessed whilst
serving a customer. The Applicant was
still not happy on how to process the
transaction and advised he would
contact NBSC the next time for them to
talk him through the transaction. On the
13th January 2014, the Applicant
contacted the NBSC and claims he was
advised not to cash the cheque unless
the branch code is printed on the
cheque. NBSC call logs (Refer To Doc
045) show that this call H18250380 is
logged as “WANTING TO PAY A
CHEQUE INTO A CO OP ACCOUNT”. It
appears in this instance the Applicant
and the NBSC Operator were at cross
purposes; further investigation has
confirmed this (Refer to Doc 046).
Michala Millington (Post Office Client
Advisor) contacted the branch on the
23rd January 2014, after another
complaint from a customer being
refused the service; during this call it
came to light that there had been some
confusion between the NBSC and the
Applicant as to which process to follow.
Michala instructed the NBSC to contact
the Applicant to explain the correct
process (Refer to Doc 047). Sharon
Jamasb (NSBC operator) contacted the
Applicant on the 23rd January 2014 and
made it clear to him that handwritten
cheques could be accepted (Refer to
Doc 048). Sharon has informed this

jumped onto the subject about lack of
training at the NBSC. Sharon did not get

checking and rechecking his cash

“not to worry” as the shortage would

the part time assistant, at 10:55,
requested a telephone number and a
second call on 06 Apr 2011, made by
The Applicant at 10:26, related to a
personal banking customer account not
being credited. There is no evidence of
the 2 calls which the Applicant alleges he
made on 17 Dec 2010 nor at the next
branch trading balance period on 05 Jan
2011. It should be noted that the helpline
would have closed at 19:00 on 17 Dec
2010 and the message in place after
19:00 advises callers to ring back the
following day or leave their details for a
call back.

The Horizon Service Desk (HSD) records
(Doc 03 refers) identify that between the
periods of Oct 2010 to Jul 2011, 3 calls
which should have been made to the
helpline were in fact made to the HSD.
On all 3 occasions the user was referred
back to the helpline.

The helpline were asked to produce the
guidance that they would provide to
subpostmasters if the cash declaration
identified a cash shortage (not at period
end) and a cash shortage was still
evident at period end. The helpline staff
would guide the caller to carry out a
number of accounting checks (Doc 09
refers). For the initial cash declaration
discrepancy, the caller would be advised
that checks could only be made on
production of a trial balance, whereas at
period end there is a requirement for the
account to balance. Therefore the
guidance would reflect a requirement to
make good any resultant losses. It
should also be noted that this guidance
includes help in settling the account.
Settled locally is a term used to describe

the cash in’.
Page 4 Para 5.2

The Applicant reports
that, on 17 December
2010, his daily
reconciliation showed an
inexplicable cash
shortage of £2,400. He
says that, despite
checking the cash and
transaction log, he was
not able to identify the
cause of the shortfall,
and that he called the
Helpline at about 7pm
and was advised “not to
worry” and that the
shortage would “balance
out at the end of Trading
Period”.

repayment at the time of balancing,
where the agent physically makes the
shortage good; whereas there is a facility
to settle centrally, which transfers the
shortage to the agents account for
repayment at a later agreed date. The
Applicant had used the settled centrally
facility before for the Lottery debt, so he
was evidently aware of this facility.

There is no evidence in the helpline
records of the 2 calls, as stated in the
CQR, made by the Applicant on 17 Dec
2010 and 05 Jan 2011. However, the
guidance held by the helpline would
indicate that a loss, incurred during the
trading period, would warrant a different
response to a loss showing at balance
period end. The same guidance would
also be given by other areas of the
business.

The Applicant reports that, when Horizon
was introduced at the branch, she
received just three days of on-site
training from an auditor. She describes
the level of training she received as
“appalling” and states that the auditor
was “perpetually on his telephone” and
showed a general lack of interest
towards the Applicant and her branch
She asserts that she made a request
through the Helpline for further training,
but was told that no one was available to
attend the branch.

Page 15 Para 5.22

Post Office asserts that the Applicant is
unclear as to the identity of the trainer
who visited because she refers to him by
two different, albeit similar, first names in
her CQR. It states there is no record, in
the NBSC Helpline logs, of the Applicant
at any point complaining about the
quality of her training or requesting
further training. Post Office reports that
two days of further training were
provided on 31 March and 1 April 2011,

states that she sent the
Trading Period records
to Chesterfield the
following day and called
the Helpline to report the
shortfall. She says that
the Helpline told her that
they would look into it
and get back to her. The
Applicant asserts that
she was contacted by
Post Office the next day
and told that ‘the
discrepancy did not

She states that she
reluctantly agreed to
centrally settle the

her remuneration, Post
Office's position is that
"The Applicant is

as a condition of the Applicant's:

11 October 2011 Appeal Hearing, in
which the Applicant states “a trainer
came out one Friday morning (referring
to Friday 1 April 2011) but I was serving,
no training got done”. Post Office asserts
that the Applicant knew that training was
to take place on that day, but failed to
ensure adequate staff were present at
the branch for her training to be carried
out.

The Applicant reports
that she received a
phone call from Post
Office, in November or
December 2010,
explaining that Horizon
was showing £9,000.00
of Stock Vending
Machine stock, despite
the branch not having a
SVM. She says that she
was “confused and
startled” by the news
and took the
precautionary measure
of placing £9,000.00 into
the suspense account.
She states that she
contacted the Helpline
the next day to try to get
an explanation, but all
that they could tell her
was that there was
£9,000.00 in the
suspense account. The
Applicant states that she
told the Helpline that she
would wait until the end
of the Trading Period to
see if anything arose
and invited them to
investigate the matter.
This amount is listed on
the Applicant's
Statement of Debt on 4
January 2011 with the
label ‘stamp vending
machine’, the Applicant
questions why she is
liable for this amount.

Post Office refers to the
Horizon transaction logs
(Post Office Document
031), which show that,
on 4 January 2011, two
entries regarding SVM
stock were made on the
system. The first entry,
made with the
Applicant's user ID,
decreased the SVM
stock by £5,000.00 and
the second entry, made
using a staff member's
user ID, decreased the
SVM stock by a further
£4,000.00. Post Office
states that there is no
evidence of the
Applicant transferring
these amounts into the
suspense account.

Page 7 to 8 Para 4.14

Post Office reports that it
would have taken a
deliberate action by the
Applicant or one of her
staff members to
activate the SVM icon
on Horizon. It presents
evidence of two more
entries, made using the
Applicant's User ID,
which decreased the
SVM stock by £6,000.00
on 6 July 2011 and
£2,000.00 on 12 July
2011. Both of these
entries were cancelled
out by reverse

transactions on 20 July
2011. Post Office states
that, whilst it is possible
for the SVM icon to have
been selected in error, it
is unlikely that this error
would be made on
several occasions. It
asserts that any genuine
error would result in a
corresponding cash
surplus, but the erratic
pattern of the cash
declarations made by
the branch have made it
difficult to establish any
relationship between the
figures. It suggests that
the Applicant and her
staff could have
purposefully decreased
the SVM stock figures,
which would inflate the
cash on hand figure, in
order to conceal
shortfalls. In its
comments on the
previously issued draft
of this report Post Office
states that "entries were
made in the suspense
account against Stamp
vending Machine (SVM)
losses but as there was
no SVM or stock of
stamps for an SVM (and
there could not,
therefore, be a loss
associated with this
product), this action
would have created a
gain or covered a loss
that was already
present".

is that a serious shortage had been
identified in my office on 5 January
2010 by Horizon. They were
contacted by someone I spoke to on
a call back resulting from my call to
the Helpline to report my loss of £

immediately after my first full
balance after the move on 11
November to query the shortage
which I had assumed was due to an
administrative error during the
move. At the time I assumed this
would right itself and put the cash in
to cover the shortage.

The next trading statement on 9
December 2009 showed a further
shortage of £ 2,584.65 and
attempted to telephone the Helpline
again. I was unable to speak to
anyone and the Helpline were not
able to return my call until after I
had "rolled over" for the office to
open. They did not give me any
assistance or advice.

The next trading statement on 6
January 2010 produced a shortage
of £9,033.79 which I immediately
reported. I telephoned many times
and it was only during one of these
calls that I was told that I had to
request that the shortage be put in
dispute for it to be registered as
such. This I did and: From that point
my telephone calls became more
frequent and more agitated given
the complete lack of any resolution.

There is also evidence that these calls
were actioned by the CA and Branch
Support team. There is evidence of the
CA requesting Horizon checks and
intervention visits to support the branch

NBSC log 03/02/2010 suggests that the
BDM had not replied to the specific
questions raised. Post Office has
assumed that this is the issue referred to.

Records show that 46 calls were made to
NBSC during the period 27/10/2009-
08/06/2010. Evidence available indicates
that the calls were acted upon as contact
was made with FSA, CA, Duty Manager
and FSC. The actions are reflected in the
correspondence by various parties.
However it is noted that the steps taken
to try and resolve the Applicant's issues
were still not deemed to be sufficient
support by the Applicant.

me of this "serious" shortage on

the balance shortage and asked for
it to be checked. The young lady I
spoke to just said,"We've checked

a fruitless discussion with her, I
asked to speak with a Manager. I
got a Supervisor called Ken

little to the conversation about
checking that Horizon was working,
but brought up the "shortage" on

knowledge of a remitance

of £26,000 on that day. He went
away to check and then came back
to ask me for the time and

being infallible. However, even this
did not trigger any form of
investigation. I pointed out to him
that I had actually printed out all the
transaction logs for the Office since
17/11/09 and that I would not
accept that the Horizon system was
not at fault until someone from
Horizon/Fyjitsu had come out with
copies of their logs and put them
side by side with mine to prove they
were exactly the same. My offer

The Applicant estimated that he
contacted the helpdesk once a week
from

when the system was installed in
October 2000. Unfortunately,

Horizon Service Desk (HSD) call logs
for the period in question are no
longer available so these numbers
cannot be verified.

Call logs from the Network Business
Support Centre (NBSC) indicate that
only 3 out of 138 calls received in the
5 year period between October
2000 and October 2005 were relevant
to the HSD and transferred
accordingly.

Page 3 Para 2

The Horizon service Desk (HSD) call
logs are no longer available (Doc 004
refers). However, the NBSC call logs
from October 2000 — Oct 2005 are
available (Doc 003 refers)

The NBSC call data for the 5 year period
shows that 36 calls out of a total 138
logged were Horizon related (highlighted
in yellow on Doc 003). However, as
stated above, details of the calls made to
the HSD are no longer available so
interrogation of this data is not possible.

Page 5 Para 4

There are several instances on the
NBSC call logs of the Applicant
requesting guidance on the procedure
when "cut off" hadn’t been performed

Page 3 Para 1.13

In regard to how the
shortfall arose, the
Applicant states that he
received inadequate
training in handling
problems and a lack of
support when he needed
it, despite his numerous
requests to the
Helpdesk, especially
given the remote
location of the branch.
Post Office notes
however that there were
no calls recorded in the
NBSC helpdesk calll logs
in which the Applicant
requested additional
training. As referenced
in paragraph 2.3. below
it would appear that the
Applicant had a weak
understanding of how to
properly operate the
Horizon system which
introduces the possibility
that errors made at the
counter could have
caused some of the
losses.

he made frequent calls
to the Helpline,
averaging approximately
‘one per week over an

This suggests the Applicant was
struggling to understand this element of
the Horizon process over an extended
period of time despite help being
provided by NBSC.

Page 7 — Helpline Assistance

Within the NBSC call logs (Doc 003),
there are 3 calls (highlighted in green on
lines 44, 115, 121) in relation to attempts
to contact the RLM (Retail Line manager)
although no mention is made of the
subject matter. On one of these
occasions (01/03/02), a call was
escalated as the Applicant hadn't
received a response. Other than the
aforementioned escalation, there is no
evidence of calls or requests being
refused or ignored from the available
data.

In addition, 3 calls to the NBSC were.
transferred to the HSD (Doc 003, lines
10, 11 and 68 refer).

NBSC call logs show a high volume of
calls from the office on a variety of
subjects. There is nothing in the
available data to indicate that the
Applicant received anything other than a
professional service with satisfactory
outcomes to the issues raised in the
calls.

the Horizon Helpdesk
call logs are no longer
available but that such
of the NBSC call logs
that could be accessed
"show a high volume of
calls from the office on a
variety of subjects",
although Post Office
consider that these
averaged approximately
‘one per month. These
call logs confirm the
frequency of reported
hardware problems and
may also indicate a
weak understanding by
the Applicant of the
basic operations of the
Horizon system and how
some important aspects
were meant to operate.

On the first occasion that I had a
large deficit I rang the Helpdesk and
eventually, after following their
instructions, the difference that I
had called about had approximately
doubled. Even though a supervisor
called me back to try to resolve the
issue they were unable to help me
get the difference back to its original
figure. In the event I eventually
repaid the money from my own
salary.

The next time that I had a
substantial deficit I rang again but
no attempt was made to help me or
find out why another large amount
of money was missing and I was
merely pressured to pay in the
difference myself. After this I lost
faith with the Helpdesk and felt
unable to ring for help as I did not
believe that any assistance would
be given to me to resolve the
matter.

(Doc 010 refers). There is nothing to
suggest this error on 25 May was
connected with the transaction
complained about on 23 May.
However, it is possible that what has
happened is that during the
transaction on the 23rd May 2005, the
clerk has given the whole
documentation back to the customer
without entering or scanning the
Licence onto Horizon. This would be a
reasonable explanation as to

why the cheque was on the system
and the TV Licence was not.

The Applicant claims in her case

an audit, but there is no evidence in the

requesting an audit. There is an email

Retail Cash Management Support, sent

intervention office highlighting problems
at the Post Office. There is a security
report (Doc 012 refers) that the Applicant
allegedly told Mrs Kan Matharu, who
represented National Federation of Sub
Postmasters, that there were some
problems at the Post Office. Mrs Matharu
informed Colin Woodridge, Rural Support
Manger for Post Office, who in turn
informed Mr Adrian Skinner, Area
Performance Manager, and this is
confirmed by Mr Skinner's response

The Applicant's failure to
use the Helpline when
problems occurred
resulted in the Post
Office having no
knowledge of those

accounting by the
Applicant compounded
this situation, ensuring
that Post Office was

lack of support from the NBSC from Dec
2003 to March 2006.

answered 203 calls from the branch
during the period under review.

2003- 16 calls to the helpline, all in the
month of December: seven calls from
1/12/03-30/12/03 relate to the
misbalance call on the 3/12/03 £2082
shortage reported: a further call on the
30/12/03 about another £2000 loss.

2004- 99 Calls to the helpline: two calls
in relation to previous month misbalance
on the 2nd and 6th January.

Call on the 2nd Jan 2004 relates to
£4, 188.53 loss, it is most likely that this is
the previous two losses added together.

Call on the 3rd February 2004 regarding
£3, 191.00 loss; again it is most likely that

this is part of the previous loss.
Six calls about faults with Horizon
System; all other calls were general
enquires.

2005- 69 calls to the helpline, 30 of
which relate to issues processing and
despatching cheques and other
accounting problems.

24/2/05 Call in relation to £750 loss

25/5/05 Call in relation to TV Licence
transaction

2006- 19 calls between Jan-March: 15
calls in January in relation to cheques,
system crashing, and branch trading

Call on 5/1/06 in relation to £1000 loss
after system crashed when processing
postage label.

There are no calls suggesting any
shortage in the region of £36,000

There is no evidence in the call logs that
the Applicant could not contact the
helpline. There is evidence that on one
occasion she had to chase a call in
relation to cheques despatch in January
2006 (Doc 006 refers).

Call logs made to the NBSC suggest that
this may have been the case (Doc 004

Applicant contacted the NBSC regarding
a problem with the despatch of cheques,
the Application called back again on the
2" December and asked to speak with
someone else as she was not happy with
the help she had received the previous
day. It appears from the comments
section on the call logs that the NBSC
contacted the team at Chesterfield who
dealt with error notices at the time and
confirmed that the cheques had not been
despatched from the branch correctly
and arranged for an error notice to be
issued to the branch to clear the loss.

The Applicant was therefore clearly
aware of how to seek support in order to
investigate losses.

The Incidents relating to the
shortfall arose between February
and March

2003.

I was doing my weekly balance on a
Wednesday when the system
showed a shortfall of £15,000.00.

I contacted the Post Office help line
immediately on the day the

35

POL-0019248

discrepancy
arose

I was shocked as I could not
understand why the system was
showing a

shortfall of £15,000.

The staff at the Post Office helpline
were extremely unhelpful.

This was my general experience
with the Post Office helpline.

I cannot recall ever having had a
helpful conversation with the Post
Office helpline.

I had asked the Post Office for help
to trace the shortfall however all of
my requests for help were ignored.

The Post Office did not investigate
the possible cause of the shortfall.
Given that the Post Office failed to
investigate the cause of the
shortfall, I would like the Post Office
to explain the basis on which they
accepted the payment of £15,000
from me.

Furthermore, I would like the Post
Office to provide me with a detailed
breakdown with dates and details of
the transactions the shortfall of
£15,000 relate to.

I was always told by the Post Office
that we had to repay any
discrepancies

I therefore felt that I had no option
but to repay the £15,000 to the Post
Office.

I took out a personal loan for
£15,000 to repay the Post Office

J was struggling financially as I was
paying the mortgage on my
mother's home as I was living with
her at the time, the mortgage on the
Post Office and the £15,000
personal loan.

I paid the £15,000 to the Post Office
in good faith as I believed that an
error notice would eventually come
through. I knew I had not taken the
money from the Post Office. I also
knew that Gemma had no
involvement with the shortfall.

J genuinely believed that an error
notice would eventually come
through and the Post Office would
refund me the £15,000 I had paid.

/t was not unusual for error notices
to come through up to six months
after. The Post Office should have
records of the error notices I was
issued and I would like the Post
Office to present these notices
which will confirm the delay in which
they were issued.

3 weeks after I paid the £15,000,
the Horizon system stated that there
was a further shortfall of £19,000.

J again contacted the Post Office
helpline immediately for assistance.
This time I asked the Post Office to
send in auditors. I had already
parted with £15,000 in good faith as
1 was expecting an error notice to
come through putting the system

right. However, this had not
happened and the system was now
showing a second shortfall of
£19,000.00.
The Post Office failed to act on my
concerns and did not send auditors
out until three weeks after my plea
for help.
I had made the Post Office aware
that in the space of two months I
was told that there was a shortfall of
£34,000. I therefore am at a loss as
to why they waited 3 weeks before
sending auditors in.

I called the Helpdesk on 3 June
2013 but they were no help at all so
I called Chesterfield and spoke to
Andrew about my shortfall. He
agreed to go through everything
and from his end, but I did not hear
back from him.

I received a second letter regarding
the shortfall on 6 June 2013 and
called Chesterfield on 7June. They
said they would contact my contract
manager, Colin Burston, in respect
of the issue.

Chesterfield called me back and
said they would send someone out.
On 26 June 2013 Michelle Keohane
visited to go through things and
observe me working for a couple of
hours. She could not find anything
and told me that she could see
nothing wrong with how I worked.

Nothing was resolved so I called
Horizon (Ref: A3087487) and also
called Chesterfield and the Helpline
(Ref: H23226490) to no avail.

On 5 July I called the Helpline again
regarding a further loss (spoke to
Sarah Ref: H23236947) and also
called Chesterfield and spoke to
Dawn.

On 8 July I called the Helpline again
and spoke to Kirsty (H23239054)
and on 9 July I called

Chesterfield again. I also called the
Helpdesk again on 23 July and
spoke to Sarah again (Ref:

when a shortage of £1.7k appeared
on the balance with regards to

checking by the SPM and his staff,
no posting errors could be identified
at the branch. The SPM contacted
the Helpline with regards to this
issue. The POL staff he spoke with
had no interest whatsoever in
investigating the difference or in
supplying the SPM with any

available cover the period from 01

to the NBSC between 31 January 2007

ATM: a user had mistakenly served
customers while attached to the ATM
stock unit instead of the AA stock unit.
Whilst this causes discrepancies
between the stock units themselves,
those discrepancies cancel each other
out and do not cause an overall branch
discrepancy and transaction and event
logs show that this issue was resolved
on the day. The remainder relate to
operational issues around transactions,
reversals and matters unrelated to the
issues raised in the Applicant's

longer available to confirm what training
the Applicant received, Post Office
cannot find any evidence that supports
the allegation that the Applicant's training
was inadequate. Whilst the Applicant
expressed her dissatisfaction in relation
to the training, she was viewed as being
very capable in operating the ATM and
the associated procedures. There also
do not appear to be any additional
requests for training made to NBSC.

Page 8 ~ Para 2 ~ Process issues at the
end of each trading period

Records show that no calls were made to
the NBSC regarding discrepancies on
completion of trading period balances.

Page 10 — Para 4

No response from Post Office or BOI in
relation to differences in the ATM figures.

A. The Applicant alleges that there was
no response from Post Office in relation
to issues raised in light of the differences
in ATM figures. Records show no calls to
the NBSC from the branch regarding
ATM

discrepancy issues. Records of calls to
the ATM Helpdesk provided by Wincor
Nixdorf are not available (Doc 016).
Although there is evidence that the
Applicant sent a fax relating to a
balancing query to Wincor Nixdorf (Docs
002, 003, 016), it is not clear whether
Wincor Nixdorf responded to the fax as
records are not available.

and frequently with no
response, or no
promised call back, at
all. In its comments on
the previously issued
draft of this report Post
Office states that it "has
only one call for the
period of 31 January
2007 to 25 November
2009 regarding an ATM
issue" and that "There
are no records for the
calls to the Wincor
helpline and therefore [it
is] impossible to
comment".

Page 6 Para 4.3

Not only were those
ATM output figures
clearly incorrect, but we
are satisfied, on the
balance of probabilities
(there being little in the
way of call records now
available), that the
Applicant was
inadequately supported
by the three helpdesks
that she says repeatedly
passed her to and from
each other without ever
addressing the important
and urgent matters that
she raised. In its
comments on the
previously issued draft
of this report Post Office
states that "There are no
call logs recorded at
NBSC for this issue" and
that "In the absence of

it is not understood on
what evidence the CRR
relies to support the
conclusion on this
paragraph".

Page 9 Para 4.12

The Applicant has also
referred to being
unaware that she could
(and ought) to have
‘settled centrally’ the
ATM-related shortfalls.
She claimed, during the
disciplinary interview,
that she "was not aware
of that option being open
to me". The fact that the
Applicant had never
settled any shortfall
centrally lends support
to her claim. Post Office
states that "If the
Applicant had informed
Post Office through the
NBSC of her losses then
the option of settling
centrally would have
been explained as an
option whilst the
investigation had been
completed".

Page 10 Para 5.3

In that context, Post
Office asserts, on page
2 of its POIR, that its
Network Business
Support Centre (NBSC)

call logs show that the
Applicant did not seek
help for problems with
discrepancies or
balancing issues, noting
that it "has been unable
to determine whether or
not assistance was
provided by Bol and/or
by Wincor Nixdorf as
there are no telephone
call logs available". This,
in our view, is an un-
evidenced and
unacceptable dismissal
of the Applicant's
seemingly valid
complaints, which were
in any event not about
general "discrepancies
or balancing issues" but
about specific, serious
and repeated issues
arising from the ATM
itself.

NBSC use a knowledgebase from which
they take the information required to
provide a satisfactory response, based
on the information provided by the called

This knowledgebase is managed by the
Post Office Core information team within
NBSC and there are provided with the
information by product managers and
other Post Office lead teams etc. They
also have some information from the
help pages embedded in Horizon.

NBSC advisors receive full training on
Horizon. The expectation is where
possible, to stick to knowledge provided
to them from knowledgebase and not
“assume" any responses. Although their
expertise can often require the right
questions to be asked in order to
understand what it is the branch needs
help with- not all questions asked are
straightforward.

The Tier 2 element within NBSC is used
if an advisor cannot:

« find the information required;

* isnot 100% sure on how to
address the issue;

« _ if information is not actually
available or on the
knowledgebase; and/or

° if there is something new that
has not yet been provided to
NBSC.

They will then liaise with other Post
Office departments, (Product managers
etc.) to gain the information.

There are no recorded contacts with
NBSC on 29 June 2011 requesting
assistance with branch accounting.
Contact on 1 July 2011 shows the
Applicant asking to send paperwork to
NBSC for investigation. However, this is
not a role undertaken by NBSC (it would
be undertaken by FSC where
appropriate). The notes on the call log
show that NBSC advised the caller to call
back on next balance if still a problem.

28 December 2011 Branch Manager
contacts NBSC to ask if authorisation is
required to settle centrally, this is some
six months after when the discrepancy
occurred.

This means that the cash on hand figure
has been inflated at each Trading Period
from June to December 2011. This
constitutes a falsification of the Branch
accounts during this period.

As part of this investigation an extensive
examination of the figures taken from the
ATM print outs compared to entries on
Horizon has been completed for the
period 04 May 2011 to 29 June 2011.
These dates were selected because the
applicant claims that a shortfall of
£19055 was reported to NBSC on 29
June 2011.

Page 7 Para 4.13

The branch had sought
advice from the NBSC
on 6 June 2011
regarding the first
counterfeit device that
was found, but no
investigations were
undertaken by Post
Office, as it was
considered to be a
police matter. The
proximity of this
attempted fraud to the
subsequent ATM
problems cannot be
easily dismissed.

Page 8 Para 4.19

In relation to the
Applicant's view that the
Helpline was ineffectual
and gave misleading
advice, she gives the
example of calling to
seek help when the ATM
printout showed over
four billion rejected
notes. She says that no
‘one knew why this had
happened and that she
was told not to worry
about it. She also says
that when a difference (a
surplus) of £93,000 was
discovered, the Helpline
advice did not make
sense, and she was
simply advised that “it
would all become clear
on rollover”. She adds

47

POL-0019248
POL00022769
POL00022769

CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

that they were ‘often told
to await instructions that
never came”. In its
comments on the
previously issued draft
of this report Post Office
explains that the call log
of 2 June 2011 states
that "the £93K has gone
and the office is now
balancing".

Page 8 Para 4.20 - Mis-
advice by Post Office's
Helpline

Post Office responds by
saying that its records
show that, between 1
January 2011 and 31
December 2011, the
branch made 385 calls to
the NBSC regarding the
ATM or ATM balancing
issues, and that without
specific examples of the
type of advice
complained of, it is
difficult to comment
further. It notes that
there are no records of
complaints being made
at the time and no
repeated calls ,
suggesting that issues
were resolved. Post
Office again also
comments that very few
of the calls to the
Helpline were made by
the Applicant but rather
by her manager.

We consider that, whilst
Post Office records
show that there was
considerable input in
terms of Helpline
assistance and further
training, there appears
to have beena
mismatch between what
Post Office considered
to be effective advice,
and how the Helpline's
advice worked in
practice for this branch
as it appears that much
of the guidance provided
was not followed by
branch staff. Additional
comments in an
addendum to the NBSC
call logs (see Post
Office's Document 26)
show that, whilst the
NBSC operator is
attempting to assist the
office with ATM
balancing, he does not
appear to have been
able to assist the branch
to resolve the issues
remotely. His comment,
following a call from the
branch on 15 August
2011, is recorded as
saying “at this point I
could think of nothing
further to be done, so
the request for a trainer
went out”. It is not clear
from Post Office's
records whether or not
this further training took
place.

What is clear is that the

differences even with
the help that was being
provided.

Page 9 Para 4.22 —
Limitations in the Audit
Trail available by
Subpostmasters

In relation to the
Applicant's complaint
that deficiencies in the
audit trail meant that she
was unable to
investigate how
discrepancies had
arisen, Post Office
responds by saying that
Horizon transaction and
event logs are available
to branches for a period
of 60 days. It also says
that NBSC call logs
show no calls from the
Applicant regarding
assistance in identifying
transaction audit trails.
Post Office's NBSC call
log shows that, for the
period 27 November
2007 to 31 January
2012, out of a total of
557 calls made by the
branch, 100 were calls
relating to the ATM. Of
those, 50 related to ATM
and other balancing
procedures.

Of the two Helpline
references cited by the
Applicant in relation to
this £19,055 shortfall,
Post Office responds by
saying that there were
no recorded contacts
with NBSC on 29 June
2011 requesting
assistance with branch
accounting. There was
however a record of a
call requesting
assistance with branch
accounting on 1 July
2011 which appears to
relate to the same query
(call reference
H22890493).

Page 10 Para 4.29

The Applicant says that,
after phoning the
Helpline on a daily
basis, she finally
became so concerned at
the unexplained shortfall
that she requested an
Audit to assist her with
identifying the cause of
the differences,
However, the result of
the Audit was that she
was suspended and her
contract later
terminated, in her view
with no investigation as
to the true cause having
been carried out despite
the fact that crime was
clearly suspected. Post
Office states that there
is no evidence to

that the Audit was

April 2009, Ms Ballan contacted the
Applicant to arrange a meeting (refer to
Doc 013) to discuss the branch losses.
The Applicant was unable to attend (refer
to Doc 014) and the meeting was
rearranged for June 2009, these issues
are addressed in the “Accounting
discrepancies and lack of proper audit
trail” section of this report.

There is no record of the Applicant
making any complaints to NBSC
regarding the service provided. There is
no evidence to suggest that any
correspondence between the Applicant
and the operators at NBSC was anything
but professional and every effort was
made to help the Applicant with any
issues raised.

following requests by the
Applicant and/or her
Contracts Manager, four
intervention visits took
place, when a Field
Support Advisor (FSA)
visited the branch to
deliver further training, in
October 2008, and again
in February, April and
August 2009. The
Applicant's daughter
also received classroom
training in December
2008. It is not clear
whether the Applicant
ever received any formal
classroom training,
however, Post Office
says in its POIR that the
Applicant had been
operating Horizon
without issue from the
time of her appointment,
until 2008. Indeed, we
note that she was
recorded as having said,
in a call to the Network
Business Support
Centre (NBSC) Helpline
on 13 November 2008,
that she had “been in
office for 10 years and
concerned as to why
things are now going
wrong”. Taking that
statement into account,
and notwithstanding the
lack of availability of
training records, we
have formed the view
that this branch's
problems are not
primarily attributable to

following a meeting to
discuss the branch's
outstanding debt, she
was warned in a letter
(Post Office’s Document

not to settle anything
centrally, and that any
losses were to be made
good immediately. The
letter told her that if she
failed to meet this
requirement, Post Office
would “seriously have to
consider [her] suitability
to remain asa

Applicant says that there
seems to have been a
presumption by Post
Office that they could
“just hold her liable for
everything without
explanation”. She adds
that she was “regrettably
forced to accept and roll
over, time after time”.

doubling in size and then

says that he was then told that

on this is that there is no

NBSC could also offer appropriate

Page 8 - Conclusion

There is no evidence that support
or training provided to the
Applicant/her daughter was
inadequate. It is Post Office's view
that in the unfortunate
circumstances of the Applicant
suffering from ill health during the
initial training, Post Office acted
swiftly and was supportive in
offering the training to her
daughter. Whilst it is
acknowledged the classroom
training did not include ATM
training this is for good reason as
set out above. There is evidence
that the Applicant and her
daughter knew how to contact
NBSC and how to use the settle
centrally function. There is
evidence of considerable support
for this branch, which exceeded
the standard training package. It is
Post Office’s view that the
Applicant's claims that the off-site
training focussed on daily
transactions only is unfounded and
that she is not in a position to
comment on this given that she did.
not attend the full course. In
recognition of the Applicant's ill
health, further training courses
were offered however the
Applicant failed to take up these
opportunities.

On 5 May 2009, the
Applicant's husband emailed
Post Office in relation to a
£5,000 discrepancy that the
office was unable to resolve. In
that email, he complained of
conflicting advice he says the
branch had received from the
trainer and the Helpline in
relation to variance checks and
balance snapshots. He also
requested training for all the
branch staff “with a competent
trainer and for more than two
hours, also one that knows
about the ATM because the
last two trainers knew nothing
about the ATM”. In its
comments on the previously
issued draft of this report Post
Office "questions why the
Applicant's husband felt able to
criticise the knowledge of its
trainers in relation to the ATM

regard to Post Office's
reference to the Applicant's
husband not being registered
to work in the branch, the
Applicant says, in her
comments on the previously
issued draft of this report:
"POL was always made aware
that Mr G Etheridge was part
owner of the post office" and
that he "had all the deals with
POL management”. This
matter is also referenced in

money was used to fund the post
office during August and
September. Explained to them that

money be used to top up the Post
office. On the day that they receive

Page 15 Para 5.2

As noted at paragraph 3.7.
above, sometime after January
2011, the Applicant discovered
that the ‘Deputy Manager’, LP,
had been inflating the branch's
cash declarations. On 12 May
2011, the Applicant informed
the Helpline that she
suspected that a member of
staff was stealing cash from
the branch and “not entering
customer's deposits as she
had had a few complaints”. We
also note that, on 24
November 2011, a TC Invoice
for £1,421.91 was issued to
the branch, when a cash
pouch, that had been remmed
out of Horizon, was not
despatched to the Cash
Centre. It would appear that no
investigations were carried out
at the time either by Police or
by Post Office. From the
available evidence, we are
unable to conclude whether LP
was stealing cash from the
branch, or whether she was
inflating the cash declarations
to hide discrepancies caused
by errors. In either event, it
would have made it extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for
the Applicant to trace the
source of those discrepancies.
We note the Applicant's
comment that "LP was inflating
cash declarations to hide
discrepancies...".

the money it needs to be
transferred to the ATM stock and
accounted for daily. Suggested
that Mr Gareth Etheridge runs
through the loading of the machine
and how to obtain the figures with
a member of staff or all the staff.
So that if he is unable to take the
figures there is a competent
person to do it. The training cannot
be done while the office is open
because it is a very busy benefit
office, so not practical for a trainer
to arrive at 17.30 and train all
members of staff. Mrs Etheridge
the postmaster could do with some
additional training as she is unsure
of some of the weekly balancing
procedures. Her daughter and
members of staff have been trying
to tell her what to do. The office
had not been balanced since the
last Trading Statement. Confirmed
with Chesterfield the ATM
shortage of £6210 and asked them
to send the evidence to Gurnos. It
appears that during the month of
August incorrect figures were
inputted .Sunday figures were
omitted totally. It has been correct

NBSC call logs have been
examined and there is no evidence
of incorrect or unhelpful advice
being given to the Applicant or her
staff. 114 calls were made during
the Applicant's period of tenure, of
which were made by the Applicant.
There is a steady increase in the
number of calls made during

the Applicant's period of tenure. It
is significant that in 2010 (the last
full year of the Applicant's tenure)
41 calls were made by persons
other than the Applicant, who
made 3 calls. This year also
included a period when the branch
was closed. Appropriate
responses and action when
required was taken, which on
numerous occasions led to
additional on-site support being
provided. NBSC call logs are
provided as part of this response

Records show that an email was
sent by the Applicant's husband to
the BDM on 5 May 2009 in which
he complains that he had been
given conflicting advice regarding
the end of day balancing. The
Applicant's husband stated in that
email that the “trainer” (FSA) had

should be used to complete the

the balance snapshot should be

A further call is logged on 19
January 2010 reporting the branch
closed due to a system failure but
an engineer was expected. There
are two calls relating to the
recovery process, both logged in
August 2010. The first call is
recorded on 17 August 2010 and
reports that the system went down
half way through a card account
transaction; the second call is
recorded on 24 August 2010 and
refers to the recovery process. On
both occasions advice was
provided to the caller from the
NBSC knowledge base.

On 1 April 2010, 7 May 2010, 12
May 2010 and 21 September 2010
calls were made to NBSC which
were transferred to HSD relating to
on line services, rebooting, and
printer or faults, no other
information was provided. Analysis
of further HSD call logs is
contained in document 054.

On 25 March 2011 a call was
made to NBSC to report
discrepancies that the
Subpostmaster thought had been
caused by Horizon; the calll is

4A_32763924_1

POL-0019248
CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

POL00022769

transferred to HSD and there are
no further details logged. There
are two callls relating to engineer
visits on 10 March 2011 and 25
May 2011. The first call related to
a system failure which may have
been related to phone lines and
states that an engineer was
coming; the records do not
indicate if the engineer was from
HSD or BT. The office is logged as
closed at 08:55 and reopened at
10:03. Given the time of the initial
call (08:55) it is unlikely that the
branch was open and therefore
this incident could not have
occurred mid transaction or
affected a transaction. The second
call was a chaser to an expected
engineer visit the previous day; on
call back by NBSC the engineer
had been on site and resolved the
pin pad issue raised.

Page 22

There is a call logged at NBSC on
12 December 2008 which refers to
an amount of £210.00 which it is
presumed, given the limited data
available, is held on the cheque
line of the branch accounts. If this
was removed, as it should be if the
cheques were not physically on
hand, this could have created a
loss in the branch. However, the
actual cause of the loss would be
the fact that the cheques were not
physically on hand.

On 20 February 2009 the
Applicant's daughter logged a
request for OIT to contact her

4A_32763924_1

72

POL-0019248
CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

POL00022769
POL00022769

regarding another staff member
and a balancing issue and a
problem she had created. The O/T
logged the call as :-

NEEDS TO SPEAK TO THE
AREA OFFICE REGARDING
ANOTHER MEMBER OF STAFF
OVER THE BALANCE &
PROBLEM SHE HAS CAUSED. A
member of staff created a zz unit
and put £210 in suspense account
and was then told to take it out
now there is an amount of £649
which keeps coming up on the
system and pm does

not know where it's come from and
what to do about this.

The OIT raised a request for
additional training which was
delivered on 4 March 2009 (see
1(v) above). However, as referred
to below, there was a call on 31
December 2008 about this.

There are no calls logged to NBSC
during March 2009 in relation to a
loss or referring to a ZZ stock unit.
No TC's were issued during March
2009.

On 27 April 2009 a call was logged
by NBSC from the Applicant's
daughter reporting a £5,500.00
discrepancy due to an incorrectly
processed ATM figure. The correct
advice to reverse the entry was
provided by NBSC. If the correct
advice provided by NBSC was
followed there would not be a
discrepancy in the branch
accounts.

There are numerous other errors
and discrepancies reported to
NBSC. These are either
mentioned in other parts of this
report or recorded in the NBSC
call log analysis. (Docs 001, 002
refer)

Although the Applicant claims that
the £700.00 discrepancy in March
2009 was her first loss and her
Manager was advised to create a
ZZ stock unit to resolve the issue
which it failed to do, records
show:-

On 31 December 2008 a call was
logged with NBSC requesting
assistance with creating a ZZ
stock unit.

HOW TO CREATE A ZZ SU ON
HORIZON SPMR HAS MESSAGE
THAT SAYS TO CORRECT DISC.
ON BALANCE NEEDS TO
CREATE A CORRECTION SU ZZ.

The branch was advised using the
knowledge base held at NBSC.

On 20 August 2009 a call was
logged at NBSC from the
Applicant's daughter relating to an
ATM discrepancy which it is
reported was “made worse by
figures being reversed”. The call
log is further annotated “£700
down on cash tried to reverse cash
dec and it didn't work”. A call back
to the branch to speak to the
Applicant is requested after 1pm
the following day when the
Applicant will be in the branch. It is
not known if this is the £700.00
discrepancy the Applicant refers to
(see 6(ii) below).

There is one further reference to
the ZZ stock unit in the NBSC call
logs on 1 April 2010, when the
following is recorded:-

DID MONTHLY ROLLOVER
YESTERDAY BUT IS UNABLE TO
ROLLOVER OFFICE

The resolution states that
instruction was given on the ZZ
stock unit, the most likely
explanation is that the branch was
attempting to roll the office but had
failed to ‘roll’ the ZZ stock unit.
Records show that the ZZ stock
unit had been deleted by 1 June
2010 although Post Office cannot
determine from the available
records exactly when it was
deleted.

Page 25

NBSC records show a call made
by the Applicant's daughter on 27
April 2009 reporting a shortage of
£5,500.00. The logs are annotated
as ‘balance last week-Postmaster
put through ATM dispensed figure
incorrectly. Has attempted to
reverse but unable to do so”. The
Applicant's daughter was advised
to process the transaction as a
new reversal rather than as an
existing one. (The facility is
available via Horizon to correct an
error made by reversing the
transaction and then inputting it
correctly. There are two types of
reversals, new and existing. A new
reversal is used when the Horizon
user sells a stock item incorrectly

4A_32763924_1

75

POL-0019248
CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

POL00022769
POL00022769

for example a first class stamp
when the customer wants a
second class stamp. An existing
reversal is usually transactions
input to Horizon incorrectly and is
completed with the use of a
session number obtainable either
from the customer's receipt or from
the Horizon produced transaction
log.) In this specific instance

the user was attempting to reverse
the ATM dispensed figure input to
Horizon as an existing reversal.
However, the ATM dispensed
figure had been input into Horizon
as the sale of a product and
therefore the

correct method would have been
to process as a new reversal. This
would have corrected the
discrepancy reported. It is not
known if this is the £5,000.00
shortfall the Applicant refers to.

On 6 May 2009 there is a call
logged at NBSC at 18:10 by the
Applicant. This is recorded as
“office has got large discrepancy.”
A second call was made on the
same day at 18:30, again by the
Applicant, and the log states that
the large discrepancy related to a
transfer from the BOI stock unit to
AA stock unit. The Applicant
requested permission to place the
amount into the branch suspense
account, but was advised to settle
the shortfall centrally. There is no
amount recorded on the log
however records show that a
balancing

discrepancy of £4,824.78(-) was
settled centrally on 6 May 2009
which would correlate with both

4A_32763924_1

76

POL-0019248
CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

POL00022769
POL00022769

the advice given by NBSC and the
shortfall the Applicant refers to in
her CQR (Doc 024 refers).

There were further calls made to
NBSC during 2009. On 24 June
2009 the Applicant reported
cheques possibly being remitted
out of the branch twice. If this error
had been made then a surplus
would have been generated of the
additional amount remitted out but
for which no actual cheques were
sent. The call logged does not
record a value of the error made
and no balancing discrepancy was
settled centrally in August 2009
when the trading period balance
was completed (Doc 024 refers).

On 19 August 2009 the Applicant
again contacted NBSC regarding
cheques. By this time the
Applicant believed that she may
have remitted the same amount
out three times and reversed the
transaction once. The log records
that a TC had been received for
£832.00 and records show that a
charge TC was issued to the
branch on 23 July 2009 for
£832.42. It is apparent at this time
that the Applicant was receiving
assistance from a Subpostmaster
from a branch nearby, but he was
unable to resolve the issue either.

Page 26

The following day, 20 August
2009, the Applicant's daughter
made a call to NBSC relating to a
discrepancy with the ATM “made
worse by figures being reversed”
The logs show that the branch was

4A_32763924_1

POL-0019248
CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED

POL00022769
POL00022769

reporting £700.00 in cash and that
they had tried to reverse the cash
declaration and it did not work.
(The correct procedure would have
been to re-declare the cash by
overwriting the previously declared
incorrect figure(s)).

On 8 December 2009 a call was
made to NBSC by the Applicant's
daughter regarding the ATM and
reporting that the ATM dispensed
figure of the 27th (the exact date is
not recorded but it is believed this
refers November 2009) had not
been entered. There was no
amount specified but the caller
was advised to the omitted figure
to Horizon on the day of the call.
Page 32

There is one calll logged with
NBSC on 6 May 2010 which
relates to an enquiry as to whether
a Premium Bond transaction for
£2,000 had been processed via
Horizon (Doc 003 refers).The
advice is given to review the end
of day reports. There is no
evidence (chaser calls for
example) to indicate that there are
any further issues with this
transaction. Records show that a
credit TC for £2,000.00 was issued
on 22 February 2010, as the TC
was issued prior to the call logged
with NBSC it is unlikely to be
related. However this could be the
issue to which the Applicant refers
(Doc 003 refers).

Mrs Ward contacted the helpline as

on 18 August 2006 to report the
flood. A printer was replaced
following the flood but no checks
were undertaken by the Post Office
on any other equipment. Mrs Ward
was informed that nobody would
come to inspect the system until
she could demonstrate it would not
occur again19. No further checks
were undertaken.

Page 1 Findings

The evidence shows that all calls
that were made to the Network
Business Support Centre (NBSC)
were resolved and closed, which
would indicate that the issue
raised had been dealt with. There
is no evidence in the call logs of
the

Applicant requesting assistance
with discrepancies or the other
issues raised within her case

such as postage labels or
activation of scratch cards.

The Applicant's claims regarding
the transaction audit trail and
difficulties at the end of each
trading period are not supported
by contemporaneous; no calls
were made to the NBSC in relation
to either issue during the
Applicant's

time in post.

NBSC

The NBSC call logs are available
for Priory Road Post Office for the
duration of the Applicant's tenure
and provide both a category for
every call and the resolution. From
6 June 2002 to 11 January 2007 a
total of 118 calls for the

branch were logged at the NBSC,
although eight of these were made
to the branch and not by the
branch (Doc 004). All Calls’ Tab

The Applicant comments that 14900151
in August 2006 the office
suffered a water leak, as a
result of which the back office
printer was damaged and the
office was closed for two days.
The Applicant states that
nobody from Post Office would
agree to come to check the
equipment until it could be
proved that the leak had been
properly and permanently
repaired and she says that
they never did carry out any
checks. Post Office agrees
that there is evidence that the
branch was closed as a result
of the flood and it also appears
to us from the evidence that
equipment was checked
following the incident, although
there are no records available
to confirm the conclusion of
calls made to NBSC or HSD
on this matter.

Page 7 Para 3.19

The Helpline logs also refer to
a number of issues relating to
cheques and deposits for
which no further information
was available to the Applicant
but which has now been
provided by Post Office as part
of its POIR submission. A
review of these call logs
indicate that a number of calls
were resolved by reference to
the Knowledge Base, a

NBSC Horizon related records
The Applicant claims in her CQR
(Doc 001 3.33, 3.36, 3.66 and
3.41) that telecommunication
failures were a common
occurrence at the branch. There
are no HSD call logs available to
substantiate this claim, however
there is some relevant information
within the NBSC call records.
* Three calls were made to
NBSC (on 20 December
2004, 14 March 2005 and
9 May 2005 where the
Applicant requested
contact with HSH and the
calls were transferred;
two calls were noted as a

information relevant to specific
products, services and
accounting matters. Post
Office has additionally stated
that "If reference is made to
the Knowledge Base without
further escalation it is likely
that the query was
straightforward and easily
resolved".

Page 8 Para 3.20

In 2006 a shortfall was caused
by a mis-keying of £2,776.95
as £27,779.95. The Applicant
states that although this was
not a cash loss, Chesterfield
informed her that she would be
required to immediately pay in
£25,000 to cover the
difference. It was only some
three weeks later that the
branch received a TC to
correct the problem. Post
Office comments that the call
logs indicate that the
processing errors which
generated the need for the TC
represent an additional area of
a lack of controls in checking
bill payment counterfoils. It
does however agree that the
Applicant did raise calls with
NBSC about this matter and it
states that she received
appropriate support and
guidance to bring the TC to
account and to resolve the
earlier mis-keying error. It is
not clear to us why the
Applicant would have been
told to immediately pay in the

In regard to the Applicant's
expectations of answers from
the Helpline, and of practical
on-site help from Post Office's
Investigations team, to help
her find out how discrepancies
had arisen, it is clear to us
that, as in other cases that we
have reviewed, this Applicant
had an expectation that the
Helpline would be able to tell
her how her branch's
discrepancies had arisen and
perhaps also that she could
call for experienced
investigators to come to the
branch and help her and her
staff to isolate and correct
them. The Applicant's position
is that, as a result of her
experience regarding
differences, she ceased to
notify the Helpline, which she
now accepts was "incorrect
and foolish”. It is our view that
Post Office's Helpline and its
Chesterfield-based staff
cannot reasonably be
expected to determine from
afar how every discrepancy
has arisen.

Although there are calls
categorised as ‘Horizon
Balancing’, analysis of all of the
logs has not identified any call
reporting a discrepancy or asking
for assistance in finding a
discrepancy was made.
Furthermore, the Applicant was
asked about the losses at
interview

Interviewer: “did you not think to
speak to somebody in the area
office or the helpline or whatever?”
Applicant: “No. And I felt ill every
week since just waiting for
somebody to knock on the door”.

In conclusion, calls to the NBSC
were made throughout the
Applicant's tenure and did not
reduce over her years in post.
However, there is nothing to
suggest that the answers she was
provided with by NBSC did not
resolve her

2007, reveal that the Applicant
sought assistance from the
Helpline on a variety of
transaction-related matters on
numerous occasions. These
appear to also include calls
from the Interim
Subpostmaster, appointed
following the Applicant's
suspension. However, as
many of the records do not
include information about the
amounts involved or how the
calls were resolved, it is
difficult to assess the extent to
which they may have had an
impact on differences.

Page 9 Para 4.3

In its POIR Post Office states
that there are no records of
calls being made to the
Helpline regarding transaction
audit trail problems; difficulties
at the end of a trading period;
or postage labels or
Scratchcards. Post Office also
notes in its comments on the
previously issued draft of this
report that "the Applicant did
not make any calls to seek
assistance in relation to the
discrepancies".

Page 9 Para 4.4

From the available evidence it
can be seen that 118 calls to
and from the branch were
logged at the NBSC, which is
the main point of contact for
Subpostmasters and their staff
with respect to non-technical

issues. There is no evidence that
the Applicant made any calls to
NBSC or the area office requesting
support or assistance with the
Horizon balance, contrary to the
Applicant stating in the CQR, on
more than one occasion (Doc

001, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.27), that she
had contacted the NBSC for help.
Page 10 Para 3.2

Three calls were made to NBSC
on 20 December 2004, 14 March
2005 and 9 May 2005 where the
Applicant requested contact with
HSH and the calls were
transferred; two calls were noted
as a system issue and one call
was noted as an offline indicator. It
should be noted that these three
calls from the branch were made
before the Applicant states that
problems started at the branch.

According to the NBSC log (Doc
004 Tab Printer Faults) NBSC
were notified of water leaking
through the ceiling and a printer
being damaged. Notes made in

the incident log column seem to
suggest that the branch re-opened
on 21 August 2006. The resolution
column only reports that all parties
have been advised, but as HSD
call logs are no longer available, it
cannot be assumed that Fujitsu
were one of the advised parties. A
further call was made to NBSC on
23 August 2006 to report two faulty
printers and this call was
transferred to HSD, but again

there are no records to confirm the
outcome of this call

issues. Of these many related
to enquiries about procedures
and some to Horizon
balancing. Post Office states
that an analysis of these calls
has not identified calls
requesting assistance in
finding a discrepancy. We
agree with this analysis, which
appears to be supported by
statements made by the
Applicant during interview.
Post Office also considers that
all calls were marked as
resolved and closed, which
would it assert would indicate
that the issue raised had been
dealt with. We do not ascribe
any particular value to this
observation.

Page 10 Para 4.8

It is clear that this Applicant
experienced a number of
hardware issues, especially
those subsequent to the
flooding of the branch in
August 2006, and that she
reported these to the
Helpdesk. The Applicant
reports that, when a printer
was replaced, the engineer
also investigated the main
computer and was concerned
whether, due to the level of dirt
inside the machine, it was
operating correctly.

H16340369

Post Office findings are that there
were no instructions by NBSC to
Zero the stock a claimed.

The Applicant stated he has an
incorrect figure and a discrepancy
of £30,000.00 in the suspense
account.

The problem appeared to be in
relation to the Applicant's use of
stock.

Page 15

Post Office findings are that there
are no NBSC call logs evidencing
that the Applicant's wife made a
request for an audit. Further, there
is no record of an audit having
been carried out on 30 September
2009. Rather, 30 September 2009
was the end of a Trading Period
and on the date the Applicant was
required to complete a balance.

A balance snapshot produced by
the Applicant showed a negative
figure against the cheque amount
for the reasons explained above.
The Applicant contacted NBSC for
advice to correct this negative
figure. (Doc 021 refers). NBSC
advised the Applicant fo adjust the
figure positively so that there were
no discrepancies

on the cheque listing (i.e. the
Applicant added £10,490.08 to the
cheque on hand figure to create a
zero balance). This adjustment
created a surplus in the branch
accounts of £10,490.08 (+) (i.e.
the branch declared that it had
£10,490.08 more than it should
have based on the transaction
records recorded on Horizon)

Page 22 ~ Process Issues at the
end of each Trading Period

Post Office findings are that NBSC
call logs confirm that the Applicant
did contact the NBSC when he
experienced issues with balancing
at the end of each Trading Period.
There is no evidence that NBSC
failed to provide a suitable
response to any of the questions
raised by the Applicant. Records
indicate that there was only a
slight increase in calls to NBSC in
2009. Although it was the year
when most calls to NBSC were
placed, it was not by any means
exceptional,

with 127 calls being made in 2006
and 115 in 2003.

On 8 April 200447, Mr English
received an error notice from
Chesterfield regarding one of a
group of 10 pension dockets for
£102.25 which had allegedly gone
missing in the week ending 21
January 2004. Mr English was
adamant that he had followed the
correct procedure at his end, and
requested evidence from the Post
Office to support their claim

Page 11 Para 3.27

Mr English wrote again to Steve
Gibbs after receipt of the letter
disallowing the £102.25, but does
not appear to have received a
response51.

Page 9

It is clear from NBSC call logs and
the correspondence presented by
the Applicant that his wife
accepted this TC, but his wife
subsequently disputed it.

Page 9 to 10 — Para 2 Shortfall of
£500 experienced sometime
between 2008 and 2010

The Applicant claims to have
suffered losses of £250.00 per
month for two months running at
some point between 2008 and
2010. The Applicant claims he had
no option but to repay the losses,
despite his belief that he was not
responsible.

The Applicant has not specified
when this issue is said to have
occurred nor has he provided any
evidence in relation to it.

There is no record in the NBSC
call logs (Doc 003) of any calls
placed during the time period
quoted by the Applicant.

The record of TCs (Doc 002) and
NBSC call logs show that whilst
errors were rare at the branch,
they did occur and sometimes
resulted in losses and surpluses
which the Applicant would make
good by paying in or taking out
cash as appropriate. The Applicant

Page 3 Para 3.3

The Applicant also complains
about the lack of support he
says he received from Post
Office. He says that he
requested help on “several
occasions” both by letter and
by calling the Helpline,
asserting that, in his opinion,
“they would assist up to a
certain point and then would
ignore him’. In describing the
Applicant's experiences of the
Helpline, the Applicant's
Professional Advisor says, in
the CQR, “whilst he felt
comfortable with the advice the
Horizon helpline provided him,
the Helpline could only assist
with what he described as
“immediate things”, adding that
they would “often refer him to a
different department rather
than deal with him”. Post
Office states that "the
unsatisfactory level of service
experienced by the Applicant
prior to April 2012 was
addressed by way of the
apology and explanation made
in Post Office's letter dated 21
May 2012 (Doc 006) sent on
behalf of the Chief Executive".

Page 5-6 Para 4.1

In its POIR, Post Office says

4A_32763924_1

POL-0019248

POL00022769

gives no detail regarding how he
reached the conclusion that
neither he nor his wife was
responsible for the £500.00 loss
experienced or what type of
transaction the losses are thought
to have related to.

Post Office rejects the Applicant's
claim that he had no option but to
pay back the missing money. It
would have been open to the
Applicant to dispute any shortfall if,
as he claims, he knew that neither
he nor his wife was responsible.
However, there is no evidence of
the Applicant disputing the
shortfalls either in the NBSC call
logs or in any correspondence
available to Post Office.

Page 10 Para 3 Shortfall of
£373.06 arising when a balance
was undertaken on 17 August
2011.

A shortfall of £373.06 appears to
have been declared when a
balance was carried out on 17
August 2011

Records show that a call to NBSC
was placed the same day (Doc
003) stating that the branch had a
loss of £373.06 and asking how to
settle it. Records show that NBSC
advised the caller to settle the
amount centrally.

The Applicant claims that his wife
placed two calls to NBSC and that
she requested that the branch

that a discrepancy in the sum
of £147.12 arose because the
Applicant accepted payment
for a water bill but failed to
obtain and/or supply the
counterfoil to Santander. It
says that a further discrepancy
in the sum of £3,873.05
occurred because the
Applicant failed to follow the
proper ‘cut off’ procedure. In
his comments on the
previously issued draft of this
report the Applicant states that
"I told P.O. of my error but
enclosed payment and a letter
of apology with the account
That would have been in
October 2011 I think. A week
later I submitted the counterfoil
also with a letter". He also
states "At no stage, and I ask
P.O. to produce my October
account, was there a shortfall
of £3,873". This resulted in the
report sent to Santander
showing figures that were
greater than those recorded on
Horizon. Post Office also says
that it issued Transaction
Corrections (TC Invoices) in
relation to both errors, and that
once those TCs were
processed, the branch's
accounts showed a shortfall of
£4,020.17. It says that, as
soon as the sources of both
accounting errors were
identified, two more TCs were
issued (TC Credits) in order to
bring the accounts back into
balance. In his comments on
the previously issued draft of
this report the Applicant states

accounts be checked as the
Applicant and his wife did not fee!
that they were responsible for the
loss (see the applicant's letter to
FSC of 5 September 2011 at CQR
Tab 19). However, the Applicant's
recollections are contrary to NBSC
call records and there is no
evidence of such requests being
made. The NBSC call logs
showing only a request for
assistance regarding the process
for settling a discrepancy centrally.

Page 11

However, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary the
explanation for the loss of £373.06
declared on 17 August 2011 is that
there was an actual shortage of
cash or stock at the branch
meaning that value of actual cash
and stock in the branch was less
than the amounts that should have
been held according to Horizon.
Cash declaration records (Doc
004) show that the Applicant was
aware of a cash discrepancy as
early as 1 August 2011 and that
each cash declaration for which a
variance check was performed up.
to and including 17 August
showed a loss. Despite this, there
are no records of calls being
placed to NBSC between 1 August
and 17 August 2011 querying the
cause of the shortfall.

Page 11 Para C
The Applicant states that he

requested help from Post Office on
several occasions via both letter

that "I requested evidence
which didn't come and several
phone calls took place
between Chesterfield and
myself and this is when I found
(later the following year) that
Nikki [Cook] had left the
business in the October I
made the error for £147". He
also explains in some detail
the process that he followed in
processing this payment and
states that "I did not err in this
region. My accounts balanced.
That's why I was happy when I
was accused by Cook. Before
the end of the 2011 the Post
Office had my Giro account
three time before Cook
accused me. There wasn't a
shortfall. There wasn't a gain".

Page 6 Para 4.6

In relation to the Applicant's
suggestion that he was helped
up to a certain point and then
ignored, or passed on to a
different department, Post
Office says that the Applicant
made regular calls to its
National Business Support
Centre (NBSC) Helpline. It
says that the vast majority of
the Applicant's enquiries were
dealt with at the time of the
call, and that where the issue
could not be dealt with over
the phone, only then was
Applicant referred to a different
department. It says that the
reason for referring the issue
to other departments was to
“ensure the Applicant received

and NBSC. The Applicant claims
that Post Office would assist up to
a certain point and then would
ignore him. He claims that NBSC
were only able to deal with
“immediate things” and would
often refer him to another
department rather than deal with
him.

the specialist support
appropriate to the issues being
experienced’.

Page 7-8 Para 4.12

We consider it to be clear that
the Applicant did not
understand the effect of
settling centrally, but we are
unsure as to the reasons why
that should have been the
case. It is possible that this
‘settle centrally and dispute’
option had not been explained
when the old method (whereby
disputed amounts could be
held in a branch suspense
account) was discontinued.
This explanation is consistent
with what we have learned
from other Applicants in the
Mediation Scheme, some of
whom have reported that they
were not aware of that option.
In its comments on the
previously issued draft of this
report Post Office states that
“NBSC call logs show that the
Applicant did request
assistance regarding the
process for settling a
discrepancy centrally. If the
Applicant did not understand
the effect of settling centrally,
he could have asked NBSC.
The process of settling
centrally and its effect is also
covered in the manuals
available to every
Subpostmaster and via
Horizon Online Help".

Post Office says that “in the
absence of evidence to the
contrary the explanation for the
loss of £373.06 declared on 17
August 2011 is that there was
an actual shortage of cash or
stock at the branch”. It says
that its cash declaration
records show that the
Applicant was aware of a cash
discrepancy as early as 1
August 2011 and that each
cash declaration for which a
variance check was performed
up to and including 17 August
showed a loss. It says that
despite this, there are no
records of calls being placed to
NBSC between 1 August and
17 August 2011 querying the
cause of the shortfall. It adds
that ‘the Applicant had access
to NBSC and Horizon Online if
he wished to investigate the
cause of the shortfall, but he
does not appear to have used
either of those services’.

Page 11-12 Findings

The Applicant made regular
calls to NBSC from his
appointment and throughout
his tenure. Call logs (Doc 003)
show a total of 1543 calls
between 9 November 2000
(the earliest date for which
records are available) and 21
December 2013 and show that
the vast majority of enquiries
were dealt with at the time of
the call. Where the issue could
not be dealt with over the

phone the Applicant was
referred to a different
department e.g. Horizon
Service Desk for Horizon
equipment issues or the Post
Office cash management team
for issues relating to the supply
of cash. Post Office has a
tiered approach to its support
services and does not agree
with the Applicant's claim that
NBSC staff referred him to
other departments to avoid
dealing with the issues
themselves. In fact the reason
for referring the issue to other
departments was to ensure the
Applicant received the
specialist support appropriate
to the issues being
experienced.

Page 14 — Problems in 2011

NBSC call logs (Doc 003) and
records of calls to the Horizon
Service Desk (Doc 009) show
that the branch experienced
issues with Horizon in July and
August 2011. Records show
that there were some
occasions when the recovery
process was used for
transactions that did not
complete because of an
interruption to the power
supply or loss of connectivity
to the Post Office Data Centre.

show a total of 16 calls during
the Applicant's tenure relating
to the branch being short of
cash, 4 in 2006, 3 in 2008, 5 in
2009, 3 in 2012 and 1 in 2013.
Cash is supplied from Post
Office cash centres to
branches based on what the
branch declares it has on hand
compared to the expected
cash movements (data from
recent Horizon transactions)
until the branch’s next
scheduled delivery day.
Shortages of cash can be
caused by a variety of reasons
such as:

© — The failure of a cash
delivery to arrive on
time

* ~~ Higher than normal
customer withdrawals

* — Branch fails to order
extra cash for a
known peak period
ie. prior to. a Bank
Holiday

* — Branch does not
declare cash on hand
accurately on Horizon

* — Alarge deposit
customer stops using
the branch

It is not clear from available
records what caused the
Applicant's branch to run short
of cash. The calls to NBSC
suggest that the Applicant
believed he was not being sent
enough however this could be
for a number of the reasons
listed above. Whilst Post Office

not in itself cause the branch
to experience losses.

July 2001 - Mrs Stewart states that
she recorded a loss of £7,000. The
Helpline was contacted, but the
amount was not put into Suspense.
Telephone logs are required.

August 2012 - Mrs Stewart
recorded a loss of £6,000. Mrs
Stewart stated that she was “too
frightened” to contact the Helpline,
as on previous occasions when she
did the amount increased and she
had lost confidence in the Helpline.

Page 7 Para 3.8:

No further losses were discovered
at the branch until June 2010 when
Mrs Stewart discovered a difference
when balancing. She contacted the
Helpline and they instructed her to
carry out certain actions on the
Horizon system, giving her step-by-
step instructions and talking her
through the process. Mrs Stewart
cannot recall the instructions she
was given but she followed them
exactly as she considered the
Helpline staff to be experts in the
matter. When she had completed
the steps, the difference had not
changed.

Mrs Stewart was told to put the
amount into Suspense. The

not to worry about the amount in
Suspense as this was the correct
procedure. She was told that the
Horizon system would reverse the
error and in time, everything would
be resolved. The difference never
corrected.

Page 15 Para 4.14:

Mr El Kasaby also believes that
advice from the Helpline staff after
the initial loss in June 2010 was
discovered also contributed to the
amount. Mrs Stewart states she
contacted the helpline, followed
their instructions, yet the amount of
losses increased.
