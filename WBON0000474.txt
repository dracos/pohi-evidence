Hi All

In prep for drafting POL's defence, there are a number of issues in the GPOC (attached) which Andy has identified as
needing further investigation. Owain is also going to review the GPOC to see if there are any other areas which

counsel would like

us to investigate but below is the starting list.

Timeframes — Tony is unavailable from May onwards so looking to have these bottomed out by mid-April where

possible.

I think this is who is actioning each of these but shout if otherwise!

Paragraph in Issue Who
draft GPOC
12 What was the pre-Horizon accounting system? lAmy
15 Can a postmaster dispute a Transaction Acknowledgement? jonny
30 What are Post Office's investigation processes when a shortfall arises? _IAmy
36, Are shortfalls caused by Post Office's suspense accounts? lonny / And:
64.5 Are postmasters able to access information whilst suspended? lAmy
66.4 Ts there any type of accounting error by a postmaster that would not jonny / Andy — suspense account
cause a real-loss to Post Office? jelement
Amy — to discuss with Kath /
