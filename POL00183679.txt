All

Message received from Alan Bates below. His main concern is our proposed cut-off date being too soon. This is no
surprise, we put this in as a negotiation starting point. I’ve asked 2" Sight for their views — we'll move forward from
there.

Subject: "Raising Concerns with Horizon" Document - Amended

Simon, I have attached an amended copy of the document. In order to see the amendments I have underlined in
bold wherever an amendment appears or a word has been omitted, although in one case, I have annotated in blue a
comment.

The only major change has been the date used throughout the document, 31% December 2012. If we had been
starting back in July that would have been acceptable, but I have been advised by our external expert that it is now far
too short a period for any meaningful process to take place. Has 2"Sight agreed to the timescale? On advice, I have
included a date of 31° March 2013 as the earliest possible closure date, and it may well be worth obtaining the views
of 2™Sight on this point, especially bearing in mind that the whole of December is normally lost to Christmas mailings.

Please let me know if the suggested amendments are acceptable or contact me to discuss them further if that would
assist you.

Regards
Alan
