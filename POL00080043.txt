Hi Rod

Ihave just received this from Lin and I note that Mr Frank Holt form Glenmoriston Stores is named as one of the
claimants on the list. Mr Holt is still suspended and we are in the middle of a long drawn out conduct case with him. To
this end I actually sent him an invite to an informal meeting yesterday to discuss the findings of a report completed by
Wendy Mahoney, Case Review, My question is should I carry on this case as normal or should I stop what I
am doing at the present time?’ in this case is the subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal and the
indications from security are that the case will proceed to court.

Your advice would be appreciated.

Thanks
Robert

Subject: IMPORTANT EMAIL RE: PRESERVATION OF DOCUMENTS / HIGH COURT LITIGATION

IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ITS CONTENTS ARE COMPLIED
WITH.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS IN RESPECT OF ITS CONTENTS OR EFFECT THEN PLEASE CONTACT ELISA LUKAS OR
RODRIC WILLIAMS IN LEGAL SERVICES.

As you may be aware, 91 mostly former postmasters have issued a High Court claim against Post Office Limited
advancing allegations about the Horizon IT system and Post Office’s engagement with them. A list of the 91 claimants is
attached, and we have been told that others may join the claim in due course.

Now that Post Office has seen the claim, you and your team members must familiarise yourselves with Post Office’s
document disclosure obligations, and ensure that you comply with them. Please therefore circulate this email to your
team members who may hold documents related to the claimants and/or their claim.

In short, the three crucial document rules that must be followed are:
(1) You must not destroy or delete any documents which may be relevant to the claim. In particular, make sure
that any automatic deleting/archiving systems are suspended now until further notice. If you have any question

about whether a document is relevant, please contact Legal Services and preserve the document in the
meantime;

(2) You must not amend any existing documents which may be relevant to the claim. For example, do not make
handwritten notes on existing documents or try to change the content of a document; and

(3) You must recognise that any documents that you create from now on may have to be disclosed to the other
side in the case. If in any doubt, think about whether you would be happy for the email or document to be read
out loud in court.

I attach a more detailed note on this, which can be used as a reference going forward.

If you have any questions concerning these requirements, please contact Elisa Lukas or me for further guidance.
With thanks for your cooperation, Rodric
