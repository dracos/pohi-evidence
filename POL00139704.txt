Subject: Horizon Weekly Report, Action Log Matrix Update - CLOSE ATM Router Upgrade Issue

The “ATM Issue - New routers” issue (Item 10, Action Log Matrix Horizon, Updated following call on: 4 September
2013) can be closed on the following basis:

1. The issue concerns connectivity/timing out/freezing, e.g. a customer withdrawing cash has their account
debited but the ATM disconnects before the cash is dispensed.
2. If that cash is then dispensed once connection is re-established, but the customer has left, then the cash is
either:

a. retracted into a separate compartment in the ATM; or

b. taken from the ATM before it is retracted.
3. The customer should raise this with their bank, e.g. “my account was debited but I didn’t get the cash.”
4. Customers may also raise the issue directly with the affected PO branch.
5. PO branches will then raise this via the Wincor Helpdesk, where it is escalated through POL’s ATM
Installation Manager (Kevin Cox) and Service Manager (Wayne Cowan).
6. Wayne Cowan (POL ATM Manager) says the issue cannot create a negative balance for the branch.
7. Where dispensed cash is retracted, the issue could create a positive balance at the branch (i.e. give the
branch more cash), given that the branch will be holding the cash which should have been dispensed to the
customer.
