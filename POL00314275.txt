Hi Mark

There is only one process Fujitsu can use which is the insertion of auditable additional transactions described in the
document so the words below must have been a loose business description for a meeting with non-technical
attendees.

Thanks Pete,

That sounds promising. Though we will need to map the lines SS have hung their assertions on, to the points made in
the paper i.e. what process FJ are referring to when they state “The data can be corrected by adjusting the
appropriate opening figures and BTS data that relates to the current TP” etc

Pete,

In preparation for this morning’s call, attached is a paper we had previously prepared with James Davidson in relation
to Remote Access. It never got finalised or shared with Second Sight. It may be that this forms the basis for the answer
we provide to Second Sight. But let’s discuss on the call.

This may be useful to have to hand for the call @11am. Especially given it seems likely SS query relates to the BTP
process.
