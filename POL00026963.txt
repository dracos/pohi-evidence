Business Improvement Programme — CEO POL Board Speaker Notes.
26.11.2013

e The role of the Branch Training and Support Programme as part
of Project Sparrow has to date been to:

* Understand and map the “as-is” process for training and
supporting our branches

* Identify the gaps and risks with the current experience
* Suggest improvements to address those gaps and risks

* Map the “to-be” process for how we should be training and
supporting our branches, which is underpinned by a vision
and set of guiding principles for how we should treat our
agents.

© The guiding principles for how we interact with Spmrs are:
* Treated with dignity & respect at all times
* Stand in Spmr’s shoes
* Right first time

These principles underpin the Programme’s approach and will
determine policies and processes going forward.

e It has become evident during this piece of work that the scope
of the Programme needs to be wider to ensure that the required
cultural change is embedded within business as usual within
the Post Office. This is not simply a network consideration
but is essentially the DNA of the Post Office.

e The Programme therefore as now been renamed the Business
Improvement Programme (BIP) and whilst the scope of this is
currently being determined it will as a minimum include a
review of the life cycle of the Spmr and all touch points with
the business to ensure we support our physical network from
not only an operational perspective but also and perhaps more
importantly from an engagement perspective. Recommendations on
the organisation’s structure will also be an output of the
Programme.

e The Business Improvement Programme will operate with a formal
programmatic approach supported by the necessary governance
and resource. The rationale for this is that a cultural change
in behaviours will be required and therefore the right support
in each of the workstreams and business areas will be needed

to ensure that the changes are managed effectively and
successfully embedded within the organisation. Whilst this is
work in progress the governance structure will broadly be —

Steering Group;

Programme Board; Work stream Project Board.

e Nine workstreams have been identified and are currently in the
stage of mapping the “to be” policies and processes. The table
below outlines the respective work streams, what they are
trying to achieve and what needs to be change to make the

improvements.

Timeline

* An interim progress report will be produced w/c 2° Dec - this
is essentially the high level “to be” policies and processes
for the nine workstreams

e The Business Improvement Programme scope will be determined
and agreed with Programme sponsor, Kevin Gilliland w/c 9 Dec.
The Programme milestone plan will be mapped out at this point.

Branch User Forum

* The purpose of the Branch User Forum is “to provide a way for
sub-postmasters and others to raise issues and insights around
business processes, training and support directly feeding into
the organisation’s thinking at the highest level. The forum is
a forward looking mechanism to ensure the business processes
and approaches are fit for purpose for users and are in
keeping with Post Office behaviours and values.

e The inaugural meeting took place on 19** Nov. The purpose of
this meeting was to set the context; reiterate the purpose;
agree ways of working and of course get to know each other.

e The Forum members are:

* Chair - Angela Van Den Bogerd

* IT & Change ~ Dave Hulbert

* Network - Michael Larkin

* Commercial - Paul Brown

* Spmr Bryan Hewson, Amble Post Office (Mains)

+ Spmrdohn Shepherd, Gilberdyke Post Office (mailwork with
satellite outreach & Local)

+ SpmrkKaren Goldthorpe, Manor Post Office

+ SpmrSrisvanthini Sriskanthvel, Hollington Post Office

* Bhavna Desai, Newton Post Office

* Wendy Burke, Dunmurry Post Office

* Bob Taylor, BM Gloucester Crown

* Mike Jones, Crown Colleague, Bootle

e In summary an excellent first meeting with the Spmrs & Crown
staff being totally committed to what they saw as the business
reaching out to the branch network and genuinely wanting to
break down the barriers and make a difference.

e The meetings will be held on a monthly basis (at least for the
first few months as determined by volume of input) with the
quarterly meeting being held in the regions to enable a wider
participation from the network.
