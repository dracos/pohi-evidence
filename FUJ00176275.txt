FUJITSU SERVICES BUSINESS OWNER: Mick Reynolds

POST OFFICE BUSINESS OWNER: Dionne Harvey

SUBMISSION TO POST OFFICE DATE: 30" March 2021

SUMMARY OF WORK:

Post Office have requested under RTQSRO003106 (previously RTQSRO002349 and
RTQSR0002456) that Fujitsu Services continue to preserve data (including Post Office
Personal Data) generated on the HNG-X System as per the previous work orders (CT2616a &
Cw0251a) until 30 April 2022.

Business Case:
The audit system stores data, depending on its type, for a default period of 7 years or 18
months.

Post Office previously requested Fujitsu Services under various CTs and CWOs to retain audit
data beyond the default periods until 30-Apr-2021. The original purge date was 12-Oct-2014.

Post Office have requested Fujitsu Services to further extend the data retention period until
30-April-2022.

The purge retention period is expressed as a number of hours and is therefore set to 66,192
(i.e. 24 * 2758 days - the difference between 01-May-2022 00:00 and 12-Oct-2014 00:00)

The Eternus storage deletion prevention date is not being changed. This means that any
audit data older than 7 years or 18 months is not protected by the Eternus deletion
prevention.

Summary of Wo!
A configuration file exists which defines how long data should be kept beyond the standard.
The configuration will be changed so that purging does not start until 1 May 2022. To be

precise the NumExtraHoursToKeepTracks parameter will be increased from 57480 (6.56
years) to 66192 (7.56 years). This change will be tested in development and test because
although the configuration file has been modified several times before it is always possible
that some system limit will be hit (integer overflowing or the like).

In development there exist VMs representing all the machines in the audit solution. They can
be snapshot. They can as a complete set be advanced forward in time. With the changed
configuration file in place they will be advanced forward in time running the purger and it
will be confirmed that data is not purged until it is expected to be. After the tests are finished
the VMs will be set back to their normal working snapshot.

In the Fujitsu Services test department they are not able to move machines forward in time.
However, they can alter the “Until date” and “Until time” of a few tracks in the sealer
database and confirm that an attempt is only made to purge them if that is sufficiently in the
past (66192 hours in the past to be precise). An attempt to purge them will be logged in the
daily purger log. Note that due to Eternus data protection the data may well not really be
deleted. It will only be really deleted if the “Until date” and “Until time” were genuinely in
the past anyway.

CHANGE WORK ORDER DELIVERABLES:
Fujitsu Services will:
¢ Stop Horizon data purging in May 2021 and will delay this purging until 1 May 2022.

NB: Post Office will notify Fujitsu Services if a further delay in data purging is
needed.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME:

Exact dates for progression of this change to be agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services upon approval of this CWO and supply of a valid Purchase Order.

Changes and/or re-prioritisations of entries in this schedule may be required as a result of
potential impacts/conflicts relating to resource and infrastructure caused by this CWO.

In the event that changes to delivery timescales are identified by Fujitsu Services or Post
Office, such changes shall be discussed and agreed at the Demand Planning Forum and
managed via change control. However, the work shall be completed at least 2 weeks before
the date when purging would otherwise begin.
