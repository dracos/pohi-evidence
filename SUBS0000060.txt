Dear Sir or Madam,

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry — Application forms relating to the Historical Shortfall Scheme
and the Interim Compensation Scheme

We refer to the email from the Inquiry on 21 June 2022 whereby the Inquiry requested copies of all
application forms utilised by applicants who had made an application under either the Historical
Shortfall Scheme ("HSS") or the Interim Compensation Scheme for claimants whose Horizon related
convictions have been quashed.

HSS

As acknowledged by the Inquiry in its email of 21 June, annexed to our client's written submissions
on compensation dated 31 May 2022 were two versions of the application form for the HSS. We
understand that these were the only versions of the application form that were published by the
Scheme for use by applicants wishing to make a claim under the HSS and, accordingly, have not re-
enclosed copies of these forms.

For completeness, we understand that a small number of HSS applications were submitted based
on Word or other file formats which generally sought to replicate the substantive content of these
forms as published by the Scheme.

Interim compensation for claimants with quashed Horizon related convictions

We enclose two versions of the application form that is used by applicants to submit requests for
interim payment of compensation following the quashing of their Horizon related convictions. We
understand that these are the only versions of the form that have been used for this purpose thus
far.
