As discussed, could you please pass this to Alisdair. Many thanks Belinda
Dear Alisdair

I understand that Chris Aujard has spoken to you about the discussion at yesterday’s Working Group meeting of the
Complaint and Mediation Scheme. For some months, Second Sight and the independent chair of the Working Group —
Sir Anthony Hooper — have been asking for information on the operation of the Post Office’s Suspense Account. Put
simply, this amounts to:

e How much is absorbed into Post Office P&L from the suspense account each year; and

e How much of that relates to money which is/may be properly due to Subpostmasters.

The nub of the issue is whether it is possible for a Subpostmaster/Subpostmasters to have made good a loss in branch
or held accountable for a loss where it later transpires that the money was not owed therefore Post Office gains.

Please find attached a more detailed note on Second Sight’s questions which you will see ask for rather more detail. It
has become essential that we address these questions as a matter of urgency (although it could be that we cannot
provide all the information Second Sight have requested in the attached document). The Chair of the Working Group
is now pressing to provide answers as he has been asking for answers for some time. I’d be very grateful of you could
give this your urgent consideration.

In addition, we have taken an action from the Working Group to organise a meeting between Second Sight and POL
finance on these issues. I’d be grateful if you would also urgently consider who might attend such a meeting.
Thank you in anticipation

Belinda
