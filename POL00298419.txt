Lesley, Andy

Following our meeting last week, please find attached a revised draft letter to Fujitsu which tries to pick up the points
we discussed.

Please let me have any comments — we can do this face to face if that is easier for you. I would be particularly
grateful if we could expand a little on what we would like from Fujitsu to make Horizon more user-friendly (final page,

second bullet point).

Kind regards, Rodric
