Revision of Wording in Service Description CCDs

SVM/SDM/SD/0017 - Security Management Service: Service Description

Paragraph 2.1.19 is amended, as follows;

“2.1.19 MONFHEY REPORTING

2. 1 Monthly Reporting

Information Governance staff provide a monthly Information Security Reporting Pack
which informs the Management Team, as an input to the Fujitsu Services POA ISMR, of
progress towards IS027001 compliance, results of audits and current risk status. It is
intended that the details contained in this report will expand over time. This includes
reports from the Operational Security Team such as a summary of the types and numbers
of incidents that may impact on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of POA
systems.

This report, together with report sub-sets contained in the service review book, is
provided to the customer on a monthly basis.

For the avoidance of doubt, this element of Security Management Service is limited to
reporting in respect of the HNG-X Application for those elements of the HNG-X System
migrated to Post Office Cloud.

2.1.19.2 Weekly Reporting

Security operations resources shall provide a weekly report to Post Office detailing the
remote access made by the Fujitsu Services support users to RDT and Live Post Office
Branch counter systems.

The report will be provided by Fujitsu Services on a weekly basis and consist of the
