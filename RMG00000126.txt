Incident Reporting Period: Periods 5 and 6
Injuries Sustained to RMG Employees or Customers

2 August. Upper Holloway Delivery Office, London, N19. As the postman approached the
Post Office in Hornsey Road to make a delivery, he was punched on the side of the face by
one man who snatched the Special Delivery remittance pouch from him and ran off. The
postman was taken to hospital and it was found that he had a hairline fracture to his skull.
Following 2 weeks sick absence the postman returned to work and reassigned to light
duties. The stolen remittance pouch contained £5,000 in cash within two SD items. Police
enquiries continue.

1 September. East Belfast Delivery Office, Northern Ireland. A driver postman parked the
RM vehicle in a car park by a shopping centre and went to the rear of the vehicle to obtain
the items due for delivery. As he opened the rear doors, he was hit several times on the
back of the head by one person before being bundled into the rear of the van. The robber
proceeded to steal 9 Special Delivery items and normal mail before running away. The
postman attended hospital for a check up and was released later that day.

16 September. Winchmore Hill and Palmers Green Delivery Office, London, N21. A
postman on delivery heard an elderly member of the public shouting for help as his house
was being burgled. As the postman went to assist, four men ran from the house and one of
them hit the postman in the face causing a split lip.

September

Although the sub postmistress was tied up during the Ryton on Dunsmore incident and
received minor bruising to her arms and legs, there were no other injuries sustained during
any of the incidents detailed above.

During the incident at Fallowfield Sub Post Office, a CiT delivery officer was threatened and
cash stolen — further details at the section entitled Cash in Transit.

Cash In Transit

There were 5 incidents in total during the reporting period with three of these incidents
resulting in a cash loss of £28,897.59. One of the incidents was an attempted snatch and
further details in relation to two of the incidents are detailed below.

2 September. Fallowfield Post Office. Three men entered the secure area after threatening
the counter assistant and waited for the CiT delivery. As the CiT delivery officer entered the
secure area, one man threatened to douse him in petrol if he didn’t hand over the iBox
containing £1,000. The iBox together with working cash from the Post Office was stolen
before the men fled the office.

2 September. Farringdon Road Crown Office, London, EC1. The CiT escort had collected

several bags from the office when he returned to make further collections. As he
approached the siphon door, he was confronted by one man brandishing a large knife. The
escort stood back and the suspect entered the siphoned area and grabbed 3 RM sacks
containing Special Delivery items before fleeing the office to a waiting vehicle. Although
both the Post Office staff and the CiT crew member were shaken, there were no injuries
sustained during the incident. The three stolen SD sacks contained 62 items with a
compensation loss potential of £155,000. Police enquiries continue.

Audit Shortages

Since the last report, audit activity across the Post Office network has identified shortages
at 13 branches totalling £162,124.63. Of the total shortage amount, £ 27,279.35 has been
recovered and 7 members of staff have been suspended pending further investigation.
These figures are likely to increase as one office, Bruce Grove, suffered a fire destroying
information and the audit shortage figure is yet to be determined.

Other Incidents to Note

7 September. Milltown Sub Post Office, Belfast. An attempt to obtain cash from the office
by staging a hoax hostage situation was safely resolved without any injuries or cash losses.

BT Occupational
Disease Test Case —
Nov 2008

BT have claimed, as a test case, an 1.

indemnity/contribution in relation to an
asbestos claim settled for £119,000 together
with a declaration that liability to compensate
telecom employees who ceased employment
by The Post Office Corporation prior to 1
October 1981 (appointed date under the
British Telecommunications Act 1981) rests
with Royal Mail.

Liability in relation to these ex —- employees
concerns mainly the contracting of asbestos
related diseases as well as some industrial
deafness cases. Some asbestos related
diseases (such as mesothelioma) have a

BT succeeded in this case in the Court of Appeal and RMG was refused leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court in February 2011. This case is now therefore concluded. RMG retained
auditors, Towers Watson, their best estimate of the potential for industrial diseases claims
against Royal Mail as circa £75m (unadjusted for the time value of money). Using a
discount rate of 5% as a proxy for the risk free rate (based on government bond rates for
the term of the provision), a provision of £30m has been raised at the year end. This will
be reassessed on an annual basis as Royal Mail gains more experience of the level of
claims received.

Oct 2011: Provisions in the accounts will continue to be made (and will be revisited)
and the discount will be unwound going forward. As the test case litigation has
concluded, this item will be removed from the next report.

particularly long period between the exposure
and the development of the disease (the
disease takes 15 to 20 years to develop, the
amount of time between exposure and
development is between 8 and 50 years). The
heaviest period of exposure was between
1955 and 1975. We have received 80 cases
since 2001.

Amazon — October 2.

2011

Amazon has claimed that Royal Mail over 3.
charged it for 16 months (from 1 April 2010 to
31 July 2011) by £7.2m.

Oct 2011: Although litigation has been threatened, Amazon has not yet issued a
legal claim and settlement discussions are underway.

Manpower — Octobed.

2010

A routine audit of contractual compliance in 5.
2010 revealed serious problems with
Manpower's charging practices. The amount
of the claim is up to £24m, although certain
heads of claim are stronger than others.

Oct 2011: A mediation will take place on 11 October. If a settlement is not reached
at the mediation we will use the next few months to seek the best possible
settlement offer. If an acceptable deal is not achieved we will seek authority to
issue Court proceedings after the critical Christmas period.
