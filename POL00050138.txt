7.44 JW I just wish I had as I said previously hindsight's a wonderful thing I just wish I'd

made more of it in the early days with Paul and later with Keith and said you know

this (inaudible)

82
845 JW shown Branch Trading Statement dated 11" April 2007 and 16" May 2007
and he confirmed it to be his signature on page 3.
8.29 GT And the amount shown as cash on hand on that occasion is £26,363.18p. Would

that be a true reflection the 26,363.18 of what cash would have been in the office
at that time?

Jw As previously said it would have been an inflated, inflated fi

GT Right ok with that figure being 26,000 then I would imagine that clearly back in last
April you wouldn’t have been able to have been inflating it by 20, £25,000 or so
because it would have suggested you had no cash in the office.

Jw No cash in the safe,

GT So what sort of amount would you have been looking at being short at that time
and what's your sort of cash holdings on a general daily basis?

JW Normally you hold about 14, that's what I've been advised my cash holdings should

be around 14, 14 and half thousand.

_—————

GT Right so I mean even at that time if it was 14 then we would have looked at an
—_——EoeEOeeree en

inflated figure of perhaps about just 12 at that time?

Jw Yeah
——
GT Which would suggest that maybe from April or May well actually 16" May 07 to

September it's increased quite considerably so 12,000 to 27 15,000

JW 15,000
oT In about the last year or so? (fk

Jw Yeah

GT Which is obviously a lot more than we were suggesting I thought it was more of the

you know every year it was around the sort of same amount 5,000?

JW No no no some it’s, it has increased slightly that’s for sure I don’t know whether

there's another one we could just look at in-between those probably between those

28, 34, 29, 36, 41, 34, 42, 46, 41, 39, 40, 48, 41 so yeah certainly over the lest
6,7 8 months it's gone up a bit and that may have Teflection ip that we've got 1,064
as you talked about on tag first gatement we looked at. £6.70 that one, 1,047
short on that one, 377, 565, 1300 short and that one is g particular large one
which I'll show you that one as well. Well that one is £2,306.99 short and the
month before £1590.58 short so this one being a 4 week period we're looking now
at 2.306 over a 4 week.
? Have you mentioned the.
GT Yes we're just going to go through that in a moment. Obviously we're looking at 5,
£600.00 a week on our monthly trading period which is from the period of the 9"
January 20 to 13" February 2008 and the cash on hand there carried forward
states 46,795.60 so again would that be a true reflection of the cash that would

have been in?

JW Same answer as I gave.

GT Same answer it would have been an inflated figure?

JW Yeah. BZ

GT Ok any recollection as to why you would be £2,306.99 short in that particular

trading period ‘cos obviously it's quite a bit higher than the other?

Jw Yeah and it's early part of the yeah isn't it it's January, not that I can off the top of
my head think of. As I said the thing is or other things you can check back through
the system the system is very good and they only need to check back but to me
there that sounds as though there's one transaction or a couple of transactions that

have not been done perhaps correctly which has I mean that's a big jump.

GT Right and that’s again your signature?
Jw My signature.

JW Yes I realise where I was going wrong there. WM
GB (inaudible)
Jw Because there are 2 options on the screen there's the ‘settle centrally’ screen and

then there's the ‘make good cash’ and I wasn't aware that the ‘settle centrally’
button to push would highlight, would highlight the problem that I'd had.

GB But you have to get authority to get it settled centrally anyway 2 a id they will you
know refer to what they call like a hardship case it's like Gary wast eal) to you
earlier, if you have a large discrepancy and you think ‘oh I've made a mistake I'm
pretty sure it's a girobank error I'm going to be £4,000 short at the moment but
when this error comes pack I'll be good but I can't afford to make it good at this
moment in time’ or for whatever reason, sometimes, I'm not saying all times
sometimes a decisions made where it will be settled through hardship i.e. settled

centrally and they would, you would effectively pay back through deductions in your

remuneration.
JW I wasn't aware of that,
GB But you would need to get authority for that so settling it at the branch making it at

the branch is how you should be doing it but of course you should be actually

putting the money in because you're telling the system you've made this good.

JW Yeah
GB And then that will effectively, Horizon will recalibrate the cash figure that you would

need to balance believing that you've actually put that money in whether you've

done it as a cash or whether you've done it by cheque

JW I understand what you're saying that's my mistake.
~~
GB But also the Post Office to use the general term Post Office might have set some

alarm bells ringing if you're actually showing the discrepancy that would have been
relevant to the accounts.

JW Yeah I understand where you're coming from. -
GB So if you'd have shown it when it first started £500 next one if you show it £1500

going forward going forward going forward until say maybe 3 months ago you show

£22,000 short then you show £25.000 short then you show £27,000 short I'm
pretty certain somebody in the Post Office would have been alerted to that fact long

before now but because

Jw Because I was operating the system incorrectly and I should have been putting it
thee.
17.25 cB Well you say that but to me you were hiding the actual true state of the accounts by

inflating the cash therefore somebody in the Post Office wouldn't have been alerted
to it. If you did want this person to be alerted whoever this person may be it was
BDM, somebody at the helpline, somebody at Chesterfield to be alerted (a) either
Mention it to somebody to one of your phone calls (b) contact the helpdesk, contact
the BDM or declare the true state of the accounts and trust me somebody would

have come out.

JW I understand where.
GB To have dealt with them.
JW. Yeah I understand what you're saying Graham yeah I understand what you're
saying.
GB Ok so have you inflated the cash figure so that it didn't alert somebody? I
JW Now
GB Right so what was the reasoning for just showing £1,000 short on the Trading

Statement for period 4 as oppose to showing it roughly £27,000.

JW Because it you, in my thinking, whether this is incorrect or not. if you had doctored
the figures which alright yes I have done on this, if you doctored the figures so this
bottom figure more or less lined up the same as being so many 3 quid adrift or
£4.00 adrift, in the event of an audit you would have been that much more cash
short.

GB Yeah but there’s an £1,000 on top of, instead of being, so basically the audit would
have found £26,000 discrepancy in the cash plus £1,000 further discrepancy which
hadn't been made good.

JW Yeah

GB So whether, so.
19.20 JW But because I was still declaring that that was the discrepancy I wrongly assumed

that somebody from Post Office would pick up the phone that you'd got a problem.

GB But because you're telling the system you're making it good the Post Office isn’t
concerned,

JW No, yes I wasn't aware of that.

GT And in the following week if you have a £300 discrepancy there's nobody going to

be looking at all this out of the 14,000 branches trust me they'll be no-one looking
at somebody showing £1,000 short if they're telling us this and they're making it
good. What they will be doing is if it suddenly becomes 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 8,000,

10,000
JW I understand where you're coming from.
GB Up to 27,000 we have the situation where somebody be alerted this branch appears

to be rolling losses and if we're not alerted certainly the 8BDM would have been
alerted and they'd have done a visit and if there looked to be anything untoward.
JW Yeah I understand what you're saying Graham, I'd thought the other not being

aware that that’s the way you should have done it.

20.20 GB Ok if you had have declared this £27,000 do you think somebody would have been
alerted to the fact there was a problem at your branch do you think that would have
set alarm bells ringing?

Jw I would hope so.

GB Ok and if it had, irrespective of what's going on here today. irrespective of that if it
had have set alarm bells ringing somebody would have then phoned you up or
somebody would have come out and visited you and said Mr. Wilson you need to
make this £27,000 don't you would they not have said that to you?

JW Mm.

GB Ok so by not declaring the £27,000 short which you should have done which was a
true state of the accounts you've effectively gained because you've then not had to
find that £27,000.

JW Yeah I understand what you're saying. The bit I can’t understand is how you can be

one week you know 6 grand and the next week you can be £8,000, £1,300 out

that's the bit, it's human error.

GB It's one of two reasons.
JW It can only be human error.
GB Either a general errors been made or somebody's taken that money and that's

either yourself or could be a member of staff, Who actually works in the Post Office

apart from yourself?
Jw Just Jane.

21.50 4W states Jane Robinson has worked at the Post Office for 26 years working
Monday to Thursday mornings serving behind the counter. She is not involved in
Trading Statements and cash declarations. He always does the end of day work
and weekly balance. JW confirmed he has had time off in the school holidays when

Michael Cowling covers.

23.57 GT So when you were away and you were off how did Michael deal with the balance
and the cash account and the cash declarations and that did you instruct him that
there was monies missing that had to be inflated to enter?

Jw I told him that we were short in the cash but how, I don't, I didn’t ever check his,

because he used to do a Monday to a Friday I would never check and see what it

was on the, what he declared cash wise on the Wednesday.

25.10 GT So you've made him aware how did you make Michael aware then?
JW I just told him I just told him that there was short in the cash,
GT Right ok so did he ask you how am I going to account for that then or he didn’t ask
a thing?
Jw No, :
