Branch Support Programme - Terms of Reference Qe

The Weekly Steering Board needs to approve the improvements project TOR, by next

* Inexperienced trainers and gaps in training coverage
* Lack of centralised data to investigate specific cases

*Approach will be to organised the deliverables against mapping the entrance to exit journey for
subpostmasters, colleagues and multiple partners

«Key Deliverables required to address the issues within the report are:

Second Sight Proposal C2)

Objectives:

*Second Sight exit the investigation in the medium term

*Retain the confidence of key stakeholders (JFSA, JA, other MPs and SS)
*Reduce our investigation costs

*Create an enduring capability for independent investigation

*Keep aligned to the Parliamentary Statements

Proposal:

«Augment Second Sight with Post Office employees who will work under the oversight of Second Sight
*Propose that at first this is Angela and two assistants, with the view to grow the team to meet demand
*Second Sight step back from the detailed work (hence less cost) and play an oversight role

*The POL team establish a reputation for independence of mind, integrity, and thoroughness in their
investigations

*Once credibility of the POL team is established Second Sight give them the seal of approval and pass
the baton on to them.

As a reminder some of The continued input of Second Sight is.

Who is responsible for — our public commitments? Q

eminent ere

1. The creation of a working party to work collaboratively to complete Angela
the review of cases started by Second Sight last year. This would

examine the themes identified by Second Sight and consider all cases

brought forward by the JFSA and MPs, together with any new themes

which emerge from these cases. The JFSA have been invited to join

this working party.

2. A review chaired by an independent figure to determine how an Susan
independent safety net might be introduced to adjudicate in disputed

cases in the future. Again the JFSA and other stakeholders will be

invited to take part in this process.

3. A new Branch User Forum to provide a way for sub-postmasters Angela
and others to raise issues and insights around business processes,

training and support, directly feeding into the organisation’s thinking at

the highest level. A key task for this forum will be to review support

processes and training to ensure they meet the standards expected of

the Post Office.

Risks eS

A risk workshop is scheduled for 15" August. At the workshop we will
identity the key risks, their potential impact and mitigation plans. They
will be tracked each week at the weekly steering board.

Below are the risks highlighted in the board paper 26" July 2013:

*the reputational and brand risks that could emerge if we don’t handle the overall
resolution process carefully;

the risk to NTP if concerns around how we treat sub-postmasters leads to lower take-up
of the new models;

* the opportunity cost arising from the significant amount of senior management time that
will be taken up in handling this process;

* the potential destabilising impact on the NFSP, who are feeling exposed to the whole
issue because of accusations from some sup-postmasters that they failed to represent
their interests; and

« the process re-engineering that may be required for our IT, training and support
systems will add further complexity and risk to the existing transformation programme.
