Hi Alwen,
James did speak to me about Sparrow yesterday (so the brief was worthwhile, thank you).

> He said he had had no comeback to his letter to MPs proposing no meeting till the New Year - a good
sign.

> He and his wife - a judge - commented that "Tony" Hooper was "quirky" but there was no suggestion that
he wouldn't do a good job for us. Emma had devilled for him but a long time ago.

> James asked for a meeting with me once some cases had been through the mediation process he suggested
early December - I reserved the position for January because I wasn't sure what the timescale would be. I
would ideally like to do this when we have real substance to report on that, our role in prosecutions and
practical change re how we support SPMs.
