1. Introduction ;
This document defines the format of the files that will be used as interfaces between the BGT
Quantum System and Third party polling agencies.

1.1 Abbreviations

TPPA - Third party polling agencies
cs - Customer Specific
acc - Quantum Customer card

1.2 Definitions
Message Type : A 2 byte array of characters used to store a marker to show if the record is a header
or a trailer. It can only have two values
00" - Standard Header
‘99" — - Standard Trailer
Message Type is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL

File_Date : A 10 byte array of characters used to store a date in the format
YYYY/MM/OD

Note - Slashes are included.

Date is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL

File_Time : An 8 byte array of characters used to store a time in the format
HH:MM:SS

Note - Colons are included

Date is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL

Sequence Number : A 6 byte array of characters used to represent the sequence number of the file
For compatibility with the existing Quantum Sequence file layout, the first three digit will always be
padded with spaces

eg 576" represents the number 576.

Sequence number is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL..

Originator : A 12 byte array of characters used to mark the origin of the file . It can contain one of
four values(where s indicates an ASCII SPACE character)

BGTsssssssss" - British Gas Trading
PAYPOINTssss” - PayPoint
POCLssssssss” - Post Office Counters
LANDGsssssss” - Landis & Gyr

Onginator is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL

Destination : A 12 byte array of characters used to mark the origin of the file It can contain one of
four values(where s indicates an ASCII SPACE character)

BGTsssssssss - British Gas Trading a
PAYPOINTssss” - PayPoint
POCLssssssss" - Post Office Counters
LANDGsssssss" - Landis & Gyr

Destination is NOT a string, as it is not terminated with a NULL
Message Count: An 8 byte array of characters used to represent the number of records in the file -
e.g. "00003001" represents the number 3001
Some files contain different types of record (e.g. see definition of .DUP file definitions). in these
cases, extra information will be added after the Standard header.
Filler: A 42 byte array of characters used to mark the end of a file. ‘
Filler is not a string, as it is not terminated by a NULL
Auto/ Manual (applies to .DCM file only):
A two byte variable (integer) that is used to flag the event that caused the .DCM file to be created
from a .CMD

0 - .CMD file processed as timed event (automatic)

1 - .CMD file processed in response to user input
Time (Note - This is different from File_Time)
This is the time stored in DATAGYR format, and is used internally in some files.
It is defined as follows:
A 6 byte structure used to store a date and time

Byte year - Least significant byte

Byte month

Byte date

Byte hours

Byte minutes

Byte seconds - Most significant byte
An example will be given for clarity
The time - 15"" day 1" month 1997 year 14 hours 16 minutes 23 seconds
Viewed in HEX

Byte year - 97

Byte month - 01

Byte date - 15

Byte hours - 14

Byte minutes - 16

Byte seconds - 23

Viewed in DECIMAL

Byte year - 151

Byte month - 01

General

All offsets and sizes in this document are given in decimal. not hexadecimal

Byte Ordering

FUJ00003487
FUJ00003487

In some files. certain bytes will be reversed. This will only effect integers( 2 bytes) and long integers
(4 bytes). This will lead to the definition of two new types. Mot integer and Mot long integer

Integers

Example representation of 2.012 decimal in binary. In 16 bits (2 bytes) this number is represented as

folicws
0000011111011100

The table below will show the difference between the normal representation of this number. and it's

Mot integer representation

Type of integer Lowest Address Highest Address
Mot integer (Motorola format) 00000111 (Most significant 11011100 (Least significant
_ byte) byte)
*“ Regular integer (Intel format) 11011100 (Least significant 0000011 1(Most significant byte)

+ cai be seen from the above table. Mot integers are stored with the byte order reversed

The following files will be defined : -

The Command File (.CMD)

The Upload File (.DUP)

DATAGYR Regional Data (.DRD)

DATAGYR Customer Specific Message (.DCM)

CS Messages Ack (.CSM)

2.1 Standard Header and Trailer
The . DUP, .DRD and .DCM file will each start with a Standard Header and End with a Standard
Trailer. These are defined below:

Total size of Header - 54 bytes

“Checksum will be calculated by adding every byte in the file with the exception of the Standara
Header and Standard Trailer. 1.e. the total sum of the binary values stored in each byte. with this total
result stored as a 4 byte binary number.

The .CMD file does not have a Standard Header and Trailer

-CMD - record count will consist of the number of Commands in the file (number of binds + number of
CS Message adds + single eof command)

The following files will each have a standard Header and Trailer:
DUP - record count will consist of number of transactions + 1 Standard Header + 1 Standard Trailer

ORD - record count will consist of number of sets of regional data + 1 Standard Header + 1
Standard Trailer

DCM - record count will consist of CS Messages + 1 Standard Header + 1 Standard Trailer

The UTP2RMC files and the .LOG file will not start with the Standard Header and will not end with
the Standard Trailer.

-CMD File - General

The prefix of the .CMD file will be as follows

“PAYPXXX” or
“POCLXXX" or
“BGTXXX"™

Where XXX is the last three digits of the sequence number (the first three are padding

spaces)

FUJ00003487
FUJ00003487

The CMD File consists of CMD INFO, a series of text Command Messages. and a Standard Trailer

The start of the first message Is marked by the text string CMDSTART

The end of the series of Command Messages is defined by the text string CMDSTART EOF

CMDEND

All text not contained within these two delimiters is ignored

The end of the Command File is flagged to the parser by the text string

CMDSTART EOF
Three commands are supported

1) Meter Outiet bind

Forms a relationship between a meter and an outlet. The METER will be created in the

database if it is not already there.

2) CS Message Add

Add a CS Message to a meter

3) End of File Informs the parser that the CMD file has finished

The Command File will be sorted by Outlet order. Each CS Message add will be preceded by a Meter
Outlet bind command. This means the commands will occur in the following order .
(obviously. the outlet and meter numbers shown here are abbreviated representations) -

Meter outlet bind for meter 1 to outlet 1
Add CS message to meter 1
Meter outlet bind for meter 1 to outlet 1
Add CS message to meter 1
Meter outlet bind for meter 2 to outlet 2

Add CS message to meter 2

Log file (LOG)
4 log text file will be produced when the .CMD file is processed by the Agency/District PC
The prefix of the log file will be as follows
PAYPXXX" or
POCLXXX"
BGTXXX"
Where XXx is the last three digits of the sequence number (the first three are padding
spaces)

The prefix of the LOG file will correspond to the name of the .CMD File from which it was produced
It's format will be defined in the Agency PC Requirements Specification by Landis & Gyr. It will not
have a Standard Header and Trailer.
