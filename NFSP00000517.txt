@ Had been left to a junior Minister who had made a mess of
the issue.

@ A\l Party Group had insisted that a copy of the contract be
placed in the House of Commons Library, hence the
Federation becoming aware of its content.

@ The General Secretary had called those who signed the
contract to book for signing away their business and making
Subpostmasters futures gloomy or even worse.

@ Advice from Adam Crozier to keep the campaign going.
Took a Iot of time, but worth the investment.

@ The campaign had to be driven from the centre to keep it
focussed.

@ = if the Government were given a chink of light they would get
off the hook.

@ Alan Johnson was a ‘friend’ of the Federation who had met
with the General Secretary and Mr Peberdy the previous
week.

@ He had been embarrassed by what the DWP had done as
the DTI did not know that they were going to take action
without a POCA replacement in place before the pilots.

@ Alan Johnson was meeting following day with John Hutton I
and it appeared that Government realised they needed to be I
joined up on both POCA and Post Offices.

@ They had the acceptance of the Social Network Payment
and had extended the ‘no avoidable closures’ policy until
there was a strategy in place for the size and shape of the
network, along with an exit method for Subpostmasters with
compensation.

@ There would be a tough battle for compensation but the
Federation would not discuss closures without an offer. i

@ Closures may need to be staged over a 5 year period rather i
than in one big hit.

@ = The Federation had done a very good job for its members.

@ The ongoing letter writing campaign had worked well, with
one excellent Westminster Hall debate already and a further
debate on 22 March. In a change of tactics, the letter with
attachments to John Hutton had been ‘leaked’ to strategic
MP's to inflame the situation.

@ Profile of the whole issue had been raised despite other
major national issues in Parliament.

the Executive Council: ‘We, the undersigned, believe that
the post office network provides a vital service to local
communities in both urban and rural areas which are
threatened by the Government's withdrawal of services from
local post offices. Accordingly we call on the Government to
reverse its announcement that it will end support for the Post
Office Card Account in 2010 thereby threatening the viability i
of thousands of post offices and we urge it to immediately 1
halt its activities designed to kill the account off in advance of
that date.’
@ Will be mailed to every Post Office for signatures to be
collected then sent back to Shoreham. Decision would then
be made as to how to use it, depending on whether the
number was over the 3 million reached for the last petition. ¢
@ Trying to get national newspaper behind petition, starting
with Mail on Sunday, and if not will try a different one.
@ Not necessarily to keep POCA but to keep negotiating, and
have commitment that the Federation will be involved.
@ Amended wording to be supplied to the Executive Council. CTION
@ Crucial that signatures were genuine and there was no
duplication or creative issues or credibility would be

damaged.
@ MR MILNER proposed that ‘the Federation go ahead with a
petition to send out to all members.’ This.was agreed. [DECISION

@ Originals to be sent to Shoreham, but members to be urged
to send a copy of their pages to their MP to keep the focus
locally too.

@ The National Treasurer was keen to continue with the
petition even if the Federation had to bear the cost as funds

were available. a
@ Communication via BSC’s to be improved to keep members \
informed of progress. (ACTION

@ Not possible to publish all progress as it could be seen as
‘gloating’ and could affect invitations to participate in the
creation of solutions.
