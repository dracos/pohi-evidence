Statement of GARETH IDRIS JENKINS

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18’)

This statement (consisting of pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge
and belief and | make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, | shall be liable to
prosecution if | have wilfully stated in it anything which | know to be false or do not believe true.

| have been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd, since 1996 as a Customer Solutions architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon. This is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

| have been asked if issues found at Callender Square Post Office in Falkirk could have caused
the discrepancies in the case of SEEMA MISRA. At this stage, | am not aware of the details of
the problems in Callender Square Post Office in Falkirk. However | expect to be able to find out
the details of that case and also to compare the failing scenarios with the detailed logs that are
to be extracted for the SEEMA MISRA case and should then be able to make it clear if the
scenario is relevant.

| have been asked to make comments on the 3rd_Interim Technical expert's report to the
Court prepared by Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd.

| have listed below the statement contained within the above mentioned report in italics and
recorded my comment beneath in bold. For ease | have retained the original number
reference.

1.2.1 Source of problem — End to end EPOSS transaction flow: the equipment failure
user guide provided identifies at subsection 14 a process for identifying lost EPOSS

transactions. The implication is that EPOSS transactions can be lost due to equipment
failures. Without access to the sub post office data records and the intermediate data
records in the end to end process it will not be possible to identify the extent to which
this may explain the accounting discrepancies.

No request has been made to Fujitsu for any data relating to this branch. The logs would show
any equipment failures and replacement which might possibly relate to lost transactions.

1.2.2 Source of problem — Poor integration: the helpdesk reports provided in Andy
Dunks 2nd statement identify a series of problems with the network, printer and the pin
terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give rise to inconsistent

data capture and transmission at the sub post office.

Not sure what this is about. What exactly is required?

1.2.3 Source of problem — systems issues causing incomplete/inconsistent processing
of transactions between sub post office and central systems: the reports provided in
Andy Dunks 2nd statement identify a number of cases in which the user was required to
‘re-boot’ the terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give rise to

inconsistent data records in the sub post office.

Again without examining the logs it isn’t possible to progress this.

1.3 Hypothesis: Errors in operator data entry are not properly reconciled by the Post
Office finance function or by the Horizon system: without access to the system files it is
not possible to determine whether this is the case.

Again what is being requested? I've not seen any logs and | don’t believe that they have been
requested so how can this be progressed without them?

1.3.1 Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of EPOSS transactions end to end:

without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine whether this is the

case.

What is being requested?

1.3.2 Source of problem - lack of reconciliation of other transactions end to end:
without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine whether this is the

case.

Agreed, so the Logs need to be retrieved and examined.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times the
computer was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly, or
was out of operation was not such as to effect the information held on it. | hold a responsible

position in relation to the working of the computer.
