I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd, since 1996 as a Customer Solutions architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon. This is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

I have been asked if issues found at Callender Square Post Office in Falkirk could have caused
the discrepancies in the case of SEEMA MISRA. At this stage, I am not aware of the details of
the problems in Callender Square Post Office in Falkirk. However I expect to be able to find out
the details of that case and also to compare the failing scenarios with the detailed logs that are
to be extracted for the SEEMA MISRA case and should then be able to make it clear if the
scenario is relevant.

I have been asked to make comments on the 3rd Interim Technical expert's report to the
Court prepared by Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd.

I have listed below the statement contained within the above mentioned report in italics and
recorded my comment beneath in bold. For ease i have retained the original number
reference.

    No request has been made to Fujitsu for any data relating to this branch. The logs would show
    any equipment failures and replacement which might possibly relate to lost transactions.

    Again without examining the logs it isn't possible to progress this.




    Again what is being requested? I've not seen any logs and I don't believe that they have been
    requested so how can this be progressed without them?

Agreed, so the Logs need to be retrieved and examined.



There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times the
computer was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly, or
was out of operation was not such as to effect the information held on it. I hold a responsible
position in relation to the working of the computer.
