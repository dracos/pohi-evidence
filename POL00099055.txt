Mark, thanks for this and, I don't think we are too far apart - I didn't say this approach would be our media statement
but they would need to be aligned.

You are right to call this out. And I will take your steer. no issue.

there are two objectives, the most urgent being to manage the media. The second is to make sure we do address the
concerns of JA and Alan Bates, mainly looking forwards (but we should be aware AB's driver is really justice for the past);
otherwise they will call for re opening cases. It may be that we get to manage AB/JA by playing on the 'go ballistic' view:
ie., I will meet him privately to hear his views about these cases but that we cannot refer to anything in relation to past
convictions. Any challenge must go via normal legal routes.

Thanks for suggesting we speak. I can at around 9.30am? Or at 10am. Then after 1pm anytime.

Btw, could you send over the latest set of Q&As. It will save me hunting down 00s of emails to find the last one.

I hope you are both managing to get some rest with your families. Paula

         Hi Paula

        Could we have a word at some point today to discuss this, and specifically how far we go in terms of the
        wording below? I'm sending this just to you at this stage.

        I am very concerned that we may get to a position where we go so far in our commitments that we
        actually fuel the story and turn it into something bigger than it is. I am not at all complacent about the
        issues, but there is real danger in going too far in commitments about past cases.

         I say this for two reasons:

        - first the substance of the report doesn't justify this response. Indeed the report is at such a level that
        our current media strategy would mean there would be some coverage, but not very much (the usual
        suspects). If we say publicly that we will look at past cases (and whatever we say to JA or JFSA will be
        public) whether from recent history or going further back, we will open this up very significantly, into
        front page news. In media terms it becomes mainstream, very high profile. It would also give JA a very
        strong case for asking for a Parliamentary statement from BIS.

        - my second concern is the impact that this would have more broadly. It would have the "ballistic"
        impact which AB fears. It could lead to a very public narrative about the very nature of the business,




                                                                                                                       POL-0098638
                                                                                                              POL00099055
                                                                                                            POL00099055



raising questions about Horizon (the reality of what SS has found would be misunderstood) and having
an impact on public views about the PO and really widening the issue to the whole network.

The SS report would become irrelevant: in media terms it is the impression which counts (I was talking
to the BBC's comms director last night about very similar issues), and the impression would be of a PO
which doesn't have confidence/trust in its systems or processes, with the impact that could have on
customer views of us.

I re read the SS report last night. It is a poor piece of work, but its over-riding finding is to support
Horizon and urge us to improve our processes. But there isn't cause in there to question confidence in
us. We can manage this in media terms in such a way that it doesn't escalate into a bigger issue, while
having the right conversations with AB and JA.

Perhaps we can speak later?

        Hi, thank you for the inputs today. Susan I need your thoughts on the note below
        especially 1) and 2) please and the questions at the end of the mail.

        I think we have the following which is a variant:

        1) a working party over the next three/four months. This comprises PO working
        collaboratively with the JFSA and does three things:
        •. Firstly explores the SS (8) themes for improvement (can we get less than 8?) and
        agrees how they can be implemented.
        • Secondly, looks at the remaining past cases with JFSA (and MPs if they wish) to see if
        either further themes or new evidence emerge.
        •. Thirdly, our external lawyers review all prosecutions in the past 12/18 months since
        PO has been independent of RM, in the light of the SS findings. The JFSA/PO working
        group reviews the findings.
        [Why would they not review all cases of false accounting, eg., over the last 5-10 years,
        especially where the amounts have been 'small'? I assume 'large' amounts would be less
        likely to get away with saying they were muddle-headed and not helped? But could we
        review all? It is the false accounting charge JA was most concerned about.]
        • Does the working party update JA in the autumn?

        2) setting up of a review (chaired by PB/MO'C type) again via joint working between PO
        and JFSA, to determine how an independent safety net might be introduced ie., a
        commitment to an independent adjudicator or (non-statutory) ombudsman and the
        clear intention to agree scope and ToR.

        3) the future introduction of an ongoing branch user group, once the working party has
        completed it's task. This will ensure ongoing independent involvement of Spmrs/(inc
        JFSA if they would like) to ensure the business listens to and acts upon issues as they
        arise; and as importantly, consults users on future systems planning and changes.

        [4) a statement that although the system has been proved to have no systemic issues,
        and our training, support processes and helplines have worked for most of the 50-60000
        colleagues over the past decade, we are nonetheless genuinely sorry that some of our




                                                                                                            POL-0098638
                                                                                                                                       POL00099055
                                                                                                                                     POL00099055



Spmrs, who were struggling did not feel we offered them sufficient help and support
when they needed it. And that we are grateful to JFSA and JA for highlighting the issues.
Many are historic and already improved but we are always open to new ways to
improve how we do business to ensure the PO stays as trusted and effective in its
communities as it ever was.]

Last thought: if we can draft this into something I could send to Alan Bates 'in
confidence', it would get us to a better place in agreeing the press statement and way
through with JA on Monday. Could Martin try and corral views into a draft by Sunday
early pm? The more I speak with him the better I feel it will be.

Susan, would we ever ask the lawyers to consider reviewing past prosecutions? Is that
what we are talking about in 1) above but simply not using the terms? If not, why would
it be different? Of our 500 prosecutions, how many are false accounting? (For clarity
these are open questions -just want to know the answers, not an indication that I want
us to do so.)

Thanks, Paula

        Hmm, the boundaries between these groups are getting quite blurred
        and confusing (at least in my mind!).

        I thought the focus of the working group involving the JFSA would be
        primarily thematic (i.e. the 8 or so themes which emerged from the SS
        process) - rather than focussing on resolving specific cases, which we
        would pick up through the seperate 1:1 briefings with MPs. The
        description below appears to shift it more towards the latter. Perhaps
        this is an academic distinction which we can't sustain in practice, but it
        certainly feels like safer territory to have the JFSA focussing on themes
        to do with training and support (which would then morph into the
        branch user forum) rather than individual cases...

        Or have I misunderstood?

        We also need to think about how the review of past cases by our
        external lawyers plays into the messaging (if at all). Certainly not
        something we would put in our proactive media statement I would have
        thought, but would we refer to this in meetings as an avenue if pushed
        by MPs or the JFSA?

              Hi Paula

             I think this points to the need for our
             package of measures to include two
             and possibly three new initiatives:

             1. A Branch User Forum - for existing
             users to share views, discuss issues,
             examine processes etc.. Chaired by Exco
             and reporting to Exco. But this doesn't
             cover historic issues (ie the JFSA and
             MP cases) so we could also have (2)

             2. A working party, to use Alan's
             phrase, to complete the MP and JFSA
             cases. This could "take over" the Second
             Sight review (perhaps involving them
             but perhaps not as they have effectively
             "cleared" Horizon, the remit of their
             inquiry).This would involve the JFSA and
             us working collaboratively on the
             remaining cases. We might wish to
             include an external party in this too (a
             PWC?). This is the area of greatest risk -
             looking back at historic cases which



                                                                     POL-0098638

have gone through the courts. But it is
also completing the job we asked SS to
do.

3. A review by a Mike o Connor or
Patrick Burns figure to consider
potential independent levers which
could be developed to give SPMRs a
means of independent adjudication or
(non statutory) ombudsman.

This package, it feels to me, covers all
bases. It looks ahead to fix internal
issues and create independent
balancing view, but it also completes
the review and has the potential for
doing so with SS playing a different, or
no, role.

It is also a compelling package for
media, which handled carefully, could
contain the story.

Grateful for views.
