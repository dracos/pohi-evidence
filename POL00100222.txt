Hi David
Thanks for your patience on this.

With regard to the Minutes, James thinks they are absolutely fine except for a few differences, which he would
like recorded:
1. PV confirmed that Second Sight were at liberty to discuss matters with JA, as was the JFSA
2. PV confirmed that if problems were found with Horizon, that Second Sight were at liberty to investigate
— in other words, there were no ‘no go’ areas in the investigations
3. PV happy to meet with Second Sight to iron out letter of agreement

With regard to the agenda, he proposes the following:

Welcome and into — JNA for 5 mins

Update on progress with mediation scheme and business improvement programme ~ PV for 15 mins
Second Sight update — 10 mins

JFSA update — 10 mins

Q&A ~ 20 mins

Can you let me know your thoughts, please?

Finally, we need to get the date confirmed tomorrow, I’m afraid. Meeting rooms here get booked out months
in advance, and we are only a month away from the proposed date. Can you help out on this, please?

Kind regards,
Janet

Thanks David,

No problems at all, and of course we will keep these confidential. I'll come back to you swiftly, as soon as I
have spoken to James, which will be next week.

Have we got a date yet?

Kind regards and have a great weekend,
Best wishes,

Janet
