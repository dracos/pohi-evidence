Prosecution case

The defendant, Rabina Shaheen, was during the relevant period the sub

postmistress at Greenfields Sub Post Office, Shrewsbury.

On 3" September 2009 auditors attended the Greenfields Sub Post Office to
verify financial assets due to the Post Office Ltd and confirm compliance with a

range of business protocols.

On the date of the audit, 3“ September 2011, the auditor found a total shortage
of £43,269.10 made up as follows:

e £43,093.79 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures
e £175.14 (-)identified as a difference in stock figures

e £0.17 (-) Discrepancy as per office snapshot

e £43,093.79 (-) Total shortage.

Whilst the auditor became aware that there was going to be a cash shortage he
asked Ms Shaheen about the shortage of cash and also the fact that her

declaration of the previous night did not resemble the cash in the Post Office.

Ms Shaheen said that when her remittances were delivered the auto settlement
had been booking in the incorrect cash. She said that she had been in contact
with the helpline on a few occasions about the problem. She was able to
produce one reference from the calls made. She said that she had been making
incorrect declarations for the last 6 months. She would make up the figures

each night to make the cash appear correct.

. Ms Shaheen in her interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 10
September 2010, said that:

— That she had been sub postmistress since August 2006

— Her user ID is RSHOO1 which her husband also uses. He knows her

password.

— She does the cash declarations and Branch Trading Statements

— She thought that she had made a mistake. She phoned her helpline to
ask for a BDM or trainer to come and ascertain the error that caused
the loss.

— She discovered the error some 6 months before.

— She had backtracked the figures and the error on the REM sheets.

— She produced a sheet of REMs (Item 1) that she queried between
February to September 2008.

— She admits that she did not contact the helpline when her figures were
first out and on the second occasion she put £2,300 in which she got
from family and friends.

— On the third occasion she wanted to contact the DM but no one would
release his name.

— She confirmed that she had inflated the figures from this point forth.

— Put to her that she was £41,000 short in September 2008 and had had
no discrepancies since.

— She denies taking the money and says that Horizon has gone funny with

the figures.

11. She was re interviewed on 13 October 2010. The defendant produced a typed
schedule of the 2008 figures (Item 2). She said that:
— The Horizon system had been adding the figures.

— She had not taken the money
Defence case
12. In interview the defendant accepted false accounting to cover losses. She
denied stealing the money but admitted concealing the losses as she was liable

for the losses.

13. There is a straight forward attack on the Horizon System in that it is suggested

that the Horizon system itself had generated the losses.

Discussion
14. This case pleaded out on the defendant’s own basis of plea but the Judge gave
her an immediate term of imprisonment on the basis that the offence had taken
place over a period of time and she had a responsibility to safeguard public
money. The Judge also added that the loss had increased as a result of her

dishonesty.

15. The defendant maintained her position to the day of trial that the system itself
had generated the figures. It is clear from the defence statement that anything
that undermined our position in relation to the Horizon system would have
been disclosable to the defence both because it undermined our case and might

have supported the defence case.

16. It is my view that had we been in possession of the Second Sight Interim

Report at the relevant stage of these proceedings we would have disclosed it.

Potential Appeal
17. It is not within the remit of this advice to deal with all potential avenues of
appeal in this case but the fact remains that the defendant has admitted false
accounting in interview which is the count to which she pleaded. It is possible
that she could have fielded some type of lack of dishonesty defence had she
known of the imputations cast on Horizon by the Second Sight Interim Report.
I doubt that there is enough there for the Court of Appeal to conclude that the

conviction by guilty plea was unsafe.

18. It may be that the court might be swayed by an argument that as the figures
from Horizon may not be reliable the Learned Judge should not have sentenced
on the basis that the losses increased owing to her dishonesty. Again I doubt
that this argument will make much headway - a sentence of imprisonment was
inevitable and she was specifically not sentenced on the basis that she had taken

the money.

Conclusion

19. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we would have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the

Second Sight Interim report. Defence solicitors should be written to

accordingly.
