Patrick, Mark

Please find attached a list of possible adverse comms points in the HIT Judgment that the legal team have flagged on
their read through. Many of these look to be bad but not newsworthy bad. We've flagged in red the really bad ones. I've
attached the full list in case you think different.

Kind regards
Andy
