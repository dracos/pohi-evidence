4.3 HFSO Reports

The following are usability comments collected from the HFSOs during their
visits to offices. These offices were selected as being potential problem

Offices.
FAD Office Usability Comments
Code
198328 IAlnmouth I Only complaint - length of bar code scanner.
154329 IAnnitsford I Keyboard under monitor stand needs to be reversed
or pulled out for use. No spare space available.
163329 I Bates Equipment slightly out of reach but should not cause
Cottages any problems.
200328 I Beadnell No problems.
201328 I Belford No problems.
158329 IBlaydon on/No problems in operating the system based on the
Tyne current positioning of the equipment and the space
available.
204329 I Clayton The Post Office counter is a little narrow. Using the
Road keyboard may present problems when BES cards are
in full use.
157328 I Ellington Monitor and printer on 2nd terminal are on a high
shelf to the right. Unable to see lights on printer.
Office is for sale and is expected to be relocated in
the near future.

N/A IEmbleton Position of kit in usable position, although there are
two serving positions only one kit is installed. There
are 2 part-time staff and 1 SPMR.

245329 I Grange OM has smashed 2 glass shelves on the counter to
Park enable monitor and keyboard to fit and still use
swipe facility. Pos. 3 has monitor on a stand and to
use the swipe facility you have to pull out the
keyboard 6 inches. Gateway printer overhangs 2-3
inches.
248329 I Hartford A very small Post Office with limited space. The
Colliery only way the system will operate is to pull the
keyboard out from under the monitor stand to access
the swipe facility.
163328 I High Market] The Ithica printer for position 2 is stored sideways,

but enough cable has been left to enable easy
movement to a correct serving position when in full
service.

The system is set-up on the left-hand side of the
serving hatch. The SPMR and staff are right-
handed so the system is not as easy to use as they
would like.

Keyboard has to be pulled forward or reversed in
order to use it.

The Gateway is rarely used but the Ithica printer is
resting on a slope because part of it is on the foot
holding the screen in place. Holes drilled in the
counter partially obstruct the serving positions and
looks untidy.

All using monitor stands - swipe facility hidden so
keyboards will either have to be reversed or pulled
from under stands for use. Keyboards overlap
counter by approx. 1/3rd when pulled out from under
the stands.

At the moment the keyboard is in the middle of the
serving position. The OM has asked if she can have
a shelf put on the right-hand side of the serving
position for the printer to be put on. Then the
keyboard can go underneatb the shelf.

SPMR happy with days events. Space although
very limited houses Horizon kit okay.

Unable to access swipe card facility without pulling
out keyboard. Use of A4 printer very difficult when it
will be required. A shelf would be very useful in this
respect.

No problems encountered with usability.

No problems.

If both positions are in use counter space is minimal
and the keyboards may have to be turned around.
At present there is only one person working behind
the counter so the keyboard can be used correctly.

SPMR has at times difficulty reading the screen as
she wears bi-focals.

The printer for the Gateway terminal needs to be put
on the right-hand side of the monitor or put on a
shelf above the monitor. For the slave terminal the
printer was moved to the right-hand side of the
monitor.

469329 I Riding Mill I The extra work was not carried out and the installers
had no knowlegde of the problem. The counter
serving space would be reduced if the printer was
moved to the left. A stand for the monitor would be
a great improvement for both space and ease of
use.

320329 IRochester INo problems.

217328 IShilbottle I Sub-Postmaster has built a shelf onto the side of the
counter to allow movability of the counter equipment.

461329 ISlaley The swipe can only be used when it is back to front
and pushed under the monitor stand.

357329 ISunniside I Gateway - keyboard and Ithica moved to sit on
counter top shelf instead of lower shelf. A4 printer
moved up a shelf to a better site after improvement
work.

190328 IThropton _I Alarm switch was moved and situated on the side of
the counter. The OM could not open the safe door
as the base unit was in the way. The base unit was
turned at an angle so the safe could be opened.

371329 IWalbottle I The desktop printer is pushed behind and to the left
of the monitor which when needed for general use
will be difficult to operate. It is also wobbling on the
shelf it stands on.

371329 IWalbottle I The keyboard is on a drawer which opens up from

(cont) under the monitor - in full use it will be difficult to
operate the BES cards. There is limited space in the
outlet - more space could be made if the letter scales
were located away from the PO secure area.

378329 I West Adequate space for use.

Bolden

383329 IWest Moor I Adequate space for use.

391329IWideopen IThe slave station is close to the parcel hatch on the
right hand side, but the OM is left handed so there
isn't much of a problem. OM was asked if there was
any major problems with usability and there wasn't.

392329 I Willington INo problems that would affect the use of the

Quay equipment at this office.

402329 I Wilton SPMR is unable to access the swipe reader as the

Drive keyboard lies partly under the monitor stand. The
height of the monitor cannot be raised as the SPMR
wears bi-focals.

MISCELLANEOUS

Site Preparations

Four sites have been identified in the North East that require additional site
preparation works prior to the migration to 1c, Thropton (190328), Kenton
Road (272329), Winlaton Mill (395329) and Sunniside (357329). These works
where completed as planned and the sites were migrated to 1c within the
normal schedule.

Scheduling

A further change to the order of the Exel vans was made in the second week
to make better use of the spare van. This van was allocated offices at the
start of each day. This reduced the number of drops per van down to two or
three outlets a day.
