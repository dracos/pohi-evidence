Attached are South Warnborough Cash on Hand figures, they have not received or sent and cash or
coin over this period. I have highlighted in red the couple of dodgy cash on hand figures i.e. the branch
looks like in did not declare its cash on hand and the Flexible planning system has put in a predicted
cash on hand figure.

Our records on requested amounts to returned or delivery only go back 13 weeks, I can provide what
the branch was sent and what they returned and the cash on hand declaration if they declared properly
of course.

We do not issue ONCH targets to the vast majority of branches, these branches are on Flexible
Planning/Planned Orders. This system plans their cash needs on the latest cash usage and payments,
‘South Warnborough is one of these branches and the system would have planned cash to be
delivered or sent a message for the branch to return.

I hope this helps.

Afternoon,

Ihave spoken to this outlet today regarding the high levels of cash holdings. This outlet pays out
£2500 on average per week and has been holding in excess of £20k since the beginning of the year. I
have asked that the Postmistress returns at least £25k on Wednesday, I do have concerns however
as to whether the cash is actually there and believe there could be a risk of loss. I have spoken to CIT
and advised them that the office will be returning £25k. If possible I feel it would be prudent to
physically check to see if the funds are there before contacting audits if the cash is not returned on
Wednesday,

I would appreciate your comments,
Thank you

Becky
