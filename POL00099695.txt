Dear all, I am not sure who else I want to read these yet. But certainly the three of you.
They make disturbing reading. (1 couldn't make sense of the spread sheet but the individual submissions
are sufficient to get a steer on what we are dealing with.)

We have to keep it in perspective of course. But even in perspective they are challenging from all sorts
of angles. (Belinda these are examples of Sparrow cases that have been submitted for consideration for
mediation.)

I'm with Angela tomorrow am. She and her team are hopefully going to talk me through where we have
made improvements and where we still need to do more. I am glad I've decided to make the trip - we

need to show we are taking this v seriously.

Subject: Example Applications

Paula:

As promised in today's call, here are eight examples of the incoming
Applications. I've selected those that are more clearly expressed
than most of the others that we've been receiving. I'd have also sent
Case MO41 but it hasn't been scanned yet.

I'm also enclosing a spreadsheet that shows which ‘Thematic Issues’
each Applicant has reported to us. It's probably not worth you

POL-0099278
looking at that before your meeting with Angela and her team
tomorrow but, in case you do, you only need to look at Rows 55 to 97
(those are the Mediation Applications). The rows above that relate to
the MP-sourced cases and those that came in from the JFSA. In
some cases the Mediation Applicants were already on the spreadsheet
so are cross-referenced to their earlier appearance. Where there
are more ‘Thematic Issues’ marked on an MP-sourced case than on
that same case's Mediation Application that's because we know more
about the case than has as yet been revealed in the Mediation
Application.
