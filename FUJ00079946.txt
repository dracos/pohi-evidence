1.0 Introduction
11 Process Owner

The owner of this process is the POA Service Delivery Team Manager.

1.2

Process Objective

The key objective is to improve the overall major incident management process as follows:

1.3

Improvements within communication channels to become more effective and
streamlined

Improve accuracy of reporting against status of incident
Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

Assessing which incidents are major and which are “Business as Usual’
Clarify the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents

Demonstrate to the Post Office a more professional approach
Provision of clear defined roles and responsibilities
Defined reporting/update timelines through duration of a major incident.

Improved governance

Process Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management process and guidelines to be
followed in relation to Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework
process presently deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined process on which future major incident
communication and management will follow and that any parties involved in that process
provide updates /receive updates at defined intervals from inception to closure of any major
service impacts.

2.0 Mandatory Guidelines

Whilst it is important to maintain a balance between:

a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an

incident

b) Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major and which are “Business as Usual’

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

The Post Office Horizon Service Desk should be the first point of contact for
operational contact between Fujitsu and the end user.

The relevant technical teams who are monitoring and aware of a potential major
incident must page/call the Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager (Duty Manager out of
hours) as soon as possible, rather than wait. This is not limited to major incidents
alone, but must be delivered wherever a state other than Business as Usual has been
detected. The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager must in turn communicate the
potential incident, to their counterpart for awareness and monitoring in POL.

The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible
for communicating both wp the Fujitsu Organisation and across (see appendix A) to
their counterpart in POL. Where this is impractical (i.e. leave, out of hours,
unavailable), the initiative should be taken to jump up the organisation. The important
fact is that the customer is informed in a timely manner and at the correct touch point.
This communication should be by voice or direct SMS. The communication should
include the date, time, name, nature of problem, severity, if service affecting, and the
owner for contact

The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager should also initiate communication using SMS
via HSD, 08.00 to 18.30 or via SMC 18.30 — 0800.

3.0 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will always be an incident rated as severity level A (critical)
in the POA Customer Service Incident Management Process Details document (CS/PRD/074)
version 3.0. However not all incidents rated at severity level A qualify. This is because the
severity levels do not necessarily translate to the global business impact on POL’s business.
For example a single counter post office which is unable to transact, regardless of its business
volumes is rated as a severity A.

For simplicity, Incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium and Low.

High — An Incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse
impact on POL business. Typically these Incidents will initially require a significant amount of
reactive management before they can be controlled and resolved.

Medium — An Incident that has the potential to cause significant impact to POL business but
can be controlled and mitigated against through effective management.

Low — An Incident that requires business attention but if managed effectively will not have
significant impact on POL business.

3.2 Influencing Factors

It is important that a major incident is defined as such because of its business impact on the
day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a major incident because it appears on
a list. The following parameters will also feed into the consideration of whether a major
incident exists, as follows:

¢ Duration i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely
degraded or actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL Branches, customers, clients or brand image

3.3 Factors external to POL and POA

The following factors are external to both POL and POA and represent an event or risk to be
managed by both parties to minimise the risk to POL’s business. The list is not intended to be
exhaustive:

e Adverse weather
e Fuel strikes

© Criminal or terrorist activity directly affecting the ability to deliver service e.g. ram
raids

e 3" Party Service Provision
o E.g. DVLA for on-line service

o BT where telecom supply is outside POA or POL control

40 Trigger Topology

This document is covering the mutual responsibility between POL and POA for sharing
information in the event of major incidents. POA however do not have responsibility for all
aspects of the POL business domain. The following diagram illustrates the trigger topology.

The need for a Technical Conference Call will be
established as appropriate based upon the impact of the
Incident. This will involve POA Service Team (as
appropriate to the specific Incident), SMC, SSC, Core
Services, Networks, and HSD as appropriate for each
Incident. The outcome of the Technical Conference Call will
be determination of the Incident being classified as Major
(medium to high impact) or Business As Usual (low). An
initial action plan will be defined.

If the Incident is assessed as a Major Incident the POA
Service Owner and POA Service Support Manager will move
into a Technical Bridge Area on 6" floor at Bracknell.

An impact analysis will be produced referencing:

From this point forward, with the exception of box 26, which
