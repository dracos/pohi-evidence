14/04/01 12:45 new complaint call as previous e-0104091750 closed WITHOUT

permission from PM.
14/04/01 12:55 uk080106
information: pm wishing to complaint about ongoing system problems. see

call 0104140477 for details.

n had previous complaint open (0104091750) that pm was
lander impression (correctly) that it could only be closed with
nis permission. it would appear Ki Barnes gave
lsuthorisation to close that call. pm VERY unhappy about this.
14/04/01 12:58 uk080106
information: pm extremely unhappy about the problems with his counters.
he says he has had to pay out over £1500 in losses that are
jue the these problems. he has informed POCL they can
suspend him because he is refusing to make good any further
llosses.
jm wants a face to face meeting with someone in authority
from Pathway/POCL to discuss the issues. pm feels very
strongly about this and says he is willing to take POCL to a
tribunal/court because of the stress he has suffered because of
the problems.

4/04/01 13:00 uk080106
information: please contact pm to discuss issues.

information: THIS CALL IS ONLY TO BE CLOSED WITH THE EXPRESS PERMISSION
F JULIAN HALL.
4/04/01 13:42 uk081168

contacted: By Kevin called back on Sagib computer.

Pm has lost all confidence in system and ki Barnes as he

feels she has misled him over previous calls.

call ref: e-0104091750.

the system seems to lose transaction and PM is concerned

that for every transaction that error he notices there is the
jprobability that there ones he misses, leading to

discrepancies. The PM is at present finding the whole scenario very
stressful and is suffering sleepness nights due to these

problems. In the light of what has gone on the PM is prepared

to break his contractual obligations with POCL and refuse to

jpay any more discrepancies andwill take legal action if

required.

4/04/01 13:49 ukog1168

Information: Pm is going to log a call with the NBSC so a Pathway
complaint call can be raised aswell.

Ir advised PM that i will make the relevant personnel aware

lsc his call can be escalated and investigated on 17/04/01.

14/04/01 13:51 uk081168

information: Pm does not want this call closed without his express
ermission.

7/04/01 09:48 uk061537

contacted: I have left a message on Ki Barnes voice mail as the PM is
Inow complaining about her. T was speaking to her about the

last complaint call and we both feel that this PM is

complaining unjustly. She has been in contact with him, and I feel
lhe is complaining because the feedback has been advising it

jis user error, whereas the PM thinks it is software

7/04/01 10:12 uk061537

information: Ki is on holiday this week. I have spoken to Reg Barton in
ner absence. The best way forward at present is for me to

rovide an update, although I feel the PM has had it already.

tr will contact him today

7/04/01 10:17 uk061537

contacted: As I was on the phone to the PM, he advised that three
first class stamps that were on the screen just ‘dropped off".

lM had 3 first class stamps, and other stamps for 30p. When

the other stamps 30p went on, the first class stamps

disappeared. They have since put the 3 first class stamps again.
[the first transaction (that disappeared) was put on as 2@first
class stamp, and 1 normal first class stamp. The

transaction ID's are 1-221176-2 (for the 2 first class stamps)
17/04/01 10:40 uk061537

Information: PM advises that the transactions taken after this one,

POL00029224
POL00029224

tart 1-221178-, which basically Skips out 1-221177=. We were
lunable to find out the transaction ref of the 1 first class
stamp that was taken with the 2 (ref 1-221176-2)

can SSC please invstigate why he has had disappearing
transactions again, and perhaps a recommendation as to what
laction can be taken

I now have pressing evidence to suggest that unwanted peripheral input is
occurring, the likely source being the screen.

['his has been seen at Old Iselworth (OI) and Wawne (W) with OI being the best
site; when the PM has been asked to leave the screen on overnight I have
lobserved system activity corresponding to screen presses happening with no
lcorrepsonding evidence of either routine system activity or human
interference, the way forward now is to correlate this with the Microtouch
supplied monitoring software and to this ends Wendy is arranging for
installation of Kit at OI on friday, we can then, provided the PM agrees,
leave screens on over the weekend and record what happens.

nce these results have been analysed I feel sure that we will be in a
position to move forwards at OI. All other cases should be considered on
their individual merits but you must appreciate that this is a fairly
intensive analytical activity and I cannot hope to provide answers on all
cases in the short term.
