Subject: Note of telecon with lan Henderson 20 Jan

Attachment: Discussion with lan Henderson 20 Jan 2015.docx
To see

This was a note I made of my call with lan Henderson on 20 Jan. I apologise it is rather scrappy but it was simply
meant to be a note.

This is why I was rather surprised at what he said in his evidence at the Select Committee in which he made no
reference to:

- our conversation

- the WG decision about the prosecution docs (especially as he did not raise this with POL when he came in to discuss
the suspense accounts).

Best wishes
Belinda
