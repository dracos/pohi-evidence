The bulk (may be all) of the events for this urgent request have now been retrieved and sent via PEAK to EDSC. The
PEAK numbers are:-

PC0205005 - ARQ 292
PC0205007 - ARQ 282
PC0205021 - ARQ 283-4
PC0205022 - ARQ 285-6
PC0205023 - ARQ 287-8
PC0205024 - ARQ 289-90
PC0205025 - ARQ 291 and 3

As I explained, there is a lot of senior management focus on this request from both Fujitsu and POL so I would be
extremely grateful if you could view this as a priority.

Kind regards
Penny

We, as a matter of course, check all system events before returning transaction records to POL. Their trawl is to do with
transaction records, which, I'm sure you're aware is a totally different kettle of fish.

Penny,

Of course we can look as the provided data but it will take some time to trawl though the potential number of events.
The comment in the trail below "We have Helen Rose (POL) on stand-by to decipher the data and this will be her priority
when received, but we need to feed back a delivery date and time to Mark, Lynn and Paula." implies that they would like

to do the trawl themselves.

John

“tOn Behalf Of

Hello Peter

Despite the miserable journey to us, I hope todays meeting in Dearne proved
to be beneficial.

My apologies for the late notification of the following but I am hoping
that you will be able to assist in rapid turn around for an ARQ request.

Our Security Team who forward ARQ requests to yourselves for extraction
(Mark Dinsdale and Jane M Owen), have this afternoon sent an emergency ARQ
to Penny's team for processing. This has come from Lynn Hobbs, Branch
Network Manager, which in turn was passed into Lynn by Paula Vennells, Post
Office Ltd (POL) Network Director.

This request is a data extract for the above branch from 01 September 2009

- 30 September 2010. I understand from Mark Dinsdale that the agreed
turnaround for ARQ requests is 7-14 working days, but the ARQ above (I have
no ARQ reference at the moment) is a business priority.

Given the resource at your disposal and your teams existing workload is

there anyway that the 12 month extract can be completed Monday 04 October
2010. We have Helen Rose (POL) on stand-by to decipher the data and this
will be her priority when received, but we need to feed back a delivery

date and time to Mark, Lynn and Paula.

I am out of the office and without email until Monday morning, however,
h profile of this request could you contact Dave Hulbert
} to discuss any re sourcing issues or turn around times for

‘this:
Once again I am sorry for the late notification.

Kind regards
