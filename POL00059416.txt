Dear Sirs

Re: Regina (Post Office Ltd) v. Khayyam Ishaq
Bradford Crown Court
Date of next hearing: 25 February 2013 for Trial

Thank you for your letter dated 1s* November 2012. We have been liaising with the
investigator in this case and hope to serve any further evidence within two weeks time.
However, we look forward to receiving a revised defence case statement which
particularises the issues, if any, you may have with the Horizon system, as indicated by
HHJ Rose at the PCMH on 4" September 2012.

We appreciate that you received the core data covering the operational period of the
indictment on the 26' October 2012 in the form of a disc and accompanying password and
look forward to receiving your expert report from the forensic accountant as soon as
possible.

Should you require any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact Rachael Panter at the
above office ort

Yours faithfully

Cartwright King
