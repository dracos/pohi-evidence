I agree with Jill and have one of my team onto this - Richard Benton. I have asked Richard to put together a check list of
obvious things that could have caused this discrep in the Branch. If we can discount those it gives us a greater level of
confidence that it really is Postmaster error.

Do you have any timescales on this?

I have passed the file you sent on to Richard Ashcroft in problem management, for one of his team to have a look and,
and request information from Fujitsu Services.

I do think that a telling point in this case is that there are no calls to HSH logged - I would have thought that if he believed
he had a system problem, he would have done that quite promptly? It's also a bit amazing that the accountant from a
couple of doors away knows enough about Horizon to put his name to the assertion that it's a system problem. However,
whilst I believe there is no evidence to support system problems, I don't want to make sweeping assumptions and would
rather be certain when the circumstances may lead to termination of contract.

Richard or one of his team will be in touch in due course.
Kind regards
Jill
