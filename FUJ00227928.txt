The questions raised with regard to TES are more architectural than support... help please...

- shortened version of the email is...

a) Is it possible to increase the data held in TES from 180 days to 1 or 2 years - if so, what would it cost

b) Can we increase the number of POL users from 20 to 30 , if so , what would it cost

c) Can we supply some training to POL of TES facilities - I suspect that this may be more difficult - Dave Harrison has
already told me that he no longer has anyone left in his team with Horizon experience - and SSC are really only end-
users of TES .

Regards
Mik

Steven,

As per the discussions during the AOB part of the above meetings, would it be possible for you to provide me with some
idea as to whether the following are possible, and if so I very rough idea of costs involved etc?

Would it be possible to extend the period transaction data is held
on/accessed by TES from the current 180 day limit to 1 or (ideally) 2
years?

Would it be possible to provide in depth training in the use of TES and

all of its available features?

Could we increase the current ARQ allocation to POL security/fraud teams
from 720 to 1000?

Could we increase the number of current TES licensed users within POL
from 20 to 30?

We currently only need a brief idea of costs etc.

regards
