Profit

Half year YTD operating profit was £53.1m, which was £5.1m favourable to budget of £48.0m, and £7.9m adverse
to prior year of £61.1m,

‘Net Income of £426.2m increased the adverse variance to £18.0m to budget and £16.8m adverse to prior year.
~ Versus budget - driven by Mails (£12.5m adv) and lottery (£3.6m adv). Mails performance continues to be driven
by lower parcel volumes following the RM price changes in April. New parcel formats are being introduced at the
end of October which should reverse this trend. Lottery continues to underperform, although the Health Lottery
was introduced during September, and the Camelot price increase is effective from October.
~ Versus prior year, driven primarily by the stamps buy forward last year and the volume decreases this year as a
consequence of Royal Mail pricing changes. Government Services has also decreased as a result of lower rates
from the new DVLA contract and falling Card Account customers. NS&I income has also fallen as they move their
customers away from POL, partially offset by growth in FS commissions reflecting Eagle impacts.

* Staff costs were £0.8m adverse to budget due to higher bonus payments relating to 2012/13 and some savings
task shortfalls both partly offset by unused pay award budget, and £3.7m adverse to prior year due to higher
pension costs, pay awards and increased headcount.

+ Agents’ costs were £18.9m favourable to budget. £9.9m of this relates to lower sales income, £2.0m relates to

sales mix (parcels), £1.6m relates to WHS provision utilisation and the remainder is made up of smaller variances

including timing and favourable VAT recovery. Year on year there is a £15.4m favourable variance. £9.3m due to
lower sales, predominantly Mails buy forward pre price increase, £2.2m lower fixed pay from unfreezing the Core

Tier Payment and roll out of Locals and £2,7m relating to the DVLA rate accrual.

Non people costs were £1.1m adverse to budget, and £8.2m adverse to prior year. The adverse budget position is

driven by Horizon costs which were budgeted to be taken last year. The prior year variance is due to increased IT

costs mainly Horizon, timing of marketing spend, and the removal of the FX bureau rebate received in H1 last
year.

Interbusiness expenditure was £2.2m lower to budget, driven by lower Official Mail costs and insurance claims and

£1.1m favourable to prior year, due to services switching into POL from RM.

Project costs were £2.4m favourable YTD. The underspend is driven by timing of the Project Eagle sales capability

investment and the movement of Separation costs to exceptionals.

Cashflow
The YTD cashflow was an inflow of £193m which was £21m favourable to the £172m inflow budget (period 5
was £99m favourable),

The £241m favourable variance was driven by delays to NTP expenditure

Crown Profit - YTD
The Crown profit is £1.4m adverse to budget. Income was £2.0m adverse driven primarily by Mails, but offset by
Government Services. Costs are £0.2m favourable and share of JV is £0.4m favourable.

Non financials ~ YTD.
* Queue times in branches (less than 5 minutes) were 83.5% which was 4.6% favourable to target.
* YTD Network conversions were 17 ahead of the 1853 target, (P5 was 9 ahead of target).

FYE
This pack shows the Q1 FYF. Once the Q2 FYF has been signed off, it will be added to this pack in time for P7

Period vs. Budget
Operating profit (EBIT) of £15.2m was £6.6m
favourable to budget.

BAU was £6.0m favourable:

+ Lower staff costs of £0.8m

+ Lower Agents costs of £7.1m mainly due to
reduced income, but also the WHS provision
utilisation of £1.6m and DVLA timing of £1.8m,
and

+ Lower interbusiness costs due to lower Property

charges from RM.

Offset by:

+ Lower income of £3-1m due primarily to the
continuation of the trend in Mails and Retail

One-off variance of £0.7m favourable relates to
the moving of Separation costs to exceptional.

Below EBIT

Impairments were favourable due to slower
progress than plan on NTP. In P6 there was a one
off exceptional credit of £102m (budget ril) that
relates to the recently changed pension terms.

year, but incurred this year.

Project One-off variance of £2.4m favourable. The underspend is driven by timing of Brand spend
and the movement of Separation costs to exceptionals,

Below EBIT

Exceptional costs are favourable mainly due to a £102m credit relating to the charge in pensions
terms. The underlying variance is due to slower pace of capital spend and operating exceptionals,
including agents compensation, compared to budget. Government grant utilisation follows this
trend, but also included utilisation against the remaining 2012/13 exceptional costs. The profit on

+ Income £2.0m less than plan

of the ‘shoebox’.

+ Costs are £0.2m less than plan:

+ Staff savings from industrial action continue to offset delays in CTP savings.
+ Mainly driven by favourable variance in POC as a result of separation costs moving to exceptional spend

+ The impact of size based pricing has adversly impacted Mails as follows: Priority Mails £0.2m, 1st class and 2nd class £0.8m, International Standard £0.5m are products most
impacted by PIP. Retail sales are also underperforming against target by £0.1m. The expectation is that the gap will reduce with the roll out of remedial actions, including the delivery

+ Main drivers of favourable Government income are UKBVI (due to backlog in applications) £0.7m, ID Services £0.4m and Passports £0.2m, offset by Motorist services (DVLA Licences
and AEI) which are £0.3m behind target.
+ Savings £0.6m and Life insurance £0.1m are the main drivers in the shortfall against Financial Services netted off against the Travel portfolio delivering a £0.2 upside

Metrics To Focus On
September 2013

(Key metrics to focus on (YTD below target) this month include:

Net Income: (Paul/ Kevin)
Net income is £18.0m adverse and is driven primarily by Mails income. The Mails variance was driven by ‘(st class labels, Lottery, International
and Parcelforce.

Net Promoter Score: (Paul)
NPS is negative and is believed to be driven by the RMG pricing changes, privatisation and potential strikes.

Engagement Index: (Susan)
The Engagement Index target is 1% greater than prior year outturn. Although this will not be measured againin the same manner until early
2013-14, a Pulse survey has been sent out in October to give an indication of the current score.

Crown Profit (Kevin)
The Crown profit is £1.4m adverse to budget. Income was £2.0m adverse driven primarily by Mails, but offset by Government Services
income. Costs are £0.2m favourable and share from FRES joint venture is £0.4m favourable

Headcount of 7,999 is 108 below plan and is due to vacancies within the Network directorate,

both Crowns and transformation projects. The adverse variance in Financial Services (FS) is
offset by a favourable variance in Network. This is due to some of the Financial Specialists
transferring from Network to FS. The remainder are due to transfer over the coming months

‘mation Board (TB}- Key Point
Crown Transformation - Branch transformation is underway with 5 transformed and 13 m progress. 16 WH
Smiths franchises have been announced and are in public consultation. The automation pitot is on track for
November with the printer issue now resolved, but feaving no contingency for further delays. In-year cost
savings expected to be £0.7m below the £8m target. but income shortfalt is the most significant risk to
achieving the crown benefit targets. Anal of the half-year performance and forecast will now inform the i
programme board consideration of next steps.

Nelwork Transformation ~ Planning for implementation of revised approach under new strategy is underway,
pending agreement with NFSP and BIS, in order achieve the scale of conversions required, Contracts signed
so far are stightly ahead of current year target, but at risk for 03 while the strategy negotiations remain
ongoing.

Wave ~ Transformation Board discussed the implicatons of the development of the mobile solution with
Fujitsu stalling (following their commercial position changing and their unwillingness to provide a genuine
managed service). It was agreed that moving away from Fujitsu would not have a detrimental impact on other
negotiations with them. Aiternative delivery options will be presented in November to meet commercial
objectives.

Separation - Analysis is underway to confirm the approaches and target dates for HR, Fmance and tower
related projects (EUC, IT Networks) in the context of latest agreements on approach with Royal Mail, Findings
wilt be presented back senior management of both organisations end of October to agree next steps and any
resulting change in plans. /

integrated with the core system replacement into a single programme, now moving from Blueprint to Build
‘The decision to move to build was made with the recognition that an element of the spend may be non
recoverable if subsequently a strategic decision to BPO Finance is taken.

HP&BB - Data migration is complete. network migration is on track and billing has cornmenced in smaii
volumes, but there are continuing cali centre performance problems, although no significant increase in
customer churn has been detected. A programmatic approach to resolving the cali centre issues is now in
place and Fujitsu has vestructured its service management team to give better focus on the key areas. 130
additional call centre heads are being deployed and 50 additional back office heads are being deployed. Fujitsu
is also looking at other opportunities to bring in more resource in the short-term. seen performance
improve but it is still poor. The plan provided by Fujitsu should see the customer experience getting to
acceptable levels by the end of October.

Savings - In September the book dropped by another £80m to £16.01bn as Post Office assisted Bank of
Ireland re-structure its balance sheet. Online Bonds and Online Saver are on track to hit targets. The sales of
fixed rate products in branch are also picking up with FRISA topping the best-buy tables. Premier Cash Isa sales
continue to be supported by marketing activity. There is an increased presence of all savings products in all the
rate tables. Network targets have been rebased and re-cut for the second half of the financial year.

Life Insurance - income remains on target despite lower than budgeted sales, a range of initiatives are being
deployed that to increase sales over the remainder of the year. A DRTV Press and In Branch campaign will run
through Q4 with a central theme of “always paying your way and settling your tab”.

Motor Insurance - sales volumes remain ahead of target but reliance on aggregators continues to impact
income, while improved retention rates offset some of the additional aggregator costs.

Home Insurance - sales are down year to date due to aggressive competitor pricing through aggregators,
although the branch network is ahead of target.

Travel Money - Sales income is below target due to lower transactional volumes. The average transaction
value, however, is higher than budget so this will result in a higher profit share from FRES. The channel sales
performance remains on target as these are based upon sales value (benefiting from increase ATV) rather than
the sales volume.

Travel Insurance - period 6 income was below plan due to an historic commissions adjustment made by our
administrator Aon; we are investigating the background to this. New policy sales continued with a strong
performance, across all channels and YTD income remains on plan.

Credit Cards are at 88% of target and 106% year on year. We have now launched a new online application
form and the improved balance transfer offer to 18 months. We are starting to see an improvement in online
applications and estimate 950 additional online applications were made in the 17 business days following

POL00027534
POL00027534

launch. The “start-to-submit” rate on the online application form had improved from around 32% to an average
of 46% since launch and we expect this to improve further over time. We are now rolling out additional
marketing activity with affiliates and anticipate strong growth in applications over the coming weeks.

Mortgages - In September mortgage applications dipped slightly to £115m, down from £130m in July and
August as the range needed re-pricing. Our new products gained traction towards the end of September and
flows have improved and we are on track to achieve £130m+ during the month. We achieved branch sales of
£8.5m through our Mortgage Specialists (MS) in September and we anticipate a similar performance in
October. Run rates will improve in the branch channel in the New Year when we will have completed the
recruitment of a skilled MS sales team, in addition to the new supervisory structure, new incentive programme
and lead generation activity.

MoneyGram - remains on track to achieve its budget for the year.

they are promoting the service and having the appropriate sales conversations with customers.

Mails Focus products income has remained steady and 3 out of our 4 Focus products (express24&48,
International Express, International Priority) have increased sales volumes compared to last year. Currently we
are slightly behind target with our Focus products income however, the volume at Christmas will get this back
on track. Our Standard income is down by 12%, this will improve from November onwards with the
introduction of the new small parcel sizing, when we expect to see 225k parcels coming back to POL per week.

Lottery - down by -£3.27m vs. budget. Lottery income is down vs. last year and budget, driven by Camelot’s
decline in market sales and poor performance of the new terminals following their 3rd licence extension.
Camelot are optimistic there will be a turnaround in sales due to the launch of the new Lotto game in early
October, along with aggressive marketing campaigns for Euromillions and scratchcards in Q3 and Q4. Post
Office launched The Health Lottery in mid-September which will deliver incremental income.

Retail (Crown only) down by -£117k vs. budget. Retail is down due to decline in packaging sales, in line with
the decline in standard mails volumes. There are strong plans to improve sales in Q3 including promotions on:
commemorative coins, packaging and Christmas.

The YTD HomePhone, HomePhone Combined and Broadband performance have fallen behind target. The
targets have started to ramp up as it was intended that post-migration we would be in a position to take
advantage of the new products we have available and drive an uplift in sales. Given the issues that we have
experienced since migration, sales have declined due to the network not actively promoting the product and
customers struggling to get through to the call centre. The current focus is on stabilising the call centre
operation for our existing customers and we are re-visiting our plans for the rest of the year as the current
view is that we cannot commit to running a campaign throughout the entire quarter 4. We are working through
options with Marketing Communications which will allow a campaign to run from mid-February. Whilst this
would not materially impact income in-year, there would be an impact on the strategic plan and, as such, an
additional push early in 2014’15 would be required. We are working up a proposal to ‘relaunch’ HomePhone
and Broadband at an appropriate time in the New Year including a branch engagement programme, a
consumer offer, a colleague incentive and a re-launch of the colleague offer.

E Top-up performance continues to run at just below 10% below target and has stabilised at this level. We
have explored a number of options to drive E Top-up sales with a number of the mobile networks but there is
limited appetite to invest in the category. We are also looking at the opportunity to undertake E Top-up online
with our provider E-pay.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Business User Forums

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to invite ExCo to:

1.1. approve the proposal and arrangements for the establishment of a number of
Post Office Business User Forums.

2. Background

2.1. At its away day in June the Board agreed a mutualisation timeline which set
out a programme of initiatives aimed at improving and increasing stakeholder
engagement. To meet the commitments in the timeline we need to have a
number (unspecified) of Business User Forums in place by early 2014.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1. Weare already in the process of establishing a Branch User Forum. This is a
forum established specifically to meet the commitments we made in response
to the findings of the Second Sight Report. We are in the process of inviting
subpostmasters and staff to join that Forum.

4. Options Considered

4.1. In developing this proposal we have considered how other organisations with
a comparable stakeholder mix have established forums to contribute to the
development of business proposals which are of interest or importance to
them.

5. Proposal

5.1... The proposal is to establish a small number of Business User Forums,
proposed by Directorate areas or commissioned by ExCo. There is no
agreed number or subject matter. We should start with a small number in key
areas and use the learning to inform decisions about how and where others
might add value.

5.2. The general aim of the Business User Forums is to provide a formal
mechanism for engaging stakeholders in the development, communication
and implementation of key business issues. The role played by the Forums
will vary according to the subject matter but, overall, the objective would be to
get early input and expertise from stakeholders and interested parties and,
where possible, their buy-in to new ideas so that they can act as advocates
and communicators within their stakeholder communities.

Business User Forums Susan Barton
October 2013
Page 1 of 3
POL00027534
POL00027534

Confidential

5.3. The specific proposal is that the Business User Forums:
e do not form part of the governance of the Post Office

are proposed and sponsored by the relevant Director, and chaired by
them to ensure the leadership necessary to attract senior
stakeholders

e comprise an appropriate but diverse group of stakeholders and
experts who would add value, by bringing knowledge, expertise and
advocacy, to specific business areas or initiatives

e are established and managed in a way which allows stakeholder input
and discussion at an early stage so that, for example, where possible
handling issues are dealt with before final decisions are made.

5.4. Areas which might benefit from a Business User Forum are mails; financial
services; telecoms; FOoG, marketing and communications.

5.5. To ensure the Business User Forums receive the profile necessary for them
to succeed, it is proposed that the Chairs report quarterly to Exco on the
progress and work of their Forum. However, as the Communications Director
has overall responsibility for the delivery of the stakeholder engagement
programme, he should have a co-ordinating role and also report to ExCo on
the delivery of the programme in its entirety. Secretariat support for the
individual Business User Forums should be provided from within the relevant
business area.

6. Commercial Impact/Costs

6.1. Closer and earlier involvement of stakeholders in business developments
should lead to better and more informed decisions and allow stakeholder
concerns/ideas/issues to be factored in early. The cost of early engagement
and problem solving would potentially be less than dealing with those issues
when decisions have already been made.

6.2. Each Business User Forum should have a small budget of £5k to cover the
out of pocket expenses of the members.

7. Key Risks/Mitigation

7.1. There are no significant risks. There may be minor handling risks arising in
relation to the creation of specific Business User Forums. These should be
identified by the proposing Director along with mitigating actions. More
generally, starting with a small number of Forums will allow us to test the
concept properly and learn what works well before establishing others.

8. Long term considerations — horizon scan
8.1. None.

Communications Impact

9.1.

The creation of Business User Forums provides us with a positive
communications message for Government about progress towards
mutualisation, and to our staff and stakeholders about the steps we are taking
to change the culture of the organisation to one which listens, engages and
involves its stakeholders in the business.

Conclusion

10.1.

We have already made progress with the plans for the Branch User Forum.
Established with the right membership and well-crafted terms of reference,
Business User Forums will increase and improve stakeholder engagement.
The experience from other organisations suggests that if properly established
and chaired, such forums bring significant benefits to the business. Overall
co-ordination of the Forums by the Communications Directorate will enable
ExCo to monitor the overall success of the programme.

Recommendations

11.1.

ExCo is asked to:

* approve the proposal for the establishment of a number of Business
User Forums, and agree in which areas a Business User Forums
should be established;

e agree that individual Directors will submit proposals for the creation of
Business User Forums for ExCo consideration in November

« agree the co-ordination role of the Communications Director and the

reporting arrangements to ExCo

At its away day in June the Board agreed a mutualisation timeline which set

out a programme of initiatives aimed at increasing and improving our
engagement with Stakeholders. The timeline (reproduced below) was shared
with BIS colleagues in July and although they are broadly content, they have
pressed for more detail so they can understand more of the activity that sits
behind the high level milestones.

Since June we have made significant progress against the plan as set out

The aim of the Stakeholder Forum is to bring stakeholders and experts

together to work with Post Office to define its public benefit purpose.
Established in October 2012, the Stakeholder Forum has met six times.
Meetings included presentations from experts, and discussions about the

public purpose, and two working groups were established to produce the
content of the public purpose with the outputs from the groups to be tested
with the public and wider stakeholders

3.3. The public engagement exercise started with a ‘qualitative’ engagement
exercise which ran through September. Over 1,000 questionnaires were
completed and 150 people attended the focus groups. The responses will be
analysed through October and a qualitative survey of a. statistically
representative group of people will be conducted in November based on the
responses.

3.4. I Stakeholder Forum to consider the findings from the engagement project in
December and agree a public purpose definition to recommend to the Post
Office Board. The intention is that the Board will consider the Stakeholder
Forum’s recommendation in January and make a recommendation to
government with a view to publishing an agreed public purpose before the end
of the financial year.

Post Office Advisory Council

3.5. A detailed proposal for the Post Office Advisory Council is dealt with in a
separate paper for consideration by the Board.

Business User Forums

3.6. We aim to create a number of business specific forums comprising of
stakeholders with an interest or expertise in particular subjects to input into
developing thinking or implementation plans. A detailed proposal has been
submitted to ExCo for approval.

3.7. We are already in the process of establishing a Branch User Forum, created
specifically in response to the findings of the Second Sight report to provide a
mechanism for subpostmasters and others to raise issues and insights about
business processes, training and support. Using this as a model, the intention
is to create other similar groups focussed on specific business areas.
Directors have been invited to make proposals, to be agreed by ExCo, for
subject specific user forums where stakeholder and other input could add
business benefits. It will be important to begin with a small number of groups
and use the learning from those to inform how and where other such groups
could add value. We anticipate having two or three groups up and running by
the end of the financial year.

Subpostmaster engagement survey

3.8. The survey, developed through workshops and 1-2-1s with stakeholders
across the business and interviews with a selection of sub-postmasters, was
launched at the end of September and runs until mid October. The findings
will be presented to ExCo in November.

Information sharing

3.9. An information sharing agreement has been in place with the NFSP since
June. Principally this was to enable confidential discussions about the
strategy. The learning from this process will form the basis for routine

information sharing going forward and similar arrangements will be developed
with CWU and CMA when the industrial relations position allows.

Superbriefers

3.10. The regular programme of superbriefers continues with Senior Managers
visiting Crown branches on a monthly basis to update staff on network
transformation and other business issues.

WOW staff magazine

3.11. A new monthly staff magazine about transformation was launched in
September, written for staff and developed with their contribution.

Regional sales events

3.12. Regional sales events, running from September to November, have been
extended to all agents, incorporating training and two way communications on
business issues.

4. Future engagement activities

4.1. There are also a number of engagement activities planned to start over the
coming months. The detail is set out below.

Social network

4.2. ‘Yammer’ an enterprise social network will be introduced in November to allow
real time, interactive collaboration and engagement across the network.

NFSP/Post Office communications forum

4.3. A bi-monthly communications forum was established in September with the
NFSP to share communications plans.

Subpostmaster events

4.4. Six-monthly events for subpostmasters, covering business wide issues, will
begin in December.

Phone bank sessions

4.5. Monthly phone-in evenings for staff, hosted by senior leaders, will begin in
December.

Quarterly business updates

4.6. A rolling programme of half day sessions, led by ExCo members, for staff in
different locations will start in November. Social media will be used to
maximise coverage.

Culture workshops

4.7. I The culture workshops to work through the recommendations in Patrick Burn’s

culture gap analysis did not take place because of the industrial dispute with

CWU and CMA. Plans to reorganise the workshop will be revisited when
industrial relations allow.

5. Conclusion

5.1. We have made good progress against our timeline and continue to do so. If
we were able to share the information about our progress and plans with BIS
colleagues this should satisfy their desire to understand more about the
activities underway and planned. Regularly and proactively sharing our plans
with BIS will help put us on the front foot and help remove their concerns
about whether or not we are serious about adopting mutual ways of working.

6. Recommendations
The Board is asked to:
6.1. note the update and actions set out above;

6.2. agree that an update detailing the progress and activity set out above is sent
to BIS for information, and on a monthly basis.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Post Office Advisory Council

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. request approval for the arrangements and Terms of Reference for
establishing a Post Office Advisory Council;

2. Background

2.1. At its June away day, the Board agreed a mutualisation timeline. A key
initiative agreed in the mutualisation timeline was the creation of a Post Office
Advisory Council in early 2014.

2.2. The Terms of Reference and proposed arrangements for the Advisory Council
are drawn from Tim Franklin's experience of working with a Members’ Council
in a mutual organisation. They are also consistent with examples of
organisations which are broadly comparable with Post office in terms of
stakeholder characteristics.

2.3. The proposals are based on the assumption that the Council will:

. not form part of the governance arrangements of the Post Office
. not be a representative body
. have no decision-making authority.

3. Current Situation

3.1. I The Stakeholder Forum was created specifically to work with the Post Office
to develop its public purpose. There are no plans for the Stakeholder Forum
to continue beyond recommending a public purpose to the Board.

3.2. Apart from the Stakeholder Forum, we have no arrangements in place for
cross stakeholder engagement. Our engagement at a senior level, where it
happens, tends to be bi-lateral. The experience of the Stakeholder Forum has
shown that bringing together a range of stakeholders and experts can provide
wide and valuable perspective on matters of interest to Post Office and its
stakeholders.

4. Proposal

4.1. The proposal is to create a Post Office Advisory Council in line with the Terms
of Reference attached at Annex 1. The aim of the Council is to provide a
formal mechanism for the Post Office to engage stakeholders on matters of
mutual interest and to improve stakeholder understanding of, and
engagement in, Post Office business. As with the Stakeholder Forum, the
Council would benefit from members who are not stakeholders but who have
expertise which could add value to Council discussions. .

Post Office Advisory Council Susan Barton
15 October 2013
Page 1 of 6
POL00027534
POL00027534

Confidential

4.2. Within its remit the Council could provide both strategic and tactical advice; it
might act as a sounding board and provide feedback on matters such as
marketing campaigns, policies, products and services as well as provide a
broader perspective on strategic issues such as market opportunities. It will
be important to ensure that the context in which subjects are presented is
clearly defined so that members are clear at the outset about why a specific
subject has been brought to the Council.

4.3. I The creation of an Advisory Council will not, of itself, improve stakeholder
engagement. It will require a change of culture and processes if it is to work
well and produce business benefits. The experience from other organisations
suggests that stakeholder involvement on important issues at an early stage
can, if properly managed, improve the quality of business decisions.

4.4. The key benefits of this type of Council are:

. involving stakeholders prior to taking final business decisions, where
appropriate, might highlight new opportunities and result in those
decisions being better informed because of the richness and variety of
insights that may not be available within the business

. identifying challenges or points of contention before a course of action
has been decided enables those issues to be dealt with and
accommodated, if possible, before matters are finalised

. co-creating ideas is more likely to achieve stakeholder buy-in, and
reduce the more traditional type of stakeholder discussions where the
business presents a solution or decision leaving stakeholders free to
critique, criticise or present alternatives after the event

. bringing a range of stakeholders together to discuss subjects of
common interest allows all stakeholders to hear each other's position —
a challenge against a partisan view from another stakeholder is more
powerful than a challenge from the business

. Council members can become advocates and communicators of Post
Office messages within their own communities.

4.5. The benefits listed above are unlikely to be realised immediately. It will take
time and commitment from the business to allow the Council to develop and
mature into a forum which can add real value to the business.

4.6. As the Council will only meet three times a year, it is proposed that
relationships and understanding of different perspectives will be enhanced if
Council members are invited to meet over dinner on the evening before a
Council meeting. This will help build relationships and smooth the way for a
more relaxed and better informed meeting.

4.7. Two factors which will be key to the success of the Council in terms of
improving stakeholder engagement and delivering business benefits are:

° The Chair - the appointment of a Chair who is independent of the
executive management, who has the skills and experience necessary
to chair a Council of this size and diversity, and who has the
confidence of the Board and the business as a whole. The Chair will

Post Office Advisory Council Susan Barton

POL00027534

Confidential

need to ensure engagement with Council is meaningful whilst
respecting the decision-making and accountabilities of the Board and
ExCo, as well as ensuring that the Council operates in line with its
agreed terms of reference

. The membership - the appointment of a diverse and balanced
membership with the skills and experience necessary to make a
positive contribution to the Council. We would, properly, invite some
stakeholders to join the Council as of right, such as NFSP and union
officials. However, we should also advertise and recruit to ensure a
diverse membership which balances commercial and social expertise
and that our customers and the general public are represented. A
framework for selection and appointment is at Annex 2.

5. Costs

5.1. It is recommended that a budget of £40k is allocated for the Council. The
costs would cover three off-site meetings per year including dinner and
overnight stay (£10k per meeting) and out of pocket expenses for Council
members to attend the meetings.

5.2. There will be a resource cost for the Council secretariat. The average
resource requirements should amount to no more than 0.5 person over the
year, but the activity will not be spread evenly with the initial establishment of
the Council and recruitment of members, and the secretariat support at
meeting times requiring dedicated resource with little or no resource required
between meetings and recruitment exercises.

6. Key Risks/Mitigation

6.1. There are some limited risks related to confidential information with Council
members. However, it is unlikely that the Council would be involved in
matters which are commercially confidential. It would be made a pre-requisite
to membership that confidentiality, where required, would be respected and
the Chair would agree ways of working at the initial meeting.

7. Long term considerations
7.1. None
8. Communications

8.1. The intention to establish the Council should be announced publicly as a
positive step, following separation, towards the Post Office working more
closely with its many stakeholders as it delivers its 2020 strategy and
continues its transformation journey. The announcement would be
accompanied by advertisements inviting people to express their interest in
becoming members.

9. Conclusion

9.1. The creation of a Post Office Advisory Council will allow Post Office to
demonstrate that it is progressing its mutualisation timeline and is serious
about increasing stakeholder involvement in the business. Experience from
organisations with similar bodies have found that, over time, and if properly
managed, a mechanism for senior stakeholder engagement can bring

business benefits which outweigh the time and cost involved in establishing
and running them.

10. I Recommendations
The Board is asked to:

10.1. approve ToRs and arrangements for the establishment of a Post Office
Advisory Council

10.2. approve a budget allocation of £40k per year to establish and run the Council

10.3. agree that the Chair works with the secretariat to establish the Council, in line
with the proposals in this paper, with the aim of holding a first meeting of the
Council in early 2014.

Action 1

Information Security
Policies need to come back to ExCo for review and agreement with

solutions for areas where compliance is difficult. E.g. acceptable use
policy.

LS Update: 01/07/13 The Head of Information Security will be
contacting each ExCo member to discuss the Policies and identify area
where compliance will prove difficult.

LS Update: 07/08/13 All but 1 Policy (Acceptable Use) are now on the
Intranet and are part of an Information Security and Assurance
communication plan along with the Information Security Handbook
and on-going training and awareness. The Acceptable Use Policy was
raised as a potential non-compliance issue by several ExCo members
and therefore has not been published; a Corrective Action Plan has
been drafted to mitigate any potential risks of non-compliance. The
Corrective Action Plan will be provided to ExCo for agreement during
the week ending 9 August 13, members will be asked to provide their
response by 27 August 13

The Information Security Training, Awareness and Communications
plan is on target, with specific Information Security requirements
