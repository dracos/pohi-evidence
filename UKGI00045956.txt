Outlook — key issues/upcoming risks, including reputational: -
* POL faces civil litigation in relation to its ‘Horizon’ IT system — adverse judgement would pose reputational risks for b
UKGI. Trial begins 5 November 2018.
+ Major IT transformation programme has improved resilience. A major migration of back office systems has been ©
repeatedly delayed and costs have mounted from £20 to £37m, but extensive mitigation has taken place and the Tom '
organisation is confident of a successful migration in January 2019. S
+ Re-negotiation of third party contracts (Royal Mail and Bank of Ireland) are commercially critical for POL. s
+ Renegotiation of the terms of the Banking Framework, whereby POL provides basic cash banking services on behalf of fa
high street banks. We believe there is significant upside potential for POL. i
* Post Office needs to meet its network commitment and we are agreeing process for external validation of their service LJ
provision. "2
* Policy sponsorship role to BEIS will formally transfer to BEIS on 8 October 2018. =
* Agreeing a Framework Agreement with POL requires clarification from HMT on treatment of public corporations. “p
+ Ramping up of the DMB franchising programme may cause some negative stakeholder interest
