Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Horizon Issues Disclosure

We write further to our letter of 11 February 2019 and your letter of 18 February 2019.
1. Pre-2011 audits of Horizon

141 Post Office understands that E&Y were the auditors of Horizon prior to 2011. Copies of the audit
reports are held by Royal Mail Group. Post Office has made a request for these documents
however Royal Mail Group are concerned about providing these documents without a formal
order from the Court for third party disclosure. Please could you confirm if you wish to continue
to pursue disclosure of these documents, in which case assistance from the Court on this
disclosure request may be required.

2. Horizon Management Council
24 Please see our letter dated 19 February 2019.
3. Newport

3.41 The documents which related to the Newport Pagnell branch were disclosed to the Claimants
due to them being adverse documents which came to light when seeking to locate documents
which related to Ms Burke's branch (which is also called Newport). Post Office is required to
provide disclosure of these documents under CPR 51U.

3.2. To locate documents which related to the Ms Burke's branch, a search was run across 59
custodian's email accounts for documents which contained the phrase "Newport". No date range
was applied to this search. The search returned 4,444 documents which were all manually
reviewed for relevance and disclosure of the responsive relevant / adverse documents was
provided. The search that has already been undertaken is broader than the search which you
are now requesting Post Office to undertake, which is limited by a date range. Running the date
limited search would return the same results as Post Office's previous search. If your proposal
instead is that Post Office searches other custodian's email accounts for documents relating to
Ms Burke's branch, please could you confirm the custodian's email accounts which should be
part of this search. It should be noted that it may not be possible to extract further email

accounts for Post Office's IT system and review these documents prior to the start of the Horizon
Issues Trial. Post Office's position on the reasonableness and proportionality of such a search is
reserved until your client's position is known.

3.3 Your new disclosure request also seeks for Post Office to search the email accounts of Fujitsu
personnel. Before now, none of your disclosure requests have been targeted towards the email
accounts of Fujitsu employees and to undertake a search of these accounts would require our e-
disclosure provider to undertake a substantial amount of work with Fujitsu to understand how
their emails are stored, whether any archiving exists and how the emails could be extracted.
Given that trial begins in 2 weeks there is not time to undertake this work before the start of trial,
which would lead to disclosure being given either during trial or after it has ended. Further, these
documents are not within the control of Post Office.

4. Witness statement disclosure

44 Please see our letter of 20 February 2019.

5. Credence report for Mr Patny and call logs for Mr Latif

5.1 Further to our response to request 10 in section 10.1 of our letter of 11 February 2019, enquiries
have been made with Post Office to locate the credence report referred to in the NBSC logs. We
understand that a copy of this report has not been located and since Credence only holds data
for 3 months a copy of this report cannot be reproduced.

5.2 In relation to the call logs for Mr Latif, please find enclosed POL-0514487 which are the call logs
for Mr Latif's branch from 25 October 2001 to 31 March 2017.

6. Responses to disclosure requests made on 22 January 2019
