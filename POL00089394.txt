Andrew,

Ihave now amended my witness statement to refer to the specific case and to mention the removal of the Cash Account
in 2005.

Does this provide sufficient detail? if it is OK, I’ll sign a hard copy and get it scanned and emailed to you (or do you want
a paper copy in the post ~ if so I’ll need an address).

Regards

Gareth

Gareth,

The only clarification | think | need at the moment relates to the time line, 2005 removal of cash account. Could you
clarify what this means and discount it as a possible explanation for the losses beginning to occur at that time in the
sefton and neild case.

The audit reports will simply show the money missing, so will not take things further.

Andrew

Andrew,

Thanks for the info you have supplied me with on these two cases. I thought I should try and
clarify exactly what you want from me.

My understanding from Rachael was that all that is required is a signed version of a standard
report I produced a couple of months ago (attached - together with 2 related documents). If
that is the case I can get that produced, scanned and emailed to you in a couple of days.

However having read through the info you’ve given me, perhaps you want me to cover some
further things. Some observations:

1. In the case of Nield & Sefton, it is stated losses started in 2005 and this is linked
to the installation of Horizon. My report shows that Horizon was rolled out between
1999 and 2002, so 20@5 doesn’t seem to tie in with Horizon being installed. NB I have
no records as to exactly when Horizon was installed in any Branch and I don’t know if
Post Office Ltd have any such records. Similarly I have no idea if this mismatch of
dates is material.

2. At some point in 201@ the Post Office would have been migrated from the original
Horizon System to the new Horizon Online system. This is mentioned in the Grant Allen
case but not in the Nield & Sefton case.

Note that I have no information regarding complaints or investigations into Horizon, and it
has already been established that it is not possible to examine the original Horizon system
that was operational until 2010.

Similarly, I have not been presented with any audit data relating to any of these cases to
examine.

Regards

Gareth

Dear Rachael / Gareth,
Please find enclosed outlines of the the two cases which involve me.

Of the two, i would say that the Sefton & nield case is the more urgent, and therefore
Gareth i would be grateful if you could concentrate on that one first. it is listed for
trial in Jan and they have been waiting longer for this report. the allen case is only for
plea and case management on 10th December. in an ideal world i would like to serve a report
before the 16th if possible, but in any event we do not have a defence case statement in that
matter yet.

regards
