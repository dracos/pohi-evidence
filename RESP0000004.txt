Dear Sir Wyn,

Restorative Justice

I am writing in response to your recommendation that by 31 October 2025, the
Department, Fujitsu and the Post Office shall publish, either separately or together, a
report outlining any agreed programme of restorative justice and/or any actions taken
by that date to produce such a programme.

Today, the Department for Business and Trade, Fujitsu Services Limited and Post
Office Limited are publishing the attached joint statement which sets out our plans for
our future work on restorative justice. This builds on the listening work that the
Restorative Justice Council have conducted and their recommendations, as set out in
the attached report which they are also publishing today.

We are grateful to those who have shared their experiences of the Horizon Scandal
with the Restorative Justice Council and we are now acting, together with the
Department and Fujitsu Services Limited, to establish a lasting and meaningful
restorative justice programme which is directly informed by the wishes of those who
were harmed.

Yours sincerely,

Neil Brocklehurst
