Over the next week please look out for the Whistleblowing posters on display within your
depot.

Whistleblowing refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing by reporting it
internally within an organisation.

Post Office is committed to conducting business with the highest standards of honesty,
integrity and openness. Colleagues can raise concerns in confidence, secure in the knowledge
that we will take those concerns seriously and act on them.

the procedure to follow if a colleague wants to raise a concern. The business will support
anyone who raises a genuine concern, even if it turns out to be mistaken. You will not be
treated unfairly or liable to disciplinary action as a result of doing so.

How do I raise a concern?
There are three ways in which colleagues can report a concern:

1. By contacting their line manager or HR Director

2. By contacting the Speak Up confidential reporting service run by InTouch MCS Ltd on
