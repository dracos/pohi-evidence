REGINA v SUSAN JANE RUDKIN
STAFFORD CROWN COURT
SENTENCE -~ DATE TO BE FIXED
CASE Ni OLTD/0809/0101

The above named Defendant appeared at Burton-on-Trent Magistrates Court on the
23 March 2009.

On a plea before venue basis the Defendant pleaded Guilty to the single count of theft.
Jurisdiction was declined and the Defendant was committed for Sentence to Stafford
Crown Court on a date to be notified. John Dove will prosecute the case in the Crown
Court.

Mr Dove has advised that the Defence have informed him that arrangements are
currently in hand to repay the stolen money at the rate of £1,000 per month. My
understanding from speaking to Ged Harbinson is that the husband is repaying the
money at that rate but that confiscation proceedings are to be pursued.

Mr Dove has also asked to be provided with a copy of the schedule of the investigative
and administrative costs to be claimed and a copy of the signed admission statement
handed by the Defendant to the Auditor.
