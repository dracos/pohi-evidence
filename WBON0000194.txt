Jonny / Pete

The minutes of our meeting are being turned into a witness statement. I have seen this process previously
where a colleague signed such a statement which resulted in a very stressful court appearance. I am happy to
continue supporting the process and refining the information but I will not be signing a witness statement,
we need to find another way to use this information.

Tbbett, Dave

Pete,

Thanks again to you and the team for your time on the phone on Friday. It was helpful to flesh out the comments
provided in relation to Mr Roll's statement.

I attach a draft response to Mr Roll's statement that is based on Friday's discussion. You'll see that there are several
comments and questions where further detail is required. Please would you provide the information requested by
close of play tomorrow?

Let me know if there's anything you want to discuss.
Kind regards

Jonny
