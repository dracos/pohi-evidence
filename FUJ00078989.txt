PINICL IMPACT ASSESSMENT TEAM (PIAT)
PROCESS DESCRIPTION

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 The high level process for the resolution of PINICLs has been described in “PinICL
Issue Resolution Process” and the aims and objectives of the various groupings involved
in the process are similarly described in “PINICL Forums - Aims and Objectives”. Both of
these documents are attached to this paper as annex A and B respectively.

1.2 The purpose of this document is to describe the process that will be followed by the
PINICL Impact Assessment Team in discharging its responsibilities and in interfacing with
the other forums.

2. MEMBERSHIP OF PIAT

Colin Oudot - PDA Product Management

Gareth Lewis - PDA Security

Janet Leach - PDA Testing

Other Non-Core members will be consulted as and when required.

3. PURPOSE

3.1. To assess and document the business impact of outstanding faults in the Pathway
solution that are referred to it by Pathway for consideration of a deferral of the appropriate
fix.

3.2 Develop and document a workaround to the known problem where this is required to
maintain a viable release.

3.3. To obtain sponsor approval for known problem, and any proposed workaround, to be
entered on the Known Problem Register (KPR) when necessary.

3.4 Advise Pathway of any problems which they have submitted to the PIAT which are
not accepted for entry to the KPR and therefore must be resolved.

3.5 To agree the target time for subsequent introduction of a problem resolution to the
operational environment.
