I would just change the media section to say:

Media interest to date has been limited but unwelcome and damaging. The coverage is being
generated by a limited number of journalists. We are taking a very proactive position in
challenging journalists, combining legal and editorial approaches, including to senior figures
in relevant organisations. We will maintain our communications strategy focussing on
providing a firm, measured and proportionate response to key audiences on the central
allegation of faults within the Horizon system.

Media interest to date has been limited and is only being closely followed by a very limited
number of journalists. Similarly, the story has failed to find any depth of traction with the majority
of MPs. We will maintain our communications strategy focussing on providing a measured and
proportionate response to key audiences on the central allegation of faults within the Horizon
system.
