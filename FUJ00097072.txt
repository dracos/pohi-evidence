Dave,

FYI. This issue has been raised by Graham Welsh. POL did not mention this on the call this morning, but be aware this may
become an Acceptance Incident. Gareth is checking on the viability of the workaround but we do not have any capacity to include
this in Release 1.

Regards,

Geoff

Peter,

Please can you keep an eye on this while I'm away. The issue is that I don’t want to be telling POL that they can’t rely on Branch
numbers or that there’s a risk of more complaints from Post masters. They could regard this as a serious issue and delay
acceptance on HNG-X. Geoff Butts tells me he’s aware and that they are working on a permanent fix.
