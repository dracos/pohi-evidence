Progress

Achievements this week:

IT Roadmap - POLSAP: Collaborative Acceptance Testing (CAT) has commenced with business users
and is progressing well. 31% of tests have been successfully completed and schedule remains on
track to complete by the 27th May 2010 planned date.

Back Office Efficiency - POLFS Direct Debits: Functionality successfully delivered on Monday
12th April - project complete.

Crown Office - Efficiency: A Work Time Listening & Learning (WIL) session was delivered into
the Crown Network to outline/communicate the year ahead.

Product - Paystation Plus Phase 2b: Approx 7,770 terminals have successfully received the new
phase 2b configuration.

Network Development: Two more Post Office Essential (POE) offices went live on the 12th April
at Tennyson Road (retailer cash) and Mossley (POL cash) which brings the total live to date
under phase 2 to 18.

Direct - Campaigns: The email distribution of the March Newsletter campaign (609k emails) was
fully completed on 9th April as planned. The ‘open’ and ‘click to open’ rates were in line
with industry standards.

Compliance - Operational Compliance: Branch Manager compliance training has commenced. Early
feedback from Branch Managers and Crown Area Managers has been positive after initial
resistance as they can see benefits to other aspects of their roles.

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): The first 3 live proving transactions were
conducted in the Model Office with DVLA staff. Feedback on the customer experience was very
positive and we were able to show how easy the transaction was which gave some assurance
around the training of our staff and sub postmasters.

What did not go so well this week:

Horizon Online: The Horizon Online pilot continues to run at 614 branches, but further branch
migrations remain suspended due to the series of live service interruptions which have
occurred since 26th March. A set of criteria has been established in conjunction with Fujitsu
and the wider POL business which must be met before migrations will re-start, including a 2
week period of proven stability, as well as an understanding/rectification of the root causes
of the live service issues. These criteria will be finalised in the next few days, along with
options for the recommencement of the rollout.

Business Efficiency: There is a significant risk to delivery of the in-year benefit challenge
of £30.3m. Work continues to de-risk the plan through the identification of contingency and
planned mitigating activity

Business Efficiency - Agents Pay: Draft figures indicate a significant risk to the targeted
£2m savings against the WHS income guarantee. Finance will quantify this next week

Product - VAT On Postal Services: PFWi and RM Letters funding arrangements for the £1.4m
required for the project has still not been agreed at Group level (see risk section). This has
potential implications to submission of the long-form business case to POLIC planned for 4th
May. Stephen Hirst and Davyd Nash are continuing work to resolve with Matthew Rose (Group
Programme Sponsor) .

Product - Savings Gateway: Launch of the new product is scheduled for 31st December 2010,
however, HMRC are applying pressure for an earlier go-live of October/ November. HMRC have set
a deadline of 30th April for POL to confirm whether this is achievable. At this stage project
team feel this is unrealistic but this will be validated with Hewlett Packard (HP) and Fujitsu
Services (FS).

Product - Paystation Plus: The running of dual files did not begin on 12th April as planned
due to the CSC firewall preventing data being passed to Alliance & Leicester (A&L). A&L impact
assessment to be agreed. Daily calls to monitor situation with client have been arranged and
ongoing dialogue with client and POL is being maintained (see issues section).

Crown Office - Our Best Way (OBW): OBW trial sales results continue to reflect an
underperformance against the 66 branches in the control group. Sale results are slightly
better against the rest of the Crown network but a gap remains against the intended trial
benefit targets:

OBW Trial Targq@BW Performance Agq MBit Performance Against
Control Office Crown Network
Focus Products 4.00% -4.10% -1.80%
standard ProductsI 0.50% -2.10% -1.00%

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): The response rate for Agency vetting is still
only running at 48% - resource is being sought to call branches in mitigation.

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): Contract variation forms for 24 sites were not
sent out to branches by the supplier (Linneys). In addition the necessary DVLA forms did not
go out with the training materials. The supplier will be monitored more closely moving
forward.

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): Some Crown Branch Managers have shown
reluctance to complete the Vetting forms and have flagged concerns to their Union reps who in
turn have issued a correspondence to HR. Head of Network has been asked to support.
Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): Although DVLA stated that they were ready, it
appears the supplied security certificate was incorrect and there are some connectivity issues
with the live DVLA communication links (DVLA engineer on site).

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): The Programme is still being provided with
examples where BT are not aware what work they have to complete at the branch or have not
installed the PSTN line in the right place or not completed the work. These have all been fed
back to Fujitsu for revisits to be booked. The performance of BT and Fujitsu and the issues
being caused is proving to consume more resource than anticipated.

Application, Enrolment & Identification (AEI): A planned DVLA joint test meeting did not occur
for the third week running

Compliance - Monitoring & Reporting: The planned November 2010 completion date for this strand
element of the Compliance programme continues to be at risk due to the strand still
determining the current compliance MI gaps and issues coupled with the absence of an assigned
Business Analyst resource.

Network Development: Due to Horizon Online delays the two BFPO training school pilots will not
go live next week as planned. The milestone will be updated once we have agreement to a
revised date.

IT Roadmap - POLSAP: A number of activities within the Fujitsu plan have not been completed to
schedule due to Fujitsu resources being diverted to address high priority Horizon online
issues. A re-planning activity is underway to determine how the slippages can be recovered.

IT Roadmap - POLSAP: CMS Integration testing is still not signed-off as there are issues
regarding creating Bank of Ireland customers. This is currently being tested and discussipyg 3 ofh2

New or Major Issues:

Direct - Travel Insurance Rate Review: As a result of a delay to agreeing new rates for all Travel
Insurance products between AON Fortis and POL there is a risk that the full year benefits of the
new rates will not be achieved.

* Actions to close - POLIC agreement of the new rates.

* Update 25th March: The Travel Insurance Rate Review business case was approved by POLIC on
22/03. However AON have now requested further changes to the agreed rates. Martin Moran is
meeting with AON to drive final sign off for Standard Rates by Ist April. No dates are
currently available for signed off rates on Extended Stay and Gap Year products.
of this latest delay are as follows;

© Timelines for production of the Product Brochure will be pushed out beyond the current
date of 16th May.
© Timelines for implementation of the AON fulfilment interface will be pushe:
the current date of 17t.
© There i

May.

is a risk that the slippage in the above activities

build not being incorporated in the eBusiness release on
release is 29th June.

o As Portaltech (software appl

ation developer) are scheduled to complete the main body

of their activity by April, there is a risk that key resource to support
process and post live fixes will not be available.
© The loss of benefits due to slippage from the planned go live date of 20th April to
29th June totals approximately £142k
* Update 8th April - Martin Moran has written to AON requesti

g an explanation re the
additional charges that they (AON) want to pass onto POL. This will drive the next steps to
be taken. Until this is resolved a go-live date cannot be agreed and the impacts highlighted
above, pose a greater risk of being realised.

* Update 15th April - AON have now provided revised rates for Standard Products, however rates
for Gap and Extended Stay products are still outstanding and are required to determine a new
go live date. The current target for agreeing these rates is week commencing 26th April.

Product - Paystation Plus: A&L do not agree to the file transfer times. The project is unable to
plan the re-introduction of the A&L products and the rollout to the rest of the UK network until a
suitable resolution to the file timings issue has been agreed by all parties. This will result in
further model office live proving and pilot activities.

* Action to close (opened 7th January): Set up 2 working group to close the issue consisting
of Marketing, Service Delivery and C&IS Technical Authority. Inaugural meeting took place
1st December with further meetings planned.

© Update 18th March: The draft Business Case is being reviewed by David Gray (IT Strategy and
Architecture). Gavin Bell has engaged (letters have been exchanged) with A&L to agree a
migration date,

* Update 30th March: Submission of business c
Delivery has set up workshops to review E2E
ongoing ownership and controls.

© Update 8th April - The running of dual files will begin on the 12th April. A&L will begin an
impact assessment as of 19th April. A&L will respond with a go/ no go decision on 26th
April. This will mean the planned migration of A&L to the Transaction Integrator will not

mplete on the 21st April and will need to be re-planned. Daily calls to monitor the
situation with the client have been arranged and ongoing dialogue with client and POL is
being maintained.

¢ Update 15th April - A&L client file dual running did not commence as planned on the 12th

April due to infrastructure firewall complications that would not allow live production data

from EDG to be sent to the clients test file system. The re-planned date for dual running is

22/23 April. The deadline for A&L migration is the end of May.

The Business Case to implement the file rectification work is now targeted for the POLIC

meeting on 4th May.
