Lesley, Dave, Neil

Julie and I had a positive meeting with Legal, Cartwright King and Imperial College London consultants (ICL). We
discussed scope, approach and outcomes

- Agreed the scope would be HNG-X only (i.e. 2010 onwards) and that it would not extend beyond HNG into other
3" party systems

- This scope will need to be reviewed as ICL progress but will cover technology, controls, processes, disputes and
other investigations. Additional detail included in attached document from ICL.

- We discussed possible outcomes and wording ICL might use so both Legal and Cartwright King understand what
ICL would be likely to say in a final report.

- We discussed the approach/costs, ensuring there was common understanding that this would not become
clearer until ICL understand more. We also made sure they understood there would be a Fujitsu cost for this
work. We also used the discussion on scope to explain the scale of what is now being included in this review,
explaining that this scope is larger than our previous conversations about the counter/audit storage processes.

-  lagreed that I would arrange a full day kick off with Fujitsu/PO to help make ICL are more familiar with the
systems, architecture, processes and find out the specific the level of information/evidence required.

lam satisfied that now we have had this meeting those involved understand both the scale and risks. Chris A was on
holiday but Jessica Madron attended on his behalf and was pleased with the meeting. Given ICL’s other commitments
the kick off will not happen until October.

I have engaged Andy Grant on this and he has lined up some support for this within ATOS. I have done this because I
think it is important ATOS learn more about the challenges we have in this area. We have many transition states over
the next few years and we will need to be able to evidence our technology solutions, controls and processes throughout
this period. As we have learnt on the Mediation scheme we might have to thoroughly investigate individual cases that
occur throughout this period for many years to come.

I will keep you informed on progress.
Regards

Andy
