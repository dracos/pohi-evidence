P&M

As a side point, FJ are exploring a way to extract all the KELs into pdf format for Freeths. It's not as good as looking at
them on screen but hopefully within the next month, we should have a complete pdf copy of the KEL and then we
could as needed give this to the CCRC.

Hi Mark,

It was good to hear from you earlier.

Here is a quick note on the points we discussed, plus a short summary of the history/status of the investigation as
requested.

I have double checked the correspondence from the CCRC and yes, the scope of the visit was "supervised access to
the Known Error Log" (see attached email chain). Whether Rod has had further conversations with Miles Trent
regarding the scope of the visit, I would need to check.

Rod — please can you let us know if the position on the scope of the visit has shifted at all? Is it still limited to the KEL?

Can I also check whether the attendees from the CCRC/Grant Thornton have signed the non-disclosure agreement we
drafted. This may also be a question for Rod. I presume this has all been dealt with given that the meeting has now
been arranged but thought it was worth flagging just in case.

Summary of CCRC investigation

The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is a body which investigates cases where people have been
convicted, have lost on appeal but believe they have been wrongly convicted. In rare cases they can investigate even
when there has been no appeal.

Since 2015, the CCRC have been investigating various cases (the list now stands at 32 cases) involving postmasters
who were convicted for false accounting and/or theft.

The typical process for the review is that the CCRC issues a "section 17 Request" (under the Criminal Appeal Act
1995) for documents relating to a particular case and then Post Office is under an obligation to produce that material.
The CCRC then reviews that material and makes a decision on whether to refer the cases to an appeal court.

We (WBD) have been helping to co-ordinate the document collation process along with Cartwright King (criminal
lawyers) who have taken the lead on sourcing all the prosecution/security files. We have also been co-ordinating
responses to the CCRC's queries on various issues but the lines of communication are between Rodric and Miles
Trent at the CCRC.

The available documents have been provided to the CCRC on 30 of the 32 cases and CK are currently chasing down
any available material for the final 2 most recent applications (made in February). The CCRC is yet to reach a
conclusion on any of the cases.

The CCRC have also instructed Grant Thornton as its appointed expert to look at Horizon. Just FYI, GT and the CCRC
appear to be focusing on the Misra case and they are looking closely at the transaction logs.

The CCRC are also interested in the Known Error Log, in the context of Misra and generally. You'll will see from the
attached chain that we answered some initial questions on the KEL and the CCRC came back with further queries. In
particular, they are interested in reviewing the KELs dating from the time of Ms Misra's indictment period (June 2005-
January 2008). Please note Rod's explanation in his email of 15 November 2017 that information about Misra may not
be accessible/identifiable.

Hopefully this gives you what you need but shout if you need anything else. I hope all goes well tomorrow.
Many thanks,
