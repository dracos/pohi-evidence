1 Introduction

This document presents the Corrective Action Plan that emerged from a post
audit meeting following the audit of the operation of CSR+ Development.

2 Process

This Plan will go through a number of iterations and reviews following
production as Corrective Actions (CA) are worked on and, subject to agreement
between the CA Owner and Internal Audit, amended.

The status will remain OPEN until such time as the CA Owner and Internal
Audit agree on a course of action to address the issue at which time the status
will be changed to ACTION. Once the actions have been carried out, subject to
agreement between the CA Owner and Internal Audit, the status will change to
CLOSED.

Once actions have been agreed the Plan will be monitored by the responsible
manager and subject to periodic review by Internal Audit.

ISO 9001 cross references have been included. Where more than 1 clause of the
Standard is considered to have been breached the primary clause is
underlined.

The audit identified that some Team Leaders had
identified retrospective work to generate missing
and update CSR documentation in preparation for
future Releases.

This retrospective work should be supported by the
organisation and should be taken into account in
any resource planning that may be underway.
However, it must be planned and I recommend that
Delivery Unit Managers are tasked with developing
‘Get Well Plans’ for their retrospective units to deal
with the missing or incomplete deliverables.

Hard evidence is an important element of ISO
registration. The audit found little in the way of
hard evidence to support assertions made wrt
reviews.

There was an abundance of verbal assurances that
lifecycle reviews had taken place but very little hard
evidence, in the form of walkthrough notes,
document comment sheets, review meeting
minutes, etc existed. Having moved from the NR2
position where even anecdotal evidence was hard to
find Pathway must now formalise the documenting
and retention of review outcomes. Not only does
this provide evidence of review but can also be used
to measure the effectiveness of the review process
itself, an important element of continuous process
improvement.

The audit identified that EPOSS continues to be
unstable. PinICL evidence illustrated the numbers
of PinICLs raised since the 1998 Task Force and the
rate of their being raised.

The EPOSS Solutions Report [7] made specific
recommendations to consider the re-design and re-
write of EPOSS, in part or in whole, to address the
then known shortcomings. In light of the continued
evidence of poor product quality these
recommendations should be re-considered.

17/11: This action falls within Development but requires

speak with TPA direct.

25/11: Work on Alz98 identified that majority of problems
(~80%) were to do with error and printer error handling.
Daily meetings had been instigated. TPA of view that while
original code had not been good it would be difficult to
justify the case for re-writing now.

25/u : Email issued by TPA :-

“We have not formally closed down the recommendation
that we re-engineer the EPOSS application due to its
inherent instability. Since this recommendation was made,
a number of events/actions have taken place. We
embarked upon a major maintenance exercise for LT2
which targeted several known stability issues. In parallel,
we carried out a defensive testing activity which identified
a number of faults which were addressed. The intensive
exercise designed to remove acceptance incident 298
resulted in many substantial improvements to the error
handling, messaging and printing aspects of the product.
We finally introduced improved unit and link testing and
more disciplined configuration control. Finally, the
maintainability and enhanceability of the product has been
proven by the speed and quality of the SIP 16 and EPOSS
Reconciliation developments.

We will of course continue to monitor the PINICL stack for
the next few months and if necessary re-evaluate this
decision. Would Jan please close this issue formally using
the rationale described.”

The risks identified on the PO risk register apply
whole or in part to all Delivery Units. In order to

Concern was expressed by a number of Team
Leaders about the planning process.

For the Planning Process to be accepted and used
positively by the Team Leaders it is imperative that
it meets their needs as well as management's. I
recommend that a full review is carried out of the
Planning Process that confirms or refutes the
concerns raised by the Team Leaders and establishes
a process that is acceptable to, and used by, all
interested parties.

The audit identified that process management was
operating on a departmental basis and made more
complex the assurance that Pathway had a full suite
in time for ISO registration.

To have any chance of success I believe that a
similar singular resource should be appointed to
take overall responsibility for the co-ordination of
process development and deployment across the
whole of Pathway and that this resource and the ISO
Project Manager should be organisationally co-
located.

The audit identified the absence of development
standards for Agent and Counter development.

The Host Application Database Design and Interface
Standards were developed to provide definitive
technical standards for host development teams.
Arguably out of date since it deals specifically with
Oracle development, there are no known
equivalents for Counter or Agent Development. I
recommend that the HADDIS is updated to reflect
the current host development environments and the
equivalents for Counter and Agent development be
produced.

range of development standards so no further work
required in that area. Confirmed that this was not the case
with Counters and that JD was producing :

(a) Description of Standard APIs for Counters
(b) Development Standards or Counters

JH to forward workplan and periodic progress report.
Target completion for these and NFR Catalogue 03/00

17/02 : Work in this area, including upgrade to HADDIS,
has been delayed due to higher priority work. JD expecting
to be able to restart soon, starting with replan, re-scope &
re-estimate. Replan to be completed by 06/03.

07/04 : This has slipped due to competing priorities with
015/17. The main body of the General API is complete and
has been signed-off. Dealing with 2 Appendices and
document will be complete and baselined. Delivery
Managers are then expected to apply the principles to
future work. This also needs to be reviewed against
Macroscope to see how it will fit although this latter part is
not really part of the corrective action.

03/05 : Discussed with Nigel Kermode. Agreed to transfer

as planned WIP and to be reviewed as part of Risk Register.

The audit identified that there were no universal C
or VB standards in place.

However, to improve coding quality and ensure a
consistent basis for code review coding standards
for C and VB must be developed and deployed via
the Intranet OLS. These standards should then be
used.

17/1: To be discussed

25/11: Debated within Development and decided not worth
retrospective re-code for CSR+. A&TC and Dublin have own
stds. Post CSR+ JH had assumed Macroscope would
establish but this does not now seem likely. Therefore
Pathway have to look to themselves and decision taken to
adopt RODB Team standards, validate with other Team
Leaders and implement. Will need to be kept consistent
with JD work @ 015/16.

17/02 : To be included in the re-plan identified at 015/16.

07/04 : This has now been extended to include SQL
standards as well. A review of existing standards had been
held with Delivery Managers and the KMS standards were
used as a basis for review draft. Target date now end o4/oo.

The audit identified the possibility that the statistics
used to report progress on documentation
generation and approval may be inaccurate.

In order to present a more accurate reflection of
CSR+ documentation status, thus improving the
reporting to and monitoring of this by management,
two review cycles should be undertaken/completed :

a. The Programme Office should complete
their review the totality of the PVCS documentation
worksets for CSR+.

b. Workset owners should review their
worksets and confirm the current content or provide
details of changes to the Programme Office.

A similar situation pertains for the CSR
documentation.

The size of this task is significant and should be
included within the proposed ‘Get Well Plans’
identified in 3.2. In order to size the job the
Programme Office should undertake a review of the
worksets to ensure that they are all required and
workset owners should review their content to
confirm their accuracy, as required in

The audit considered that insufficient management
attention was being given to the contractual
requirement to obtain ISO registration by
September 2000.

Having personally steered three separate companies
through the rigours of ISO 9000 registration,
including one to ISOgoo1/TickIT, I believe that the
breadth of scope of the proposed certification, and
the time remaining in which to achieve it, demands
that a full time Project Manager is assigned to the
task. Either the Quality Manager should be able to
transfer any non-essential initiatives or a resource
should be assigned to him specifically to manage the
registration commitment.

is appointed, an activity should take place to
