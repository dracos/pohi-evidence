The main alternative is to confirm that, subject to our point about the Judgment being read as a whole, we
have identified all the passages on which we intend to rely. We would, in effect, be deleting the words “in
particular” from the sentences that introduce each category of point.

Whether or not we want to do that depends on whether the rest of the counsel team thinks that amounts to
tying our hands too much.

One further option would be to say practically the same thing as below but with slightly more words. For
example:

“We have responded fully to your letter of yesterday. There are no further paragraphs that we wish to
identify in accordance with the Order.

Your clients now have the benefit of a 44-page witness statement filed in accordance with the Order and
have notice of the parts of the Judgment to which Post Office objects. We offered to provide a Skeleton
Argument, which would have given you early sight of the arguments on the application as well as the
relevant passages, but you preferred to seek a witness statement.

Your clients can, on the basis of the witness statement, form a view as to whether or not they wish to oppose
the application. We invite you to inform us of your clients’ position in accordance with the deadline in the
Order.”

Kind Regards,

Owain

I would normally agree, but given historic allegations of PO being dismissive, do we want to write
something more substantive?

We could, however, respond with something like this (just so Cs cannot say we ignored their letter):
“We have responded fully to your letter of yesterday. We have nothing to add.”

Dear All

Please find attached Freeths' response to our letter of last night. The back correspondence is also attached.
They are planning to "proceed on the basis that you will not be relying on any parts of the Judgment to
which you have not expressly referred in Parsons 15" unless we tell them otherwise by 11am and may seek a
hearing with the Judge to discuss this matter and delay the recusal hearing.

Thoughts and comments welcomed.

Kind regards

Amy
