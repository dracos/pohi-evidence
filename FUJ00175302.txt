Hi Al

I am really sorry you have had to write to me. I had already organised a full review of the situation.
I assure you that we will take whatever steps are necessary.
I will revert with further details asap.

never improved or accelerated by a single day and at no time did we sense real urgency or an understanding of the
seriousness of the situation.

had to be re-booted earlier in 2016. That was at a weekend and was less substantial but it seems to me (a) that the
lessons were simply not learnt and (b) that the testing we undertook must have been inadequate or it would have picked
up the failure at high volumes.

serious response and a cold, hard look at the quality of the service we are receiving, and of the team providing it,
especially given the cost of having our own unique data centre and back up support.
