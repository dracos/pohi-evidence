All — here’s my summary of my call with Andy Winn. Andy ~ please make amend / correct as necessary.
Thanks, Redric

e Issue first surfaced at POL Finance Service Centre (FSC) on 6 February 2012, at the clase of a Branch Trading
period

e The Issue raised concerned the £9799.88 discrepancy at the Willen branch

* FSC might have proactively contacted SPM given the size of the discrepancy

e FSC investigated, saw that it looked wrong, and brought the account back to balance (i.e. £0) at no cost to the
SPMR

« FSC would have monitored the Willen branch to see what happened the following month

e Over the next few weeks, as the rest of the Branch Trading data for the same period was processed, the other
13 branch anomalies were noted

¢ Those other branches’ accounts were brought to balance, again at no cost to the subpostmaster

¢ This was not perceived to be a significant issue given the small number of branches affected and the small sums
involved

e On6 February 2013, the Willen SPMR contacted POL National Business Support Centre (NBSC) to report the
same discrepancy in his Branch Trading as the previous year
e NBSC passed this on to Fujitsu between 6 and 8 February 2013
e Fujitsu then notified FSC of the problem on 28 February 2013
© Fujitsu resolved B14 on 25 April 2013

The Branch as an unexplained discrepancy. They balanced and rolled trading
period on 6 Feb, they have one stock unit AA and this was balanced with a
loss of £39.57 which was transferred to local suspense however the figure
that was cleared out from local suspense was much higher £9839.45.

I have carried out transaction logs for all transactions from date range 31
Jan to 06 Feb. Branch has submitted copies of the final balance reports from
TP 10 BP4 and TP10 BP 5 the balance report for TP10 BPS shows discrepancy
transferred of £39.57 and then discrepancy resolved £9839.45. The transaction
log completed for all transaction does not show any other figures being
entered into or removed from housekeeping/local suspense account.
