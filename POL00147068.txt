1 Of the 31 plus advised on cases as the landscape now stands in most of the cases it is better that
we have the expert instructed as any case begun now will attract some type of Horizon issue.

2.Much of the work requested in our charging advices is dotting I’s and crossing Ts. Most of the cases

advised for charge will be sound prosecutions with comparatively little extra work when we have an expert’s
statement.
