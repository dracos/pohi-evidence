for approximately 5 years, though have been employed by the Post Office for
approximately 23 years.

Post Office Ltd first commenced offering foreign currency at our outlets in 1993 and I
have been involved with this enterprise since it's inception. The project was started in
partnership between the Post Office and a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland called First
Rate Currency Services (FRCS). Foreign exchange was started at our outlets in a trial
at 20 sites in November 1993, a further 180 sites were brought online in April 1994 and
a full National nationwide role out was carried out in April 1995 where 647 outlets
offered a full ‘On demand’ currency service.

The Post Office has been in a contractual relationship with First Rate Currency Service
between November 1993 and March 2002 to provide wholesale currency to Post Office
Ltd. In March 2002, the Post office in Partnership with the Bank of Ireland formed a
joint venture company to run foreign exchange within the Post Office network. From
March 2002 until the present time, the joint venture company called First Rate Travel
Services (FRTS) has provided wholesale currency to the Post Office network.

Under the contractual obligations upon formation of the joint venture in March 2002, all

income generated from foreign exchange transactions are paid to the joint venture
company which then pays a rebate to the Post Office from transactions carried out on
it's behalf. Post Office Ltd also receives 50% of all dividends that are generated by the
joint venture company.

Post Office Ltd has an agreement with the Federation of Subpostmasters to pay all
postmasters the sum of £1.12 for every foreign exchange transaction conducted on
behalf of Post Office Ltd. This figure is a flat sum that is paid for every transaction
irrespective of the value of the transaction.

The Post Office has a number of contractual relationships with corporate customers
who receive foreign currency on account. All these corporate customers receive the
standard discount for any transaction that is over £ 5,000 in value. Some of these
contractual relations involve a yearly rebate depending on the number and value of the
transactions conducted. All of these contracts are managed centrally by the Head of
Travel Services and his team, there is no authority process for anybody apart from the
Head of Travel Services or an appointed member of his team to enter into a contract for
the provision of foreign exchange for a corporate customer or an individual conducting
a high value of transactions.

Since November 1993 a daily fax is sent to all participating on demand outlets, which
provides them with the daily retail rates of exchange they are authorised to buy and sell

currency at.

On a daily basis Post Office Ltd buys the currencies it needs to support it’s networks
from just one supplier, this historically was FRCS and is now FRTS. This currency is
bought at the wholesale buy rate for that particular day; this wholesale buy rate has
been contractually agreed between Post Office Ltd/FRTS at the rate the currency can

be sourced from the wholesale currency market.

Upon receipt into the Post Office network all currency bought from FRCS/FRTS is
converted from the wholesale buy rate to the Retail buy rate and the currency is always
held at this rate within the network. This conversion from the wholesale buy rate to the
retail buy rate involves the currency being devalued, on average this devaluation
amounts to 6% of the currency’s value. The reason the currency is devalued in this
manner is to enable all foreign currency within Post Office Network to be held at the
same universal rate, which is the lowest rate of its value. The consequence of this is
that any subsequent revaluation of the currency shows that the monies are generated
at outlets and not at the central distribution centre

This accounting regime has been agreed within Post Office finance executive as the
best way to hold and record monies made from Bureau de Change transactions. It also
has the compliance of the Bank of Ireland through its subsidiary FRCS/FRTS.

When currency is sold to a member of the public this is sold at the retail sell rate, which
is provided to participating outlets on a daily basis through the fax sent. The difference
between the rate, which the currency is being held and the rate at which it is sold to the
public is known as the retail spread, this is a common term within the Bureau de
Change industry and generates the revaluation figure at the outlet.

However the retail spread does not constitute the true income generated from the
transaction as the currency has already been devalued by approximately 6% on its
purchase from the wholesaler. The true income generated is the differential between
the rate at which it was bought from the wholesaler and the rate it was sold to the
customer, this is also the difference between the full retail spread and the initial

devaluation.

Continuation of statement of Hugh Richard STACEY

In order to demonstrate how this process works I have produced an illustration of the
purchase and sale of £100 of currency as a conceptual example, which I now produce
as item number HRS/1,

This illustration shows how the wholesale and retail margins operate and the differential
between the wholesale and the retail spread.

In terms of the illustration if we were to buy £100 from FRCS/FRTS, Post Office Ltd
would buy this for £101. Upon receipt into the Post Office Network (Cash Centre) the
£101 would be converted in value to £95 which represents the retail buy rate, this
devaluation looses the Post Office £6 in value which is held on its books at the central
cash centre. If the currency being held in the Post Office outlet was subsequently sold
to a customer this would be done at the retail sell rate, which on the illustration would
be £103. In terms of the outlet the revaluation within their accounts should show the full
difference between the retail buy and the retail sell rates, which in the example is £8.
The true income earned from this transaction is the difference between the revaluation
on sale and the initial devaluation, which is £8 minus £6 giving £2 income generated.

I first became aware of an irregularity at Rugeley Post Office on 16" January 2003
through a call I received from the Post Office Legal department asking for my advice on
the freezing of bank accounts. As a result of this conversation I was made aware of an
incident having taken place at Rugeley Post office involving the Bureau de Change
product and was asked for my input as the Head of Travel Services. Since that initial
contact, I have been involved with various analyses of Bureau de Change transactions
conducted at this office and also implementing stricter controls and monitoring
procedures. I also checked our central database of corporate customers to understand
if Rugeley was an outlet conducting corporate transactions, I found this not to be the

case. I also checked to see if RPX Recycled Plastics Ltd had any contractual
relationship with the Post Office to conduct corporate transactions, this was also not the

case.

When I was more aware of the scale of the income loss at Rugeley and the potential
impact for Post Office Ltd, I! needed to obtain accurate figures for each of the
transactions which had taken place at Rugeley so I could ascertain the loss to Post
Office Ltd and how much money I could recover from FRTS who had been paid income
that in reality had never been generated. I liaised with the investigating officer, Mr M
Patel who I understood was compiling a database of all transactions which took place
at Rugeley, I was subsequently supplied a copy of this database (MP/3). Upon receipt
of this database I conducted further analysis to understand exactly how much income
had been paid to FRTS that had not actually been generated at the time of the
transaction, through the application of an unauthorised exchange rate. On completion
of this analysis, I ascertained that £241,194.62 had been paid in income to FRTS but
had never been generated at the time the transactions had taken place. This money
has now been repaid to Post Office Ltd by FRTS after agreement between the
Managing Director of FRTS and the Chief Executive of Post Office Ltd.

I now produce a further illustration to show exactly how much money Post Office Ltd
lost as a result of the transaction that took place at Rugeley MSPO on the 23" of
December 2002, which is identified as item number HRS/2.

Rugeley Post Office carried out a transaction selling 150,000 euros to a customer on
the above date. Post Office Ltd would have paid £96,649.00 for this number of euros to
FRTS based on a whole sale buy rate of 1.5520, upon receipt of this currency Post
Office Ltd would have devalued it to the retail buy rate of the day, which on the day in
question was 1.6485, this produces a value of £90,991.00.

Continuation of statement of Hugh Richard STACEY

This example shows the currency has been devalued by £5,658.00, upon receipt and
before being sent to Rugeley Post Office. If the currency had been sold at the official
retail sell rate of 1.5117 (over 5K rate), the currency would have been sold to the
customer for £99,226.00. The office account should therefore have shown a positive
revaluation of £8,235.00. If the original devaluation is deducted from this the true
income earned by Post Office Ltd and paid to the joint venture was £8,235.00 minus
the downright of £5,658.00, which equates to £2,577.00. From a inspection of the
Forde Moneychanger till role and recorded on the database forwarded to myself, the
actual exchange rate applied on that date when selling the currency to the customer
was 1.65, which meant the customer was charged £90,909.00.

Instead of showing a positive revaluation of £8,235.00, the transaction would actually
have generated a loss of £82.00 as it was sold at a worse rate of exchange than it was
actually being held at. The true loss to the Post Office as a result of this transaction
was £8,317.00. Of this sum Post Office Ltd will have recovered £2,577.00 from FRTS
as income it would have paid based on the correct exchange rate having been applied.

After I was aware of the initial scale of losses at Rugeley, I also asked a report to be
produced showing how much revaluation was being generated for each transaction so
that I could compare what should have been earnt against what was actually being
earnt , this report was essential to produce to understand if there were any other
irregularities amongst the other 646 outlets within the Post Office network offering a full
on demand service. This report produces a broad indication of the revaluation that
should be earnt The ratio between a value of a sale and the revaluation shown at an
outlet for that sale should be consistent throughout the network, although there will be
slight variations that are caused by movements in exchange rates and the amount of
stock held.

A report has been generated specifically for Rugeley from week 1 (w/e 03.04.02)
through to week 43 (w/e 22.01.03), which I now produce as item number HRS/3.

As shown on the illustration HRS/1, for a sale of £100 the revaluation shown should be
£8 irrespective of where the transaction had taken place. This is represented as a
percentage of the value. To be within acceptable boundaries the revaluation should
always be between 7% and 12%.

On inspection of the report (HRS/3), I noticed that rather than being in the accepted
boundaries of between 7 and 12 percent, the percentage revaluation recorded was
between -1% and +2%. This produces further evidence that incorrect exchange rates
were consistently applied at Rugeley MSPO causing significant losses to Post Office
Ltd.

! also noticed from this report that in week 43 (w/e 22.01.03) that a revaluation ratio has
been recorded of 10% that falls within acceptable boundaries, I have subsequently
been informed that week 43 corresponded to a new Subpostmasters being in place at
Rugeley MSPO.

There are four ways in which the public can obtain foreign currency from Post Office
Ltd, they can either place an order at an outlet which provides a Bureau de Change
service and then collect their ordered currency in 2 to 4 day time or they can go to one
of the ‘On Demand’ Bureau de change outlets which have a stock of currency on hand
and are therefore able to conduct transactions on the spot. Alternatively currency can be

obtained via the internet or telesales at all branches.

The following procedures, which I have been asked to describe, are in relation to ‘On

Demand’ outlets only.

Bureau de Change on demand service is available in selected Post Office branches. It is
provided by Post Office Ltd in a joint partnership with First Rate Travel Services. The
branches keep a stock of foreign currency and travellers’ cheques, which they can sell to
customers on demand commission free excluding Sterling travellers cheques. We also
offer a purchase service, which makes it possible for customers to exchange their
foreign currency for the sterling equivalent commission free. With the buy back of
Sterling travellers cheques unless the customer has a Post Office receipt to prove

purchase, commission will be charged.

Bureau de Change on demand branches are supplied with an electronic rateboard, a
Forde Moneychanger and a streamline terminal for accepting debit/credit card

payments.

Each Bureau de Change on demand outlet will have an electronic rateboard, which

shows both the Buy and Sell rates for selected currency and travellers’ Cheques. The
rateboard is connected to the Forde Moneychanger by a data cable and the rates shown
are automatically updated with daily exchange rates when they are entered into the
Forde Moneychanger. The electronic rateboard should be displayed in a prominent
position and should not be switched off at any time, unless advised by the First Rate

Travel services.

The Forde Moneychanger is a foreign exchange calculator that performs a variety of

functions:

It calculates the value of Foreign currency in Sterling

When rates of exchange are entered, the electronic rateboard is updated automatically
It prints a customer receipt

It keeps a running check on stock levels

It provides information for full daily and weekly accounting.

A two-part tally roll is used in the Forde Moneychanger and records transactions, the
top copy forming the customers receipt, whilst the under copy remains attached to the

roll and is kept at the outlet as their records.

The Streamline terminal is provided by Streamline. The terminal will seek
authorisation for debit and credit card transactions and send the transaction details to
the processing centre without the need to despatch paperwork, unless an manual

fallback procedure is followed if the terminal does not work.

First Rate Travel Services supply the currency sold at the Post Office outlets, which is
transported to and stored at the Post Office’s National Secure Stock Centre (NSSC) in
Hemel Hempstead. Orders from the Post Office outlets are placed to the NSSC who
then despatch the order, which is sent by Royal Mail Priority Services. Ina similar way

currency which is surplus to requirements at an outlet can be returned to the NSSC.

Each on demand outlet will be advised by fax, originating from First Rate Travel
Services, of the exchange rates applicable each day, Saturday rates are advised on
Friday afternoon. The exchange rate is determined by First Rate Travel Services and as
a Joint Partner, Post Office Ltd are contractually obliged to adhere to the published

rates.

Upon receipt of the fax the rates should be entered into the Forde Moneychanger before
the outlet opens for business, if the rates are not received by 9am each day or Saturdays
rates by 4pm Friday the branches are required to contact NSSC, the rates should be
entered as soon as the information is received. Rates for Saturday, which will be
received on Friday afternoon, should not be entered into the Forde Moneychanger until

Saturday morning.

It should be noted that the rate sheet (Fax) shows exchange rates for transactions up to
the value of £5,000. A special rate is available to customers who wish to purchase or sell
currency with a sterling equivalent value of £5,000 or more. This is obtained by
contacting First Rate Travel Services on the telephone number provided on the fax. As
the rates applicable to Saturday transactions is sent to the outlets on Friday afternoon,
this special rate of transactions of £5,000 or more in with regards to Euros and US
dollars is published but at all other times First Rate Travel Services must be contacted to

determine the rate to be used for such transactions.

The method of inputting the new exchange rates into the Forde moneychanger are fully
described in the Operations Manual at pages 9 to 11 of subsection 5, item number
RK/O1.

For those Post Office which offer an on demand Bureau de change service, a separate
till to the usual counter tills must be used for all Bureau de change transactions to

ensure the daily and weekly balances are correct.

On demand outlets should generally limit the stock of foreign currency held in the
branch to approximately two weeks worth of sales, though there may be occasions,
however, when there is a need to keep a level of currency in excess of two weeks
supply, for example, when it is known that a customer is going to place a large order, or

a promotional event may create an artificial demand.

To place an order the outlet is required to complete a Foreign Currency Order form
P5056, I produce a blank version of this form as item number RK/02. The form should
then be sent via fax to the NSSC, although telephone orders are now accepted. If for
some reason an urgent order is required then the form P5056 should be sent via fax to a
special emergency order number or the outlet can ring the Helpline service where their
order will be taken over the telephone. All orders should be placed to the NSSC before

2pm so that next day delivery can be ensured.

Upon receipt of the currency from the NSSC, Hemel Hempstead, the currency should
be carefully checked against the enclosed advice note, the advice note details the ‘buy
note’ rates of the day when the order was placed and the sterling value of the

remittance (REM).

All Post office outlets use a computerised system known as HORIZON to conduct
transactions and perform the office accounting. In simple terms the system is fed
information on the amount of cash and stock held in the office at the beginning of the
week and is used throughout the week to conduct numerous transactions which entail
giving out stock or cash and the receipt of cash or ‘vouchers’ all of which are fed into
Horizon which keeps a running tally of what is ‘coming in’ and what is ‘given out’
throughout the week. At the end of the week the Horizon system will be able to tell the
user what has been sold that week and what should be on hand in the office in terms of
cash and stock. This forms the basis of the weekly verification of cash and stock on
hand carried out by all Post Office outlets commonly referred to as the weekly office

‘Balance’

Post Office outlets operate in cash account weeks, the week commences on Thursday
morning and finishes at the close of Business on the following Wednesday at which

time the office balance is performed by the staff.

Having received and checked the foreign currency received from the NSSC, the total
sterling equivalent indicated on the advice note at the ‘buy note’ rate should be entered
into the HORIZON computer system. This effectively informs the system that you have

just taken receipt of X amount of foreign currency and you have ‘booked’ it in.

Once that has been done, the individual currency types must be transferred into the
Forde Moneychanger. Again using the advice note, each currency type is transferred
into the Forde Moneychanger by entering the type of currency, the foreign face value
and the ‘buy notes’ rate as shown on the advice note and then pressing ‘Enter’ at which
time the equivalent Sterling value will be displayed and the Moneychanger will ask if
you are sure and wish to proceed. The Sterling equivalent displayed on the
moneychanger should be the same as the Sterling equivalent shown on the advice note,
if they are different then an error has occurred and the process should be started again
from the beginning. If it is correct then the next currency type can be entered into the
Moneychanger until all have been input when the Moneychanger will print out the
grand total in Sterling of the currency received, this should again match the figure
shown on the advice note and that which was entered into the HORIZON system. The
Moneychanger printout should then be attached to the Remittances In Slip and the

advice note and kept in the branch for one (1) year.

The full procedure of receiving and transferring currency onto HORIZON and the
Forde Moneychanger is described on pages 17 to 20, subsection 6 of the Operations

Manual.

During the course of the week various sales and ‘buy backs’ are performed at the Post
Office outlet, each being recorded by the Forde Moneychanger. Having initially ‘fed’
the moneychanger with the value of the currency we started with (including a
breakdown of different currency types) and then entering details of transactions as they
are performed, the Moneychanger keeps a running tally of what has been sold, what

has been bought and therefore what you should have left in the Bureau till.

The Bureau de Change is subject to Daily and weekly accounting which requires
interrogation of the Forde Moneychanger and the despatch of documentation and also

the input of figures into the HORIZON system.

Daily accounting must be performed at the close of business each day in order to check
that all of the transactions have been entered correctly on the Moneychanger and that

you have the correct amounts of foreign currency left in stock. In order to do this you

cheques.

At the end of a cash account week, which for the Post Office is at the close of business
on a Wednesday, a weekly account of the Bureau de Change till must be performed

together with the despatch of various related documentation.

In order to carry out the weekly accounting, firstly the daily Command 3 printout
should be obtained and the daily balance performed as mentioned earlier. When the
daily balance has been completed, a Command 10 printout is required from the
Moneychanger, which just entails pressing the buttons, Command and then 10, on the

Moneychanger. The Moneychanger will print the Command 10 ‘weekly report’.

the revaluation figure is the profit or loss made by the buying and selling of currencies

at different exchange rates and the fluctuations of the exchange rates during that week.

The report goes onto show a breakdown of actual currencies held which again should
agree with what is physically in the Bureau till. Towards the bottom of the Command
10 print out are some Sub Totals, which show figures against ‘BN’ (bought notes) and
‘SN’ (sell notes). These figures show the total number of transactions and the total

value in Sterling of currency bought and sold during that Cash Account week.

Certain information from this Command 10 printout must be transferred onto other
accounting documentation and sent to the relevant section within the Post Office or

figures input into the Horizon system or indeed both.

There is a Post Office accounting form called a Bureau de Change Commission and
Revaluation Summary, form P4833, which must be completed weekly and despatched
to the accounting section in Chesterfield. This form requires the completion of two
totals as well as office details etc. The two totals are those shown for the Revaluation
(REVALUE) figure and the Commission (COMM) figure on the Command 10 summary.
Both figures should be entered onto form P4833 in their relevant boxes making sure that
the Revaluation figure is entered into the correct box, either Negative or Positive, this
again is indicated on the Command 10 printout. Once complete this form together with

the Command 10 printout should be forwarded to Chesterfield.

issue of the updated Operations Manual RK/01, the outlets would have been informed

to destroy the old manuals.

The basics of the two Operations Manuals are the same, the main similarities and

differences are listed below:-

e The original version (RK/01A) was written before the Post Office installed it’s
computerised accounting system know as HORIZON, Horizon began to be
installed in Post Office outlets during 1999. Prior to this system Post Office
outlets used a computer system know as ECCO + or Capture and prior to these
two systems a manual Cash Book and therefore version 2 (RK/01) was written

with the Horizon system in mind.

e With the original version (RK/01A), the equipment used for the Bureau
transactions was the same except that originally there was no streamline
terminal, which is used to authorise debit and credit card transactions. Originally
only credit cards payments were accepted and these were manually transacted
using the old fashioned method of making an imprint of the credit card. With
the newer version (RK/01), both credit and debit cards could be used with the

streamline equipment.

e The method of receiving a fax from First Rate Travel Services (FRTS) every day
and inputting of the rates into the Forde Moneychanger remains virtually the

same.

Iam employed by Cash Handling and Distribution (CHaD), a part of the Royal Mail
Group, as the Foreign Currency Manager and have been so employed for
approximately 3 years, though I have been employed with the Post Office for 23 years.
Iam based at the Cash Handling & Distribution centre located in Hemel Hempstead,
HP2 4SF, this particular centre deals with the storage and distribution of ‘stock’ and
foreign currency to Post Office Ltd. outlets nationally. The word ‘stock’ encompasses a
wide variety of items such as postage stamps, phone cards, postal orders etc which are

sold throughout the Post Office outlets.

Post Office Ltd. have a partnership with a company called First Rate which is a part of
the Bank of Ireland to supply Foreign currency to be sold through Post Office outlets.
My role at the centre is the inventory manager for foreign currency which entails the
requisition of foreign currency from First Rate to ensure it meets the demands of the
Post Office outlets. The foreign currency is collected by secure means via the Cash in
transit (CIT) Network of CHaD from Shepperton, London and brought to the centre
here in Hemel Hempstead for storage and distribution. I try and maintain no more

than two (2} working days worth of funds on site though this may fluctuate with

seasonal variations. During the busy holiday season I may well be ordering between 6
to 6.5 million pounds worth of foreign currency on a daily basis, this will drop to about

2 to 2.5 million during the winter period.

Part of the Foreign currency which we deal in, is the Euro and in fact accounts for about

80 % of all the currency traffic.

To place an order with First Rate, I assess the foreign currency requirements taking into
account orders placed by Post Offices throughout the country and fax an order through
directly to First Rate who have it ready for collection by CIT the following evening. The
foreign currency is then transported to this centre where it is secured in a vault

overnight and ‘booked’ in the following morning.

First Rate determine the exchange rates for both buying and selling of foreign currency.
When I place an order from the cash centre to replenish my stock, I am sold currency by
First Rate at a wholesale exchange rate. This is the exchange rate I will use to book in
the various types of Foreign currency, this therefore will provide me with a sterling
value for that currency. The amount in volume, the wholesale exchange rate and the
sterling value of each currency is listed on the advice notice I receive with the delivery
from First Rate and this is then verified and the figures entered onto a computerised

database.

For a Post Office outlet to order foreign currency from this centre, there are three
methods they can use, however, all three require the completion of a form P5056 known
as a requisition form, I now produce a blank version of this form for reference as item

number LGH/01 . The first method requires the completion of the P5056 form by the

Post Office outlet requesting the order, which is then forwarded to the centre by post.
The second method is for the form to be faxed to the centre using the fax number
provided on the form and the final method is for the Post Office outlet to contact this
centre via telephone (help line) and place a telephone order, the staff member taking
such a call would complete the P5056 form whilst speaking to the outlet. In general, the

most common practice, which is used for placing these orders, is via fax.

Upon receipt of the completed P5056 form a staff member enters the details into a
computer which is then used by the warehouse section to make up the specific order
and then placed in to plastic pouches and sealed. At the same time the computer
generates a foreign currency advice note which lists the various types of currency which
has been ordered, it will show the amount in volume of each currency, the exchange
rate which they have ordered the currency from us, the sterling equivalent and a break
down of the various denominations for each currency type and this advice note is
placed within the pouch, I now produce a sample of this form showing an order which

is being prepared for an office today as item number LGH/02.

The plastic pouches are sent to the offices using Royal Mail’s priority services facility
which guarantees a next day delivery and each pouch is insured up to the value of
£2,500 sterling, hence no more than £ 2,500 worth of foreign currency is placed into
each pouch. If an office orders thousands of pounds worth or currency, then they will

receive several pouches for that one order.

The exchange rate used for the preparation of the order is again one that has been
supplied to us by First Rate. Ona daily basis at around about 0800 hours each morning,

transactions receive a fax from First Rate which provides the buy and sell rates of the

various foreign currencies for that day.

Although initially the currency received from First Rate is entered onto the computer at
the wholesale exchange rate, this currency is then re-valued using the ‘buy’ currency
rate figure as specified on the daily fax from First Rate, this figure would always be
higher than the wholesale rate. When the currency is despatched (transferred) to the
Post Office outlet, which may not be for a day or two after having received the currency
from First Rate, the advice note will indicate the ‘buy’ currency rate for that particular
day as indicated on the daily fax. Upon receipt by the Post Office outlet, the currency
should be ‘booked’ in and held at the buy rate as indicated on the accompanying advice

note.

In order to ‘book in’ the currency at the Post Office outlet, the amount in volume and
exchange rate given on the advice note is required to be physically input into the Forde
Money Changer equipment that each outlet uses for Bureau de Change transactions,
this has to be done for each currency type received in the delivery and the figures
including the sterling equivalent should match the advice note. The advice note is then

just retained by the outlet for their records.

The Post Office would then sell (to the customer) the currency at the exchange rate
given on the fax that day, if the transaction took place on the same day as delivery, or
use the exchange rate supplied by First Rate according to the day the transaction took

place.

To demonstrate what I have said above, I have shown an example below: -

I buy 1600 Euros from First Rate on Monday at a wholesale rate given to me by First

Rate as 1.6.

I book this into our computerised system as 1600 Euros at 1.6 giving a sterling

equivalent of £1000.

The daily Fax from First Rate for Monday indicates a ‘buy’ rate for Euros of 1.7,
therefore I now re-value those Euros using the exchange rate of 1.7 which in this case

means my 1600 Euros are now worth approximately £940.00.

The 1600 Euros are then despatched to a Post Office outlet with an advice note
indicating that the 1600 Euros should be booked in at a rate of 1.7 giving a sterling
equivalent of £940.00.

The sell Euro rate for that day as indicated on the First Rate fax shows 1.5, therefore if
the Post Office outlet sold the 1600 Euros that day they would sell to the customer at a
rate of 1.5 which would mean that the Post Office would receive from the customer

approximately £ 1,060.00.

Therefore overall the Post Office (Cash centre) paid First Rate £1000 for those Euros and
the Post Office outlet sold them and received £ 1,060 for them, leaving the Post Office

with a profit of £ 60 on that one transaction.

real limit to the amount of currency an outlet can request from this centre, however, an
exceptionally large order which had been placed via the telephone (help line) would
normally be referred to me and I would raise it with Mr R Kalsi who would make

contact with the money laundering section of Post Office Ltd. and seek advice.

If the order is received via fax, the onus for reporting exceptionally large orders is left to

the input clerk and therefore it is not always upwardly reported.

During the early part of December 2002, I cannot now recall specifically the day
concerned, I was performing an exercise to establish the Post Office outlets which
ordered Jarge volumes of foreign currency with a view to setting up deliveries via the
CIT network as opposed to being sent via Royal Mail priority services. These offices
normally order for corporate customers and are therefore generally known or have high
sales, however, when I looked at some of the figures, a Post Office in Rugeley bearing
the FAD code 264242 (a unique six digit number allocated to each Post Office) showed
very large volumes of Bureau de Change currency transferred to it, I was not aware that
this office had any corporate customers, so I decided to contact the Manager at the

office.

Initially when I got through to the office, I spoke to a female person whose name I
cannot recollect and asked to speak to the Manager but was informed that he was out at
lunch and therefore I left my details with her with the instruction for him to call me
back. Later that same day, a gentleman who introduced himself as Mr Carl Page,
Manager of Rugeley Post Office did call me back. I then asked Mr Page that I had
noticed a large amount of currency being sent to the office and asked him if it was a

mistake on his part or on our part, to which Mr Page stated that it was not a mistake as

he was ordering it for a corporate customer. I asked who the corporate customer was to
which Mr Page stated it’s not an official corporate customer set up by the Post Office
but one he had set up locally. Mr Page, without any prompt from me, then went onto
say, not to worry as he was following money laundering regulations. Mr Page then
stated that he would contact me again soon as he wanted to discuss getting one
standard weekly delivery via the CIT network rather than the 30 - 40 pouches he
currently received daily. We then ended the conversation, however, I still felt
somewhat uneasy about this situation and after a day or two I raised this with the
National Secure Stock Centre (NSSC) manager and then ultimately with the money
laundering section of Post Office Ltd. When I was speaking to Mr Page in December
2002, I did scribble some notes on a piece of paper which I have retained, I now produce
this as item number LGH/03. There is some additional writing on this piece of paper,
towards the bottom left hand side which were notes I made ona subsequent date whilst

speaking to one of the investigators.

Subsequently in early January 2003, my section received a request from Mr M Patel of
the Investigation section to supply him with details of all the Euros despatched to
Rugeley MSPO over the last year. This information was subsequently obtained from
our computerised records and a schedule was printed off and forwarded to Mr Patel. I
now produce this schedule as item number LGH/04, the schedule commences on
Wednesday 16' January 2002 and concludes on Monday 13 January 2003, during this
time Rugeley Post office had delivered to it 15,752,005 Euros which equate to a sterling

Further to my statement of 11" March 2003, I wish to make the following amendment.

I produced a schedule identified as item number LGH/04 that I stated showed the
amount in volume and value of Euros despatched to Rugeley Post Office. The last
column which indicates the volume of Euros is correct, however, the column headed
Sterling which shows the sterling value, relates to the sterling value of the entire order
despatched that day, which may on occasions have included other currencies, though

the majority of this value would be attributable to the Euros.

Therefore when I have stated that from 16" January 2002 to 13 January 2003,
15,752,005 Euros equating to a sterling value of £ 9,557,993.49 was delivered to Rugeley
MSPO, the volume of Euros is correct, however this does not equate to £9,557.993.49 in
Sterling as this figure includes all the other currency, which would have also been

despatched to the office.

Also the date shown on the schedule is the expected date of delivery and may not

match exactly with when the delivery was actually affected.

Further to my statement of 30 September 2003, I received a request from Mr M Patel of
the Post Office Investigation section to extract from our archived records, all of the
wholesale exchange rates in relation to Euros purchased from First Rate Travel Services

throughout the period from 1st March 2002 to 31% January 2003.

The wholesale rates were extracted from our weekly cash accounts through copy and

paste.

Having extracted the relevant wholesale exchange rates, I input them onto a computer
spreadsheet in Post Office week number order, starting at week 50 (week ending
06.03.02) through to week 44 (w/e 29.01.03) of the next financial year. I now produce
this schedule as item number LGH/05.

The missing values are due to the following bank holiday’s:
1. Easter w/e 03.04.02

2. May Day w/e 08.05.02

3. Queens Golden Jubilee w/e 05.06.02

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of Three (3) pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and
belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have
wilfully stated in it anything, which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 24"  dayof September 2003

Signature M Bushell

I am employed as an Investigation Manager for Post Office Ltd (POL) and have been
so employed for approximately 6 years, though I have been employed by the Post
Office for approximately 17 years. I am responsible for the detection and investigation
of criminal activity committed by employees against the Post Office.

As a result of information I received from my colleague, Mr M Patel, I attended the
Headquarters of Staffordshire Police during the late afternoon of Monday 13" January
2003 at which time I liaised with Police officers from the Major Crime Unit (MCU).
Subsequently, later that evening together with Mr Patel and several officers from the
MCU I attended Rugeley Post Office.

The visit to Rugeley Post Office that evening was for the Police to carry out a search of
the premises as a result of two persons who had been arrested earlier that morning
suspected of having stolen money from the Post Office. As the office was closed upon
our arrival, arrangements had been made by the Police to meet with one of the staff
members and shortly after our arrival outside the Post office we were met by a lady who
I now know to be Mrs Margaret Pearce who unlocked the Post Office and allowed all
concerned in. At this time the location of the Sub Postmaster, Mr Carl Page was
unknown and the Police were making attempts to try and locate him

Continuation of statement of Mandy BUSHELL

Subsequently the Police officers conducted a search of the office and were guided by
Mr Patel and myself as to what documentation should be seized. As this investigation
centred on the Bureau de Change product, our attention was focused on
documentation relating to these transactions.

Margaret Pearce was asked to open the main office safe and the two sub safes, one of
the sub safes held the separate Bureau Till and this was taken out of the safe insert by
Margaret. I can confirm that within this Bureau till, there were five (5) HSBC cheques
and a brief examination of these cheques at the time indicated that they were all drawn
under the account of a company called RPX Recycled Plastics Ltd and were for very
large sums of money, all five cheques were seized by the Police and are identified as
item number NJW/5. Further documentation including a large number of Forde
Moneychanger till roles were also seized by the Police. The search of the premises
concluded at 2130 hours and the safes were secured and time locked until 08:00 hours
the following morning. All concerned then left the Post Office, which was secured by
Margaret Pearce.

During the course of the search, I was made aware by the Police that they had made
contact with Mr Page.

On the morning of Tuesday 14" January 2003, I again attended Rugeley Post Office
shortly after 08:00 hours together with Mr M Patel and four (4) members of the Post
Office Audit team. Upon our arrival at the Office it was closed and shortly afterwards,
Margaret Pearce arrived and opened up the office and allowed us access to the secure
area. The office remained shut to the public that day whilst the audit team conducted a
full audit of the office and I was present throughout. I also took statements from Mr
Mark Irvin (Retai! Line Manager) and Margaret Pearce at the time. At the conclusion of

the audit I was made aware that there was an overall shortage of £ 645,345.18 mainly
due to the five cheques taken away by the Police the previous evening which had not
been included as part of the audit. The total value of the five cheques was
£638,675.65.

Later that day I attended Stafford Police station with Mr Patel at which time we met up
with Dc Andrews and Dc Deans of the MCU. I remained at the Police station whilst Mr
Patel and Dc Andrews interviewed Mr Page, after which I left.

On Wednesday 15" January 2003, after having spoken with Mr Patel, I contacted Mr
Mark Irvin and asked him to attend Staffordshire Police Headquarters and collect the
documentation that had been seized by the Police from Rugeley Post Office on the
evening of Monday 13°" January 2003, including the five HSBC cheques. I informed Mr
Irvin that I wanted him to secure the documentation and take one of the cheques, the
one with the value of £ 278,181.82 to the bank that day and pay it into the Post Office's
account and to get it express cleared.
