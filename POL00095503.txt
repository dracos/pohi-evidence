‘Have Your Say results. . addition, we are looking to bring: forward
some communications. about the future of the
site. We are providing ongoing support fo
the Managers during the difficult period.

Action 5. Social Network Payment: The DTI have now announced the financing arrangements in support of the rural network through to 2008.
The position thereafter will be determined prior to March 2006 in negotiation with the DTI. We expect that the DTI will seek to shift future
funding responsibilities to regional/devolved bodies. With this shift in mind, we have already engaged with DEFRA and planning to meet with
the DTI shortly (initial meeting 23rd September). Our aim will be to influence their approach - as well as developing a flexible framework for
rural service delivery that will be capable of meeting the challenge more dispersed funding mechanisms after 2008, without adversely impacting
the Business. Progress will be reported back to the Board through the standard update mechanisms.
