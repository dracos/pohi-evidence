Pete,

In preparation for this morning’s call, attached is a paper we had previously prepared with James Davidson in relation
to Remote Access. It never got finalised or shared with Second Sight. It may be that this forms the basis for the answer
we provide to Second Sight. But let’s discuss on the call.
