                    WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANNE CHAMBERS




 I, ANNE CHAMBERS of Fujitsu Services, Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire, RG12
8SN WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:


i.   I am a System Specialist employed by Fujitsu.          I have worked for Fujitsu
     (previously ICL) since 1978. 1 have a working knowledge of the computer system
     known as Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office
     Limited (the Post Office).    For the past 6 years I have been responsible for
     investigation of problems which are, or are suspected to be, caused by software
     or hardware errors anywhere in the Horizon system. I am authorised by Fujitsu
     Services to view extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
     obtain system transaction information from the live Horizon system.


2.   I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
     otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
     page numbers of Exhibit "AC1" to this Witness Statement.


3.   Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to
     the business of Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course
     of business from information supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be
     supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in the information




                                          1
                                                                                                 LCAS0000112
                                                                                               LCAS0000112




         supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
         traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records and I have refreshed
         my memory from them.


     System Support Centre


 4.     Calls from Post Masters relating to potential system problems are initially taken
        and logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). Business issues, which
        include problems with discrepancies when balancing the branch accounts, are
        expected to be handled in the first instance by the National Business Support
        Centre (NBSC), run by the Post Office. If these helpdesks are unable to resolve
        the problem, calls may be passed to the System Support Centre (SSC), the unit in
        which I work. I have access to much more detailed system information than do
        the other units.


 SSC investigation



 5.     My initial involvement with the investigation was on 26 February 2004, when call
        reference e-0402251077 was assigned to the SSC (pa'           4Jand 15). The call
        cross referred several other closed calls being numbers e 0401280325, e-
        0401290358,e -b402130297, e-040225045 ,,' e {bf402~250 5 (pages 1 to 11) and
        so I read those too, to get a better idea of the problems being reported by the
        Marine Drive branch.



6.     I refer to the call log of 25 February 2004, 4.56pm, call reference e-0402251011
                    I
       (pages 12 and 13). This states "Critical event seen @13..00.36 18/02/04 on
       H21333700101'°. This particular call was raised several days after the event
       occurred, by a member of the team responsible for monitoring system events. I
       do not know why they raised this call so long after the event. The Known Error
       Log entry quoted did not match the specific symptoms of this instance. Upon
       checking further, I found that hundreds of branches had had the same event at
       the same time. The cause had already beenl investigateed by another member of
                                                           hi
       the SSC on 18 February 2004 (call reference e-0402186§03 at pages 5 and 6)
       and was benign. The event would not have been seen by users at the branches,
       and in no way affected the branch accounts.



7.     On 26 February 2004, 1 also checked for any central reconciliation report entries
       for the branch for the previous 2 weeks which might indicate a system problem.
       Various built in checks occur at the end of each day. For example, the gateway
       terminal (i.e. the particular computer at the branch through which data is



                                                                                                      331
                                              2
                                                                                                 LCAS00001 12
                                                                                               LCAS0000112




        uploaded to the central data centre) will total all the transactions completed on
        both terminals during the day. The total is transmitted to the central data centre
       and compared with the total transactions received at the data centre from the
       branch, to ensure that all transactions recorded at the branch have reached the
       data centre.        If the gateway terminal is not in communication with the second
       terminal, the totals are not calculated until communications are restored.



 8.    Further checks are made when the sub-postmaster has produced the weekly cash
       account at the end of the financial week - normally Wednesday.              The cash
       account lines are produced by processing the entire week's transactions as
       recorded at the branch, the paper copies of the cash account are printed, and the
       electronic           is sent to the data centre.   Each day, the gateway terminal has
                    copy




       added up the day's transactions according to where they should appear in the
       cash account, and summarises them at the end of the week. The data centre also
       produces a weekly cash account based on all the transactions received from the
       branch during the week.          There are therefore effectively three weekly cash
       accounts:



      a)    The official branch weekly cash account;

       b)   The branch daily account, summarised at the end of the week; and

      c)    The data centre weekly cash account.



      Any differences between any of these will result in one or more reconciliation
      report entries. Report entries are only produced if there are differences.



9.    I found no reconciliation report entries relating to this branch, indicating that all
      transactions recorded at the branch had reached the data centre and had been
      included in the official branch cash account.         My checks covered at least two
      weeks prior to the investigation, i.e. weeks 47 and 48.



10. I examined the branch messagestore as at 26 February 2004. This contained,
      among other things, all the transactions completed in the previous 34 days, and
      any cash, stamp and stock declarations or adjustments made at the branch.            I
      looked primarily at one of the latest financial weeks - I cannot remember now
      whether I checked week 47 or 48.




                                                                                                     332

                                                                                                                 LCAS0000112




  11. Cheques were handled correctly as far a, the system was concerned. 1 checked
              the remittance out of the cheques, which is normally done several times a week,
              as the sub-postmaster had reported a problem with this on 10 February (call
              reference e-0402130267) (pages 3 and 4). 1 found that on that one day, the
              cheque listing report was not cut off after the day's cheques had been remmed
              out. "Cut off" involves pressing a button on the system to confirm that you have
              completed processing of the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will
              include only transactions done after the cut-off point. Since the report was not
              cut off, when next printed, it still included the cheques that had already been
              despatched.                  I confirmed that the total value of cheques remmed out of the
          system equalled the values of cheques received, and so the failure in process did
              not cause any financial discrepancy.



 12. Following up                           further point from call reference e-0402130267, I noticed that
                                       a




       occasionally, when the branch declared the cash held in the office at the end of
     the working day in their overnight cash holding (ONCH) declaration, they did not
     always use the same declaration identification number.                             For example if a sub-
      postmaster uses number 01 and enters £10,000 and then changes their number
     and uses 11 to record it elsewhere, the system will think that, at that point, the
                     has £20,000 whereas it only has £10,000. If they printed the optional
     branch




     cash flow report at the end of the week, it would show the sum of the differently
     identified ONCH declarations day by day. I checked to make sure that, when they
     declared the cash as part of the balancing process at the end of the financial
     week, they used a single declaration identification number. This was the case.



13. I went through the cash elements of transactions contained                                      the branch
                                                                                               in




     messagestore day by day and                              compared them with the overnight cash
     declarations (ignoring any duplicated declarations as described in paragraph 12
    above). I expected to find that the cash holding declared by the sub-postmaster
    at the end of                           day was reasonably close        what he had declared the previous
                                       a




                                                                       to




    day, adjusted by the value of the cash transactions recorded on the system during
    the day.                                      if at the end of day 1 he was holding £50,000 cash, and
                      For




                            example,




    during day 2 recorded transactions showing                              £6,000 cash received and £5,000
    cash paid out, the net cash for the day would be £1,000 received, and so the cash
    holding at the end of day 2 should be £51,000. The main reason for making this
    check was to see if I could narrow down the source of the discrepancy to a
    particular day.



14. I was surprised to discover that at the end of each day, the cash the branch
    declared as being in the drawer was tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds




                                                                                                                     333
                                                               4
                                                                                                                LCAS00001 12
                                                                                                              LCAS00001 12




      astray (sometimes higher, sometimes lower) from what they h( cl recorded on or
      had been recorded by the system.                        Iles meant that it was possible that the sub-
     postmaster was not accurately recording all transactions on the system at the
     time the cash was physically being put into or taken out of the till. This is not
     necessarily a problem, as long as everything is entered and declared correctly by
     the end of the financial week. However, it does suggest that they are not working
     accurately and it meant I could not link the weekly loss to any particular day.



 15. I saw that on 25 February 2004, call reference e-0402250454 (pages 8 and 9) the
     clerk reported that their balancing problem seemed to be related to stock being
     "remmed in" (i.e. entered on the Horizon system) through the week. Accordingly,
     I also looked              particular to see if there could be a
                                                                caused by remming
                         in




                                                                              problem
     in, but I was unable to find anything that suggested that the remming in was
     causing the balancing problem.



Conclusion



16. My conclusion                     that there was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem.
                          was




    The continuing losses and calls suggested the Marine Drive branch needed some
    business assistance, to identify whether there were any transactions carried out at
    the branch but not appearing correctly on the branch reports, or any failure in
    process.   I therefore contacted a colleague, Julie Welsh,       Fujitsu Customer
                                                                                        in.

    the call with  summary of my investigation and returned it to HSH, requesting

    discrepancies were caused by the difference between the transactions they had
    recorded on the system and the cash they declared, and were not being caused
    by the software or hardware.



17. I had investigated and examined whether Horizon could have                      the
                                                                                              caused




    discrepancies, either for the specific reasons raised by the Marine Drive branch, or
    for various other reasons.                        I was unable to identify any basis upon which the
    Horizon system could have caused the losses.

     Richard,
     I have had a chat with Anne, she used the messag store viewiruj to
     investigate this. If you want copies of extracts 1-or the particular
    incorrect declarations please submit an ad hoc request requesting this
    information. Hope this helps, see below:
     NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT
    DATE
    AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and
    guidance given I have checked various things on the system. All the
    internal
    reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except
    for 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't
    cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer id
    11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to
    amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided.
    But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions
    on
    the system against the declarations shows that they are not working
   particularly                     at the     of the day the cash they
