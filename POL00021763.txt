Hi Rod,

Just a quick follow up to your comments below (and thanks again for these).
Can you point me in the direction of the person who would know when the Operations Manual was updated?

In addition, we have some queries outstanding in relation to the cash remittance process (section 13). Do you know who
could help with that — the queries relate to the process for cash remittances and pouches being returned (which we did
discuss very briefly).

Many thanks
Andy

Subject: RE: Second Sight Part Two - ATM and other bits of section 2

Hi Andy — comments on “Section 2” ie. The one that includes ATMs

Para 2 — there is a type of ATM that is not even mentioned here but perhaps should be mentioned as a point (d). This
would be “It should also be noted that some ATMs are pure CViT load (meaning that Post Office security van drivers load
the cassettes of money into the ATM and there is no action needed by the Subpostmaster. The report does not
distinguish whether any Applicants ATM’s are CViT load and we have not reviewed the applicant list for such
segmentation. However, for any matters to properly be deemed as themes one would expect such clarification to be
carried out.”

Para 4 line 2 — applicants (plural)

Para 9 line 2 — say “dispensed by the ATM” not “held in the ATM”

POL-0018242
POL00021763
POL00021763

Para 11 and its question — it is fair to say that it is more cumbersome in Post Office. This is because there is no
automated interface from the ATM to Horizon. I would agree that the need to key data is in more cumbersome
(perhaps not complex) but cumbersome.

Para 14 — why isn’t it automatically loaded? I believe it was a cost / benefit decision. Post Office has several pieces of
customer facing technology in branches which are not automatically interfaced to Horizon. Clearly it would be beneficial
if they were, but to date we believe the cost had been prohibitive. This is, however, anecdotal from discussions with IT
in previous years and I have no substantive costings to offer to expand on this

Para 17 — yes there has been an update. I don’t know the date but I think 2 / 3 years ago.

Para 18 —I would delete the first half of that paragraph. I believe that the premise is right but I cannot easily provide
substantive data and therefore it would seem simpler and fairer to remove that sentence. (ie. The sentence starting and
ending with “The fact that.....can be followed”

Para 21 — Delete the middle sentence. We have been some way off “a few days”

Para 25 — The recovery processes. Not this

Para 28 line 3 — known not knows

Para 38 line 3 — “if they have” not “due to them”

Section 10

Para 1—root cause. Not cause or root

Para 7 question — full transaction lists are possible showing method payment

Para 10 to add to end of first sentence “...and also that TCs are often preceded by an enquiry and so even if the TC is
beyond the 42 / 60 days then an enquiry may well have been received within the period.”

Section 12
Para 3 — last sentence doesn’t make sense. Is it missing some words?
Thanks, Rod

Hi Rod,
Comments by email would be great.

In answer to your other email — we will be making amendments at our end and I suspect we'll take a view on what the
document looks like and see whether there is any need to send it round for another review — as you say there is a risk of
continuing to circulate documents for review.

Many thanks
Andy

Hi Andy

lam reviewing all the documents you have sent again - primarily re the points we talked through regarding processes I
commented on.

I'll let you know today if any points arise from that.
I have two other observations:

1. The Introductory section - minor typos pages 3,4,5 but also short bit of extra text on page 6

a. Many branch errors (including the two examples above) are most easily identifiable in branch. They
would not be evident to Post Office Ltd unless a complaint were made by a customer - top of page 6

b. Save when it conducts and audit...physical cash is ACTUALLY in a branch, ONLY THE EXPECTED AMOUNT
PER HORIZON (item 2...)

c. And on page 3 at the very foot would it be fairer to say "remit or scope" as opposed to "professional
expertise". I don't know. I go with your judgment there.

2. Girobank section 17

a. 4.2.3 "If there was a discrepancy, the Subpostmaster could correct the Horizon records. For example if
there had been an actual deposit and a paying slip for £150 but the Giro PDR as keyed in by the
Subpostmaster said £1,500 then the Subpostmaster could reverse the £1,500 and rekey the £150 as per
the deposit slip, bringing the branch into balance.

b. 4.2.4"...sent to SANTANDER via Royal Mail. The Subpostmaster would then perform his end of day cut
off routines."

c. 5.1 Second Sight refer to one part paying in books. In fact what the customer has used subsequent to 3
part paying in books is a card and a "cash ladder" (form G7001). The cash ladder is the table of £10, £20
etc that the depositor would fill in to help their own count and to help the Subpostmaster check the
deposit. It is not retained by the Post Office. The fact of the situation is that Post Office and the
Girobank deposit process moved to the industry standard of card based deposits where there is no
paying in book. This is in no way unusual.

Thanks, Rod
