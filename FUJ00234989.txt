ee) POA Operations Incident Management Procedure “
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Post Office Account incident procedural document is solely to supplement the
incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Incident Procedure with
any Post Office Limited specific requirements or requests.

This document outlines the management guidelines to be used for Incidents impacting the live estate in
communicating with Post Office Limited.

1.2 Owner

The owner of the Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior Service
Delivery Manager.

1.3 Objective

For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card data
as defined by the POA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

The document applies to all Incidents raised by the POA MAC or by SMC (out of hours or from systems
monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to POA
MAC / SMC that should be placed with the POL Service Desk are transferred/ referred from POA MAC /
SMC to Post Office Service Desk.

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the MAC / SMC, through to the successful
resolution of the incident (or providing a workaround).

For clarity, it should be noted that the MAC team are responsible for managing/owning Incidents between
08.00 and 20.00 Monday to Friday, 08.00 to 17.00 Saturday and Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding
Christmas Day. The SMC assume this responsibility out of hours, i.e., outside these hours. The SMC are
responsible for escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager.

The key objectives of the process are:

Log, track and close all types of incident requests

Respond to all types of incident requests

Restore agreed service to the business as soon as possible

Resolve incidents within the target timescales set for each priority level within the Service Level
Agreement(s)

Resolve a high number of requests at first contact

Ensuring incident priorities are linked to business priorities

Keeping the user informed of progress

Reduced unplanned downtime

Improved Customer satisfaction

1.4 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn, this ensures the highest level of
service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

Demonstrating a professional approach to, and Post Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

1.5 Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

« During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 17:00 and
Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day.) the MAC should be the first point of
operational contact between Fujitsu and the Post Office Service Desk. Outside these hours the
SMC acts as the first point of contact.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC is handed over to the SMC
outside the MAC Core Hours.

Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

All Incidents reported by Contact with the MAC / SMC. Contact is defined as voice, e-mail, incident
transfers over the HDI interface from Post Office Service Desk or Tivoli Alert as the methods of
communication with the MAC / SMC and fall into the following categories:

o Business process error

o Hardware or software error

o Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident

o User complaint

o Network Error
Severity and SLT information.
Evidence of an Error.
System Alerts received automatically from transaction monitoring tools. Due to the urgent nature of
some of these alerts, they may be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or
resolution supplied to MAC / SMC. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step
1.2.3, and are not subject to prior steps in 1.1 & 1.2 of this process.
Splunk will monitor the Azure environment and will be used by the SMC to identify incidents from
alerts. In the Full Azure Foundation Service Splunk will automatically raise incidents in TfSNow. It
should be noted that these automatically raised incidents enter the process at step 1.2.3, and are not
subject to prior steps in 1.1 & 1.2 of this process.

Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.
Non-availability of the MAC / SMC Incident Management System. Mitigation is given in the MAC /
SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the HDI interface with the POL Service Desk. Mitigation is via e-mail.
Non-availability of the OTI links to internal & external service desk tools. Mitigation is via e-mail.
Lack of information given to the MAC / SMC regarding changes, POL Business updates, request for
changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as the
Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff to investigate and resolve issues.

4 Resources

The resources required for this process are:

« Process Owners

e Major Account Controllers team

e Service Management Team

e System Management Centre team

e Software Support Centre team

e Service Delivery Units

e TfSNow - Hosts Incident, Problem and Change databases

e Peak (third and fourth line incident database)

*  ServiceNow and the HDI interface into TfSNow.

¢  OTI links

e TIVOLI (system components and event monitoring software)
e Additional remote Management, Operational and Diagnostic tools

e Detailed Process and Procedure documentation

4.1 Roles

The main roles required by the process are:

e Incident Manager - To drive the Incident Management process, monitor its effectiveness and
make recommendations for improvement. The key objective is to ensure that service is improved
through the efficient resolution of Incidents.

e Major Account Controller - To provide a single point of contact for Post Office Service Desk,
dealing with the management of routine and non- routine Incidents, Problems and requests

e Incident Resolver - To accurately diagnose and resolve Incidents and to assess, plan, build/test
and implement Changes in accordance with the Change Management Process. This role will
typically be fulfilled by the support teams and service delivery units.

4.2 Incident Prioritisation within POA

The priority assigned to a TfSNow incident is either based on the priority documented in an existing KB or
based upon the Urgency and Impact of the incident, refer to POA Incident Enquiry Matrix.

With the exceptions of Major Business Continuity Incidents and Major incidents POA generally utilise
three priorities for incidents based upon the following guidelines.

Consideration must also be given to if the incident being reported is a Security Incident, if it is it must be
notified to, and managed under, the POA Operational Security process (See Appendix A for guidance).

Priority 1 where there is an immediate impact to any live service or potential security incident requiring
timely attention. Priority 1 incidents are voiced to a Support Delivery Unit, the POA Duty Manager and
the Post Office Service Desk.

Priority 3 where there is an incident which has caused a loss of resilience, a failure or event which needs
the timely attention of a Support Delivery Unit whose team will be voiced.

Priority 5 for other less urgent incidents.

Note1: Generally Priority 2 is used to align incidents with the customer Priority 2 incidents and Priority 4
incidents are not utilised within POA apart from CSPOA team. However, if there is a genuine business
reason to do so incidents may be allotted at these priorities when it is consistent with EMEIA processes.

Note2: When incidents are transferred to the Software Support Centre (SSC) the TfSNow incident is
transferred into a Peak incident system. Within Peak the incident priorities are defined as A, B, C and D.
Therefore, when transferring TfSNow incidents into Peak ensure the following is adhered to:

TfSNow priority 1 equates to Peak priority A
TfSNow priority 2 equates to Peak priority B
TfSNow priority 3 equates to Peak priority C
TfSNow priorities 4 and 5 equates to Peak priority D

If this cannot be achieved through automation the MAC or SMC Agent undertaking the transfer is to log a
comment on the TfSNow incident stating the TfSNow and Peak priorities.

4.3 Horizon Defect Review (HDR) Configuration Items

As a result, of the POA Improvements Incident and Problem Meetings new configuration items related to
the Horizon Defect Review have been added to TfSNow, so that Incidents and Problems related to these
types of defects can be reported against. The new configuration items that have been added are:

e HDR-EXP
e¢ HDR-FIN
e HDR-OTHER

Once these have added to incidents and problems, reports or Dashboards in TfSNow can be created in
order to aid in tracking such issues through to resolution and provide updates when requested.

Additionally, this will allow for reporting to be produced and provided to the customer with regards to
incidents or problems that have had the HDR configuration item added, thus deeming there is a
requirement to highlight them. These will be discussed in such forums as the Horizon Defect Review
Forum

3.1 Ownership
Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and
Communication

Throughout the Incident, the MAC / SMC /SCC
retains ownership for monitoring and keeping the
call raiser informed of progress, unless the
incident is specifically software related, in which
case SSC hold the responsibility for confirming
details of closure

The MAC / SMC / SCC manages the complete
end-to-end Incident process. Activities include:

Regularly monitoring the status and progress
towards resolution of all open Incidents
Monitoring SLT and escalates accordingly.
MAC will alert the POA SDM to the existence of
a pattern likely to produce a Problem.

SMC produce TfSNow Knowledge Articles from
information supplied from SSC KEL

3.2 Alerting

Post Office Account have an account specific
process for alerting. The MAC team achieve
incident monitoring and alerting by constant
monitoring of the incident stacks and conduct
checks during core hours on a 15 minute basis.

The MAC team advise the MAC and OBC
Team SDM when there is a risk of incidents
exceeding agreed SLTs.

9 Appendix A: Security Incidents

As defined in the Fujitsu Europe Security Policy Manual requirements Section 16 (Security Incident
Reporting):

A security incident is one or more events that may impact the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of Fujitsu Europe assets and information, or those of our customers.

All security Incidents (actual or perceived) within the Post Office Account (“POA”) must be raised,
investigated, and responded to.

Security Incidents are either:

e submitted on the POA SecOps Security Incident reporting form by POA team members via the
reporting button on the POA portal (recommended and preferred option);

emailed into the POA Security Operations (SecOps) mailbox by POA team members; or
e received via a TfSNow Incident being assigned to the POA SecOps assignment group.
In some cases this is supplemented by a phone call to the POA SecOps contact (see Appendix B).

POA SecOps will raise Security Incidents with POL via the POL agreed process and will report on the
status of Security Incidents as appropriate and in the monthly Information Security Management Forum
(ISMF) report and at the POL monthly ISMF meetings.

POA SecOps log Security Incidents on the POA SecOps Security Incident portal where a complete
record of the investigation and remediation actions will be held. An initial summary, and progress
updates, may be added to any active TfSNow, if required, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the
Incident.

ALL new and unique Security Incidents MUST also be reported into Fujitsu AskSecurity (Raise a Security
Incident) and the AskSecurity Incident must be kept up to date. The AskSecurity reference should be
added to any active TfSNow Incident.

Security Incidents are investigated by the POA SecOps team guided by the Fujitsu Europe Security
Policy Manual requirements Section 16 (Security Incident Reporting) and in conjunction with required
POA operational teams and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

POA SecOps use the Fujitsu Europe Business Management System — Security Incident Reporting
Process and update the POA SecOps Security Incident portal. For quick reference, the 5 steps and
activities are summarised here:

ction obesiidoaaed P Geiiviesie [i eaten

‘eee prereset

Whenever a Security Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conducting normal business,
it must be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. POA SecOps will act with the required pace
based on the specific severity of the Security Incident and will share and discuss any containment
requirements with required POA operational teams and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and POL at the
earliest opportunity.

Should it be considered necessary, the Security Incident might be passed to an external Investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved. The decision to take this action, and the required approach, would be
discussed and agreed with POL in advance.

Cyber security threats come in many forms and the types of attacks are constantly changing. The vast
majority of Security Incidents are minor. However, the severity and urgency of any threat would require
specific consideration at the time.

A minor Security Incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain.
For example:

e Accidental inclusion of sensitive information in an Incident in the service management toolset
requiring redaction; or

e Accidental inclusion of sensitive information shared in an email requiring copies to be identified
and deleted; or

e Files being sent to Fujitsu by third party suppliers that don’t conform to the Application Interface
Specification (e.g. unencrypted AMEX EPA files) resulting in GDPR\PCI data such as PAN
numbers being shared unencrypted.

Amore severe Security Incident presents a wider impact and level of concern. For example:
e An actual or attempted breach of the systems by a hacker; or
° The loss of customer data; or
e Abreach of a legal data protection obligation; or
e The identified presence of malware in the environment (e.g. ransomware).

Severe Security Incidents would be declared as a Major Incident and managed following the POA Major
Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).
