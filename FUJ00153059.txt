The case is to continue and is scheduled for trial on the 1st June 2010. I will need
to check that all witnesses are available this week.

Could you please inform me ASAP whether you, Gareth and Andy are available to attend
Guildford cc. :

In the meantime we will need Andy to produce the disc containing the raw data of
helpdesk calls for the period 1st January 2005 to 31st December
2009 and the information as detailed in my e-mail below..

If case is still continuing tomorrow we will need a witness statement from a member of
Fujitsu explaining the following

When new hardware was installed at West Byfleet Post Office was it brand new or
reconditioned (i.e. existing hardware that has been wiped prior to installation).

If it is the latter please confirm the identity of the Post Office from which the
reconditioned hardware came and why the hardware had been removed from that Post
Office.
