Hi Andy

The costs are for an expert witness, Gareth Jenkins, our contract only covers standard litigation support so although
Andy Dunks will also be required at court his costs are covered.

Need to understand costs in the first instance please. Then suggest we discuss with Jarnail as he is the legal link in to the
wider Horizon integrity.

Jane, I raised a req earlier this yr which has not been used, so they could use PO number 4500 517 017, however might
be worth touching base with Andy / Rob if this is an Horizon Integrity case, because they may want to challenge why POL
would pay for Fujitsu to justify the system.

Hi Mark

Please see below —in a nutshell Gareth is required as an expert witness and we have no money in the pot for him. I
remember this happening before and am sure that you dealt with it? Can you remember?

Good Morning Jane
Thank you for your note.

I will pass this information onto both Gareth and Andy but please be aware that in the event that Gareth is required
at Court we do not have commercial cover for his time; this we need to arrange in advance.

Kind regards

Good Morning Penny

Hope you are well. I spoke to Sharron at our conference and asked her to put her requirements into an email — please
see below. I thought she required a witness statement from Gareth but clearly this is not the case and it is his and
Andy’s attendance at court that is required.

Hi Jane
Further to our conversation the other day I hope this will help to clarify the requirements for Court. Both

Gareth Jenkins and Andy Dunks have supplied witness statements for the above named case. At this stage it is
not known if their evidence will be accepted by the Defence or whether they will be required for cross

POL-0096706
POLO00097123
POL00097123

examination so they will both need to be 'warned' for court please. The date is the 14th January 2013 and it is
listed as a 7 day trial.

T have also just been informed that the Defence have today indicated that they will be writing to the court today
to ask for a further delay to proceedings. It is unknown if this will be granted at this point as the Courts were

not happy about changing the date in the first place. I will let you know as soon as I hear anything further
regarding this.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Dear all

There appears to have been some sort of confusion regarding the trail of emails below. Gareth was asked to
supply an expert report on Horizon Integrity by the legal team and I was asked to input this onto a s.9 witness
statement in order to produce it in court. Gareth was not aware that this related to a specific case and was also
not aware that he would be required in court. I have spoken to Gareth and he is happy to attend but as explained
below it is over and above the usual BAU arrangements that we have with Fujitsu so some extra arrangement
are required in order to cover extra costs and time etc. This email is to request that please.

Sharron,

Thanks for the clarification. I had not understood that that related to a specific case, I thought that was a general
statement. If I am required to go to court for that, I think I need to have some more background on the specific case and
exactly what is being alleged. I appreciate that is not covered by my statement, but if I need to be an expert witness, I
need to understand what is happening.

However, please note that if fam required to do anything further on this, some commercial arrangements will need to
be made to cover my time and costs since I am not covered by the normal Security Service that POL pay for. Perhaps
you can sort out the details of this with Penny when she is back from leave next week. (The process takes a while so
leaving it until it is known if I am required may be too late.)

Hi Gareth

This is the one that you supplied the expert report and witness statement for the week before last. Apologies for
not explaining that properly in the previous email, it was a blanket email for all witnesses! It is unclear at this
stage who will be required as witnesses and which evidence will be accepted without the need for attendance. I
just thought if I let everyone know they can pencil it in and then I can let you all know nearer the time.

Andy

The same applies to you. It is unlikely you will be required in court but I thought I would copy you in just in
case.

Apologies for any confusion I have caused.
