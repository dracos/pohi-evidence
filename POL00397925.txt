Programme Fore-cast Comments

Overall We are currently re-planning to address certain challenges that can impact delivery. Status is amber due to pending revision and
approval of the plan. Programme Board on 14/01 has decided to re-visit the BT contract. Networks procurement is on hold until completion of this
feasibility study. A revised ToR for Programme Board has also been agreed and will take effect from February. SISD Dialogue 2 has commenced
and ramps up with full engagement by w/c 28/01. Preparations progress for Al ISOS issue. 1 outline solution (Fujitsu) received for the DC tower. HP
and CSC have withdrawn from DC procurement. The revised programme plan is being reviewed and refined to minimise time and cost impact. An
impact assessment workshop is scheduled for 24/01. A CR will be presented to Programme Board for approval on 11/02. The refresh of the
Transformation business case is underway.

Budget and
Benefits

Anticipated Final Costs (AFC) to exceed Requested Business Plan Budget by c £400k. The AFC is £14.6m vs £14.2m as requested via
Business Plan and £1.2m higher than the original PID of £13.4m. Project Leads continue to refine CRs to minimise resource and cost impact of re-
planning. The main impact on forecast (Towers) will be presented to the Programme Board on 11/02. Revised Benefits on target for completion by
31/01. However based on stakeholder responses, further workshops and iterations may be needed. Re-modelling is underway and discussions with
stakeholders are in progress. The model has been developed and is generating outputs. It is now being refined to enable further stakeholder
discussions w/c 21/01 to continue iterations to drive an accepted view. Transformation budget for business planning as well as impacts from
Transition, Separation, TUPE and Dual Running have been discussed with CPMO, SPMO and Central Finance. We have included an additional
£2.5m in the 2012-13 forecast mainly regarding Transition as we aim to seek approval for spend both sunk and unspent in February.

Projects Comments

IT Frameworks Project complete and we continue to track benefits. Frameworks live and available for use and benefits of speed to market and access to best
of breed suppliers being realised. Increasing number of projects are now using or plan to use frameworks (e.g. Counters project is planning to use

IT Products framework). We are working with the QA team to go through necessary gating and formally close this project.

IT Supplier Plan is currently being refined prior to being presented to the Programme Board for approval on 11/02. SISD — Dialogue 2 commenced and
Procurement ramps up with full engagement by w/c 28/01. Progress on 10 critical dependencies is behind plan and is impacting progress with dialogue. A CR is
being raised by MW to assess the impact. Towers — Issued 2” draft of Al ISOS for review by working group. 1 outline solution has been received
for the DC tower from Fujitsu. Evaluation and moderation is currently in progress. Discussions are taking place to determine further plan of action.
John Brannan starts on 01/02 as EUC procurement lead. Programme Board has agreed to revisiting the BT contract before deciding whether to
procure a Networks tower on 14/01. Networks procurement is on hold until completion of a feasibility study. The plan is being challenged and refined
to minimise time, resource and cost impact due to re-planning.

* These milestones have been delayed due to:

*QA and governance process delays;

*Lessons learnt from first phase of S! dialogue and DC ISOS preparations;
*Resource constraints (availability of BAU resources);

«Impact of decision to re-visit the BT contract instead of procuring a Networks tower;
«Impact of outcomes of the Fujitsu TSS work; and

«Impact of decisions on solutions for services to be separated from RMG.

** This milestone is at risk of delay as it may be impacted by re-planning work currently in progress.

Notes:

Rebased Anticipated Final Costs of the Project since initial review. Actuals until P7 included and initial
forecasts relating to scope changes that have occurred.

During December additional work will be undertaken to refine the numbers.

Figures above are based on business decisions and the forecast is subject to change.

Budget transfer of £913k from 12/13 to 13/14 requested regarding Alignment and Training.

Budget includes original base case of £13.4m + £0.8m requested for 13/14 = £14.2m

New Business Case and Change requests anticipated early 2013.

Updates as of 18/01:

+ Anticipated Final Costs (AFC) has been updated to
reflect existing assumptions and known requirements to
produce this reforecast of the programme, as well as a
prudent view on the impact of separation.

+ Figures presented do not include Transition costs. This
will be covered in a separate business case due to be
submitted in February 2013.

The total AFC is £14.6m or £1.2m higher than the
approved baseline of £13.4m:

+ This is £800k for 13/14 additional costs as below.

+ £354k 12-13 — this is a forecast overspend, however we
do expect to bring this back closer in line with Budget.

+ £69k in 11-12 overspend

2013/14 Business Plan includes all known cost
increases and a request for an additional £800k:

+ Scope changes with Towers as requirement became
more defined. £250k.

+ BAU Resource constraints on POL knowledge so
procurement now Staggered, leading to additional costs.
£250k.

+ Impact from BAU/Skillsgroup charging structure vs
original base case £300k.

+ Plan being worked up with finance to support the
Benefits case rework during December and January.

+ Continued meetings with POL finance/SPMO to ensure
alignment of all reported numbers and transparency.

+ Benefits Tracking is being discussed with SPMO and
POL Finance to align requirements and outputs and to
understand the limitations in data and assumptions.

+ Costs for G-219 IT&C Transformation Programme has a
tisk of overspend due to scope changes. We are working
within the programme to manage costs.

Please note:

+ The figures presented for IT&C Transformation do not
include the costs associated with Horizon Evolution,
Separation and Transition planning as they will become
separate business cases.

+ Figures inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.

+ These figures are updated on a fortnightly basis.
