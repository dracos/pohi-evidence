Dear Stephen,

Thank you for your recent email; we were equally disappointed to miss the planned exit deadline, however, I am
delighted that we achieved agreement to exit Red Alert on Wednesday 14th November. This achievement was down
to real team work from both our organisations and has engendered a culture of trust upon which we can build. It now
only remains for the RMG Account team to conclude a mutually acceptable commercial position with your
procurement department, which I understand is well underway.

To mark this turning point in Project Light and our relationship with RMG, lan Terblanche will be arranging a social
event where both teams can relax and deepen our relationship.

Regards,
David

On Monday of this week I was delighted to host a social gathering (beers and a curry) that was well attended by both
the Royal Mail and Fujitsu teams. It was good fun, and was certainly deserved after all the hard work that has been put
in.

In addition, and as agreed in the expectation that we were nearing the completion of Red Alert Exit, our procurement
team has now found a way forward on the oustanding commercials that is acceptable to both parties.

However, I'm disappointed to see that Fujitsu have - yet again - missed the Red Alert Exit deadline that was agreed
with you in our last Executive call.

Regards
Stephen

Dear Stephen,

Thanks for your comments. In particular I appreciate your remarks about the commitment that both sides have
continued to demonstrate, despite the difficulties we have encountered with the project. We will certainly continue the
efforts to ensure that the project can move off Red Alert status on an agreed basis at the end of the month.

If we can pass this milestone this would be appropriate point for us to conduct a ‘lessons learned’ exercise - Dave will
nominate someone suitably senior but independent from within Fujitsu to do this.

I agree with your point about drawing the line under the history - like you I hope we will be able to do this - and move
forward to a continuing strong relationship between our companies.

Regards,
David

A few thoughts following the Executive Red Alert call earlier this week.

We continue to be concerned that this project isn't delivering what it
should be, but appreciate that isn't due to a lack of commitment from both
parties. In fact, we're pleased with the progress being made to recover
this project, and ask you to now make every effort to deliver the complete
Red Alert Exit testing by the further revised target date of the end of
October (following this week's additional system delays).

In the expectation that Red Alert Exit will be achieved, we have agreed to

a meeting between lan Terblanche and Ray Vaughan to discuss the commercial
issues that have arisen through the delivery of the project. In that

meeting, we will be seeking compensation from you as we have incurred

higher costs than expected, and we will address your concerns regarding the
stopping of invoice payments.

We have also identified the need for a 6 month extension of the current MDS
service from 24/10/07, but acknowledge that both parties want to make
changes to elements of that service.

I'd now like to draw a line under the Project Light history by successfully
completing the exit criteria and resolving the commercials, and look
forward to continuing with what has been overall a very strong and
successful relationship between Royal Mail Group and Fujitsu.

Regards

Stephen
