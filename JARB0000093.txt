Thank you for this. James is content to have a word but he would prefer to meet
Paula face to face and wants other MPs to join him, namely Oliver Letwin, Andrew
Bridgen, and Mike Wood. So, a preliminary and brief word tomorrow would work
well but he does want a meeting subsequently.

Shall we say 3.30pm, Tuesday 28 November for a phone conversation for half an
hour? And what number is best to reach Paula on at that time, please?

Kind regards,
Janet

Hi Janet,

Hope you are well. I’ve just left a vm. Paula was wondering if James might be free for a call
tomorrow afternoon? We could be flexible if he has any time, but good times for us include
1-2pm and 3-4pm, or 4:45pm.

Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

James is being contacted by the media and will need to speak to them soon. He wants to
speak to Paula before he talks to them. Can you please let Paula know this as a matter of
urgency? In addition, we know that Ron from Second Sight is trying to reach her. He would
like to tell her how things are going from his perspective and James is very keen for her to
hear what he has to say.

Kind regards

Dear Janet,

Thanks for your email and vm yesterday. Paula is actually on leave this week so has not seen
the letter yet. I will ensure she sees it on her return on Monday. November is looking very
congested at present, so I will need to speak to Paula to see what we can shift in the diary to
accommodate a meeting, so can you please leave it with me and Ill give you a call once I
have spoken to Paula on Monday.

Many thanks and we'll speak next week.

Best wishes,

Last Friday James sent a letter to Paula requesting a meeting. Could you please give me a
call at the earliest possible opportunity to arrange. I must let you know that we are now
receiving calls from numerous journalists about the mediation scheme and so this meeting is
a matter of considerable urgency.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,
Janet

Dear Paula,

James has asked me to thank you for your letter of 12 June. He wonders whether
you might send him something to consider by way of a circulation to MPs by the end
of next week. He would like to be able to tell the MPs why no meeting is going to
take place, and what progress is being made.

Might your office let him have something to consider, please?

Many thanks.

Yours ever,
