Fair point Belinda — I can’t ever recall one but would defer to Andrew’s view as to whether it adds any real value.

Thanks Paul
Just a thought from me re the unfair terms regs — I would only reference these if we are absolutely certain that in doing
so it would not attract a challenge by an applicant about whether the contract is compliant.

Best wishes

Thanks Andrew,
I have considered section 4.

In para 7 (and /or 11), does it add any value to refer to unfair terms regs and state that contract terms are also governed
by these, or a similar narrative?

Re 18 I will seek an example and revert back; more recent materials in network transformation are strong on this but I
believe we'll need something that speaks to historic subpostmaster appointments.

That aside you have picked up on the key points I had made in my original review, and nothing to add — the points are

well made.

Dear all,

Further to Belinda's email please find attached the first part of the working draft of the response to the Second Sight Part 2
Report.

We have segmented the response into sections to correspond with SS's Report. The draft to sections 14 — 22 are
attached. Sections 4 — 13 will follow shortly. At this stage it is possible that POL may submit only the relevant sections of
the response to applicants according to the issues raised within their cases. In addition, we will submit a covering
note/letter highlighting our general concerns about the Report (such as the lack of evidence to support the thematic issues
and speculation on issues outside of the scope of their instructions and expertise). There are certain parts of the report
where we have asked for more detail about the processes and procedures and I would be grateful if those details could be
provided.

Please can you respond with comments on any relevant sections. If do not have any comments please just confirm it is a
nil response. We will collate the responses and circulate final draft before submission.

If it would be easier to discuss any issues please feel free to call.
Best regards
Andy

Hi all,

I think I have now spoken to most of you and very many thanks for your assistance with this. I attach, again for some of
you, a copy of the Second Sight Part Two report. We will need to get a response out on this next week and Andy
Parsons is holding the pen. Although we have a lot of the information we need, we still have some gaps and I think the
easiest way to deal with this is to have a core team of experts from the business who can fill the gaps and also clear the
final document. I hope it will not be too onerous, indeed we do not have time for it to be.

POL00021773

l also hope I’ve got every area covered but we will soon find out if not. Those of you that already provided some
information for me, I can confirm that I have passed that on to Andy.

The aim is not to produce a critique of the report but a document which would stand alone but which deals with the
themes and sets out the facts related to each one, making sure we address each point. I just wanted to join everyone
up to get us started. Andy will pick it up from here.

Best wishes and thanks again

Belinda
