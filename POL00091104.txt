Interview held 8 October 2010: -
Miss Hall was very upset during the interview. She was on her own with
no representation.

Miss Hall admitted to falsifying the accounts and stated that she feels
the loss is in the scratchcards
She wants someone to go through all the lottery slips for her.

From an email from Neil Thorneycroft, Lottery Team Leader (have a hard
copy of this in file) and he ‘says that he ‘cannot find any
errors relating to the amount in question.

National Lottery Game - 03.04.08 to date £1052.00 credit

Prize Payments - 24.04.08 to date £190.20 debit

Scratchcards - 23.06.08 to date £2,200 debit (stock credit)

Regular numbers of apparent scratchcard sales entries have been made.
However a high number of stock adjustments have also been
made. From 01.01.08 to date 115 stock adjustments @ £1760.00
credit. If stock adjustments have been made in place of sales
entries no commission is payable to the subpostmaster. ‘*

There was no evidence given that the loss in question relates to
scratchcards Miss Hall stated that when she received TCs for
scratchcards that she accepted the TC which increased the
stock level. She would then put in the right stock amounts
and inflate the cash levels to enable the branch to balance.

She said that she requested the audit herself after returning from
holiday. (log call 31/8/16)

When asked about staffing she said that she had 4, did have 5 but one
member of staff has recently
Left

Miss Hall stated that she counted the lottery scratchcards every day -
this was by the markers on the dispenser or scratchcards?.
She keeps a count of the scratchcards by doing a chart on an
A4 piece of paper.

She also stated that she does a physical count of the cash daily

She asked whether with scratchcards
e if she had not remmed them in but activated them would this cause
a problem.

e At the audit there was a £400 in stock wants a breakdown of what
this was

¢ She cuts off her scratchcards on the Weds morning when balancing
and wants to know if the problems are being caused by this

She said that she had not contacted Post Office before as she had
been trying to sort this out herself. She had been going through
the paperwork. She says that she has not taken a penny

DECISION - terminate the contract for services

Decision letter sent : - 15 October 2010

Reason for the decision

Miss Hall admitted to falsifying the accounts by increasing the cash
totals over a period of time

It would appear that Miss Hall only informed POL that there was a
problem when she knew that the HOL team would be attending the
branch. Te call to Helpline 31/8/10 HOL cash check completed
1/9/10

NB Miss Hall has requested an appeal and also that someone in
Chesterfield looks through all her paperwork. I advised her
that we would not do this. She said that she had been to
Citizens Advice and they advised that if anyone is requesting
monies they are obliged to look through the paperwork.
