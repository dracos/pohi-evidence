I just noticed that your email of 30 June had one point that was "to follow" — this was in relation to para 21 GPOC,
which is where a number of the unanswered questions are in our Defence. If we could have Fujitsu's response to para
21 before the call on Friday that would be really helpful.

Thanks
Andy

Hello Andy,

Thanks for your email, which I have reviewed and discussed with Pete and Torstein. I have also just left you
a VM on your mobile.

I assume that you have received my email of and considered my response sent at 16:57 on Friday 30 June
(copy attached)?. This should answer most if not all your queries.

If it does not (or if you have received my email) this would imply that you require further clarification in
order to answer the pleadings.

We equally are not sure that the your questions are the right ones to be asking , in order for the pleadings to
be answered (for example pleading 21.1 which really relates to when the different types of line were
available and from whom) so we suggest a phone call would be a better way to handle these latest questions
and requests for clarifications.

Both Pete, and Torstein could make Friday 7 July at 12.00 pm. Unfortunately Pete has no other time slot
available, so hopefully this would suit you?.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
Chris

Christopher

It was good to meet you the other day at Counsel's chambers.

Please find attached an extract from our draft Defence that relates to Horizon. There are a few other odd paragraphs
in the Defence on which we may need your input but this extract is the main factual section on Horizon.

I should be grateful if your team could review this extract and provide any comments they may have. In particular, if
they could flag and explain any points that they believe not to be correct that would be much appreciated.

Would it be possible to complete this review by close of business on Thursday?

Kind regards

Andy
