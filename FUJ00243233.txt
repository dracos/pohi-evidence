Simon,
I refer to our recent correspondence on the issue of ARQs.

We introduced the updated ARQ form to clarify the intended use of ARQs requested by Post Office. FSL does not accept
that the introduction of this amended form has caused delay to redress activities. Since it was introduced, the Post Office
has requested over 60 ARQs to support redress activities and these have been processed by FSL in the usual way. As you
have now clarified that the ARQs referred to in your email below are intended to be used to support postmaster redress,
I will instruct the team to process those received on the previous version of the form and they will not be subject to
additional charges.

With regards to the provision of a credit for charges the Post Office has incurred in obtaining information used to support
redress, based on the confirmations contained in your letter of 10 June 2024, I will arrange for a credit to be raised which
reverses the charges for the 10 identified CWOs.

Kind regards,
Dan

Further to my earlier emails on this topic, we are now accumulating a backlog of requests, potentially delaying
Postmaster redress.

Can you confirm that FJ will process these requests without further delay please?
Thanks

As you can see below, we again sent our ARQ requests through to Fujitsu using the older process of master tracker and
summary table. Again, Sreydy Khun returned our request this morning, refusing to complete the request without us
completing the Updated ARQ Form attached.

Could you please advise next steps from us, as we have 10 ARQ requests outstanding now, as per the table below.

Outstanding Requests HSS3065 — HSS3069 Requested 17/06

Good Afternoon,

FUJ00243233

Please find attached an updated ARQ request tracker with a brief summary of all previous and new request(s) since our
last ARQ Requests.

This is replacing the ARQ Request Form which you advised us to start completing in April, as I have been instructed to
return to our previous, more efficient method with immediate effect. The instruction I received came direct from those
within Post Office, responsible for the relationship between Post Office and Fujitsu with regard to ARQ bulk requests
submitted from the Remediation Unit.

Outstanding Requests HSS3065 — HSS3069 Requested 17/06
