Dear Mr Castleton

I too am concerned about the temporary situation at Post Office®, Marine
Drive branch.

It is regrettable that an agreement could not be reached with Mr Booth to run
the branch. However, I am aware that Mrs Day is considering continuing as
temporary subpostmaster for another few weeks.

I reiterate, Mrs Train’s application will be considered in the near future.
However, until this happens, she will not be considered to run the branch as
temporary subpostmaster.

Hopefully, Mrs Day will agree to continue. If not, there is a possibility that the
Post Office® may have to close on a temporary basis.
