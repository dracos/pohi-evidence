Jim,

We have reviewed Jason Coyne's reply to our paper and are disappointed that the he was unable or unwilling to
change any of his original opinions based on our original submission. We are also concerned about some of the
broad and general statements made in his original report, for example ‘The majority of the system issues were
screen locks, freezes, and blue screen errors which are ......... most probably due to faulty computer hardware,
software, interfaces or power. Unless he is prepared to present objective evidence to support these vague
assertions it is extremely difficult for Fujitsu to respond in anything other than a broad a general manner.

With regard to his comments under the 'Reasonableness of Calls' heading his tone infers that we have only found
this data in order to respond to his report and suggests that we deliberately withheld information. We reject this
inference.

The attached paper provides detailed feedback to his reply but in truth we can only re-iterate what has been
already said. Given that he has assumed the moral high ground, and appears not to want to shift his position, the
next step is to make available to him the people, data and resources at Post Office Account and allow him to
address his doubts to the true experts and practitioners.

In conclusion it has to be said that his analysis of the situation is at best selective and at worst simply wrong, and

his conclusions partial.

We are happy to accommodate him at any or all of our locations and arrange such interviews and access to data
that he requires, and would ask that you make ___ this offer to him.

Please feel free to pass a copy of this paper to Jason.
