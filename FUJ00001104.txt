SUMMARY and REASON FOR CHANGE:

As a consequence of the transfer of the Service Desk Service from Fujitsu to Atos, it has been agreed
that changes to the HNG-X Agreement relating to the provision of the Services will be necessary and
the terms set out in this Change Control Note (CCN) shall apply to amend the HNG-X Agreement from
the date of signature of this CCN1409a.

This CCN sets out the changes necessary to remove the references to the Service Desk Service from
the HNG-X Agreement and to detail the changes necessary to the remainder of the Services to
enable the continued provision of the remainder of the Services under the Agreement. Such changes
include the formation of the MAC (Major Account Controller) team, the scope of which is detailed in
Attachment 1 to this CCN. This CCN also details the necessary adjustments to the Charges within the
Agreement to reflect the changes that are being made to the Services as a result of the termination of
the Service Desk Service.

Due to the Expiry Date of the Service Desk Service being changed to the 2" July 2014 from the 2"
June 2014 and the transfer of responsibilities and employees to the Next Supplier taking place on the
16" June if Fujitsu Services fail to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels as a
direct result of this transfer of responsibilities Fujitsu Services shall continue to provide the Services to
the extent it is able in accordance with the Service Levels but may apply for relief as set out in Clause
39 of the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fujitsu Employees shall transfer to the Next
Supplier on the 16" June 2014 in accordance with the TUPE Regulations, and the back-up solution
which may be required to be provided by Fujitsu for the period between 17" June and 2" July 2014
shall not affect this transfer.

Any defined terms set out in this CCN shall have the meaning set out in the Agreement.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

This CCN provides for:
1) The termination of the Service Desk Service with effect from 23:00 on the 2"? July 2014;
2) The amendment of references to the Service Desk Service from the Agreement;
3) The removal of the Charges associated to the Service Desk Service;
4) The remedial changes necessary to the remainder of the Services to enable the continued and
uninterrupted provision of such Services;

The remaining Services require some adjustment to enable them to continue to function
when the Service Desk Service ceases to be provided by Fujitsu.

The main amendment necessary in this area is the introduction of the new MAC Team
(as defined below) to be provided as part of the Service Management Service.

5

The necessary adjustments to the Charges defined in the Agreement to enable such changes
to be effected;

The changes to the Charges in Schedule D1 as detailed in this CCN1409a are reflective
of the elements of the currently provided Service Desk Service which will transfer to the
other Services and of the increased workload required as a result of the termination of
the Service Desk Service.

With regards to the Charges for the Service Management Service, the increase in
Charges for the years ending March 2016 and March 2017 will be lower than those for
year ending 31% March 2015 due to the expiry or termination of the Engineering Service.
In the event that the Engineering Service is extended beyond 31% March 2015 the
Service Management Service Charge shall be increased by £29,648.70 per month and
such shall be detailed in the associated CCN to extend the Engineering Service.

6) Service Volumetric Limits.

The termination of the Service Desk Services means that there are anticipated increases
to the volume of Incidents. CCN1400 agreed the Expected Engineering Volumes relating
to the number of Engineering Service Visits to Branch, however, it did not include the
treatment of potential impacts on other Services. It is agreed by the parties that, in the
event of increases in the volume of activity or other Service impacts which affect Fujitsu’s
ability to perform the Services and which are attributable to the termination of the
Service Desk Service, this shall be managed in accordance with the HNG-X Agreement
and in particular, Clause 39..

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF THE AGREEMENT (including Schedule reference)
Removal of References

In order to effect the termination of the Service Desk Service the references to the Service Desk
Service throughout the Agreement are to be removed in accordance with the detail below.

Additions to clauses are shown underlined, and deletions are shown with a strikethrough.
