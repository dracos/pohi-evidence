I had a telephone conversation with Peter Sewell of Fujitsu at about 5.00 pm to see where
he had got to with the information. He said that Fujitsu were retrieving the data. The data
covers every branch in England and there is a programme running to extract it. There is 9
gig of information. Once all the information has been retrieved from archive they then have
to extract from that the information from Marine Drive. They are going to have a breakfast
meeting tomorrow to discuss how to get that information. I will call him then to try to get a
better idea of timescale.

Thereafter I had a telephone conversation with Christine Train and updated her and agreeing
to call Mr Castleton either way after I have spoken to Fujitsu tomorrow morning.
