Jane

The defence have requested some further questions which I think only Fujitsu can
answer. Could you forward them and ask for a response.

1) In light of the above, the statement by Fujitsu that the calls to the -
helpline were of a routine nature is not accepted. Please provide a copy
of the log of all calls made to the helpline by West Byfleet Post Office
for a period from 6 months prior to the Defendant becoming sub-post
until’ the present day. (Date range required - 1st Jan 2005 to 30th
November 2009)

2) In the Defence Expert’s interim report reference was made to the need to

is

have sight of service logs for West Byfleet. Comment has been made as to
the huge cost involved in pursuing this exercise. Please provide details
as to the work involved in this action and why the cost is so ‘high.
Depending on the answer provided to this request and others contained in
this document, a decision will then be taken by the defence as to
whether this action needs to be pursued. (Date range of Transaction
Logs requested 1st Jan 2005 to 30th November 2009. How much would it
cost to produce transaction logs for this period).

3) In light of the Post Office’s stated intention to commence rolling out
the new computerised accounting system from January 2010, please confirm
what steps are being taken to preserve the end to end architecture of
the Horizon system in general and, in particular, to West Byfleet Post
Office.
