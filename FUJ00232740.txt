TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

The following is a summary list of improvements that have been made on POA that were stimulated
by comments seen in any court cases, were seen as necessary for internal improvements generally,

or were introduced to improve the information provided to POL. The items are loosely grouped into
categories and are not, at this stage, fully described.

HIJ PROGRAMME

.

.

Assigned a named point of contact to help coordinate POL's HiJ improvement initiatives
Whilst this was being formulated by POL, Fujitsu delivered a POL focussed Postmaster First
improvements initiative to jointly address a number of issues:
© SME knowledge sessions on POL selected subjects to enhance POL understanding
o. Aligned CBIF with HDR to consolidate views of defects (See HDR below)
© Offered guidance and teaching sessions on POL reconciliation actions (POL never
responded)
© Supported POL high-level discussions on UAT
Reviewed and contributed to POL planning around its test strategy and test policy
Supported POL in its thinking of its new governance model

HORIZON DEFECTS REVIEW (HDR

.

Fujitsu introduced Horizon Known Error Review Forum (HKERF) in late 2018 to provide POL with
early visibility of branch impacting defects
© POLconsidered ending this in 2019 (Martin Godbold)
o POLrequested transfer of chairmanship to POL in Q1 2021 with a new name HDR —
started February 2021
© May/June 2021 the ToR for HDR was updated and the interaction formalised
In 2018, Fujitsu introduced internal weekly review of any new Knowledge Base Articles that
could potentially refer to defects to ensure a Peak/Incident was in place if needed and POL
notification of the Peak was provided where branch impacting. This fed into the HKERF.
This evolved to be more system driven in May/June 2021
= Now Peak/Incident tag driven
= Advised all staff of the criteria
= This is a cultural shift in how POA considers postmaster implications

LIVE DEFECT MANAGEMENT

Continuous improvement focus — not a new activity

Agreed definition of Live Defect and branch impacting with POL

Fujitsu now provides a weekly report on all branch impacting defects to POL weekly as well as
attending the POL weekly meeting to review progress

Shored up the internal Live Defect Management processes to enable process analysis and
reporting — making a number of changes within teams to improve efficiency

Added features to the TfSNow and Peak toolsets to enable better management of Live Defects &
HDR Defects to enable greater visibility for POL

TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

Ran workshops with all support, development, test and release management teams to embed
improved processes

Changed model for Live Defect delivery to include option for a rapid deployment option [WIP]
Expedited processes to get Live Defects assigned to a Release [WIP]

Raised the profile of Live Defect Management to the demand planning forum to enable POL to
guide on priorities [WIP]

Appointed a Defect/Quality Manager [WIP]

Introduced monthly review and report to POL of any Incidents closed where POL could consider
process improvements or enhancement requests to improved error repellence [WIP]

PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT IMPROVEMENTS

.

Reviewed assignments of user accounts with elevated privileges and rationalised it from 56 to 34

in Q2 2021

Introduced additional weekly reporting for POL on PAM account status — May 2021
Enhanced the monthly PAM verification processes [WIP]

Introduced additional monthly reporting in H2 2020 of numerous types of physical and user
account privileged usage in the monthly SecOps report to give POL greater visibility — Fujitsu
initiated

ENQUIRY SUPPORT

Introduced a simple enquiry mailbox for POL and its legal representatives and assigned a multi-
skilled team to be available to review and actions (PO.Enquiries@ and the channels we proposed
prior to this)

Offered to work with POL to check it is using all of the Horizon content it has access to to best
support an inquiry from a postmaster [WIP and awaiting POL input]

APPSUP

Removed the default privilege APPSUP on BRDB and made it an on-demand controlled allocation
of temporary rights (this was done in 2018 TBC)

APPSUP is not used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions.
Corrections relating to branch balance discrepancies are performed by POL using the POL
Transaction Correction Process (this is true - just not sure if we implemented that because of the
criticisms in the cases or if this has always been true) [WIP — what's the story]

Implemented a new jointly defined and agreed process for APPSUP usage in May 2021 that
ensures a new POL approval process can be integrated and evidence of action taken provided

RISK MANAGEMENT

.

Continued process improvements to the account risk management processes to ensure greater
alignment and clearer action tracking across all areas

Enhanced risk management with POL - expanding it to cover all domains

Fujitsu leads the joint account monthly risk management review call — driving POL to take actions
required
