SUMMARY OF CHANGE:

The Department of Works and Pensions are currently involved in a major fraud
investigation and require that pre-BI3 audit data relating to that investigation be
retained beyond the 18 months prescribed within the Agreement between Post
Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services. The most effective way of dealing with this is to
introduce a technical change to the pre-BI3 TMS element of the audit trail, increasing
it from 18 months to 7 years. As a consequence one Schedule from the Agreement
(S18) and two CCDs (Audit Trail Functional Specification (FS ref CR/FSP/006)) and
Service Description for the Security Management Service (FS ref CS/SER/016))
need to be updated to reflect this change, and as such all TMS journal data shall be
retained for 7 years.

This CCN is being raised to cover the change to Schedule 18. The CCDs will be
covered by Soft Change Control as defined in Schedule 5.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH-+MEDIUM / LOW
REASON FOR CHANGE:

The retention period for the pre-BI3 TMS element of the audit trail has been
increased from 18 months to 7 years.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

Para 2.8.3 of Schedule 18 requires updating to reflect the increase as set out below.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF THE AGREEMENT:
