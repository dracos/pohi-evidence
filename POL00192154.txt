Thanks Rob, do you think we need independent advice?

Susan,
I have read the documentation with interest.

From the draft reply it looks as though the expert has been less than fothcoming. If i am right this is disturbing. I
understood that there were a couple of bugs identified that impacted on a limited number of prosecutions which is
reflected in the later part of the reply. This is at odds with the sentence "The Second Sight Interim report demonstrates
that this was not the case" which sounds as if POL wholesale have been invloved in misleading parties to prosecutions.
Having no knowledge of the unwritten background i wonder wether this statement can be softened? I appreciate that the
report goes onto be more specific in terms of the impact.

Overall the reply covers the responsibilites that need to be covered in the reply and should satisfy the CCRC for the time
being. i am sure those inputting to the reply are acting independently and fairly, however as they have also held
responsibility in relation to prosecuting offenders there could be questions in relation to independence which could see
CCRC wanting to conduct their own investigation.

Tam out of the office at the moment but will be viewing emails until Thursday when i will be on A/L so if there is
anything specific you would like to discuss please let me know.

Regards,

Rob
