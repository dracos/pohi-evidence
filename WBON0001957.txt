Tony

I understand there are a number of documents you are keen to see following your meeting with Andy and Tom earlier
this week.

Please see attached:

1. Anote on abuse of process/criminal convictions.

2. Acopy of Second Sight’s letter to POL dated 19 October 2012 agreeing the privilege point.

3. An extract from Brian Altman QC’s draft review into Jo Hamilton’s case (please note this is in draft form and
Brian has asked that we treat it as nothing more than a guide at this stage and refrain from quoting
from it).

4. Anote on the Official Secrets Act.

I have also asked POL to send me a sample Branch Trading Statement with the relevant signature block — I will send
this to you as soon as I have it.

We are working on the other actions arising from Tuesday's meeting and will provide answers asap.
Many thanks

Paul
