OK thanks Jane.
Important Mark scans for any other areas, which could be sensitive to media scrutiny.

Paula, Al

Following discussions with our QC and Bond Dickinson this afternoon, the
following is the recommended language to be included in the response to Freeths
in the wider section on remote access:

"At each stage, Post Office ascertained the position to respond to
the questions it believed it was being asked. With the benefit of
hindsight, some of Post Office's statements may have been
incorrect in light of what has since been identified in relation to
Fujitsu's administrator access rights (see below). But Post Office
tefutes any suggestion that it ever made false statements
deliberately or did so to mislead, deceive or conceal. The Post
Office personnel responsible for those statements made them in
good faith: what was said reflected what they understood the
position to be after they had made relevant enquiries at the time.”

There have been no other material changes to the wider drafting around the
remote access issue which I circulated to you earlier today.

The challenge has been to balance the risk of adverse publicity ahead of the court
process (Post Office's concern) with the need to be open and transparent with the
Court in admitting that certain of the information we provided previously on this
issue could be construed as ‘wrong’.

Given Mark D had other commitments today, I am taking him through this
wording early tomorrow.

Kind regards,

Jane MacLeod
