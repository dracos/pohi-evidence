Thanks for the below.

Please could I clarify a couple of points? I have referred to the entries in PinICL and Peak both as Peaks although I
appreciate this may not be the correct term.

WBD_001301.000001
WBONO0001431
WBON0001431

Is Peak and the access databases mutually exclusive?

[Matthew Lenton] They are not currently connected to each other in any way; the current Peak system
has no means to search or perform any actions on the PinICL database, and vice-versa. That is possibly
not what you meant by the question however, but see next answer.

When the move from PinICL to Peak took place was there a clear split that calls either went into Peak or the
access database, or could some calls be stored in both locations?

[Matthew Lenton] There are some that are in both. Some spot checking suggest that PinICLs closed from
July 2000 onwards are also stored in the current Peak system; I didn’t find any closed after that date that
are not in Peak, and didn’t find any closed June 2000 or before that are in Peak. I expect we could check
this more systematically if necessary.

When referring to 80,000 entries in the access database does this mean there are 80,000 Peaks, or 80,000 separate
lines which when a number of them are combined together from a Peak? Does 80,000 entries mean that 80,000
Peaks were raised between 1996 (being the earliest dated entry in the indexes) and 2003?

[Matthew Lenton] It is 80,000 separate calls / Peaks. The count was done on the indices exported to
Excel, and a check for duplicates in column A in each sheet reveals that there are none, therefore it is
59720 Peaks in one sheet, and 17537 Peaks on the other.

Many thanks

Hi Matthew

We are pre-empting some questions from Freeths on the PinICL archives — please could you confirm that the below
understanding is correct / provide answers to our queries? If it would be easier to discuss, please feel free to call.

Current understanding:
Data from PinICL was migrated to Peak in 2003.[Matthew Lenton] Yes, correct

There are two access databases which contain some details of archived PinICLs, but these archives are not complete
(for reasons below).[Matthew Lenton] Yes, correct

We don't know why some entries were archived and other moved into Peak — the person who did the archiving left the
business a while ago.[Matthew Lenton] Yes, it is not clear what the criteria was. The person who did it retired in
2013.

Queries:
How large (in MB) are the two access databases?/Matthew Lenton] 250MB and 1.2GB.

How many PinlCL entries are there in the two access databases?/Matthew Lenton] Approximately 19,000 and
61,000 respectively.

Is it possible to generate an index of the entries?/Matthew Lenton] The attached is a summary of the Peaks
contained in the database, however it must be noted that a lot of the progress information is missing. PinICL
used to record large responses as an external file and smaller responses in the database table. These
archives are only the database entries, thus they are missing most of the useful updates. Note also that even
the title / description of each entry is not always complete as it might be split over more than one row.

WBD_001301.000003
WBONO0001431
WBON0001431

When providing us with the entries previously you were able to export them to a spreadsheet with each entry on a
separate tab. Would it be possible to export some or all of the entries into individual spreadsheets rather than as tabs
of a spreadsheet?/Matthew Lenton] Previously it was done manually by copying and pasting, so it could be
done the same way into separate sheets. Exporting every call into a separate sheet would be possible but
would result in approx. 80,000 files. Note that the first archive does not contain all the tables apart from the
summary (which was used to create the attached), progress (incomplete as discussed above) and users. This
would again create a very limited picture of the ticket.

Would extracting the documents be a manual or automated task?/Matthew Lenton] Extracting all of them would

have to be automated, but due to the limitations outlined above our view is that it would be wasted effort, and
the results could be misleading.

Kind regards

Amy

HI Matthew

Apologies, if you have explained these points before but please could I clarify a couple of queries on the Known Error
Log:

1. PinICL system — it is correct that the PinICL entries are stored on an access database which is accessible?
[Matthew Lenton] There are two Access databases that contain some details of archived PinICLs, but
they were created some years ago by someone who has been retired for several years, and our
understanding is that they appear to be incomplete both in terms of a) not containing all of the
original information that was stored against those PinICL details that they do contain, and b) not
containing between them all of the PinICLs that existed. We are not sure of the criteria that was used
for selecting the PinICLs to be archived. We have provided details of some PinlCLs, but for the
reasons given above, we don’t believe that it is necessarily reliable.

2. Deleted KELs - are not retrievable? Or were provided to us on 5 November 2018 (see attached email chain —
email on 12 Dec @ 16:30)?

[Matthew Lenton] There are two categories of Deleted:

a) Deleted KELs that are no longer retrievable due to being completely deleted, before SSC
started saving them into a “Deleted table”. These cannot be provided, and if a KEL is
referred to by us as not being retrievable, and, I believe, all KELs that are referred to in
Coyne’s report as not having been disclosed, then they fall into this category.

b

Deleted KELs that are retrievable due to being deleted into a “Deleted table”. These
would no longer be included in any SSC searches, even by changing the default search
criteria as described in 3 below. We believe that the functionality to save a deleted KEL
was introduced in July 2008; however, the dates of KELs within the deleted table are based
on when the KEL was created, rather than when it was deleted, so it is not completely clear
when the change occurred (and noting that there could be retrievable KELs in that table
which we have provided that are older than KELs that are not retrievable, due to when
they were deleted). This is the set we provided in November.

WBD_001301.000005
WBONO0001431
WBON0001431

3. Deactivated KELs — these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?
[Matthew Lenton] These are KELs that have not been deleted into the “Deleted table” but are excluded
from SSC’s default searches, which focus on Live KELs, but can be included easily by changing
search criteria. These were provided in the original set in March.

4. Deprecated KEL - these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?[Matthew
Lenton] When a KEL is updated, the old version of that same KEL is deprecated, so these are
superseded versions of live or deactivated KELs. We have only provided the most recent versions, so
we have not separately provided these superseded versions. Note that there are no deprecated
versions of KELs in the category 2a) — i.e. if a KEL was deleted prior to the introduction of the Deleted
table function then all versions were deleted.

5. Live KELs — these were provided to us in March 18 and December 18.[Matthew Lenton] These were
provided in March, with those in category 3 above.

6. Other KELs — are there are other types of KELs which do not fall within the above catergories?/Matthew
Lenton] No, the above categories 2 to 5 cover all KELs.

Many thanks

Lucy,

We’ ve located an archive of PinICL entries which contains some of the calls you listed, though not all, as
annotated on the list in your email below, noting that I have also added in the references that you asked about
on 31-Jan-2019, and the archived records for those are attached. The archiving was done some years ago as

WBD_001301.000006
WBONO0001431
WBON0001431

an export to Access, and this Excel extract is identical in format to the Access records, so clearly any original
formatting from the PinICL system has been lost.

Dates for the PinICLs that I have supplied are on the sheet, for those we don’t have we have no other
information regarding dates other than what is suggested in the report.

The KELs listed below are all deleted rather than deprecated or archived, and are therefore not retrievable.

Matthew,

Jason Coyne has referred to a number of Peaks / KELs in his supplemental report that he states have not been
disclosed. Can you let me know why they are not in the PEAK / KEL extracts we have received from you? Is it
because they were all from the system "PinICL"? If you can provide any dates relating to them that would be
appreciated.

The list is as follows:

e PC0021327 [Matthew Lenton] Not in PinICL Archive.
e PC0032801/Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.
