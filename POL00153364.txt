PO Chairman's Review - Agenda for first meeting with Chris Knight.docx

jane

We are meeting here at Finsbury Dials tomorrow to discuss the work you are taking forward with Jonathan Swift for
our Chairman, Tim Parker.

I attach a draft agenda in an attempt to provide some structure for that discussion. It is very much a draft, so do
please feel free to add to it.

Attending the meeting on our side will be myself, Mark Underwood and the General Counsel, Jane MacLeod, who will
only be with us for the first 30 minutes.

If you could like to speak before 3pm tomorrow, do please call.

Kind regards

Patrick

Patrick Bourke
