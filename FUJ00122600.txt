Hi Gareth

I've attached a revised witness statement which I intend to return to POL today - they did not want any reference to the
locking issue included in it, so this has been removed.

Would you please run your eye over it before I return it - there arn't many changes made, but I thought it would be a good
time to include any evolutionary changes which may have occurred.

Many thanks
Penny
