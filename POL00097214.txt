Rachel,

What I propose adding is the following (just before section 1.1):

I have been asked to provide a statement in the case of Kim Wylie. I understand that the integrity of the system has been

questioned and this report provides some general information regarding the Integrity of Horizon.

I note that in the Defence Statement (CPIA 1996 s5(5)) there are comments about the Robustness of Horizon. Firstly, 1 am
not aware of the specific allegations regarding missing user information or phantom logs, and so cannot comment on
those. However, I would say that Horizon has been designed such that it does not break down easily and is not affected by
a single application failure. Also, Horizon does recovery quickly from failures and does hold up well under exceptional
circumstances and is not wholly affected by a bug in one aspect of it. However as the report below shows, that in those
cases where there is a failure, the Integrity of the data recorded is maintained and any discrepancies resulting from the failure
are restricted to the transactions being processed at the time of failure, whose amounts are normally insignificant compared

to the amounts identified in shortfalls of cash as found during an audit of a Branch.

I also note a comment made about it being possible to remotely access the system. It is true that such access is possible;
however in an analysis of data audited by the system, it is possible to identify any data that has not been input directly by
staff in the Branch. Any such change to data is very rare and would be authorised by Post Office Lid. As I have not had an
opportunity to examine data related to this Branch, I cannot categorically say that this has not happened in this case, but

would suggest it is highly unlikely.

The purpose of this report is to provide some further background information.

However this may open POL up to carrying out further investigation so I can leave it out and just submit the statement
as it is if you prefer.

Please let me know if you want this extra info included or not and I will then arrange to get hardcopies signed and
scanned for you.

Regards

Gareth

Gareth

Many thanks for this, I really appreciate your assistance. If you feel that you are able to deal with the issues of robustness
and the Remote Access system fairly swiftly then I would like you address those points that have been raised, so that we
can deal with every area that they have criticised.

I have read your attachments and they are all fine. If you feel that it would take too much time to address the above
points, please go ahead and send me the signed copies of the attached so that I can send them on.

Don't worry you will not be required to attend court on Thursday, that is simply a hearing to serve evidence which may not
be needed now that you are sending me your report through.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need anything.
Many thanks

Rachael

Rachel,
{have been advised that I can try and help you with this, if it isn’t too late.
ve had a read through the info you sent me yesterday and have also taken my previous witness statement which I

produced in early October and amended it, in a similar way to your request (it didn’t scan well as document if I did
exactly as you asked).

POL-0096797
POLO0097214
POL00097214

Reading through the Defence Statement I see it does make some specific points which my statement doesn’t currently
address. Specifically, the challenges regarding Robustness and Remote Access to the system. Do you want me to try
and address those specifics?

Please can you confirm that you are happy with what is attached and if so { will print it off and sign it (and get the
signature witnessed) and also re-print and sign the 2 attachment (also attached to this email).

Ican then get these scanned and emailed back to you. However I though it was worth checking first that the documents
do cover ali that you want them to. I assume that I am not required to be in Newcastle on Thursday!

Regards

Gareth

Dear Gareth

Request for urgent expert report

Further to my previous email, Iam writing as a matter of urgency to request a signed and dated copy
of your report in the case of Kim Wylie. This matter has become more urgent due to the fact that
defence solicitors have listed the case for a mention this Thursday 29th November 2012.

Thave attached a copy of their request for further disclosure for your consideration. As you will see,
most of the evidence that they are seeking stems from the integrity of the Horizon system,
which makes the service of your report even more important.

Ihave also attached a copy of the following:
- summary of facts

- draft indictment

- audit report

All of which set out the background to this case. Please can you consider the above and include this
paragraph at the beginning of your report:

POL-0096797
POLO0097214
POL00097214

"T have been asked to provide a statement in the case of Kim Wylie. I understand that the integrity of
the system has been questioned and I can say the following:"

As there have been no specific criticisms of the Horizon system raised by the defence, your previous
report can be used with the addition of the opening line referred to above. Please see the defence
case statement attached which contains the nature of the defendant's case.

Please could you scan and attach in an email a signed and dated copy of your report as soon as
possible so that I can serve it on the defence today.

I note from previous correspondence that I am to liaise with investigators rather than approach you
directly. Please note I intend to do this, it is only because of the urgent nature that I have been
requested to contact you directly.

Should you require any assistance or further documents, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Kind regards

Rachael
