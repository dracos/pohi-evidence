As you are aware the CD provided should contain all Bureau de Change on demand weekly summary
figures from Week 01 to Week 43, The examples of data contained within the attachments to your
memo contain that data for Weeks 2 - 4, the offices being listed in alphabetical order. Accordingly the

correct data has been forwarded to you. Perhaps you could view the material again and return to me if
you experience any further problems.

The solicitors representing Mr Whitehouse have requested copies of all the Forde Moneychanger rolls
for the period covered by the Indictment. Could you kindly confirm whether you would wish to be
supplied with copies?

Regards
