Attachment: Horizon integrity 020810.doc

Chris — further to my last email, please find attached a report I did last summer for Dave Smith (then MD). It is a long
report but that detail was agreed as necessary and I would be grateful if you could read it as context to the update I
need to give you.

I have drafted a one page ET update and am presently getting input from Legal colleagues. I also intend to liaise with
Heads in IT, Network and Security before submission to ET.

Mike Granville has had related stakeholder conversations and I expect you may have heard references to this area
from Kevin, Paula, Susan or Mike.

Thanks, Rod
