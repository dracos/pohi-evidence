« " Not happy " with Retention or increase in variable pay
© Happy with appt of COO . Wondered if should be Dep CEO. I said the title should be for you .
* Happy that you could change three execs . They were unclear about terms we could pay for ED exit .
© Deeply disappointing and I said you would feel the same . HOWEVER , THEY HAVE NOT SENT THEIR ADVICE IN

TO THE SEC OF STATE.
