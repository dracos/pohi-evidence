1. | was interviewed by Rebecca Thomson who worked for Computer Weekly in
2008 and the article was eventually printed in 2009.

programme. This was filmed on 13 and 14 August 2009 and was aired on the

8 September 2009.

THE BACKGROUND TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE JFSA

3.

| was sentenced by the Winchester Crown Court in February 2008 and
because of the overwhelming support | received from my customers in the
village, my story made the national newspapers.

This immediately led to people ringing me up and telling me they/someone
they knew had had the same thing happen to them. The villagers also started
trawling the internet and together we found a website called “Post Office
Victims.Org”. This had been set up by Alan Bates in 2002 to try and raise
awareness of what was going on at the Post Office. Alan and | made
contact. He had been in communication with Tony Collins at Computer
Weekly since 2002. They were putting together an article on the post office.
More publicity resulted in more victims coming forward and Alan decided it
would be best to have a meeting. On 8 November 2009, 17 sub postmasters

met at the Fenny Compton village Hall.

YOUR FIRST MEETING WITH LORD ARBUTHNOT AND EARLY POLITICAL

MEETINGS

5.

While all this was going on | had a meeting with my MP James Arbuthnot. He
has been a massive support throughout all of this and continues campaigning
to this day.

Seema Misra (a fellow Sub-postmistress) saw the Computer weekly article

and turned up at my shop. | took her to my solicitor and neighbour Issy Hogg.

Issy managed to get the trial adjourned while a computer expert was
appointed. The Post Office did not disclose vital documents to enable proper
analysis by the computer expert to take place. Seema was subsequently
found guilty and sent to prison. | was so upset and angry | immediately
contacted James Arbuthnot. This was sometime in October 2010.

7. James then rattled many cages and managed to get the “Mediation Scheme”
set up. Regrettably however this turned into somewhat of a farce.

8. Second Sight came on the scene and started investigating in good faith what
was happened with the Post Office but when they started unearthing the

dreadful truth, they were sacked and their report was rubbished by Post Office

HOW AND WHEN YOU BECAME INVOLVED IN THE BATES & ORS LITIGATION

9. | had met an amazing lady at a village event just before my sentencing, Kay
Linnell. She was a very well-connected forensic accountant and having
listened to my plight over the years she jumped on board to help.

10. The ever-growing group needed legal help to take the Post Office to the High
Court. Kay and Alan set about the task of finding a great legal team and
looking at the issue of funding any legal action. They made a great team, and
| was always around to offer those involved emotional support wen needed.
We were and still are a wonderful team and Alan has devoted his life to this
cause.

11.Having sourced lawyers and secured funding the Post Office legal action
began.

12. There was two trials and | attended Court almost every day. | also gave

evidence in the mediation. We won both trials comprehensively.

HOW AND WHEN YOU BECAME INVOLVED IN THE HAMILTON V POST
OFFICE PROCEEDINGS
13.Despite the success of the Bates litigation, my criminal conviction still stood.

Turner MP, as he had been actively following the litigation and suggested |

talk to Neil Hudgell. The rest is history.
