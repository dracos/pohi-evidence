5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test
Conditions that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance
Criterion has been met together with the applicable test Phase.

5.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the MIS Services Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated
through Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using
prepared test scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a
criterion are specified in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test.
Detailed composition of the test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is
contained in Section 10. In the tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled
Function Run entry will be populated immediately prior to the running of the
Acceptance Trials in a working version of the Acceptance Test Specification.
These will provide invigilators with references to the checklists used to
monitor the progress of the testing. The order of running of Test Conditions
will not necessarily correspond to the order presented in HLTPs because of
the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function Run entry will allow the
invigilator to read across from the criterion to the checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document
reviews, site visits or presentations. The Test Condition(s) are described in
section 5.1.2.

5.1.1 Description of tests conducted by Acceptance Trial

This requirement is against ad-hoc and supplementary MIS requirements.
Those that are generic will be tested, where applicable, in the acceptance
trial via the functional areas for which they belong (i.e.: TIP, Helpdesks etc.)

The non-generic will be tested in Acceptance Review (i.e. Service Review
Reports etc.) as defined below in section 5.1.2.

5.1.2 Description of tests conducted by Acceptance Review

The table below shows which acceptance criteria are to be met by
Acceptance Review. Each Acceptance Test will use the latest baselined
version of any document referred to in section 0.2 or below.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance

Incidents.

Acceptance Test Specification Version: 1.0
Date: 20/10/98
6.1 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive
impact on the service received by the Customer.

e.g. Failure to pay benefits to the right person, at the right place, at the right
time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there was
a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITIES necessary to
overcome that impact on their business.

e.g. Failure to support accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of
the service where there is no procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service
Levels.

e.g. Where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable
Threshold under normal loading.

6.2 MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and
is likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does
not substantively impact the service received by the Customer.

e.g. Incorrect spelling on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact
on the ability of the AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there
was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITIES necessary to
overcome that impact on their business.

e.g. Non production of a weekly report, resulting in it's manual transcription,
which causes additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average
duration of 1 hour per week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service
Levels.

e.g. At peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds, but on average all transactions within the service do achieve
Minimum Acceptable Thresholds.

6.3 LOW SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer.

e.g. Presentational, style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the
user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there was
a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITIES necessary to
overcome that impact on their business.

e.g. Non production of a weekly report, resulting in it's manual transcription,
which causes additional resource or effort at 10 or fewer outlets of the
average duration of 1 hour per week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of
the service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution
(i.e. the only impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed,
but where procedures have been agreed and are in place).
