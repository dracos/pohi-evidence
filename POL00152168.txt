; - send a message from Paula to whole business alongside a filmed interview with Angela

; - use our internal channels (Subspace news etc...) social media proactively to publicise our messages

; - engage with MPs

POL00152168

costed this option up)

and information. Given Panorama's reach and influence we can expect colleagues to have questions and I would like to
