Branch focus: Whistleblowing Poster - DMBs only
Over the next week please look out for the Whistleblowing poster for internal display.

Whistleblowing refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing by reporting it
internally within an organisation.

Post Office is committed to conducting business with the highest standards of honesty,
integrity and openness. Colleagues can raise concerns in confidence, secure in the knowledge
that we will take those concerns seriously and act on them.

Our Whistleblowing Policy sets out the procedure to follow if a colleague wants to raise a
concern. The business will support anyone who raises a genuine concern, even if it turns out to
be mistaken. You will not be treated unfairly or liable to disciplinary action as a result of doing
so.

How do I raise a concern?
There are three ways in which colleagues can report a concern:

1. By contacting their line manager or HR Director

2. By contacting the Speak Up confidential reporting service run by [Intouch MCS Ltd on

{GRO or via www. intouchfeedback.com/postofficd

3. By contacting the Whistleblowing Officer at [whistleblowing}

Where can I find out more?

For further information please see the Whistleblowing policy on the Intranet. Alternatively, you
