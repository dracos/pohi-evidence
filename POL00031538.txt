Hi

I’m still really confused about this - Dave says below:

There is no remote access to the terminals in branches.

The only access channel is through the support network for software updates etc. There is nothing stored
on the terminal all transactions are committed at the datacentre. It is not possible to instantiate a remote
desktop session on a terminal and undertake transactions as if it were being done at that terminal

This seems to conflict with our lines where it says ‘it is possible to add to transactions to make a
correction...”

We need (obviously) to be absolutely certain on all this. Help!

So can anyone remotely access sub postmasters horizon systems remotely and if they can I take it this
would be visible and logged whether officially done or unofficially?

Julie

I have answered as best I can but I understand Kevin Lenihan is also getting the
information from Fujitsu (I do know these have been answered for the lawyers and Deloitte
when they were looking at this:

The system is pen tested for PCI yearly and at any major change (the last PCI test was
between 03/06/2014 - 10/06/2014 and there was a test for the datacentre refresh which is
not yet live in summer). There are not outstanding significant findings which have not been
remediated.

Internal and external vulnerability scans are conducted monthly which have confirmed the
lack of significant issues,

The system has remote access only for Fujitsu support personnel through a support
gateway against which all activity is monitored.

All transactions are written to an immutable audit trail at the point of completion and it is
from this store that any evidential information is obtained.

Thanks
Dave

Hello Lesley

Below is the current Q and A we have been using on this, in liaison with Fujitsu (and
which is in line with FOls we have had on the subject).

Regarding the testing and standards, I have pasted below what we have said in FO! but
this is from 2011 so might well have changed. Grateful for detail on this.

Many thanks

Mel

Remote Access
There are very concerning stories about remote access to Horizon that might have
contributed or been the reason for unexplained changes being made to postmasters
accounts - how do you explain changes to accounts at times when postmasters could
not possibly have had access themselves?

e¢ Transaction data in branch accounts can't be changed remotely

¢ No evidence of malicious tampering

POL-0028440
POL00031538
POL00031538

There is very selective, misleading and incorrect information being put into the public
domain about a number of cases. Much of this is not actually included in any allegations
or complaints put to us by applicants and also changes in nature and detail.

Post Office cannot breach the privacy and confidentiality of individual applicants by
discussing their cases, even in the face of unsubstantiated, baseless or malicious
allegations. To do so would lead to us being accused of breaching confidentiality and
undermining the Scheme and mediation process. So we have been limited in the public
comment we can make.

But there is no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to edit,
manipulate or remove transaction data once it has been

recorded in a branch's accounts. It is possible for Fujitsu to view branch data in order to
provide support and conduct maintenance but this does not allow access to any
functionality that could be used to edit recorded transaction data.

There is also no evidence at all of any malicious remote tampering.

So it is not possible to alter postmasters' accounts remotely?

It is not possible to edit or tamper with a transaction once it has been made.

It is possible to add transactions in order to make a correction. This is extremely rare, is
carried out with the right level of security and it cannot be done without a postmaster's
knowledge.

Can you rule out remote fraud or cybercrime?

There is no evidence at all of this in any of the investigations carried out - there is no
evidence that Horizon has not worked as it should do. No company can completely
prevent cybercrime but there is nothing to suggest that this has caused any of the issues
that have been complained about.

We adhere to industry standards , regulatory and compliance requirements. [Details to be
provided separately]

From 2011 FOI. Post Office Ltd as a responsible business undertakes regular and robust
external audits of its IT systems which includes Horizon. During the past five years
there have 16 external audits and accreditations. Post Office Ltd undertakes monthly
vulnerability scans and penetration tests are conducted annually, therefore there have
been 65 scans and tests which we consider audits.

We also referred in another request to VocaLINK and the external consultancy IRM
(Payment Card Industry audit). These audits cover the whole system including
accounting, along with product and service end-to-end processes. In addition the
following accreditations have been applied, British Standards Institute (BSI), security
audit 270001 and VocalLink and Merchant Aquirer (Worldpay, Streamline HS
