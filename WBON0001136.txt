Hi

We have circa 3500 KEL’s relative to POA, the following is based on the current Master KEL workbook,

posted on POA SharePoint.

During 2017 an average of 16 KEL’s per week continue to be reviewed. Typical examples of KEL’s
reviewed, updated and approved by the forum recently are illustrated below.

In the first, although these alerts are defined as not presently being seen by SMC, appropriate action steps are
now in place so as should incidents reoccur during a Blade server reboot event.

The second example details a KEL that was incomplete due to lack of assigned priorities . The update (v.2) is
now approved and live ensuring that a P1 call with voicing is raised with Unix. Terminology within all
KEL’s is also verified as being current relative to contractual changed.

No Incident Priority assigned. Currently such
alerts are not occurring.

SSC : Possible rewording:

1. Ifa single occurrence of this alert,
SMC can Safely ignore this event.

2. If SMC observe >3 events with in a 10-
minute period, pass a PS call over to Unix
(no need to voice Unix).

3. If the event keeps recurring (as in this,
case, when there was a constant stream of
events generated), then raise a P! call and
pass to Unix - contact Unix ASAP (both in
& out of hours).

SMC to amend accordingly.

Problem
The Fad Hash check faire incomplete processing ofall fad hashes for the stream,

The sequence of events (TWS jobs) which led to this:
LUFS_ROC. BRDBXOO3_ROC_FROM_LFS_1 completed successful
LLFS_ROC.BRDXO03_RDC_FROM_LFS_2 abended - BRDB node not avaiable
[LFS_ROC. BRDBXOO3_RDC_FROM_LFS_3 abended - BRDB node not avaiable
[LFS_ROC. BRDXOO3_RDC_FROM_LFS_4 abended - BRDB node not avaiable

2,34 were retried with success.

[BRED node 4 failed, which prompted an auto-renun.

[UFS_RDC. BRDBKOO3_RDC_FROM_LFS_1_RERUN completed successfully

UFS_ROC. RUN abended - BROB node not available
[LFS_ROC. BRDBXO03_RDC_FROM_LFS_1_RERUN abended - BRDB node not available
[UFS_ROC. BRDBXOO3_ROC_FROM_LFS_1_RERUN abended - BRDB node not available
2,3,4 were retried with success.

In summary, al jobs were eventually retried successfuly...so the fad hash check should be successful, right ?

At the meeting we had with Post Office and their legal representatives they asked the question again on
whether we currently (understanding this is a ‘living’ document set) have any KELs on the audit store or that
are related to errors or bugs in the system that could cause imbalance in sub postmasters accounts.

Hi Pete

By way of an introduction, I am a colleague of Andy Parsons at Bond Dickinson.

With apologies for bringing this issue up again, we need to revisit the Known Error Log point and I’m currently looking to draft a
short description of what the KEL is / its scope etc. In addition to your helpful notes below, we wondered whether you might be
able to provide us with a few example KELs (5 or so), just from the top of the pile? Is this feasible / easily done?

Thanks

We have checked all the KELs (takes time as they have free text included) and have found there are no KELs
that directly affect the normal operation of the Core Audit Process.

Thanks. Very useful.

Noted on the theme of questions ~— unfortunately these are not always under are control as these are questions being put by Freeths,
the postmasters' solicitors.

That said, are you 100% sure that there are no KELs in respect of the Core Audit Log? If so, we may say this to Freeths so to try to
avoid having to disclose the KELs.

Thanks

Andrew
As requested, please find below our answers to the 6 questions posed.

We would, however, like to first point out our concern regarding the underlying, erroneous, theme that these questions (and the
previous questions we've provided answers to you on) seem to be driving at. At the risk of sounding like a “broken record”, the
key premise of the HNG-X (and Horizon) system is the Core Audit Log. This comprises the only source of the “truth”. And to our
knowledge there has been no identified issues with the Core Audit Log and there are no KELs in respect of this log. To this end,
the questions regarding the existence or otherwise of issues with other elements of the system are, in our opinion, a distraction to
the key premise and could be used to create an erroneous view of HNG-X / Horizon. It is our view that a strong rebuttal is required
and a shift of focus from a view that we should somehow constantly need to “prove the negative” to a focus on the fact that the
Core Audit Log provides a true source of the data entered and transactions performed at the relevant terminals. Any subsequent

WBD_001006.000009
WBONO001136
WBON0001136

use of said data by the system does not impact on this “truth” and as such we often determine the existence or otherwise of errors

by reference to the Core Audit Log.

The answers (highlighted in yellow) to your questions are:

What format do these logs take and where are they held? The logs (referred to as the Known Error Log or “KEL”) are held on a

What level of detail is included within the logs (i.e. are they generic logs for all Horizon errors or linked to specific branches, do the
logs explain the consequences of the error and the fix which was applied, etc.)?

When did Fujitsu begin to maintain these logs and are they still maintained? ramen sae

Are the logs capable of being extracted and provided to us? Yes via excel data extract

Have Post Office previously been provided with a copy of these and, if so, to whom and when? We don’t believe Post Office has
ever asked for this before but it is available if required.

Has there been any correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu concerning these logs? I suspect loads— but it would be good to
just understand in high level terms how they are used.

Hope this helps

Hope you're well. Would you mind hoping with what is hopefully a quick query?

The solicitors for the postmasters have asked us to provide them with a copy of the 'known error logs' kept by Fujitsu and all
correspondence between Fujitsu and Post Office relating to the same. So we can respond to this request it would be appreciated if
you could confirm whether a Horizon "known error log" or a similar documents exist. We've not decided yet on whether to provide
this information (and so don't need any documents from you at this stage) — we're just trying to scope out what might be covered
by the request.

We would appreciate if you could help with the following:

What format do these logs take and where are they held?

What level of detail is included within the logs (i.e. are they generic logs for all Horizon errors or linked to specific branches, do the
logs explain the consequences of the error and the fix which was applied, etc)?

When did Fujitsu begin to maintain these logs and are they still maintained?
Are the logs capable of being extracted and provided to us?
Have Post Office previously been provided with a copy of these and, if so, to whom and when?

Has there been any correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu concerning these logs? I suspect loads — but it would be good to
just understand in high level terms how they are used.

I'm hoping that this questions are fairly easy to address but if they do need more careful thought, please let me know and we can
discuss how to tackle them.

If possible, a response by close of business on Wednesday would be useful.
Kind regards
