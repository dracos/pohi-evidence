Mike,

In response to your query;

The system is based on a user log in, and all actions have to be endorsed by the
user. POL cannot remotely control a branches system. Any technical changes by
Fujitsu that impact the system have to go through clearance processes which would
prevent any amendment to existing data. The independent audit file is in place and
can show all the system activity, down to a single keystroke, in a particular branch.

Thanks
Mike

Thanks .

Re the Lord/Misra case, can we quote POL as categorically stating that there
is no remote access to the system or to individual branch Horizon terminals
which would allow accounting records to be manipulated as JFSA claims?

Regards

Please find attached the details related to the three cases you have mentioned to us.

I have got some more generic material being cleared internally at the moment that I
am expecting to get across to you on Monday.
