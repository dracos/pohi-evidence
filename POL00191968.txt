Subject: REgular Call re Horizon Issues

John — following our con call earlier today, I set out below a draft email to go the various “Heads of” regarding a
weekly call during which any Horizon related issues can be raised within the wider business. Please let me know if
you have any comments.

Also, someone from Bond Dickinson should participate in the calls we have with Cartwright King so that our Criminal
law lawyers and Civil law lawyers are aware of what the other is doing. This will be especially important as further
Spot Reviews come in, which may raise issues relevant to the prosecutions Cartwright King are pursuing.

Kind regards, Rodric
BEGINS

All,
We are instigating a regular conference call during which issues with Horizon, user experience, and training and
support can be shared across and known to the various business units which use and rely on the system.

The calls will aim to ensure that Horizon issues are brought to the attention of user groups who might not be aware of
the issues, but whose use of Horizon may be affected by them.

To make sure we have all user groups covered, we need to have a representative from each of the following teams:

-  FSC/P&BA;
- Contracts;
- Security;

- IT;
- Legal (including our external firms);
-  NBSC

-  [[other]]

Please provide me with the name of a someone suitable to represent your team so that we can start holding the calls.
Please also let me know if there is anyone else you think should be represented on the call.

Kind regards, etc

ENDS
