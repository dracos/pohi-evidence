Notes:

‘The above calculations are based purely onthe cost ofthe activity to be used for scale reference of Central Operations workload. Ths therefore may not quanti into an effective saving elven the need to be able to scale upto increased workloads, as well as ablity to reduce headcount
If any headcount reductions are to be considered for inclusion in business cases, the relevant VR costs and PILON costs need to be considered, therefore this does not quantify asa saving

‘These costings cannot be included inthe business case as have not been piloted and tested for effective reduction, therefore approval has not been gained for materalising this saving

Business case savings cannot be included i not marerialsed and instead utlsed for other activites as there is no way of Kentification of this saving achievement and no budget changes
