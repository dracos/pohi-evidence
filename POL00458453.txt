Creating a great place to work for all... > Ib

Sustainability

Scanning the horizon whilst continuing to listen,
learn and deliver best in class. A consistent, reliable
offering across the whole colleague lifecycle.

Steadily building on the foundations to embed and improve. Building
confidence and trust in the People offering. Expanding our focus beyond the

basics and aiming for best in class.

3 Stages

Foundations

Assessing where we are and where we want to be — people, processes, technology, culture.
Starting where we are, using what we have, doing what we can to reinforce or build strong
foundations that will underpin our ambitions for the future. Narrowing our focus to ensure we get the

basics right first.
