Secure Support Role Definitions for SECURENT Build

Requirement Definition

BI3S90

The ACP requires that access to POA systems be controlled by the
use of pre defined roles to which users can be assigned. Such roles
will allow users to access only those parts of the system, with
associated tool sets, they need in order to complete the tasks
associated with that particular role. This document summarises the
requirements and defines the roles specifically engaged in support
activities, with associated objects, domains and access
requirements.

1 Introduction

The nature of the POA Horizon system requires that access to the counters and core
systems should be strictly controlled. [ACP] states that effective control depends on
having a clear definition of the roles and the responsibilities of all personnel who need
some form of access to the system. Users will gain access by being assigned to these
roles. This will be core to POA implementing the principles of least privilege as
described in [SFS]. POA will translate the human roles detailed in [ACP] into securely
configured roles, known as secure roles.

RS/REQ/022 defines the requirements for all POA human secure roles (except for
Support Roles) that access the POA data centre systems via an access point, which is
usually an NT workstation. These requirements are translated by IPDU Secure Builds
and IPDU PIT in order to generate a secure desktop for each role.

RS/REQ/023, this document defines the requirements of the human secure roles
involved with providing support of the POA Horizon solution. It describes for each of
the POA support groups the menus and tool sets required and the secure support
environment desktop access method used to connect to remote counters and data
centre systems.

2 Scope

This document only addresses the human user roles defined for use by the support
groups involved with supporting the POA Horizon solution systems. These support
roles are to be implemented as part of the POA central NT systems and access rights
assigned to cach role. Each support role specified within this document access
counters and the data centre NT systems through the POA NT Domain Structure
referenced in [9] and in accordance with the security configuration referenced in [10]
SMC and SMG support roles that authenticate in the SYSMAN domain are not
described in terms of their Secure Desktops. For these roles it is assumed that their
desktops include Terminal Server Client and that Terminal Server Client provides
these roles with access to the Secure Support Environment implemented within the
POA NT Domain Structure. Document reference [13] describes the configuration for
SYSMAN secure roles.

Non support roles used by SMC, SMG and Girobank are specifically excluded from
this document as they are authenticated on separate NT systems which form part of a
third party managed service. These roles are excluded from accessing the Secure
Support Environment.

This document does not describe the implementation or configuration of OpenSSH
components on the NT data centre systems or counters. This information is described
fully in reference [4].

3 Requirements

The requirement to implement a secure role based access control system emanates
from [ACP]. [ACP] further defines the roles that are required for access to the POA
Systems and the responsibilities of these roles.

Release BI3 Network Banking and release BI3S30 Debit Card System introduced
more stringent requirements regarding support access to counters and the data centre
NT systems. To satisfy these new requirements, a Secure Support Environment is
being introduced and as a result new user desktops and access mechanism are required
for the support groups. This document defines the new authentication processes,
desktops, and tool sets available to the support groups.

3.1 Affected Support Roles

The POA support roles affected by CP3283 are:
* PWYDCS\SSC Apps SUP

¢ PWYDCS\SSC Apps MAN

© PWYDCS\Operational MAN

e PWYDCS\Application SUP

In addition to the above two roles that authenticate in the SYSMAN third party
supplier domain are also affected. These two roles are:

e SYSMAN\SMC
e SYSMAN\MSS

3.2 New Support Roles

At Release BI3S55 a new privileged role is introduced for ADSL CHAP Password
Handling. See RS/DES/093 for more details concerning the use and procedures
associated with this new role. The role is named:

© PWYDCS\PWYLoad

At Release BI3S60 a new support role is introduced for Fujitsu Consulting staff who
will provide support for the new SAP financial system being introduced to the Horizon
data centres at BI3S60. This new will provide this group of support staff access to the
SAP Host via the SAS servers and SSH. The role is named:

e PWYDCS\SAPSUP

3.3. Redundant Support Roles

None of the existing support roles are made redundant.

3.4 New Change Proposals

CP3652: This CP requires additional support tool subsets to be added to the following
platforms:

e Counters

© Counters and Data Centre Servers

e SAS Servers
CP3653: This CP requires that Riposte be installed onto the six SAS servers.

CP4104: This CP specifies a new platform type, the Network Management
Workstation. A new support user, described in section 7.1.7, is required to administer
these platforms.

4 Implementation

For the POA support roles, each support role will be set up as a Secure Role. Secure
Roles will be mapped very tightly on to the Group concept within NT. Individual
users will be assigned to these Groups in which access to objects, domains, servers and
associated privileges will be controlled. Reference [10] describes in more detail the
rules and methods for applying Secure Roles onto the NT Group concept. These
Secure Roles are defined in Section 7.

Secure Roles use defined access points that have an accompanying Physical Platform
Design Specification (PPDS) document. Access to objects will be made available to
each role at the relevant access point. This document specifically covers the Secure
Support Roles accessing the data centres and counters

The definition of the Secure Support Roles is maintained in a spreadsheet by IPDU
Secure Builds, this spreadsheet is converted to produce automated NT command files.
These command files will be made available to ITU PIT. The command scripts will be
incorporated into the POA SECURENT build process and into the specific platform
configuration builds by ITU PIT for deployment into test and live estate environments.

Secure Support Roles, as defined in this document, will be implemented using
automated command scripts. By doing this, it will simplify the implementation and
maintenance of the roles.

Human user accounts created from the defined roles may only be members of one
Role/Group definition. This is required to ensure the user is only provided with one
appropriate tool set. Implementation of the menu structure for each Group will ensure
that users assigned to that Group will be able to access the application set necessary
for them to fulfil their duties.

4.1 NT Administrator User

The Windows NT operating system is provided with a super user known as the
‘Administrator’. This user has full administration and configuration privileges which is
exercised at both system/server and domain level. This capability cannot be removed
from Windows NT. POA recognises the power that this user has and the ability that a
human user, using the administrator user, has to interfere with the day to day operation
of the POA solution.

To address this issue, POA will limit and restrict the use of the NT Administrator User.
This will be achieved by:

> Renaming the Administrator User on all NT Servers so that it is hidden from the
system. The account name and password will be specified by the POA Security
Manager, which will be strictly controlled and stored in a secure safe.

> Restrict full administrator privileges to the “Operational Management’ role. Use of
this role will be subject to the management and procedural controls set out in the
“POA Code of Practice’, PA/STD/010.

4.2. TSadmin Role

CP3283 introduces a new administrator role known as TSadmin. This new role will be
responsible for day to day operations and administration of the PWYSAS domain and
the Secure Access Servers. The security configuration will be setup to prevent
PWYDCS roles from administering PWYSAS. PWYSAS\Administrator was
restricted from accessing the C:\ and D:\ drives in order to prevent any possibility of
tampering with the SSH log files. However this restriction has proved to be to
preventative of normal day to day system management tasks such as software
distribution and during Release BI3S60 the live estate was updated via OCPs. At
Release BI3S75 the SecureNT configuration files have been updated in line with these
OCPs. Security configuration for the TSAdmin role has not been changed and should
continue to be used for PWYSAS Domain and Server updates.

The TSadmin role will be allocated to senior Core Services NT staff and will be limited
to no more than three individuals at any one point in time. It is this role that will create
and manage the terminal server user accounts. These individual accounts will be
created from the pre-defined TS user templates. Each individual user will be mapped
to a TS profile and will have a defined user home directory. Customer Services
Security will be responsible for TSAdmin user accounts are allocated, created and
managed.

4.3. SSHadmin Role

This new role is introduced for the purpose of managing the configuration of the SSH
Client and SSH Server components. Like the TSadmin role, this new role will be
limited for use by senior Core Services NT staff and will be limited to no more than
three individuals at any one point in time. This role will only be able to administer the
Secure Shell configuration files. Only this human role will be granted access control
permissions greater than Read and Execute. Customer Services Security will be
responsible for SSHAdmin user accounts are allocated, created and managed.

4.4 PWYLoad Role

This is a special role introduced for use by the Customer Services Security
Management team. The purpose of the role is to load obfuscated passwords into the
CHAP Password database. The role accesses the CHAP Password database by logon
at Release BI3S55 at the BootLoader Server console. Once logged on, an executable
is called to provide a GUI interface that enables passwords to be loaded into the
database. At Release BI3S60 the role will also be able to logon at the ADSL Radius
Servers and FRIACO/Dialled Radius Servers console.

5 Support Role Users

5.1. PWYDCS Users

SSC support staff and Core Services operational management staff who access the
POA Horizon systems must have an individual user account registered in the
PWYDCS domain. Each user account is created from a pre-defined user template
which is described in Section 7 of this document. Associated with each NT user
account registered in PWYDCS is a SecurID Token and four digit PIN.

Existing support user accounts remain unchanged within the SSE. New support user
accounts will be created using the existing and current processes.

User templates exist for the following support roles:

e Users assigned to SSC Apps SUP role have user accounts created from user
template ‘zzSSC Apps Sup’

e Users assigned to SSC Apps MAN role have user accounts created from user
template ‘zzSSC Apps MAN’

e Users assigned to Operational MAN role have user accounts created from user
template ‘zzOPSMAN’

e Users assigned to Application SUP role have user accounts created from user
template ‘zzAPPSUP”

e Users assigned to SAPSUP role have user accounts created from user template
‘zzSAPSUP”

5.2 HUTHTIP, PDRTIP Users
Both HUTHTIP and PDRTIP domains which contain the Remote TIP Gateway
systems at Post Office sites are authentication domains. Both are configured with
identical support roles to those described for PWYDCS Users above. Access to these

remote domains/systems using SSHD will require support staff to login and
authenticate using user accounts created in the HUTHTIP and PDRTIP domains.

5.3. PWYKMS Users

TBA following input from POA CS Security Management team.

5.4 PWYCSM Users

TBA following input from Infrastructure Design.

5.5 SYSMAN Users
User accounts registered in this third party supplier managed domain must comply
with the security policies defined in [ACP].

From the requirements specified in CP3283 the following support roles from this
domain are relevant to the SSE:

e SMC
e MSS

5.6 Secure Access Server Users

Changes to the solution implementation mean that user templates and user accounts
are no longer required within the PWYSAS domain and Secure Access Servers.

5.7 Counter Access Users

CP3283 specifies that only the SSC support group will be granted access to counters
using SSE.

At the counter only a common/shared user account is required. SSH Client will
capture the logon username from the Terminal Server Client session and will record
this user name in the command log files that SSH Client generates. The user account
defined for the SSC support group is:

@  sussc

5.8 NT Data Centre System Access Users

Access to Data Centre NT systems will in the main be achieved by support staff
logging on via SSHD using their PWYDCS user account. Exceptions to this will be
HUTHTIP and PDRTIP remote TIP FTMS Gateway domains, PWYKMS and
PWYCSM domains. Access to these four domains will be achieved by using
equivalent user accounts created in these domains.

6 Support Authentication Process

6.1 Logon at Desktop

All support users that logon with a PWYDCS user account will specify their unique
username and associated password. The system will then prompt for SECURID logon
using their assigned PIN with the token value displayed at the time of logon.

The same logon and authentication process should be followed for all support users
who authenticate in the SYSMAN domain.

Once the identification and authentication process has completed the user is presented
with their usual desktop with an array of tools as specified in Section 7. One of the
tools available from this desktop is the Terminal Server Client. Executing the Terminal
Server Client tool will result in the system opening a new window at the workstation
that results from a connection to a Secure Access Server located in PWYSAS domain.
This new Terminal server window will display a prompt for a user name and password.
At Release BI3S30, Support Users can still access counters and NT data centre
systems using their pre BI3S30 desktops and tools. However from BI3S30 the only
approved and authorised support access method to counters and NT systems in the
PWYPUB and DCSSERV resource domains is via the Terminal Server/Secure Shell
access route.

6.2 Logon at SAS Terminal Server

At the Terminal Server window login prompt the support user should re-enter their
individual terminal server user account created in PWYDCS domain and its associated
password.

Successful logon will result in the SAS desktop being made available to the user.
From this desktop the Secure Shell Client (SSHC) will be available.

6.3. Logon to SSH Server

The user can invoke the SSHC by typing:
ssh —I <user name> <target-address>
where:

<user name> will equate to the support group users individual user account name
created in PWYDCS domain or the other authentication domains referred to in section
5 for NT data centre systems or user account sussc for counters.

<target-address> will equate to the IP address of the target counter or NT system.

Execution of the above causes the SSHC to make a connection with the SSH server
running on the target system. The user account specified will be authenticated at the
target-system and if successful a SSH session will be initiated. The SSHC will log

8 Support Tools

8.1 Tool Set Location and Access

The support tool set will be installed at the same location on all NT platforms.
The ‘root’ directory is known as:

e C:\Support

Underneath this directory is the following structure:
e C:\Support\Tools\Generic

¢  C:\Support\Tools\Generic\Cygwin

e C:\Support\Tools\Generic\Ntreskit

e C:\Support\Tools\Admin (only on Secure Access Servers)

As the directory names imply, Generic means that the tools are common and available
to all support groups. The Cygwin directory holds all the GNU tools generated and
delivered into PVCS by IPDU Estate Management Development team. The Ntreskit
directory holds all Windows NT resource kit utilities. These are made available to all
support groups.

In addition to the above ‘common’ directories, each support group will have a
dedicated directory to hold bespoke developed tools. The directories are:

e (C:\Support\Tools\SSCSUP
e C:\Support\Tools\SMCSUP
e C:\Support\Tools\SYSMANSUP.
e C:\Support\Tools\OPSMANSUP.
e C:\Support\Tools\SAPSUP

Each support group will be able to access tools located in their directory. They will
not be able to access the directories of the other support groups. All support group
access will be configured as Read and Execute. Only administrator privileged users
will be able to update the above directories and add further tools to the tool set.

8.5 Tools Available

A full list of the tools available is given in a table in Appendix A. This appendix will be
kept update as further tools are added in the future.

8.6 Updating the Tool Set

There are two situations in which the support tool set can be updated. These are
‘normal’ and ‘exceptional’ circumstances.

8.6.1 Normal Circumstances

This section gives a brief overview of the process that should be followed in normal
circumstances in order to add new tools to the tool set.

e The Support group identifies new tool(s).

e The Support group subject the tool(s) to local testing to ensure the tool(s) is/are fit
for purpose.

e The Support group raise a CP to introduce the new tool(s), indicating whether it
is/they are generic tool(s) or specific to the support group and identifying the
target release.

e POA development impacts the CP. If the CP is approved

e IPDU Secure Build update this document [RS/REQ/023] and publish on PVCS
review cycle.

e The Security TDA and POA Security Manager are both Approval Authorities. In
addition each Support group will also have an Approval Authority for this
document. The IPDU PIT Manager will also be an Approval Authority.

© Once this document has gained the necessary approval signatures, the IPDU PIT
Manager will authorise IPDU PIT to progress the updates necessary to add the
tool(s) to the tool set directories. IPDU Secure Build will adjust the security
configuration as necessary.

e The work packages are subjected to testing by IPDU System Test and on
completion of testing the new work packages are added to the SUPPORT TOOLS
platform configuration build for release to the live estate systems.

e The new tools are delivered and installed onto the NT platforms using Tivoli.

8.6.2 Exceptional Circumstances

There will always be emergency situations that will require new tools to be made
available urgently. At this point in time, no process for handling exceptional
circumstances has been identified. Simon Fawkes is leading the investigation into how
this situation will be dealt with and will identify the proposed solution once known.

8.7 Installation of Riposte on SAS Servers

CP3653 calls for the installation of Riposte and only installation onto all SAS servers.
Riposte will be installed in directory D:\RTOOLS.

9 Appendix A —- Support Tool Set

This appendix lists the GNU tools available as part of the Support Tools platform
Configuration SPBV. This SPBV is known as COMSECNT.

The following detail is associated with the table on the next page.

The tools identified in the table are located in directory:
C:\Support\Tools\Generic\Cygwin (on all platforms)

A ‘Yes’ in the following column indicates that the program is to be executable by
members of the support group, while ‘No’ indicates that permission to execute the
commands is not to be granted.

The commands shown in the table do not have the ‘.exe’ suffix. The ‘.exe’ suffix will
be present for all executables when delivered to PVCS and installed on the platform.

Selected and where required, security approved NT Resource kit utilities provided by
Microsoft at Release Supplement 4 are made available in directory:

C:\Support\Tools\Generic\NTreskit (on all platforms)

10 Appendix B — CP3815 Secure Signing Server Access

CP3815 introduces a standalone Signing Server for the purposes of signing PinPad Software
Updates. The new server will be introduced during Release BI3S60R. This server will be
located within the Secure Room at FELO1 operated by the POA CS Security Management
Team. After the relocation to BRAOI in 2005 the server will be located in an equivalent or
more secure environment. RS/DES/082 has been updated to define the new Server Name.

As the new Signing Server will be a standalone work group server, the usual Secure NT roles
will not be effective. Neither will SecurID authentication. The proposed solution for user and
support access is to create standard Windows NT user accounts for each individual who will
require access.

Users of the Signing Server will automatically be created and added to the Users built-in
group. These users will be provided with access to the floppy disc drive and CD-ROM/DVD-
ROM drive, having read and write access to all drive types. Therefore the floppylocker
service will not be required for the standalone server build.

Support access will be limited to Core Services Operational Management staff. User accounts
created for this group of staff will be added to the local machine administrators group and
therefore will be granted full administrator capability.

The audit policy must be configured to record all user log-on and log-off event records and
the Security Event Auditor will need to review the Security Event Log maintained by the
server on a regular basis following existing processes.
