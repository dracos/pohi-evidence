2. HIJ PROGRAMME

Assigned a named point of contact to help coordinate POL's HIJ improvement initiatives in
February 2021

Whilst the detail of the HU Programme was being formulated by POL and KPMG, Fujitsu pro-
actively created and shared a POL focussed “Postmaster First” improvements initiative to jointly
address several issues on 04 March 2021.

The POL HIJ Programme never really materialised as the Fujitsu “Postmaster First” actions were
taken forward and tracked with weekly calls with POL

involved

By August 2021 POL had associated actions to the PoaP so Fujitsu could interact. It was mostly
comparing RTQs to the initiatives POL had on its PoaP. IT was not a jointly planned and worked
programme by any conventional definition.

In summary Fujitsu drove the activity that created the following outcomes:

1. Supported POL/KPMG to validate and test that the 29 BEDs were remediated

2. Proposed improvements to Incident and Problem classification to enable better reporting
(POL did not respond to final action list shared)

3. Supported POL to take the Chair of what was HKERF and what was now HDR Forum —
including defining a ToR

. Integrated CBIF with HDR in August 2021 to consolidate views of defects (See HDR below)

5. Enhanced the ARQ data sharing process with digital signing and encryption under CWO0426

leading to CCN1723a

6. Ran numerous Deep Dive sessions with POL and Fujitsu SMEs on POL selected subjects to
enhance POL/KPMG understanding of various parts of HNG-X

7. Refined the documentation of the process for granting the APPSUP role and how the
approvals and evidence of actions would be recorded. The processes around the temporary
granting of the APPSUP role were defined in Fujitsu's “Horizon Data Changes Process Work
Instruction” [SVM/SDM/PRO/4293]. POL has its own internal process document for Horizon
Data Change which Fujitsu understands is titled "Horizon Support Approval Process vx.x"
(latest version not known by Fujitsu)

8. Decommissioned the Transaction Correction Tool on 13 May 2021 under R21.51

9. Introduced weekly reporting of PAM administrator accounts for POL to review

10. Supported POL high-level discussions on its intentions to create a UAT process

11, Reviewed and contributed to POL planning around its test strategy, test policy and
regression testing approach (see TESTING)

12. Supported POL in its thinking of its new governance model and the value and relevance of
the many meetings being held between POL and Fujitsu

13. Offered guidance and teaching sessions on POL reconciliation actions (POL never responded)

14. Supported POL to take action on some of its selected “Pain Point Catalogue” action items

3. HORIZON DEFECTS REVIEW (HDR) — formerly HKERF — Branch
Affecting defects

In 2018, Fujitsu introduced internal weekly review of any new Knowledge Base Articles that
could potentially refer to defects to ensure a Peak/Incident was in place if needed and POL
notification of the Peak was provided where branch impacting. This fed into the Horizon Known
Error Review Forum (HKERF)

Fujitsu introduced a weekly HKERF in late 2018 to provide POL with early visibility of branch
affecting defects

POL considered ending this in 2019 (Martin Godbold)

POL had created it’s own ToR for the meeting it did not chair (back in September 2020), and
Fujitsu had created a ToR for the meeting it chaired. The 2 ToRs were not mutually agreed and
were different

POL requested transfer of chairmanship to POL in Q1 2021 with a new name HDR -— started
February 2021. Fujitsu agreed

The HDR meeting scope includes Fujitsu defects and defects from other parties so Fujitsu does
not attend the whole meeting and the minutes POL issued initially did not differentiate between
the Fujitsu defects and others so Fujitsu was unable to accept the minutes from POL

May/June 2021 the ToR for HDR was updated and the interaction formalised — critically, this
included an agreed definition of a Live Defect

POL did not seek to ‘sign off’ the ToR instead assuming its acceptance — which was reasonable as
Fujitsu had co-authored it — but not formal

In November 2021 Fujitsu proposed a new format for the HDR minutes that would allow Fujitsu
to sign off on them. This included a recommendation that the weekly meeting started with an
agreement of the minutes — POL agreed

TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

Fujitsu proposed and introduced a target dataset for defect notification to POL and implemented
it in November 2021 after receiving POL acceptance. This was added into v2.3 of the HDR ToR.
This saw many new attributes captured and shared: release dates; release numbers;
screenshots; description of workarounds; and many fields describing the defect to help POL
understand and prepare postmaster comms

In January 2022 Fujitsu amended the ToR to reflect all recent changes to ways of working (v2.3)
and proposed to POL that this version is formally signed off. It was jointly signed off 04 February
2023

In August 2023 POL offered a v3.3 where they had removed the word DEFECT and changed it to
Problem. Problem is a contract defined term and we responded with various points suggesting
this was not a good idea. The discussion is ongoing

M

FW_ Branch
Impacting Problems
In May/June 2021, based on the agreed definition, POA made numerous changes to Peak to
enable better tracking and reporting of Live Defects using system driven approaches. This built
upon the existing method as described in the “BED Current Process” audit report and was
followed by various account wide cascades of the desired ways of working. In simple terms, if an
Incident is raised for an issue that appears inconsistent with the agreed design or service
specification it must be recorded in Peak with a specific ## tag applied. If, in addition, there is a
possibility that the issue could be affecting live branches then it gets a second HDR tag. This
drives all reporting and the various other meta data helps clarify the progress being made
HDR reporting included all Deferred Defects (approved at a release closure meeting with POL)
and major project defects (e.g. PBS) which are also discussed in project steering groups. This was
to ensure POL’s defect team had a complete view of all HDR defects regardless of source as the
release sign off attendees and project/programme managers were not feeding defects to the
POL defect team. All reporting has included all branch affecting defects since the very start
Fujitsu has been attending the weekly Monday HDR meetings since they started in June 2021
and provides a HDR Defects Update Report on the prior Friday.

TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

In August-November 2022 a full review of all KBAs was completed to ensure that any defects
were in fact also held in Peak and hence subject to all the tracking, reporting, updating and
controls embedded into the systems and processes. KBAs are NOT where POA records Defects,
that is done in Peak. There were very few amendments need to Peak and the exercise ensured
Peak was the master system

The KBA review did identify that there were defects that Fujitsu had not been asked to fix. To
bring these into the Defect reporting, a new category of Accepted Live Defect was created and
added to the reporting so it was visible to POL and could be discussed jointly. This was
implemented in November 2022 and communicated to POL 02 December 2022. It has been on
our reports ever since

4. ALL LIVE DEFECT MANAGEMENT

POA defined a role for a Defect/Quality Manager and identified an internal candidate who took
the role from 01 January 2022

February 2022 — POA introduced Live Defect monthly reporting to the POA Business Review pack
February 2022 — POA introduced Live Defect monthly reporting to all POA stack managers
August 2022 — Fujitsu implemented fortnightly reporting to POL of ALL HNG-X Live Defects.
Fujitsu had initially proposed and presented this to POL in December 2021, which led to a joint
follow up January 2022, a sample report shared with POL February 2022 for their consideration,
and then it went quiet. Fujitsu reminded POL in July 2022 and following further joint discussions
Fujitsu launched the fortnightly reporting on 05 August 2022 and it remains in place

5. PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT IMPROVEMENTS
Q2 2021 — Reviewed assignments of user accounts with elevated administrator privileges and
rationalised it from 56 to 34
May 2021 — Introduced additional weekly reporting for POL on PAM administrator account
status. This is also now part of the monthly SecOps report to POL
Enhanced the monthly PAM verification processes to record more evidence of actions taken —
updates applied to SVM/SDM/PRO/0012

o March 2023 — Further enhanced to include an approval step and a verification step

where a member of the POA Leadership Team must be included

November 2021 — introduced monthly SecOps reporting of all releases of “breakglass” accounts
by POA SecOps — mentioned in RTQSR0003429 and offered by Fujitsu
November 2021 — introduced monthly SecOps reporting of checks done to validate failed remote
connections to the Horizon SSNs (Login failures)— mentioned in RTQSRO003429 and offered by
Fujitsu. Suspended reporting from September 2022 to February 2023 due to identifying a data
issue affecting reporting — checking was still being done
Q4 2021 Fujitsu commissioned its ECS team to do a review of PAM accounts and activity. This
concluded in December 2021 with a series of recommendations

TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

Q1/Q2 2022 Fujitsu commissioned ECS to remediate all PAM account findings

Q3 2022 POA SecOps implemented a Privileged Account Register to hold details of all privileged
and shared accounts

Q3 2022 POA implemented a Privileged Account Policy including a revised Password Policy and
stating a range of controls that were to be assessed per privileged account

Q4 2022/Q1 2023 POA SecOps updated the Privileged Account Register to record the compliance
of all accounts to the stated controls implemented

P2831 — Fujitsu changed all non-BRDB default privileges for SSC support staff to be read only by
default with validated logging when rights escalated to WRITE to perform approved changes
(e.g. contractual tasks such as reconciliation and OBC, or other POL pre-approved system fixes as
documented in the Horizon Data Change work instruction). The CP also ensured ALL human
actions taken against the non-BRDB databases were fully logged and written to the Audit
Archive. Implemented December 2022 under R36.50

19 March 2023 — under R40.50 - CP2876 — Fujitsu refined the auditing of all human database
actions to include the BRDB

July 2023 — under R38.51, Fujitsu implemented a GPO change to enable enforcing of iKey (Multi-
Factor Authentication) of all staff — importantly including system administrators who had always
been exempt to facilitate remote support

6. ENQUIRY SUPPORT for POL

July 2021 — Introduced a simple enquiry mailbox for POL and its legal representatives and
assigned a multi-skilled team to be available to review and actions (PO.Enquiries@ and the
channels we proposed prior to this)

Offered to work with POL to check it is using all of the Horizon content it has access to to best
support an inquiry from a postmaster. Interactions ongoing with POL actions frequently being
the cause of the delays/lack of pace

Supported POL’s Investigations team to identify a series of new requirements to improve their
processes (CW00474) which led to changes being made under CWO0562

7. APPSUP

18 October 2016 18:00 — Removed the default privilege APPSUP on BRDB under MSC
043J0451867 and made it an on-demand and approved controlled allocation of temporary rights
APPSUP is not used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions.
Corrections relating to branch balance discrepancies are performed by POL using the POL
Transaction Correction Process. APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock
unit associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). This is
documented in the Horizon Data Change work instruction. Some APPSUP actions can indirectly
lead to a balance impact (such as deleting a corrupt recovery message that is causing a logon
loop). Where an action being taken by Fujitsu using APPSUP could lead to a balance impact, it is
POL that decide if any balance discrepancy correction is required with the branch and it is POL

that take any corrective action required.
© Note: APPSUP can be used to correct branch balance discrepancies and to amend financial
transactions but a decision was made, but not documented or dated, that Fujitsu would NOT use the

privilege to do this. A note is being added to any current work instructions and KBAs to ensure it is
clearly stated that we do not use APPSUP for that purpose and that that has been the case for many
years
Implemented a new jointly defined and agreed process for APPSUP usage in May 2021 (Horizon
Data Change process) that ensures a new POL approval process can be integrated and evidence
of action taken provided. This document also describes all scenarios under which Fujitsu may be

required to amend live data

8. COUNTER ACCESS RIGHTS and ACCESS

October 2021 — Fujitsu sent a recommendation to POL to work with CC to ensure that Fujitsu
privileges using the CSASSH account used when connecting to counters for remote support
purposes has Least Privilege (READ ONLY level capabilities) and CANNOT affect counter
operations — as described in REQ/SIR/SRS/2605. In Q4 2022 POL commissioned Fujitsu to test a
solution proposed by their new EUC provider DXC. This concluded successfully in December
2022. POL then rolled out this least privilege change with DXC in January and February 2023. This
now affirms that Fujitsu support staff cannot make changes to live counters

April 2022 — under CWO0574 Fujitsu implemented weekly reporting of all remote counter access
made by Fujitsu specialist support staff to branch counters. This showed the command executed
and the result

9. FUJITSU SYSTEMS

13 May 2021 (CW00425) — Fujitsu fully decommissioned the Transaction Correction Tool with
POL involvement throughout. Done under Release 21.51

R72.10 (CP2774) — Fujitsu fully decommissioned the misleadingly named Fujitsu Keylogger which
was partially implemented to help Computacenter resolve issues with hardware peripherals

10. RISK MANAGEMENT
January 2020 - POA continued to make internal process improvements to the account risk
management processes and platform to ensure greater alignment and clearer action tracking
across all areas

o APOA monthly Risk Meeting was initiated in January 2020 for all senior managers to

require quality and risk posture

May 2020 — POA enhanced risk management with POL - expanding it to cover all domains and
providing a monthly report. This is discussed at ISMF and SMR and an overview check is
performed by the POA risk load and the POL risk lead at a monthly joint risk review meeting
Security risks are routinely reviewed and action plans (where viable) have been created for ALL
risks — jointly — and this is reviewed monthly as each risk review date occurs

11. ARQ

October 2022 — Digitised the delivery of ARQ responses. This was done under CWO0426 and was
extremely delayed by POL procuring, installing and configuring the required desktop PGP
software. The project started in April 2021

e Added 35 heads in October 2020 to better support POL in its change aspirations predominantly
to build capacity to deliver the PBS and BEX critical strategic projects as well as recruited
specialists to aid the transition to a hybrid delivery model

* ASM was introduced in 2018 to enable POL to prioritise the utilisation of 4" line resource on
project work over lower priority BAU work.

« A Weekly Priority Meeting was requested by Fujitsu and introduced in April 2019 to enable
POL to share its priorities — face to face — so Fujitsu could be clear on the context and ask
questions to avoid any confusion from emails, meetings, and other ad-hoc discussions

© Additionally this helps POL stakeholders to be aware of the breadth of activities that
Fujitsu are undertaking.

20. TESTING (check with Graham)

Fujitsu assisted POL to confirm that all 62 issues comprising the 29 BEDs cited in the Horizon
Issues were closed. This was successful
«With the appointment of a new POL Head of Test we have introduced a more collaborative
approach to testing. Each release now has a joint test team POL/Fujitsu/Any appropriate 3rd
party to discuss/agree scope of activities for the changes under test.
© Good examples of this were the 29 BED testing, PRE-PAID MI and Computacenter
Data Centre migration where we worked closely with POL Test / Accenture / KPMG /
CC to complete these activities
e We have contributed to the Post Office Test Strategy, Test Policy and Regression testing
approach to help shape testing process at all levels
* We made many recommendations in the TESTING & QA REPORT as part of the Horizon Audit
