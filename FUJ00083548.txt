events _221328c3.zip

Mark / Brian,

I've had a look at this event log and | don't think there is anything really to worry about. Migration appears to have completed OK and
the outlet is running fine on Cl4.

I've seen a number of "verification failures" during migration before and | believe that they are to be expected during the various loads
of Riposte before the counter reboot.

However | am curious as to why we get the 3 errors mentioned in the PinICL. They occur at 20:26 on 9/11/00. All are identical: Facility
MessageProcessor (11); Error 94 "An error occurred while attempting to destroy a checkpoint run. Timeout occurred waiting for lock.
(0xC 1090003)". They seem to occur during the Riposte index rebuild immediately after the migration of the "real" message store. |
assume that they are benign, but would appreciate confirmation from Mark before closing the PinICL.

While | was looking at the event log | also noticed a number of other errors which hopefully Brian can explain. On a number of nights
after migration (6 out of 9), there is an Error from DesktopShutdown for facility 1, Error 4 "Error Message: Failed to create the Desktop
object while trying to bring down Desktop. Therefore we killed the process directly.". Each time it is put out as part of the ClearDesk
closedown function. ClearDesk continues OK, so again it isn't serious, but we need to avoid any errors being generated at the counter
as part of ClearDesk (since they cost Pathway 3p each for a ‘phone call!). Have you seen this before Brian? Any idea what it means?
Should this be passed to Kevin (we can always get a separate PinICL raised if it helps)? | couldn't find a KEL on it. John: is there a
separate PinICL or a KEL on this one?

| attach the event log in .xls format (zipped) and will assign the PinICL to me on Escher-Dev until | get feedback from you both.
Regards
Gareth
