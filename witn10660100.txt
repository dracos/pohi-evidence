                   FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF SIR MICHAEL
                                HODGKINSON



 I, Sir Michael Hodgkinson, will say as follows...



 INTRODUCTION



1. I held the position of senior non-executive director of Royal Mail Holdings Plc ("RMH")

  from 1 January 2003 until 31 August 2007. Between May 2003 and March 2007, I

  was the chairman of Post Office Ltd ("POL").



2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry with

  the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 14 December 2022 (the

  "Request").



3. The matters set out in the Request date back a number of years (up to 21 years

   ago) and my recollection of that period is affected as a result. I am now 79 years

   old and I have not had any involvement with the RMH or POL since I left in

    2007, almost 17 years ago.



4. My lack of recollection has unfortunately not been assisted by the limited

   disclosure of relevant documents and information. I have made a number of

   requests for further disclosure from those representing POL, to assist me in

   addressing the matters set out in the Request, but I have been informed that,

   due to the passage of time, limited information is now available.



5. 1 have been assisted in preparing this witness statement by Kingsley Napley

   LLP.



 BACKGROUND



6. - I have been asked to set out a summary of my career:



   6.1. In 1965, 1 graduated from Nottingham University with a degree in Industrial

          Economics and joined the Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst. I

          qualified as a Cost and Management Accountant whilst at Ford. In 1969, I

          joined the British Leyland Group as a financial analyst and progressed

          through the company, being appointed in 1978 to be Managing Director of a

          newly formed company: Land Rover Ltd. In this role, I was responsible for

          the Land Rover and Range Rover product lines,



   6.2. In 1983, I joined the Grand Metropolitan Group, initially responsible for a

          major section of the Brewing Division, and eventually becoming Chief



                                   Page 2 of 27
                                                                                             WITN10660100
                                                                                       W ITN 10660100




           Executive Officer of the European Food Division.



     6.3. In 1992, I joined BAA Pic, as Group Airports Director, where I was

          responsible for the day to day operation of the airports. I became Chief

          Executive Officer in 1999, before retiring in June 2003.



7. In the autumn of 2002, 1 was asked if I would be interested in joining RMH as a

    senior non-executive director, because it was starting a major transformation in

    preparation for privatisation. In addition, I was asked if I would take on the role of

    chairman of POL. It was anticipated that when RMH was privatised, POL would

    remain a government owned business, and would eventually require its own

    corporate governance processes. I believe that my history of working closely

    with government in the airport sector, and working alongside strong trade unions

    in the car industry, was probably why I was approached. However, I made it

   clear that I was unable to take on the role as chairman of POL until June 2003,

   due to my existing commitments. I set out more detail about my roles with POL

   and RMH later in this statement.



8. 1 was informed that my role on the RMH board and my role as chairman of POL

   (combined) would require two days per week of my time, which was possible

   alongside my other commitments. In the event that RMH was privatised, it was

   envisaged that I would spend all of that time working for POL.



9. I have been asked to set out what other jobs, roles or directorships I held at this

   time. These were as follows: -

                                                                                     WITN10660100




    9.1. Non-Executive Director at FKI plc (until July 2008).



    9.2. Board member of Transport for London and Chairman of the Finance

          Committee (2001 — 2012).



    9.3. Non-Executive Director of First Choice Holidays, which subsequently

          became TUI Travel (January 2004, becoming Chairman in March 2004, and

         then Deputy Chairman of TUI Travel in 2007 until 2018).



    9.4. Non-Executive Director of Dublin Airport (2004 — 2010).



    9.5. The POL nominated director on the board of the Bank of Ireland (May 2004

         until July 2006). This role was a direct result of my position as a director on

         the board of POL.



10.1 stepped down as chairman of POL in March 2007. It was clear that the

   privatisation of RMH would not be taking place in the foreseeable future, and

   that POL would therefore remain in the Holdings Group (i.e. Royal Mail Holdings

   Plc; POL; Royal Mail Group Ltd; Parcel Force Worldwide; and General Logistic

   Systems B.V.) and so did not need an independent chairman. It was also at a

   time when we had achieved the immediate tasks which were required of the

   POL board, for example: network rationalisation, introduction of financial

   services, and agreement of a strategy for government funding. With recruitment

  of a new CEO, we also had a stable board. There was also a lot of discussion

  about the increase in the parcel business at that time and the benefit which POL

                                                                                       WITN10660100




    could offer to Royal Mail Group Ltd as a result. It was therefore believed that

    greater coordination between the companies would be beneficial.



11.1 had intended to resign from the board of RMH in May 2007, but this was

   delayed until August 2007, due to a delay in obtaining the necessary legal

   consent from the Secretary of State.



12.1 have been asked to provide an overview of my professional career since

   leaving POL and RMH: I continued my work With First Choice, which

   subsequently became TUI Travel. I stayed with TUI Travel until 2018. 1

   continued with Transport for London until 2012, becoming their representative

   on the Crossrail Board in 2008. Between 2009 and 2018, 1 was an advisor to

   the West Midlands Council on their share of Birmingham Airport. Between 2014

   and 2019, 1 was Chairman of Keolis UK Ltd. Since 2014, 1 have been working for

   Canadian Government central pension fund PSP, as their advisor to their airport

   infrastructure fund. I am also one of their board directors for Budapest airport.



 ROLE AT RMH AND POL



13. When I joined, RMH was a public limited company, wholly owned by the

   Government. It had four main subdivisions:



   13.1. POL;



   13.2. Royal Mail Group Ltd;



                                   Page 5 of 27
                                                                                          WITN10660100
                                                                                        WITN10660100




    13.3. Parcel Force Worldwide; and



    13.4. General Logistic Systems B.V (GLS).



14.1 had no involvement with Royal Mail Group Ltd, Parcel Force Worldwide or the

   General Logistic Systems B.V, other than as a non-executive director of RMN.



15.1 have been asked to summarise my views on the responsibilities of a board of

   directors in the operation of a company solely owned by government. In my

   view, the responsibilities of a board are to oversee the management of the

   company, to develop and approve a corporate strategy that reflects the goals

   agreed with the Government shareholder, to ensure that the board consists of

   the right quality of directors to deliver that strategy, and to make sure that the

   financial statements are accurate and represent true and fair view of the
                                                      a




   company's activities. This is similar to the responsibilities of any board.



16. The main difference for a board of a company solely owned by the Government

   is that there is a political dimension to the company's work. For example, Post

   Offices have an important role to play in society and government has a

   responsibility to ensure that people are connected to the postal system, even if

   they live in rural areas of the United Kingdom. The rural Post Offices would

   often be unprofitable, but the Government would provide the additional funding

   to ensure that the Post Offices remained in place and could continue to operate.

  From recollection, POL. liaised with the Government about the number of Post



                                    Page 6 of 27
                                                                                      W I TN10660100
                                                                                     WITN10660100




    Offices; this was a discussion about the relationship between society's access

    and the costs associated with keeping the branches open, as this required

    government funding.



17. To the best of my recollection, in the period between June 2003 and January

   2004, I was spending approximately three days a week working for RMH and

   POL. This subsequently reduced to two days. I was initially spending time

   getting to know the people and the business. This period gave me a good

   understanding of how best I could use my time and add value going forward.



   iI:   iTj•



18.1 joined the board as a senior non-executive director. There were a number of

   non-executive directors who were recruited to join the RMH board at the same

   time as me. I understood that this recruitment drive was with privatisation in

   mind, which was anticipated to happen in the next few years. If this happened, I

   was going to move away from RMH and retain my role as chairman of POL.



19. When I joined, RMH had an established and conventional company board —

   there was a chairman, a senior non-executive director, non-executive directors,

   and representatives from the sub divisions. The structure was mature but many

   of the board members were new.



20. I would regularly attend board meetings, which I believe were every month. A

   board pack would be provided in advance containing various papers and other



                                   Page 7 of 27
                                                                                             WITN10660100
                                                                                         WITN10660100




    information. I cannot recall how this information was received. In addition, I

    cannot recall who set the agenda or the names of those who regularly attended.

    In my view it operated as a normal board would.



21. Whilst I cannot recall all of the details of the board meetings I attended, I do

    recall the themes. I recall that the there was a focus on staff engagement, and

    the connected idea of share options for the staff. We were also focused on the

    need for investment, in order to fund the upgrading of processes throughout the

    business. The problem of the pension fund deficit was a regular item for

    discussion. We also focused on improving the communication with the staff.



22. The board had sub-committees (such as audit, compliance and risk), which had

    delegated responsibility and reported to it. I cannot recall any details about their

   membership and I do not have a copy of the terms of reference.



23.I believe I was chair of the corporate and social responsibility governance

   committee and on the board of the remuneration sub-committee. I was also the

   chair of the health and safety subcommittee, although I do not recall whether this

   was formally linked to the board. As above, I cannot recall any details about

   these committees.



24. In addition to attending board meetings, I recall that I visited several of the sites,

   spoke to the staff, and also did a post round.



25.1 have been asked to summarise the level of IT experience of those attending



                                     Page 8 of 27

    the RMH board. I do not know the answer to this question.




26. When I joined POL, it was facing a serious decline in its traditional businesses

    and had just embarked on its own transformation. The transformation included

   reducing the number of Post Office branches, introducing new financial service

   products, and developing a viable future strategy that would be accepted by the

   Government. As stated above, RMH was considering privatisation at some

   stage, which would eventually require POL to establish its own corporate

   governance committees and procedures. The aforementioned was a significant

   amount of change for the organisation.



27. My role as chairman was to make sure that everyone was working together, and

   to help support the executive team (the CEO, the COO, the Sales and Marketing

   Director, the Finance Director, and the IT Director) to run their business. During

   my tenure, the executive team of POL was a very accomplished and capable

   team, who had a lot of experience in their respective roles. I would like to think

   my leadership style was collaborative and open.



28. When I joined, there were several short-term aims:



   28.1. To make sure that the network rationalisation and rural strategy was agreed

         with government and in place;




                                   Page 9 of 27
                                                                                         WITN10660100
                                                                                       WITN10660100




    28.2. To introduce the new financial services, which were crucial to the future of

          the company's finances;



    28.3. To improve cost efficiency; and



    28.4. To ensure that we had the right quality of people on the board going

         forwards.



29. The longer-term goals were to ensure POL was ready to introduce a classic

   corporate governance structure and to create a conventional board for when

   RMH was privatised. We also needed to develop a strategy which the

   Government would be able to fund going forwards.



30. Due to the passage of time, I do not specifically recall how regularly our board

   meetings were held. Whilst I do not recall any details of what was discussed, I

   do recall that I would meet with the CEO in advance of a board meeting and

   decide the agenda. Various attendees would prepare written reports in advance

   for the meeting. The meetings were attended by the executive team, non-

   executive directors, the company secretary and others who had an issue to

   speak to in that particular meeting. If a member of the executive team could not

   attend, they would generally delegate any report for the board to another person

   if possible. There would be various action points agreed during the meetings.

   ideally liked to focus a third of our meetings on future strategy.



31. When I started as chairman, POL`s corporate governance relied on the



                                    Page 10 of 27
                                                                                         WITN10660100
                                                                                     WITN10660100




   governance structure of RMH. From recollection, it was not a very developed

   board, mostly consisting of the executive team with no independent non-

   executive directors (until the arrival of Brian Goggin in September 2004, and

   Alan Cook in February 2005). POL did not have any of its own subcommittees

   which reported to the board until I introduced the risk and compliance committee,

   so it would instead rely on the subcommittees of the RMH. This is not unusual

   for a subsidiary company, and I thought the corporate structure was adequate to

   fulfil its responsibilities.



32.1 introduced a risk and compliance committee because the board was conscious

   that it would need to have greater corporate governance measures in place with

   the progression into the financial market, specifically because of the risk of mis-

   selling financial products. I do not now have the terms of reference for this sub-

   committee but, from the documents provided with the Request, I can see that the

   aim of this group was to have oversight over audit, legal, anti-money laundering,

  and crime and fraud matters [see POL. Board Minutes dated 15 December 2004

    POL00021486]. The documents provided also show that the group was set up

  during the latter half of 2004 and that the meetings were held quarterly. The

  Finance Director was a permanent member but I do not recall the full

  membership details. Due to the passage of time, I have no substantive

  recollection of the details discussed in these meetings. I have recently been

  provided with copies of six risk and compliance committee minutes [5 January

  2005 - P0L00021416; 6 April 2005 - P0L00021417; 29 September 2005 -

  P01.00021418; 8 November 2005 - POL00021419; 22 March 2006 -

  POL00021420; 6 September 2006 - POL00021421] and, whilst they are not a

    complete set, they show that there were team updates about matters such as,

    branch audits and inspections, AML and regulatory compliance, the Financial

   Services Authority (as it then was), internal crime and IMPACT (which I deal with

    below). With privatisation of RMH, further committees would eventually be

    required.



33. From approximately 2006 onwards, I believe I was also chair of the sales and

   marketing committee. This committee was created with the aim of improving

   sales after the introduction of the financial services products. I am not sure if the

   committee was formally linked to the board.



34. Whilst my memory is limited, I do recall that a significant amount of the board's

   time was taken up dealing with the following —



    34.1. The solvency of POL.



    34.2. The move towards financial services.



          34.2.1.   As POL was making a loss, the move towards financial services

          was a very important part of the strategy, as it was hoped that this would

          significantly improve the financial position of the company.



          34.2.2.   As part of the move into financial services, the board was

          required to evaluate various bids from different financial services partners.

          After consideration, we awarded the bid to the Bank of Ireland. This

       and vice versa. I was asked, by the Bank of Ireland, to take on this role on

       behalf of POL.



       34.2.3.   We particularly focused on travel products, such as foreign

       exchange and travel insurance, because of my background and

       knowledge of this industry.



       34.2.4.   We identified the need for an additional non-executive director to

       join the board, who had financial services expertise. Alan Cook was

       subsequently identified for this role, which we deal with further below.



34.3. The Rural Strategy — as discussed above, decisions about the accessibility

     and availability of the Post Office network.



34.4_ Rationalisation of the Post Office network, which was a combination of

     reducing costs and increasing the footfall for the remaining outlets.



34.5. General cost reduction, and plans to minimise the losses of the 'Crown'

     post offices.



34.6. Horizon, which I discuss later in my statement.



34.7. The replacement of the old-fashioned          Office books, with a card
                                             Post




     account.

      34.7.1.    This required a lot of work and was successfully implemented,

      only for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to say that they

      would stop using the Post Office card account and introduce their own

      card. Eventually, a few years later, the DWP did start using a combined

      card account with the Post Office.



34.8. The replacement of the CEO.



      34.8.1.   In approximately summer 2004, David Mills, the CEO of POL,

      said he would probably retire by the end of December 2005. Finding a

      suitable replacement CEO is a very important job for the chairman, and it

      was a challenging task at that time. In my view, we needed someone with

      substantial financial services experience and a close relationship with the

      Government. The pool of candidates was further reduced by the fact that

      it was a role in the public sector.



     34.8.2.    Alan Cook was highlighted to us as a potential suitable

     candidate as a short term non-executive director, and a possible

     replacement as CEO because of his close relationship with the

     Government in his job as CEO of National Savings & Investments and

     because of his extensive financial services experience. Alan Cook joined

     as a non-executive director of POL in February 2005, and later agreed to

     consider the position of CEO after getting to know the people and the

     organisation in general. Fortunately, Alan Cook decided quite quickly that



                               Page 14 of 27
                                                                                        WITN10660100
                                                                                      WITN10660100




           he would like to be considered as the next CEO, so we started the very

           lengthy process to get him approved by Department of Trade and

           Industry. I do not recall why this process took so long, but he started as

           CEO in March 2006.



35. The recruitment of Alan Cook, and the other tasks outlined above, were

   significant undertakings for the board at that time.



36.1 have been asked about the level of technical IT expertise of those attending the

   board. I cannot answer this question other than to say that an IT Director was a

   member of the board.



Oversight by the Boards



37.1 have been asked to address various questions about the areas the boards of

   POL and RMH had oversight over and the extent of that oversight, if any.



38. In respect of POL, my recollection is as follows:



    38.1. the legal department: I do not believe the board had direct oversight or

         involvement with the legal department and I do not recall the structure of

         the legal team. This was the ultimate responsibility of the CEO and COO.

         The level of involvement of a board with a legal department varies from

         company to company. I do not recall that we received a list of individual

         ongoing cases; however, I would expect the board to be made aware of



                                    Page 15 of 27
                                                                                     WITN10660100
                                                                                  WITN10660100




     non-routine civil litigation or criminal prosecutions brought by POL (i.e.

     cases which had the potential of impacting the company financially or

     reputationally).



38.2. investigation and prosecutions of SPMs for theft, fraud and false accounting

     for alleged shortfalls in branch accounts: the risk and compliance committee

     would have had some general oversight of investigations and prosecutions

     of SPMs generally but I really cannot recall the details. I was certainly not

     aware that there was any systemic issue with Horizon.



38.3. pursuit of SPMs for the recovery of alleged shortfalls in branch accounts,

     including through civil proceedings: again the risk and compliance

     committee might have had some general oversight over the civil recovery of

     money from SPMs generally but I really cannot recall the details. Again, I

     was certainly not aware that there was any systemic issue with Horizon.



38.4. company compliance with the Race Relations Act 1978: From my

     recollection the board did have oversight of the company-wide policy of

     non-discrimination. I can see references to diversity training in the

     documents provided with the Request. My assumption is that the training

     also addressed racial discrimination, and that the training was provided to

     ensure that the company and its employees were compliant with the

     company wide policy and legislation. We also received updates from

     human resources about the same. I cannot recall any breaches being

     raised with the board.



                               Page 16 of 27
                                                                                        WITN10660100
                                                                                      WITN10660100




    38.5. IT department: the board had some oversight, as the executive team

          included an IT director. The IT director was responsible for updating the

          board in relation to IT projects and other IT related matters.



    38.6. security and/or the investigation department: the risk and compliance

          committee might have had some oversight but I cannot recall the details. I

          can recall occasionally being asked to approve the funding of additional

          security for post offices who were at risk of burglary.



    38.7. the accounting system used to collate individual transactions, cash and

         stock declarations etc, used for preparing management and statutory

         accounts: the board had some oversight, as the executive team included a

         finance director. The finance director was responsible for updating the

         board in relation to these matters. They were also assisted by the auditors,

         who reviewed the accounts half yearly. I would have expected any

         discrepancy to be reported to the board. I do not recall this happening.



    38.8. problem management team: I have no recollection of this team.



39. In respect of RMH, my recollection is that the oversight was very similar to POL,

   but with established sub-committees reporting to the board.



40. The CEO and I reported from the POL board to the RMH board. I believe we

   provided a written report. We did not report to Royal Mail Group Ltd.

41.In terms of reporting to the Department of Trade and Industry, I do not recall who

    would attend these meetings on behalf of POL. I believe they took place

    quarterly but do not recall attending myself.



42.1 have been asked to summarise my understanding of how the Government

    maintained oversight of POL and RMH during my time as director. From

    recollection, the shareholder executive had regular meetings with RMH and also,

    on occasion, joined the RMH board meetings. I do not believe I was part of the

    regular quarterly meetings with the shareholder executive, so cannot comment

    further on them.



43. In relation to POL, there were also quarterly meetings with the Department of

    Trade and Industry. I do not recall attending these, but I may have attended the

   odd one. POL would also have had regular meetings with the Government about

   on-going issues, such as the rural strategy. I also do not recall attending these

   meetings.



44. At the time, I felt that the oversight was adequate.



   a-    s



45. The responsibility for monitoring the Horizon IT System ("Horizon") lay with POL.



46. The responsibility for criminal prosecutions and civil proceedings arising from



                                    Page 18 of 27
                                                                                          WITN10660100
                                                                                        WITN10660100




    alleged shortfalls in branch accounts based on Horizon data, also lay with POL.




47. WhenI joined as chairman, I do not recall any specific briefing or training about

    Horizon or about the contract between POL and Fujitsu. I have been shown the

    Second Supplemental Agreement [POL00090428} and the Third Supplemental

   Agreement [PUJ00118186}. I have no recollection of seeing these documents

    before, and do not recall the clauses about which I have been asked. I note that

   they were created several years before I joined.



48.1 have been asked if I was aware of any bugs, errors or defects or concerns with

   the integrity of Horizon or complaints about the same. I was not.



49. Although I cannot recall whether there were specific reporting lines, my assumption

   is that the IT Director reported to the CEO about matters relating to Horizon. As

   both were POL board members, I was reliant on them raising any concerns they

   had with Horizon.



50.1 do not recall any issues about the integrity of Horizon being raised.



51. When I first became the chairman of POL, I did request to further my

   understanding of the Horizon system. I have been asked about the purpose of my

   request. I believe that my first POL board meeting was 19 June 2003 - or this

   certainly would have been one of the first meetings. As can be seen in POL board

   minutes dated 19 June 2004 [POL00021482], I wanted to learn more about

   Horizon (see POLB03137). I was interested in the capabilities of Horizon because



                                    Page 19 of 27
                                                                                             WITN10660100
                                                                                       W ITN 10660100




   of the POL board's strategic plans for growth into the financial services market. In

   particular, we were focusing on offering banking products, insurance and travel

   products, and foreign exchange. These products were significantly higher value

   items than the products the Post Office had historically sold. I recall asking

   questions of the board as to whether Horizon was suitable for this. During my

   induction, I was told categorically by everyone I met (e.g. the executive team, the

   crown offices, and Post Offices I visited in East London) that Horizon was a

   significant improvement on what had existed before. However, we were entering

   into a completely different world with different products and I wanted to understand

   whether the system had been designed with these products in mind, whether it was

   reliable, and whether it was capable of handling transaction of much higher value. I

   also wanted to be confident that Horizon was resilient enough to adapt to new

   products.



52.1 recall that a meeting was arranged a few weeks after the board meeting to

   address my queries. I really cannot recall who attended the meeting, but I think it

   was the senior IT management and members of Fujitsu. I expect Alan Barrie (the

   IT director) set the meeting up, but I do not have any notes or records relating to it.

   Although I do not recall the specific questions I asked, my memory is that we

   discussed the issues addressed above. I do recall that I was left with the

   impression that POL not only had a good working IT system at the time, but a

   system that could be developed for the future.



53. Throughout the POL board meetings during my tenure, there were regular

   references to Horizon. My recollection is that these were all forward-looking



                                    Page 20 of 27
                                                                                            W I TN 10660100
                                                                                        WITN10660100




    discussions, i.e. how the system could help to further POL's expansion into new

    markets, the introduction of the IMPACT accounting system, and the extension of

    the current contract with Fujitsu in 2010. There were significant savings to be

    made by extending the Horizon contract. It is important to stress however that the

    extension of the contract with Fujitsu was only being discussed on the basis that it

    was working properly, which was my belief at that time.



54. As set out above, I do not recall hearing about any bugs, errors, defects or

    concerns with the integrity of Horizon. From recollection, the first time I heard any

    comment about possible problems with Horizon was in early August 2007, when I

    called into the office to say farewell to my colleagues. One of the senior area

    managers (the name of which I do not recall) had recently received an audit report

   about a large deficit in one of the Post Offices in her area. She told me that her

   team had not been able, to date, to understand what the problem was, and she

   said she was wondering whether there could be a problem with Horizon. She said

   her team were investigating all possible ways that the Horizon system might have

   caused the issue, but the investigation appeared to be at a very early stage. I

   trusted that this was in hand.



 HORIZON: CIVIL PROCEEDINGS AND PROSECUTIONS



55.1 do not recall discussion about the prosecution or civil proceedings brought against

   SPMs arising from alleged shortfalls in branch accounts based on Horizon data or

   generally and I was not aware that there was any systemic issue with Horizon.




                                    Page 21 of 27

56.1 have been asked about where the responsibility lay in the Holdings Group for

    criminal prosecutions and civil proceedings of SPMs for shortfalls in branch

    accounts. I cannot recall who would have been responsible within POL, but my

   assumption is that this would have been dealt with by the POL legal department,

    who would have reported any issues to the CEO or COO.



57. 1 do not recall discussion about the risks and compliance issues arising from

    the prosecution of SPMS for theft and false accounting, or the pursuit of civil

    litigation against SPMs to recover alleged short falls in branch accounts. As far

    as I was aware, there was a fully functioning legal team responsible for these

    actions.



58.1 do not have any recollection of the policies, guidelines or practices followed

   when pursuing       civil action against an SPM.
                   a




59. Similarly, I cannot recall any detail about the audits of SPMs' branch accounts, or

   the practices and policies adopted in respect of suspending or terminating SPMs'

   contracts.



60.1 also cannot recall the policies, guidelines or practices when investigating alleged

   offences and bringing criminal prosecutions.



61.1 do not recall the POL board discussing the bringing of specific prosecutions or

   civil proceedings against SPMs, and litigation was not a standard agenda item

   during our board meetings. This similarly applies to the RMH board. I note that



                                    Page 22 of 27
                                                                                          WITN10660100

    there is discussion about the principle of the approach to litigation in the POL

    board minutes dated 13 October 2004 [POL00021485] and that David Miller was

    actioned to verify the current procedures and report back to the POL board. I do

    not recall whether this happened. I recall discussion about how we dealt with

    franchise breaches by SPMs, i.e. selling a different lottery ticket, but I do not

    recall individual cases being discussed.



62.1 can recall that SPMs were occasionally prosecuted for fraud, which I think

   learned during        induction process. I do not have any recollection of these
                    my




   cases being discussed during POL board meetings.



Civil Proceedings against Ms Wolstenholme (Cleveleys)



63. The Request provided me with three documents which relate to the civil

   proceedings against Ms Woistenholme, namely: an email chain with the subject

   'Legal case — Cleveleys PO 153 405 Mrs J Wolstenholm' [POL00142503], an

   advice on evidence and quantum by Mr Brochwicz-Lewinski [POL00142504], and

   the IT spend from 2003 [POL00120833]. I do not recall seeing these documents

   before now.



64.1 do not recall this matter being discussed at a board meeting.



 THE IMPACT PROGRAM



65.1 have been asked about the nature and extent of my involvement in the design



                                     Page 23 of 27
                                                                                        WITN10660100

   and implementation of the IMPACT program; I was not involved with the design

   and implementation.



66. As can be seen in the POL board minutes dated 1 September 2004

   [POL00032050], the IMPACT business case was presented by Peter Corbett.

   IMPACT stands for "Improved Accounting" and the intention was for the Horizon

   system to be extended to accounting, with a hope that this would improve

   productivity. It was presented as a very straightforward, low risk program.



67. IMPACT was presented to the POL board, as we needed to approve the spend. I

   note that the board authorised the spend subject to an ongoing system of risk

   assessment [POL00032050]. I do not recall to what this amounted.



68.As can be seen in subsequent POL board minutes (e.g. POL board minutes

   dated 23 February 2005 [POL00021487] and POL board minutes dated 17

   August 2005 [POL00032147]), there were updates about IMPACT at relevant

   intervals. I note that POL00021487 mentions that the "Testing phase [is]

   underway". Although I cannot recall the content of this meeting, this implies to

   me that people were taking the introduction of this system carefully and properly.



69. Although I was not present during the POL board meeting on 17 August 2005

   [POL00032147], POLB05/79(c) details the sums of money that could be saved

   as a result of this program.



70.1 have been asked about the extent to which POL and RMH discussed the fact



                                   Page 24 of 27
                                                                                              WITN10660100
                                                                                            WITN10660100




   that the IMPACT program would prevent SPMs from placing disputed

   discrepancies in a local suspense account. I do not recall this being discussed.



 GENERAL



71.1 have been asked whether I felt I had sufficient time to dedicate to my roles at POL

   and RMH. I felt like I had sufficient time to dedicate to this role. For the first six

   months as chairman, I worked more than anticipated, as I needed to understand

   the role and the organisation.



72. As I did not know anything about the issues with Horizon at the time, I do not think

   there is more I could have done at the time either. Since concerns started to

   circulate about Horizon in the public domain, I have wondered what our board

   might have missed during my tenure.



73. By the time I was in post, my understanding was that Horizon was up and running

   successfully, and embedded in the organisation. It is therefore hard to say what I

   would have done differently with hindsight, as my understanding of the situation

   now is in stark contrast with my understanding at the time.
