REGINA v JULIAN WILSON
WORCESTER CROWN COURT
CASE NO: POLTD/0809/0126

As you are aware the Final Confiscation Order was made at Worcester Crown
Court on the 17" December 2009. The Confiscation Order was agreed with a
particular benefit figure of £28,434.95. The Court allowed 6 months to satisfy the
Order with the deadline for payment being 17" June 2010. This was further
extended by a further 6 months up to the statutory maximum. Also the Defendant
was ordered to pay prosecution costs of £3,500 and the Order was postponed for
a period of 12 months.

Could you please let me have the up-to-date position with regard to the sale of
the realisable asset and also whether you want me to have this matter listed for
Mention and subsequently for enforcement.

I await to hear from you.
