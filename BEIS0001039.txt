2. Notes for table

In the ‘Claim data by scheme’ table:

e spend is rounded to nearest £1 million

e data regarding the HSS and OC are sourced from Post Office Ltd, which
retains full responsibility for the data published on its website

2.1 Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting their
conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon evidence.

A ‘full’ settlement comprises both pecuniary (financial) and non-pecuniary
(personal) losses, but the Post Office has been progressing non-pecuniary
settlements first to get money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which
means a number of partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full
and final settlements published here.

The department is now publishing data on full and final settlements. Claims

received are no longer being broken down into pecuniary and non-pecuniary
settlements as in previous months.

2.2 Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63
postmasters had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress once
their conviction has been overturned.

The remaining 492 postmasters are currently eligible for the Group Litigation
Order Scheme, of whom 484 qualify for interim payments.

For disclosure reasons, the exact number of claims paid is now withheld.

This month, the number of payments has not increased.

BEISO001039

Work continues on the distributing shares of the £19.5 million interim payments
announced in June 2022, particularly on remaining payments in complex
categories such as those recently deceased and people who have not taken up
the offer of an interim payment.

2.3 Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)
Post Office received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to March
2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would be
provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress, and the
scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office has received 948 eligible late claims to date.

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants receive
an offer of redress.

The £122 million paid out on the HSS includes £29.2 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £3.7 million in interim payments to late
applications.

3. GLO Scheme delivery target

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is committed to a target of
making a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim within
40 working days.

A full claim is defined as a claim which DBT considers, with advice from its legal
advisors, does not need any further evidence in order to assess every element
of the claim.

Should the Department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a
full assessment, the 40-working-day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

As of 31 May 2024, 91% of claimants received their first offer within 40 working
days of submitting a full claim.

4. GLO Scheme £75,000 fixed payment
impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total fixed
sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-litigation-

order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from the GLO settlement
will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is made.

As of 31 May 2024, 172 offers have been accepted. Of these, 147 have
accepted offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.
