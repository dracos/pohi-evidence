At the recent audit at Birkenshaw Post office branch on 8 February 2011 a number of irregularities
in the accounts have come to light and these matters need to be explored with you. In order that
you have an opportunity to discuss the circumstances, I am writing to invite you to attend a
voluntary interview with the Post Office Ltd Security Investigation Team.

I have arranged the interview for Thursday 07 April 2011 at 11 am. The interview will take place at
Bradford South Delivery Office Stonearches Ripley Street Bradford BD5 7RS. If you make yourself
known at reception, I will be informed of your arrival.

I must remind you that we are investigating possible criminal offences and as such the proposed
interview will be under caution and taped recorded.

Your legal rights will be explained to you in full at the interview, however so that you are aware of
them I will detail a brief summary of them now.
