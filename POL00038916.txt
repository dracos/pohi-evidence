0.5 CHANGES IN THIS VERSION
0.5.1 Changes in Version 1.1
Dhisnis-called-bole-to-cll oie i Lestee-will-bebele

This supersedes various informal issues 1.4a through to 1.16.

Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1a are marked in red (like this) with significant
deletions in red-strikeout-(like-this}. Changes from Version 1.1a are in violet (like
this). Changes from Version 1.1b are in brown (like this).

Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved
the original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.

I have attempted to maintain the sub-section numbers within sections 2.5, Chapter 3
and Chapter 4 to aid traceability from other documents. This may result in some
sections being empty. New sub-sections are added at the end of their parent section to
aid this even if this is not necessarily the most logical place. Note that section 2.6 has
been restructured and in particular the subsections of 2.6.3 have all changed. Note
that Figure numbers and Table numbers may well have changed.

Changes are primarily:

= The breakdown of work between the various HLDs has now been included in
section 1.5

m= The excluded interfaces (SAP ADS Transaction Data and CAPO remuneration
data) have been removed from the DP to avoid confusion as to their status

® Migration Terminology has been aligned with that defined in [MIGSTGY].
= Alignment with the lower level documents, ie User Interface Design Proposals,

HLDs and AISs, which are now available. In some cases this has resulted in text
being removed from the DP to avoid duplication.

= Section on LFS Harvester included since it has now been decided to cut-off the
Weekly Stock data in the LFS Harvester to simplify migration

= Details of Post Office Ltd Change Requests and Fujitsu Change Proposals
included as section 8.5

= Some of the more detailed discussion sections have either been removed (if the
subject is now covered in a lower level document) or moved to an appendix within
Chapter 9 (if the discussion may be relevant for future CRs).

0.5.2 Changes in Version 1.0
Changes from version 0.3b to 1.0 are marked in green (like this).

0.5.3 Changes in Version 0.3

This is called 0.3c to allow for informal circulation. The formal issue will be 0.3
This supersedes various informal issues 0.3a through to 0.3b.

Version 0.3b has been put into PVCS as version 0.3 without further change.

Changes from version 0.2 to version 0.3a are marked in red (like this) with significant
deletions in red-strikeout-(like-this). Changes from 0.3a to 0.3b are in violet (like
this).

Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved
the original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.

Changes are primarily:

a The expansion of sections which were previously TBS

= Resolution of issues highlighted in version 0.2

= Alignment with the design that was costed for the CT.

Version 0.3 is being sent on a limited circulation and it is expected that it will be
updated to version 1.0 for baselining shortly.

0.5.4 Changes in Version 0.2

[ this supersedes various informal issues 0.2a through to 0.2d.

Changes from version 0.1 to version 0.2a are marked in red (like this) with significant
deletions in red-strikeout-ikethis). Changes from 0.2a to 0.2b are in violet (like
this). Changes from version 0.2b to 0.2c are marked in green (like this). Changes
from version 0.2c to 0.2d are marked in brown (like this). Changes from version 0.2d
are marked in dark teal (like this).

Note that in some places where a section has had major changes I’ve not preserved
the original text to make the new description more readable. Such sections are clearly
marked.

Since most of the document has changed significantly, no attempt has been made to
summarise the areas of change here.

Introduction

1.1 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

1.1.1 Accuracy

Fujitsu Services endeavours to ensure that the information contained in this document
is correct but, whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of such information,
it accepts no liability for any loss (however caused) sustained as a result of any error
or omission in the same.

1.1.2 Copyright

© 2004 Fujitsu Services. All rights reserved. No part of this document may be
reproduced, stored or transmitted in any form without the prior written permission of
Fujitsu Services.

1.2 SCOPE OF THE DOCUMENT

1.2.1 Scope

[CDPROG] identified a number of areas for the business proposition of the Impact
programme of which only some will be achieved by the completion of this project.
The business proposition section of [CDPROG] is copied below.

a Interface of data to RMG financial systems (including for data passed to HR SAP)

= Management of PO Ltd Bank Accounts (though this is not a “front end” issue and
so is not covered here)

= Capture, Validation, Verification and Correction of client transaction data from
any channel where applicable

= Provision of validated client transaction data to internal and external recipients
(though some of this is done via POL FS and MI)

= Responding to client/branch enquiries concerning transaction data (Enquiries to
allow response)

= Accounting at branches
= Branch control
= Recovering debt from branches, clients etc (inc non-transaction) debt

This Design Proposal documents the solution design for the Fujitsu Services
components of Impact Release 3

POL00038916
Fujitsu Services IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

The Design Proposal has been produced in parallel with the Conceptual Design. The
Conceptual Design (ie requirements) for the overall Impact Programme is defined in
[CDPROG]. The detailed requirements for the projects that make up Release 3 are
described in two separate Conceptual Design documents [CDBT] covering the Branch
perspective and [CDPOLFS] covering the Central perspective.

This Design Proposal is only addressing those requirements defined in [CDBT]. Any
requirements on Fujitsu associated with the Hosting of POL FS (covered in
[CDPOLFS)]) will be covered in a separate Design Proposal [SAPDP].

Any requirements on Fujitsu Services that are not fully met by this Design Proposal
are listed in section 1.6.1.

If the Fujitsu Services Commercial Terms for the Solution Build and Test and
Implementation Phases is accepted by Post Office Ltd then the solution delivered by
Fujitsu Services will be based on the outline design defined in this Design Proposal.

1.2.2 Timescales and Phasing

The design contained in this Design Proposal does not link Impact Release 3 to a
particular Horizon release. The release will be determined by the Joint Demand
Planning Forum.

However the expectation is that it will be included in S80.
1.2.3 Potential for Change

There are no specific requirements to allow for future change, however the use of
Reference Data where possible provides a good basis for minimising the
developments required in future to accommodate changes.

It is understood that the data feed to HR SAP (see section 3.2.6) is likely to be
simplified in the future and although that change is out of scope, the design should
take this into account.

1.2.4 Requirements Out of Scope

A number of the Business Processes described in [CDBT] are outside the scope of this
DP. These are listed in Table 5:

Perform Transaction Checks ~ Periodic__I This will be handled by the Post Office MIS system
Summarise Cash Centre Transactions This will be handled by SAP ADS as at present

Table 5 — Out of Scope Processes

In addition Section 21 (Appendix C) of [CDBT] identifies a number of changes based
on Schedule 12 savings. These are considered to be outside the scope of this DP.

1.3 REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW

The detailed requirements for Release 3 are described in [CDBT].

A number of further requirements were identified following the baselining of
[CDBT], which have been included in [CT] as Attachment 1.

Fujitsu Services IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

A number of further Change Requests have bene raised by Post Office Ltd and these
are listed in section 8.5.

Some requirements are also defined in [CDPROG], however since these are not
currently aligned with those in [CDBT], they have been ignored in this Design
Proposal.

Chapter 8 provides a formal compliance statement against each requirement in
[CDBT] (section 8.2) and Attachment I of [CT] (section 8.3) with references to where
the way in which the requirement is to be met is described in this document.

A number of assumptions were made at the time [CT] was approved and these are
formally described in Attachments 2 and 3 of [CT]. Section 8.4 is equivalent to
Attachment 2 of [CT] and Section 5.5 reflects the proposal made in Attachment 3 of
[CT].

1.4 DOCUMENT SUMMARY

{CDBT] split the changes required by Impact Release 3 as far as Horizon is concerned
into a number of areas:

= [CTRBAL] and [CTRDEC] which covers the counter changes. The split between
these documents is described in section 1.5.1.

= [TPSPOLFS] and [TPSOTHER] which cover those aspects to be included in the
TPS Host. The split between these documents is described in section 1.5.4.

= [TPSDWHAIS] which covers the changes to the interface between the TPS Host
and the POA Data Warehouse

= [RDMCHLD] which covers those aspects to be included in the Reference Data
Management Host

= [RDMOD] which defines the changes to the Reference Data Model for S80

a [RDTPSAIS] which defines the interface between RDMC / RDDS and the TPS
Host

= [LFSHLD] which covers those aspects to be included in the LFS Host (minor
changes only)

In addition, the detailed interaction between the clerk and the system will be described
in [€DIAG}-[DIAGBAL], [DIAGDEC] and [DIAGREP]. The split between these
documents is described in section 1.5.2.

The following CCDs will need to be updated as a result of the changes described in
this Design Proposal:

Chapter 2 -
Solution Outline Design

2.1 GENERAL
This chapter provides a definition of the solution being proposed. This is done in the
following ways:

= An overview of the full Impact Release 3 solution is presented including a
breakdown of the components for which Fujitsu Services are responsible

= Changes to the components for which Fujitsu Services are responsible are then
described in more detail, enabling the High Level Designs for these components
to be produced

= Issues to do with Migration and initial start up are covered separately

Interfaces between components (both Internal to Fujitsu Services and External to or
from other service providers) are described in Chapter 3.

2.2 OVERVIEW OF IMPACT RELEASE 3 COMPONENTS

Figure I shows the overall scope of Release 3 of Impact and the components and
interfaces involved.

Table 16 — External Interfaces

It should be noted that some of the components are external to the overall system.
These are shown as green boxes in the diagram.

Some of the components / data flows have a suffix of “R2”. This has been done
purely to avoid duplicating objects names within Systems Architect. These suffixes
should be ignored and have not been included in the text in this document.

The components are:
= Prism Systems

This represents the systems provided and operated by the Prism Alliance. The
main components relevant to Fujitsu are:

Terminals for user access to POL FS (and other systems)
SAP ADS

MIS

Reference Data System

oooo0

= Horizon Systems

This represents the systems developed and operated by the Fujitsu Services. This
is expanded further in section 2.2.1.

= POLFS

This represents the new Financial System which will replace CBDB. It is being
developed by Prism, but will be operated by Fujitsu Services.

Its design is outside the scope of this document.

a TPS Harvesting

This will become the prime mechanism for extracting Transactions from Branches
into the central data stores for passing onto the other Systems.

Changes are described in section 2.5.2.4.
= OBCS Host

This system will be unchanged. It is expected to die as Order Books are phased
out, however this may not be until after S80.

No changes are required for Impact R3.
= DRS Host

All existing interfaces to Reconciliation Clients (eg NBE, Streamline and E-Pay)
will continue to be supported (but have been excluded for simplicity).

The main change is to support the removal of the CAP on the C112 records and
the removal of the NB103 reports.

Changes are described in section 2.5.2.5.
= APS Host

All existing interfaces from AP Clients (eg Quantum and Watercard) will continue
to be supported (but have been excluded for simplicity).

Changes are described in section 2.5.2.6.
= Generate MIS Info

This will take the detailed Transactions from Branches and pass them across to the
MIS System.

Changes are described in section 2.5.2.7.
= Transaction Summarisation

This is a new component which is responsible for summarising transactions on a
daily basis so that the appropriate summaries can be made available to other
systems.

This is described in section 2.5.2.8.

2.3 Magsor NEw END To END CONCEPTS

The purpose of this section is to provide an end-to-end description of new
components that have an effect on multiple components of the proposed solution.

Do I need to add in a subsection here on Reconciliation?

Also need to consider the removal of min-cash account reconciliation.

2.3.1 Transaction Corrections

This is a new set of business processes to enable corrections to be made to the Branch
accounts as a result of various central investigations. The purpose of this new process
is to replace the existing Error Notice functionality.

In summary the process works as follows:

a The central accounting function decides that it is necessary to make some
adjustment to the Branch accounts

= A Transaction Correction is defined which will carry out the necessary changes (ie
the central user will define an amount to be transacted for a given Product in a
given Branch and a corresponding Settlement Product which will normally be
Cash or a defined Suspense Product).

The Transaction Correction will also define a list of possible actions that the
Branch Manager can take and also text to be presented to the Branch Manager
informing him / her of the affect of carrying out any of these actions.

a A daily file of such Transaction Corrections is generated from POL FS and passed
to Horizon overnight

= Horizon host systems need to receive this file and send messages using Riposte to
the specified Branches with details of the Transaction Correction. This will use
normal Bulk Loader technology including the use of Acks from the Branch to
acknowledge successful receipt of the Transaction Correction which can be
reported on as with any other in-bound file delivery. (See section 2.5.2.12 for
more details.)

Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

= In order to alert Branch Management of the receipt of Transaction Corrections a
new check is included at Logon for roles MANAGER and SUPERVISOR as to
whether there are any Outstanding Transaction Corrections and if so the user is
informed of the number currently outstanding and given the option of processing
them. (See section 2.5.1.6 for more details.)

= A new Transaction Correction Button is provided to enable the Branch Manager /
Supervisor to view and process Outstanding Transaction Corrections. (See
section 2.5.1.7 for more details)

a The result of processing a Transaction Correction will normally be the creation of
the specified Transactions, which will be returned to POL FS as part of the normal
flow of Summarised Transaction data at the end of the Trading Day on which the
Transaction Correction was processed at the Branch.

a An additional check is made as part of the Branch Balancing Process to ensure
that there are no Outstanding Transaction Corrections. This ensures that
Transaction Corrections cannot be ignored indefinitely. (See section 2.5.1.4.1 for
more details.)

As far as the processing of Transaction Corrections is concerned, the Host
functionality is very similar to that for Replenishment Deliveries (introduced at
Impact Release 1), in that a single message is written to Riposte for the appropriate
Branch for each Transaction Correction.

When a Transaction Correction is processed, a message is written at the Branch, thus
enabling a Branch to scan all Transaction Corrections and any Transaction Correction
Processed messages, and thus easily identify any that are Outstanding. This is the
same as the logic currently used to handle LFS messages.

In order to keep things simple at the Branch, it is proposed that Transaction
Corrections include the <WAIndex.LFSFlag:> attribute with new values for
Transaction Corrections and Processed Transaction Corrections. (See [CTRDEC].)

2.4 UNCHANGED PROCESSES

change. These are listed in Table 17:

2.5 CHANGED COMPONENTS
2.5.1 Counter Components
2.5.1.1 Branch Transactions

There are a number of aspects to this:

= Extending Transaction Retention

= Stock to be handled by Volume rather than by Value
= Merging of Value and Non-Value Stock

= Changes to Suspense Products

= Change APS to use EPOSS Core

= Settlement Transactions

= Reversal Control

These are discussed further below.

2.5.1.1.1 Extending Transaction Retention

This is a new requirement and wasn't included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn't directly support a Business function, but more the non-functional requirements and the
move to a monthly reporting period.

The move from a one week Cash Account period to a monthly Trading Period means
that transactional data will need to be retained in the branch for a minimum of 42 days
rather than the current 35 days. [BT049, BT0SO]

POL would prefer longer, but 42 days is thought to be the best we can offer without upgrading
the Correspondence Server Disk storage. Disk storage at the counter is considered not to be an
issue.

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Riposte configuration parameters and the migration implications

= Changes to applications in the way that they specify the Expiry of Riposte
messages

a Analysis of “unnecessary messages” and their removal
= Protection against lost data at system start
= Protection against lost data at EOD (see section 2.5.1.5.6)
= Protection against lost data at Logon (see section 2.5.1.6.4)
Some of these topics are covered elsewhere in the DP (as indicated), the remaining
ones are covered in the following subsections.

documents [RIPCNT], [RIPCS] and [RIPDC] rather than here.

Changes to the Expiry of Riposte messages

The main EPOSS messages are explicitly written with an Expiry value of 35 days.
These need to be changed to 42 days. This value should be defined in a Type C
Reference Data Object, thus allowing the exact value to be easily tuned in future.

In some cases we may decide to just change the Expiry to the default value.
This is defined in [CTRBAL]}.

become for various types of message. Need to consider any that do not have a
value of 34, 35 or 43, since that would mean that these are being explicitly set to
that value. No such messages have been identified.

= Analysis of those messages with a current Expiry value of 35 or 36 to see if it can
be sensibly changed. Specific types of message that could be considered for
reducing the Expiry value are:

LPOs

Some LFS Messages (ie those containing <WAIndex:>)

Print messages

EOD Reconciliation messages (though many of these are likely to be
removed)

oooo

The output of this analysis will be a series of proposals for further changes to the
Expiry Values of specific messages which should then be included with those changes

This is covered in [CTRBAL].

2.5.1.1.1.4_ Protection against lost data at system start

One of the major risks associated with increasing the Trading Period to 4 or 5 weeks
is that there is a significantly reduced margin for error should a branch not change its
Trading Period at the correct time. Currently there is a one week Cash Account
Period (which exceptionally can be extended to 3 weeks) and data is retained for 35
days, thus having a minimum safety factor of 2 weeks and a normal safety factor of 4
weeks before data relevant to the current trading period is lost. With the revised 4 / 5
week Trading Period and 42 days Transaction Retention, the safety factor has been
reduced to 2 weeks normally and only one week if there is a 5 week Trading Period.

Given the way in which the counter is currently engineered means that all local
reporting will fail and the ability to carry forward data into a new period will fail if
the data recorded at the start of a period is no longer available. Therefore, it is
essential that measures are introduced to ensure that the chances of losing data
associated with the current Trading Period are minimised. It is expected that there
may still be some obscure circumstances under which the data is lost, and the only
option in such cases will be to Temporarily Close the branch and reopen it as a “new
branch” as is currently done for long term temporary closures. Such a closure must be
for a minimum of 15 days currently and no work is being done to reduce that as part
of Impact R3.

The main measure to be undertaken to protect against data loss is a set of checks at
End Of Day. These are described in section 2.5.1.5.6. However these checks do not
protect against the case where all the counters in a Branch are switched off for a
period, thus preventing the EOD checks from being carried out. A simple mechanism
to handle this scenario is to carry out a check as part of the initial counter load
sequence, namely how long has the counter been switched off. If this is more than a
day (24 hours), then the assumption should be that the data on the counter may be
vulnerable and so the Riposte Configuration parameter DisableArchiving must be set
to I (through the registry) before starting the Riposte Service. The EOD checks will
ensure that this is reset back to 0 once it is safe to do so. [BT115]

Consideration is required as to whether there is a problem with implementing such a check on a
spare. For this check to be of use it must take place before Riposte is first loaded. It may be
sufficient that the code that carries out such a check is defined as an “immediate” fix.

This can be addressed in the HLDs.

PH: Have opened up conversation with Karen to attend to this - the following is her first quick
look at the problem “The starting of the Riposte service afier a reboot is instigated from a batch
file (services.bat) run under the control of PostPolo.exe (which is launched by Polo when PMMC
login is completed). This batch file is one of a number in the Cadmincfg\Postpoto directory
which are run in sequence by PostPolo. It looks as though we may need to insert another batch
file to be run before services.bat which changes the Riposte configuration if it thinks it is
necessary. I'm not sure at the moment how we work out how long the Counter has been switched
off, particularly in the case of a box-swap. Gareth seems to be implying that it is simple, so
hopefially it will be!”

GIJ: My statement was based on a conversation with Simon Fawlkes,
This bit of code is owned by Karen Morley’s team in ITU.
I need to ensure that this is being picked up properly.

Although I day is possibly a bit aggressive, with only 7 days between a “normal” 5 week
Trading Period and losing data, 1 believe that this is necessary. However the time should be
configurable (via the registry) to allow subsequent tuning.

2.5.1.1.2 Stock to be handled by Volume rather than by Value

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn’t directly support a Business process.

This has a number of implications: [BT056]
= Stock Remittance / Transfer
= Stock Declaration / Adjustment (see section 2.5.1.2.4)
= Stock Sales
a Stock Unit Balancing (see section 2.5.1.4.1)
= Stock Reporting (see section 2.5.1.3.7)
= Stock Revaluation
= Exceptional Products
Some of these topics are covered elsewhere in the DP (as indicated), the remaining
ones are covered in the following subsections.
2.5.1.1.2.1 Stock Remittance / Transfer
This supports part of the Business Process Rem In/Out Stock.

In general, Stock Remittances and Transfers are carried out by volume. There are
some exceptions to this and these are discussed in section 2.5.1.1.2.4. However when
the remittances / transfer transactions are recorded, then the stock values are recorded.
This should be changed such that a value of zero is recorded.

This may require changes to the Transaction validation function for Fixed priced
products.

POL00038916
Fujitsu Services IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004
Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

A new flag will be required in product Reference Data to identify a stock Product as
being handled by Volume rather than by Value and this should be used for controlling
this change. (See also section 3.5.)

This in turn means that when the Remittance / Transfer session completes, there will
be a net value of zero on the stack, and so strictly there would be no need for a
settlement transaction. However, a zero-value settlement transaction will be recorded
since some reporting is against the Settlement Product.

A consequence of this is that there will be no value for the overall Remittance /
Transfer session and so this will mean that the Remittance / Transfer reports will
change. This is covered further in section 2.5.1.3.7.

2.5.1.1.2.2 Stock Sales

A concept of Tertiary Mappings is introduced for stock products (see
section 2.5.1.4.1.3) in order to support the production of the Stock Unit Balance
Report. All Transactions (both stock and non-stock) may need to include these
Tertiary Mappings where they exist in addition to the current Primary / Secondary
Mappings, dependant upon the Mode of the Trasnaction.

This is a change to EPOSSCore and so is not specific to stock.

2.5.1.1.2.3 Stock Revaluation
This supports part of the Business Process Stock Revaluation.

A consequence of holding stock by volume rather than by value (and the business
reason for doing it) is that revaluation is no longer required as a branch accounting
function. I However the current mechanism of reporting imminent product
revaluations is still required to ensure that stock levels are adjusted correctly prior to
the revaluation and that staff are fully aware of the new prices. [BT046] However the
functionality to support revaluation of Stock Levels will no longer be required and so
can be removed. (ie the button will become invisible at the appropriate point in
migration)

2.5.1.1.2.4 Exceptional Products

“Other Stamps” have a special problem since they can’t easily be managed by
Volume. Therefore they will continue to be managed by Value and so still appear as
part of the Stock Unit Balance (together with Cash, Cheques and Foreign Currency)

In particular any Non Value Indicator stamps (in particular the 38p Europe stamp)
should be removed from the list of “ether-stamps” on the Declare Stamps and Postage
Stamps Remittance menus and no longer be transacted as Postage Stamps (F3 on the
main Serve Customer menu) and appear as a separate menu item. This will enable
them to be held by volume and thus avoid any future revaluation. Note that there is a
requirement on Post Office Ltd ([BT047]) to make this change.

This can be handled via normal OBC and should take place prior to S80.

This should be a simple Fype- Reference Data change.

I It probably required both Type A and Type C Reference Data changes.

imilar problem. All these products should continue to be managed by Value and si
have their mapping set appropriately and appear in reports as at present.

It is assumed (though perhaps not explicitly stated), that none of the exceptional products will
require to be re-valued,

Phil B is working with POL on a detained analysis to try and remove all such exceptions.
I'm also concerned that any such exceptional products will give POL FS a problem.

However our current design will handle such products sensibly (other than revaluing them). The
issue is what impact it has on POL FS.

Baseline position is that we do nothing and that they are both handled as Volume Stock.

Merging of Value and Non-Value Stock

This is a new requirement and wasn't included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn't directly support a Business function.

(BT0S5]

There are a number of requirements in terms of how Stock is to be handled in future.

No changes are currently proposed in this area other than removing the non-value stock
functions.

The following discussion is included for information and we anticipate receiving a CR from POL
to request further work in this area.

The CR is 3813.

I need to update this section.

They can best be summarised as removing the distinction between Value and Non-

Value stock.

Currently, the only purpose of Horizon taking note of non-value stock is for the

weekly stock report to SAP ADS. This will be removed (see section 2.5.1.5).

Having done that, any current non-value stock products can be “retired” in the normal

way and removed from the system. Since it is understood that the weekly stock repo
is not actually used by SAP ADS, there is no need to wait until the interface
removed before starting to remove non-value stock from the system.

rt
is

Further analysis is required by Post Office Ltd as to what should happen to these non-

value stock products. The following are the options:

= Do Nothing

= Change the transactions that are currently undertaken which use the non-value

stock to become Value Stock transactions.

= Re-engineer the transactions to better exploit Horizon functionality

Since there are no specific requirements on this in [CDBT], our current costings
assume that Post Office Ltd will choose “do nothing” in all cases.

Further analysis has been carried out and this is included in section 9.2.

2.5.1.1.4 Changes to Suspense Products

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

This supports part of the Business Process Make Good or Declare any Outstanding
Losses.

There are currently a number of Products and Buttons that relate to the Suspense
account. For each line on the suspense account there are 2 associated products:

= One to post the item to the Suspense Account
= One to clear the item from the Suspense Account

Most of these are invoked by Buttons or picklists on or below the Housekeeping
menu. The following changes are required:

There are two aspects of this.

* ifthe “emergency suspense” products are still required, then we need to keep the buttons for
them (or introduce new ones)

+ If they are to continue io be “Suspense

products, does that mean we have to leave full
access to the Housekeeping Menu?

tny changes here would require a CR/CP.

= All of the Suspense Account Products are to be restricted to those Roles who can
do an Office Balance (ie Manager, Supervisor, Migrate, Auditor and Auditor -
Emergency Manager). [BT040a]

This will be controlled using normal Menu Security functionality on the
Housekeeping menu.

= The list of Suspense Account products needs to be rationalised. Some additional
products are required and some existing products may no longer be required. In
particular some of the products may become non-core. [BT 102]

Branch Consumables and Corporate Customers have been introduced as new
Housekeeping categori It is assumed that normal Pick List mechanism can be
used to define the exact products to be included in these categories and that the
introduction of such products will be handled using the OBC process.

Note that Products cannot be removed if there is still a balance associated with
them. This means that in practice it is unlikely that any Suspense products will
actually be removed, however the buttons that enable the Suspense products to be
used will be removed. Business processes will then ensure that Transaction
Corrections are used to clear out the balance from these Suspense products.

= Need to introduce a new “Local Suspense Account”. This is also linked to the
Stock Unit Balancing Process (see section 2.5.1.4.1). [BT102]

need to be removed, since in the future this will be achieved using Transaction

This can all be implemented via Reference Data Changes.

The detailed changes are specified in [DIAGBAL].
Section 9.3 contains details of the current suspense products.
2.5.1.1.5 Change APS to use EPOSS Core

The APS application needs to be changed to call EPOSS Core thus enabling it to pick
up other changes associated with Stock Products and Tertiary mappings.

Tneed to ensure that this is being picked up properly.

2.5.1.1.6 Settlement Transactions

Currently, we have a number of “special products” with Product Ids in the range
10,000 to 13,000 which are managed by Fujitsu and do not come from POL as
Type A Reference Data.

Historically these products are of no interest to POL and in particular are not passed
to OPTIP. In general this is achieved by suppressing such products in either the TPS
Harvester or in the TPS Host (or in many cases both!).

However with the introduction of Impact, some of these products are relevant to POL
FS, namely the Remittance Settlement Products for Cash and ForEx. At Impact R1
these are picked up at the branch as part of the EOD Summarisation process and
harvested as part of the POL FS feed into the TPS Host. However at Impact R3, since
summarisation of transactions for POL FS is done in TPS, all such transactions will
need to be harvested otherwise the data passed to POL FS may not balance and data
will be lost.

The following table shows the types of products affected with approximate numbers:

Table 20 — Current Settlement Products

There are two approaches to this that could be considered:

= That we continue using the existing Settlement Products, but ensure that they are
harvested to TPS so that they can be used for Transaction Summarisation, but are
suppressed in the feed to OPTIP. We would need to consider separately whether
or not they should be passed to POL MIS.

= That we pass control of these products back to nRDS since they need to be aware
of those used for summarisation to POL FS. This will probably result in them
having new Product Ids (presumably in the 5000 or 6000 range), which in turn
will require changes to some of the Type C Ref Data to use the new products.

It has been agreed withir-Fujitsu that we take the second approach;-hewever-this-has
still-to-be-discussed-with-the-POL-Refe Data-t . In particular, transactions
involving such products must not be sent to MIS and so the product Reference Data
needs to identify such products to enable them to be easily suppressed by the TPS
Host system.

The proposed approach is to request that nRDS delivers replacements for the
Settlement Products that we expect to be used and we then withdraw all the 1xxxx
equivalent products following migration. There are migration issues and these are
discussed in section 2.6.3.2.4.

2.5.1.1.7 Reversal Control

This section has been added as a result of a question from ITU concerning the ability to Reverse
Transaction Corrections.

An additional check is required in the handling of Existing Reversals, based on the
Mode of the original transaction. In order to support this check a new flag is required
in the ModeParameters to indicate if Existing Reversals are supported for
Transactions originally carried out in a given Mode

It should be noted that there are already a number of specific checks done for an
existing reversal, some of which are already based on the mode of the original
transaction. Consideration should be given to removing such checks to utilise the
generic mechanism.

Note that this will have UT implications which have missed the current UIDP.

I need to consider the implications of this.

2.5.1.2 Changes to Cash / Stock declarations and handling of variances

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

Again, there are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Cash Declarations

= Reporting of Cash Variances

= Processing of Cash Variances

= Stock Declarations and Variances

= Non-Value Stock Declarations

These are discussed further below.

2.5.1.2.1 Changes to Cash Declarations

This supports the Business Process Compare Generated with Actual Cash Held for
Stock Unit.

Currently there are separate functions for a Cash Declaration (on the Stock Balancing
menu) and ONCH Declaration (on the reporting menu). Both have similar dialogues
with the branch office staff and record similar information within the message store.
It is required that the ONCH declaration be removed. [BT 104]

For ease of transition, the Cash Declaration Button will also be placed on the
Reporting menu.

The dialogue of the Cash Declaration function will be basically unchanged.

The detailed dialogues for the current Cash Declarations and ONCH Declarations
have subtle differences. In all cases the Cash Declaration dialogue will be followed
rather than that for ONCH Declaration dialogue.

In order to support subsequent reporting, details of cash declarations made need to be
held in a set of Persistent Objects similar to those currently used to hold details of
ONCH Declarations. These are described in section 2.5.1.2.1.3. The denominational

level information will continue to be maintained in Declaration messages. The

made:

For an Unshared Stock Unit, any difference between the declared figure and the
systems generated figure will be presented to the user and will be recorded (as a
discrepancy — but now to be called a variance) as part of the Declaration event.

For a Shared Stock Unit, a new function, Check for Variances, is required to check for
Cash Variances across all declarations within the stock unit. This is described in
section 2.5.1.2.1.1.

In addition, an extra button is added into the “Produce Report” screen at the end of a
Cash Declaration in a Shared Stock Unit, giving the user the option of going straight
into this new “Check for Variances” function. [BT026]

2.5.1.2.1.1 Check for Variances Function

The Check for Variances function will present a list of declarations for that stock unit
with different Declaration Ids and then compare the total declared position against the

system derived figure and again any differences will be recorded (as a variance) as
part of the appropriate event. [BT 105]

The rules for picking those Declarations Ids to be presented as part of the Check
Variances function are the same as those currently used by the Stock Unit Balance
Process. The processing required is:

1) Find the latest Declaration Variance Persistent Objects for each Declaration Id
that has been used within the current Stock Unit

3) For each Declaration Id being displayed need to include the following:
© Declaration Id
e User
e Date and Time of Declaration
© Node

4) The user has the option of abandoning the function if they are not happy with
the list presented. This can be achieved by use of the Prev or Home buttons.
There is no need to explicitly request confirmation. The list will be displayed
as a picklist (as for the current list displayed as part of SU Balancing)

5) If the user selects Continue, the current stock unit derived position is
calculated and compared with the sum of the declarations selected.

6) If they match, then a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete event is
written; the Stock Unit Variance Persistent Object is updated; and the function
exits having confirmed to the user that there is no variance

7) If they do not match, then a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with
Discrepancy event is written; the Stock Unit Variance Persistent Object is
updated; and the function exits having informed the user that there is a
variance and what it is

Note that there is no requirement to produce a report at this stage. All the relevant
information can be found on the Variance Report.

It should be noted, that no attempt will be made to check or to take into account any
transactions that may have taken place between the times the various declarations
were made and the time that the Variance is calculated.

This is no different from the current “Discrepancies” function.

Two new events are required for this:
a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete
= Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with Discrepancy

Note that if other users attached to the Stock Unit have continued trading since they
made their Declarations, then the Variance that is calculated is likely to be incorrect.
No attempt should be made to compensate for this. It is the responsibility of the
Branch staff to ensure that no such trading takes place. This is why a list of when the

last Cash Declarations were made for each declaration Id is required to assist in
monitoring this.

This function can optionally be selected at the end of the Cash Declaration process, so
that the branch office staff can move into it directly if they know that all Cash
Declarations have already been made for that Stock Unit.

2.5.1.2.1.2 Declaration Events

In order to simplify subsequent processing of Variances, then it is necessary to change
the way in which the Declaration event is recorded.

There are 3 events currently associated with Declaration:
= Declaration Complete (Event Id 21)

This is used when a declaration has completed with no discrepancy or where it is
not possible to check if there is a discrepancy (eg in a Shared SU)

In this case the event message includes information about the value that was
declared

= Declaration Abandoned (Event Id 22)

I've tried to generate this event and have failed. I suspect it can’t happen.

It is now confirmed that although the code supports the generation of this event, it is not possible
to get to this bit of code. It can be ignored as far as this DP is concerned.

= Declaration Complete with Discrepancy (Event Id 23)

This is used when a declaration has completed and it has been detected that there
is a discrepancy from the systems derived figure.

In this case the event message includes information about the value that was
declared and the amount of the discrepancy

In addition two new events have been identified above:
= Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete (Event Id 63)
a Shared Stock Unit Variance Check Complete with Discrepancy (Event Id 64)

These new events will need to be defined in Type C Reference Data. Also a new
mechanism will need to be introduced to indicate that the shared stock unit
declarations have been completed.

Haye I got the signs the right way around? It isn’t clear in [CTRDEC] either.

These events will be classified as Balancing Events and SU Balancing Events and
those indicating a discrepancy (ie Event Ids 23 and 64) will contain a Parameter
<P1:> containing the amount of the Discrepancy. This amount will be held as a
signed amount — positive indicating a gain and negative a loss.

2.5.1.2.1.3. Variance Persistent Objects

In order to support the production of the Variance report (defined in section 2.5.1.2.2)
the following Persistent Objects are required:

2.5.1.2.2

= One for each week for each Stock Unit (shared or unshared)
= One for each week for each Declaration Id in each Shared Stock Unit
= One for each week for the Office

Old Persistent Objects should be logically deleted when they are no longer of use in a
similar way to that currently done with the ONCH_ww_SS' Persistent Objects,
however rather than removing the Persistent Objects, when they are no longer
required, their content should be removed and a “logically deleted” flag should be
included in the Persistent Object. This will avoid any problem with the Riposte
mechanisms for removing Deleted Persistent Objects. This logical deletion should
not take place until at least 5 weeks after the end of the week for which the Persistent
Object was created.

Each Persistent Object should contain a composite attribute for each day of the week
starting with Thursday, with the attribute name being the weekday name. Any
declaration made the following day as part of the logon check will be held under
yesterday’s composite attribute. Unlike the current ONCH Persistent Objects there is
no concept of carry forward declarations, so it will only be necessary to update a
single Persistent Object.

The manipulation and content of the Variance Persistent Objects is defined in
section-3.4.2 [DIAGDEC].

Reporting of Cash Variances

This supports the Business Process Create Variance Report ... Compare Generated
with Actual Cash Held Across Branch.

A report is required to show the variances for all Stock Units in the branch and also
indicate when the last declaration was done for each Stock Unit.

This is a new Office Daily Report which is generally available.

It is assumed that a new button is added into the Reports Menu at some appropriate
place (probably as an Office Daily Report)

The processing when the button is touched is as follows: [BT009]
1) The normal “Produce Report” screen is displayed
2) The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” and the current week

6) The report is then produced.

Details of the report layout are in [DIAGDEC] and the way in which it is
produced is defined in [CTRDEC].

ean-then-be-built-up-as-follows:

I've deleted the detail that was previously held in the DP at this point, since it is now in
[DIAGDEC} or [CTRDEC]

I've not marked it as a deletion.

It should be noted, that immediately after migrating to the Impact R3 functionality,
there will be a very limited history of Variance Persistent Objects. Any data that is
required by the report, which is not available in the Variance Persistent Objects,

should be treated as if no declarations were made on that day and “x”s output.

Special handling is required for Stock Units that have been Created or Deleted during
the time covered by the report. The rules are as follows:

= Reporting for these Stock Units should be as above for the periods when the Stock
Units were in existence

= For those periods when the Stock Units were not in existence, then the various
columns should have a value of “n/a” rather than “x”, and the Stock Units should
be ignored in terms of deciding if totals should be included.

2.5.1.2.2.1 Reprints of the Cash Variance Report

This report is produced from the raw data in a similar manner to the production of the
Cash Variance report as described above. The difference is that the date range for
which the report is to be produced is defined as part of the reprint mechanism and the
Variance Persistent Objects for that period are used rather than those for the current
week. [BT060a]

2.1.2.3 Processing of Cash Variances
This supports the Business Process Make Good, Hold or Declare Any Cash Variance.

The Cash Declaration process may result in Variances being identified between the
Declared Cash values and the System Generated values. Such variances can either be:

= Held (ie ignored for now in the expectation that they will resolve themselves)

m Made Good (ie the physical cash will be adjusted to match the System Generated
figure)

= Recording the variance as a Discrepancy (ie the System Generated figure will be
adjusted to match the physical cash by creating a transaction which is balanced
against the Discrepancy product)

This is current functionality and will continue to be invoked only as part of the
Stock Unit balancing process. This is covered further in section 2.5.1.4.1.

Making good a loss (or removing excess cash), has no actual affect on the system
generated figures since what is being done is adjusting the actual cash holding to
reflect what the system thinks it to be. This can be thought of as making an update to
the last Cash Declaration recorded in the system.

There is also a requirement to make any such event explicitly visible, so that if an
issue subsequently comes to light there is some evidence that there had been a
variance within the system. [BT032]

Therefore two new “buttons” are introduced in the Stock Balancing Menu:
= Make good a loss

= Remove excess cash

The-c Dial s-will decide-wh. hese-buttens—-will-be-added-to-th

These buttons will I be available for any clerk to record the “making wood” events.
Such “make good” events will be recorded in the audit trail and can be viewed using
the normal event reporting mechanisms and will also be passed through to MIS. They
are also shown on the Stock Unit Balance Report (section 2.5.1.4.1), the Variance
Report (section 2.5. 1.2.2) and the Branch Trading Report (section 2.5.1.4.2).

Invoking either button will result in a screen being presented to the user inviting them
to enter the amount to be made good (or removed). No attempt is made to calculate or
verify this amount is to be made, since it is assumed that trading has taken place since
the last Declaration.

The Variance report may help the User in working out how much (s)he needs to Make Good.

Two separate events will be defined:
= Make good a loss (Event Id 59)
m Remove excess cash (Event Id 58)

These events will be classified as Balancing Events and SU Balancing Events and will
contain a Parameter <P1:> containing the amount of cash Made Good / Removed.
This amount will always be held as a positive amount — the different events will allow
the effect to be deduced when reporting on the amounts.

The relevant event is written to record the fact that the Stock Unit’s cash position has
been corrected.

In addition, the last cash declaration for the Stock Unit will be updated (for an
unshared Stock Unit the user will be asked to chose which Declaration Id should be
updated). [BT032]

Need to handle the case where no declaration has yet been made. However this is unlikely to
happen in practice since:

¢ adeclaration should be made each day

* adeclaration would probably have been made to enable a variance to be identified and thus
for the clerk to decide that there is something to make good

Any subsequent attempt to update the declaration will make it clear that there is an
amount “made good” (or removed) from the Declaration. However if a subsequent
Declaration is made, it is assumed that the cash declared at that time is correct and the
record of the amount made good (or removed) will not be carried forward in the
Declaration.

2.5.1.2.4 Stock Declarations and Variances
This supports the Business Process Local Stock Check Stock Held for Stock Unit.

There are currently two mechanisms supported for managing Stock levels and
adjusting them:

= Stock Adjustments

This mechanism presents the clerk with a list of all Stock items (apart from cash
and “other stamps”), together with the system derived stock levels.

The user can then page through the list of products and amend the volume of any
products to match those actually held. When the Finish button is pressed a “Stock
Adjustment” transaction is created for each stock item whose level has been
changed based on the Sale Price and a balancing transaction of cash in each case.

= Stock Declarations

This mechanism is only available in a Shared Stock Unit. The clerk is presented
with a list of all previous Stock Declarations made, together with their Declaration
Ids and timestamps in this current Balance Period ter-CAP2}. They can then
select one of these declarations to update or alternatively decide to make a new
declaration from scratch.

They are then presented with a list of all Stock items (apart from cash and “other
stamps”) and are invited to make a “blind declaration”. If it is a new declaration,
then they are required to enter a Declaration Id.

Subsequent use of the Discrepancies function or running a Trial Balance will then
compare the total Declarations for the Stock Unit with the System Derived figures
and highlight any discrepancies that are identified. If this check is done as part of
the Trial Balance process, then the discrepancies must be accepted, which will
result in a Discrepancy transaction being created for each stock item whose level
is identified as being in error based on the Sale Price and a balancing transaction
of the Discrepancy product in each case.

Both of these mechanisms need to be retained, however rather than using the Sale
Price when recording the Adjustment or Discrepancy transaction, a separate “loss
price” should be used. This “loss price” will optionally be supplied as part of the
Product Reference Data. Should no “loss price” be defined in Reference Data, then
the Sale Price should be used. [BT036]

This has a number of implications:

= Changes are required to Product Reference data to include an optional “loss price”
for those products where it is different from the sale price. This is discussed
further in section 3.5.

a The Pick lists displayed by the Stock Adjustment and Stock Declaration functions,
include the Sale Price in brackets after the Product Name. This should be
replaced by the “loss price” (if specified).

= When the Adjustment or Discrepancy is recorded as a Transaction, then the price
used should be the “loss price”.

Note that any validation associated with Fixed Price products needs to take into
account that the loss price may well differ from the Sale Price.

Currently Methods of Payments such as Cheques and Vouchers are also presented in
these lists.

In fact my system has 15 additional items in the Adjust Stock menu compared with the Declare
Stock menu (344 and 359 respectively, so it’s a bit hard to compare them easily!).

However POL are looking at removing these products and replacing them with alternative
products that cau be handied by Volune. Any such changes are considered to be “Business as
Usuat” and not specificatly part of Impact R3.

2.5.1.2.5 Non-Value Stock Declarations

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

It doesn’t directly support a Business function.

Since the intention is to remove non-value stock as a concept any processing of non-
value stock will need to be removed. (See also section 2.5.1.1.3) [BT 106]

2.5.1.3 Reporting

These are new requirements and weren't included in the March 2003 costings.

There are a number of aspects to this:

= Office Snapshot Report

a Suspense Account Report

= Counter Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps Report

ma APS Transactions Report

m Variance Reporting (see section 2.5.1.2.2)

= Stock Unit Balance Reports (see section 2.5.1.4.1)

= Reporting on Transaction Corrections (see section 2.5.1.7.3)
= Event Log

= Other reports affected by changes to Stock Processing
= Reprints of Reports

a Reports to be removed

= Weekly Reports

Some of these are discussed elsewhere in this DP (as referenced); the remainder are
discussed further below.

The move from a weekly Cash Account to a monthly Branch Trading cycle means
that there will up to be 5 times as much data to scan when preparing a report, and
some reports will be much bigger. However there are no requirements to improve the
reporting mechanisms, and so increased report production times are acceptable.
(BT001]

Dev have some ideas in terms of “caching” Data Server data to improve the performance, but I
want to avoid this if at all possible so as to keep things simple.

2.5.1.3.1 Remuneration Reporting

This supports the Business Process Produce Sales Report to Assist Remuneration
Check. The business requirement is that a postmaster can look at the data that will be
used by HR SAP to calculate his remuneration. However it is up to the Postmaster to
select the appropriate dates that align with those used for delineating “pay months”.
Another aspect of this alignment is that the dates specified need to align to EOD
markers rather than to calendar dates so that again the data aligns with that which is
passed to HR SAP.

The requirements are to be met by making a change to the way in which the current
Sales Report is produced.

Currently, the Sales Report reports on all relevant transactions since the start of the
current Cash Account period.

The requirement is to include an additional dialogue at the start of the process asking
the clerk to input a Start Date and an End Date.

The dialogue will be formally defined in {¢D1AG}[DIAGREP], however it will have
the following characteristics: [BT016]

1) A new button is added to the “Produce Report” screen called “Define Date

range”
2) The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” rather than “Office CAP”
3) If no Date range is selected then the current behaviour will continue (ie from

the start of the current Trading Period up until the present time)

4) If “Define Date range” is selected, then the clerk is invited to select firstly a
Start Date and then an End Date. These are both to be specified as normal
calendar dates (dd/mm/yy). The following validation is required:

a) End Date is no later than “yesterday” and EOD has been run for that

b) Start Date is less than or equal to End Date

c) Start Date is not less than xx days before “today”

Where xx is defined in Reference Data and defines the Transaction
Retention time.

5) The scan for the Transactions to build the report should be modified so that if
a Date Range is specified, then the start point for the transactions is defined as
the EOD marker for the Trading day before Start Date, and the end point for
the transactions is defined as the EOD marker for the Trading day of End
Date. These EOD markers can be found by following the chain of EOD
Markers from the Current EOD Object.

2.5.1.3.2 Office Snapshot Report
This supports the Business Process Review Stock Held Across Branch.

This report is similar in layout to the Stock Unit Balance report, however covers all
transactions for all Stock Units, rather than being restricted to a single Stock Unit.

It is proposed that its scope is unchanged, however the actual report layout will be
changed in line with the changes being made to the Stock Unit Balance report as
defined in section 2.5.1.4.1.3. [BT037]

2.5.1.3.3 Suspense Account Report

This report needs to take into account the changes to the Suspense Products
(described in section 2.5.1.1.4) and also the introduction of the “Local Suspense
Account”. [BT039]

Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

It has been agreed that this report will continue to be available to all users (ie no
additional security needs to be added).

However to avoid the report growing too much and to enable old Suspense Products
to be “retired”, some additional flexibility is required in the way the report is
produced. Currently all possible Suspense Products are reported on in the Suspense
Account Report. In future only those Suspense Products which have either a Balance
or a movement during the Trading Period should be included. All Suspense Products
with zero balance and no movements in the period should be suppresses when the
report is printed.

There is an added complexity. With the introduction of Cash in Pouches at S60, there
will be a potentially large number of Cash in Pouches transactions, particularly in
large branches (maybe hundreds in a 5 week period). Therefore CP3787 has been
raised to address this issue. The solution has two aspects:

= The “Cash in Pouches” section of the Suspense Report will be handled differently
from all other Suspense product, in that only the summary line will be included.
This summary line will just give the total Volume and Value of Cash in Pouches
Transactions together with the B/Fwd and C/Fwd figures. The detailed
transactions will be suppressed.

= A new report will be introduced which will provide the details of all the Cash in
Pouches Transactions. This report will be optional.

2.5.1.3.4 Counter Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps Report
This is a new report. [BT107]

It should become a mandatory report with a cut-off and must be produced if any
savings stamps have been redeemed. It should include a total of all transactions
which involve redeemed trading stamps since the last cut-off. These can be identified
by having a Level 2 accounting node of 535.

2.5.1.3.5 APS Transactions Report

This report is currently produced based on all Transactions that are found under the
APS Node in the accounting hierarchy. Given the need to introduce Stock Products
for AP Transactions, then the report should be changed to report on all Transactions
which have been written with <Application: APS>.

2.5.1.3.6 Event Log

No changes are required to the reports as such, however there will be additional
events introduced which will need to be categorised appropriately to appear on the
various subsets of events.

This should be purely a Reference Data change to the Events Collection.
2.5.1.3.7 Other reports affected by changes to Stock Processing

The changes to Stock Processing, particularly those requiring stock to be held by
Volume rather than by Value (see section 2.5.1.1.2) require a number of reports to be
changed so that stock values are no longer reported. [BT056]

2.5.1.3.7.1

I’ve also seen some example reports where a stock item only has a value and no volume — clearly
we will need to ensure that this doesn't cause any problems. Hopefitlly it is just bad examples in
[REPREC]. However there are some products listed in Table 22 (section 2.5.1.2.4) which need
special consideration.

This is expected to be primarily a change to the report definitions in GlobalObjects.dat rather
than actual code changes.

Table 23 — Reports affected by Stock Changes

Remittance and Transfer Reports

The report layouts should remain unchanged, however any stock remittances will be
at zero value, thus resulting in the value column usually being zero in such cases.

Since there will be some cases (eg cash), where the value is non-zero, the actual
report layout will not change. In particular zero values will still be output in the
report rather than being suppressed.

Tneed to check this. I think we may have since decided to stippress zero values.

still handled by Value, however the value should be suppressed for those products
handled by Volume (rather than included as zero). The total at the bottom should
be removed.

It is also required that the new Variances report will need to be reprinted. Since the
requirements for this are somewhat different to other reports this is considered as part
of the Variance report in section 2.5.1.2.2. [BT060a]

The current mechanism for this is that each time one of these re-printable reports is
produced, then the start and end markers used for producing the report are stored and
the reprint is achieved by rescanning the transactions using those markers. This
means that reprints can be done for those CAPs that are still “in scope”.

I believe that “in scope” means the last 3 CAPs, however I'm not sure what happens with multi-
week CAPs. I suspect it is the last 3 CAP numbers which means that the Transactions must be
there even with a multi-week CAP.

Can this be confirmed please?

The move to 4/5 week Trading Periods makes the Reprint function more complex.
Different reports are affected in different ways:
= Office Weekly Counters Revenue Schedule: Reprint
Since the original report is to be removed, then there is no need for a reprint.
a Track and Trace Manifest: Reprint

The current functionality is purely to reprint the last report produced, so no change
is required.

T now understand that this report has not yet been introduced. It isn't yet clear if it will be
introduced in S80, however I think it is OK to ignore it in this context since it is not aligned to
CAPs,

Office Weekly Inland Revenue Tax Credits P5589: Reprint

Office Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps Summary: Reprint
Variance Report Reprint (new)

All of these will continue to be weekly reports, however they will be identified by
the Date Range for which they were produced rather than by the CAP of the week
for which they apply.

The requirement is to be able to reprint all those reports for which the data is still
available, ie the last 5 reports. Therefore, no changes are required to the way in
which the reprints are produced other than by identifying past reports by a date
range rather than a CAP.

Note that when the branch has just migrated from CAP operation into Branch
Trading operation, it should still be possible to Reprint the reports from the “CAP
period”, however such reports will be identified to the user by the dates when they
were produced rather than by the CAP they were produced for.

= Stock Unit Balance: Reprint
a Branch Trading Report: Reprint

Here, the requirement is to be able to reprint the last report that has been produced
for each Stock Unit /Office (excluding any interim Stock Unit Balance Period
reports). This will be achieved by ensuring that all data required to reprint the
report is stored as a BLOB within the messagestore at the time that the report is
originally run. New reprint functionality is then required to take the data from this

BLOB and regenerate the report based on that data. Since only the last report
requires to be reprinted, it is sufficient to maintain the last report data as a
Persistent Object which is overwritten each time a new report is produced.

Note that during the first Branch Trading Period it should still be possible to
reprint the last CAP based Stock Unit Balance Report or Cash Account Report,
provided that all the data for such a report is still available in the message store (ie
by invoking the old code to regenerate the report from the raw data). Once a
Stock Unit or Branch has rolled over into the second Branch Trading Period, then
there is no need to be able to reprint CAP based data

2.5.1.3.10 Weekly Reports

There are currently a number of Weekly Reports within Horizon. The move to a
monthly Trading Period means that all these reports need to be reviewed as to what
affect this might have on them. The underlying principle is that current weekly
reports will remain weekly and will be driven by a normal calendar (typically start of
business on Thursday to close of business the following Wednesday). Reports will
either be mandatory or non-mandatory in terms of business processes. Mandatory
reports will be produced weekly by reference to the calendar by the Branch staff.
Non-mandatory reports will be produced by the same means but if not printed will
accumulate data during the trading period until they are printed. Some reports are
defined as Mandatory within Horizon and what this means is that Horizon will ensure
that they are printed at before allowing the Stock Unit to rollover at trading period
end.

No support is required from Horizon to manage conformance to any of the above
other than the following:

= Existing mechanisms for forcing reports to be produced prior to Stock Unit /
Office rollover will be maintained

= Any necessary changes to ensure that reports can be cut-off other than at period
end (for example on a weekly basis where required) such that subsequent weekly
reports only report from the last cut-off rather than for the full Trading Period to
date are needed.

Many reports have the concept of a cut-off. What this means is that once a report has
been successfully produced, the clerk can request a cut-off; such that any subsequent
attempts to produce this report will only look at Transactions that have taken place
since the cut-off was invoked.

All of these reports need to change such that a cut-off is taken and the next report

last time the summary report was cut-off. This is a new type of cut-off
functionality. Note that an implicit cut-off will occur when the branch is moved
to a new Trading Period. [BT116]

Note that there is currently no Counter Weekly Redeemed Savings Stamps report, however one is
being introduced for S80. See section 2.5.1.3.4.

2.5.1.4 Balancing and Rollover

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Changes to Rollover processing
= Branch Trading Reports

= Remove Extended CAPs

These are discussed further below.

2.5.1.4.1 Changes to Rollover processing

The March 2003 costings assumed no change to this process and so no costs were defined in this
area.

This supports the Business Processes Produce Trial Balance and Produce Final
Balance.

In general, the Stock Unit Balancing process will be very similar to that which is
currently in place. The following highlights the changes: [BT038]

The following are the main areas for change:

= Checking that a Stock Unit is balanced before allowing a Trial Balance to be
produced.

= Handling Discrepancies prior to Rolling over

This check is similar to the one carried out at logon (see section 2.5.1.6).

2.5.1.4.1.2 Handling Discrepancies prior to Rolling over

At the point where the user decides whether the rollover is to a new Trading Period or
to a new Balance Period within the current Trading Period, additional checks are
required.

If the rollover is to a new Trading Period (as opposed to a Balance period):

= then any Nett Discrepancy needs to be transferred from the Stock Unit to the
Branch’s Local Suspense Account. This is done by generating a pair of
transactions such that the first transaction causes the cumulative value of the
Discrepancy products for that SU becomes zero and the other transaction is
generated to balance this transaction is-balanced-by-a-transaction against the Local
Suspense Account product. These transactions should be carried out in Mode

cleared. If it has not yet been cleared a dialogue is introduced to allow it to be
cleared at the time.

There is a requirement (that emerged in the UI workshops) that different
“products” are available for settlement depending upon the type of branch. The
rules for which products should be available are as follows:

a If Local Suspense has an overall gain (ie cash needs to be removed from the
till to balance it), then one list of products needs to be presented

a If Local Suspense has an overall loss (ie cash needs to be put in the till to
balance it), then a separate list of products needs to be presented

dt is proposed that each of these lists is presented as a Product Group which
identifies the relevant products. Some products may be non-core and they should
only be included in the pick list if they are available to be transacted in the branch
(as is the normal case for pick lists). Similarly some products may have minimum
or maximum values defined for them (in the normal way) and again they should
only be included in the list if the amount required to clear local suspense (ie the
ive of the amount in local suspense) is valid.

Should the selected product fail to be transacted then a suitable message should be
displayed to the user and they then have the opportunity to select a different
product or to abandon the rollover (using the Prev or Home buttons as normal).

A consequence of this is that the Final Balance Report may differ from the Trial
Balance report.
2.5.1.4.1.3 Producing the Trial Balance / Final Balance report

The actual Stock Unit Balance report that is produced (both for Trial and Final
Balances) will be amended as follows: [BT007]

The following are the areas in which changes are required:
= Header

Standard report header changes to remove CAP from the Header are required
here.

= Discrepancies Section

After the existing Discrepancy details, there is a need to add in the new lines for
the “Cash Made Good” and “Excess Cash removed” events. This information
should be obtained from the events recorded at the time (see section 2.5.1.2.3). A
total is also required. [BT032]

Note that on a Final Balance following a Trading Period Rollover, the Nett
discrepancy line will be zero.

= Balance Section

Since Stock is to be held by volume rather than value, then Volume Stock
holdings should be removed from this section.

This is to be achieved by including a new set of mappings on all stock product
Reference Data and included in all Stock Transactions known as Tertiary

Mappings. These Tertiary Mappings will be in addition to the existing mappings
included on the Transactions.

If a Transaction has a Tertiary Mapping, then it is ignored when constructing this
section of the table. This will result in only those Inventory products with no
Tertiary Mappings (eg cash, cheques, other stamps or Foreign Exchange) being
included in this section of the Balance Report.

= Receipts Section
All Volume stock movements will need to be included in the receipts section.

If an Item has a Tertiary mapping then this should be used instead of its Primary
mapping when building up this part of the report.

In addition a further lines will be required for Local Suspense Transfers. Fhis-can

Revaluation Up transactions will no longer occur, so the “Reval Up” line should
be suppressed if it is zero.

It should be noted that since Volume Stock Remittances will have zero value, then
their value will be excluded from the Remittance part of this section. The same
also applies to Volume Stock Transfers.

= Payments Section

If an Item has a Tertiary mapping then this should be used instead of its Primary
mapping when building up this part of the report.

implementation should allow for it rather than exclude it.

Revaluation Down transactions will no longer occur, so the “Reval Down” line
should be suppressed if it is zero.

It should be noted that since Volume Stock Remittances will have zero value, then
their value will be excluded from the Remittance part of this section. The same
also applies to Volume Stock Transfers.

= Stock Section

This is a new section. Its purpose is to provide the current balance (by volume) of
all stock items that are held by volume. This can be done by selecting all stock
items (including the opening balance for the period) that have tertiary mappings,
but building the report based on the primary mappings. Such a figure will take
into account all Remittances and Transfers.

In order to support the revised reprinting functionality, the data used to build up the
report needs to be stored as a BLOB so that the report can be re-printed without the
original transactions being present.

2.5.1.4.1.4 Rolling over the data into the next Trading Period

future, less data needs to be generated. The following defines what data needs to be
generated following the Stock Unit Rollover:

Opening Balances of all Inventory Products. This includes

eo Stock (this should just be a volume with a zero value other than those
exceptional products covered in section 2.5.1.1.2.4)

Any such item that has a Tertiary mapping should include a “dummy” Tertiary
mapping to ensure that it is handled correctly on the Balance Reports.

o Cash and near cash (eg cheques and ForEx)
c Suspense products

This data is currently written to the messagestore as part of the SU Rollover
process and, other than holding the carried forward stock with zero value (if there
are Tertiary Mappings present), no further changes are required.

Summary Information from the Balance Report to support the Branch Trading
Statement.

This data will be held in a Persistent Object as described in section 3.4.3.

Branch Trading Reports

This is the replacement for the Cash Account report.

This supports the Business Process Produce and Confirm Trading Statement.
[BT008, BT032, BT041, BT043]

It is assumed that the existing Office Rollover button will trigger this report instead of
the current Cash Account Report.

The processing when the button is touched is as follows:

1)
2)
3)

4)

The normal “Produce Report” screen is displayed
The Report tablet will include “Trading Period” and the current week

All the current checks made prior to allowing a Trial Cash Account to be
produced are made except that the check for non-value stock can be removed.
[BT063]

The report can then be built up as follows:

Perhaps this is too detailed for a DP, however I've included it since it is my way of clarifying my
understanding of the requirement.

Details defined in the UIDP.

b) The-data-in-each-column-is-based-on-the The first column provides an
Office Total and is obtained by summing the values in the row. The

are too many Stock Units to fit on a single page, then additional pages

In order to support the revised reprinting functionality, the data used to build up the
report needs to be stored as a BLOB so that the report can be re-printed without the

It may be sufficient to rely on the underlying Stock Unit rollovers maintaining this info.

Need to allow for an early rollover of one of the SUs.

2.5.1.4.3 Remove Extended CAPs

The Office Balancing Menu currently has a button to allow Cash Accounts to be
extended to 2 or 3 weeks.

This button should be removed, thus removing this functionality since it no longer
makes sense with Branch Trading Statements. [BT045]

2.5.1.5 EOD

There are a number of aspects to this:
= Removal of LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions
= POL FS Summarisation at counter
= Maintenance of Office Variances Persistent Object
a LFS EOD functionality changes to handle changes in Cash Declarations
= Simplification of EPOSS Reconciliation
= Protection against lost data
The current APS EOD Reconciliation function will remain unchanged. [BT059]
These are discussed in the following sub-sections.
2.5.1.5.1 Removal of LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions

The current LFS Weekly Stock Reporting functions which are run early on
Wednesday; Thursday and Friday mornings and again on Friday evening, should be
removed from the Counter Applications Schedule since they are no longer required.

It is proposed that the code is left in the counter rather than actually being removed.

Strictly not part of EOD, but that’s as good a place to mention it as any other.

In theory it could be done tomorrow, but we need to understand what constraints there might be
from testing as to when it is removed. The actual removal is a change to the Reference Data that
controls the CAS.

2.5.1.5.2 POL FS Summarisation at counter

This functionality was introduced as part of Impact Release 1 at S60. With the move
to Transaction Summarisation at the Data Centre (see section 2.5.2.8), this
functionality will no longer be required other than perhaps to calculate the Carried
Forward cash position for the SAP ADS ONCH data flow. Because of this
dependency, it is simplest to leave the functionality unchanged.

2.5.1.5.3 Maintenance of Office Variances Persistent Object

In order to support the Variance Report (described in section 2.5.1.2.2) a new function
is required as part of EOD processing to calculate information for the report.

This function will assemble the data needed for that day’s portion of the Office
Persistent Object.

It will also handle the bringing forward of data from previous days in the case where
no cash declaration is done (either where it is “forgotten” or the Drawer / Stock Unit
is unused for a day).

This has changed. Need to align with HLD,

I'm not 100% sure that the HLD is right yet so T'll leave this for now.

The information that needs to be assembled and the way in which it is calculated is:

= Suspense

Is there an appropriate accounting node (or pair of nodes) that will enable data Server to
calculate this easily?

WW: I don’t think there is. The suspense nodes are spread throughout the accounting hierarchy,
not conveniently under a single node or even a node pair. There is a collection, SuspenseGroups
which defines what goes onto the Suspense Account report in terms of EPOSSProduct pairs. This
may be sufficient for our purposes. If not, it might be possible to extend this collection to include
the appropriate EPOSSNodes as well.

This level of detail can be sorted out in the HLD.

Local Suspense

This can presumably be done in a similar way to Suspense. It is probably OK to treat Local
Suspense in the same way as Suspense for most purposes.

How is this done? Presumably can be done by checking all the SU Objects and building up an
appropriate list.

This level of detail can be sorted out in the HLD.

2.5.1.5.4 LFS EOD functionality changes to handle changes in Cash Declarations

It has now been decided that it is simplest to leave this functionality unchanged.

2.5.1.5.5 Simplification of EPOSS Reconciliation

The current EPOSS Reconciliation function runs each day as part of the EOD set of

tasks. At present this is a fairly complex set of tasks, however once the cash account

has been removed, then it should be possible to simplify it significantly to a simple

check that all Transactions have been successfully harvested.

There is an issue with the reconciliation as proposed. What it does is allow reconciliation of
those Transactions that are being passed to OPTIP, not those transactions that are being passed
to POLE

We have considered making changes to the Reconciliation process to enable us to reconcile the
POL FS subset of transactions rather than the POL MIS subset, however making such a change
would require a CP io be raised, and this is tikely to be rejected on the grounds that there is no
chance of getting it included in 880 timescales.

Given the various checks that are in place, it seems safe to leave things as they are, Dis
with CS support this approach.

Should this move to section 2.3?

2.5.1.5.6 Protection against lost data

This is a new EOD Check that is required to protect against the potential loss of data
as discussed earlier in section 2.5.1.1.1.4. [BT115]

This check needs to be run on all counters every night as part of the EOD process.
However it is not important when in the EOD sequence it is actually run.

A check is required on the following:
= How many days ago was the Branch rolled over into the current Trading Period?

= For each stock Unit in the Branch that is still current (ie not Deleted), how many
days ago was it last rolled over into a new Trading Period?

In order to support this, the StockUnit Persistent Object and the EPOSSOffice CAP
Persistent Object will both need to include a new field “Date of last Trading Period
Rollover”, so that this check can easily be made without trawling through the
messagestore.

The Largest number of days detected from these checks needs to be calculated and
this number needs to be compared against a configurable parameter (configurable via
Type C Reference data to allow tuning — the proposed value is 38 days).

If the number of days exceeds the threshold, then the Riposte configuration parameter
DisableArchiving needs to be checked and if it is currently set to 0 it should be set to
1. Regardless of whether the parameter is changed an Error Event should be raised to
alert SMC.

POL00038916
Fujitsu Services IMPACT Release 3 Design Proposal Ref.: EA/DPR/004

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

If the number of days does not exceed the threshold, then the Riposte configuration
parameter DisableArchiving needs to be checked and if it is currently set to 1 it
should be reset to 0. There is no need to record an error event in this case.

Simon has suggested that we may need to do some work to produce a report on these events to
pass to POL. This is excluded from the current costs. [BTO51]

NB: Any such reporting would be a Data Centre function and have no impact on the counter.

2.5.1.6 Logon Checks

This is a new requirement and wasn’t included in the March 2003 costings.

There are a number of aspects to this:

= ONCH run for “yesterday”

= Stock Unit in correct Trading Period
= Outstanding Transaction Corrections
® Protection against Data Loss

These are discussed in the following sub-sections.

2.5.1.6.1 ONCH run for “yesterday”

The checks currently carried out as part of the logon process that an ONCH
declaration was made the previous day, should be amended to check that a Cash
Declaration was made the previous day. If no cash declaration was made the previous
day, the user will be forced invited to make a declaration at that time; but siay-desiine

there ino option to decline) [BT028]

2.5.1.6.2 Stock Unit in correct Trading Period

The existing check that a Stock Unit is running in the correct Cash Account Period
(based on the Cash Account Weeks Reference Data), needs to be modified such that
the check is based on the Trading Period (based on the Trading Period Calendar).

In order to spread the workload at the centre, different branches will be configured (in
the Branch’s “Outlet Reference Data”) with an “Offset” (in days) from the eperate-to
different Trading Period Calendars aad-each—villindicatesvhat-Calendarit-should

2.5.1.6.3 Outstanding Transaction Corrections

This supports the Business Process Receive Automated Message.

Is the list of Roles configurable by Type C Ref data? DP says yes, HLD doesn’t mention it,

In order to inform the Postmaster that a Transaction Correction has arrived in the
branch for processing, and additional check is required on logon for any user with a
Role of Manager or Supervisor (actual list of Roles to be defined in Reference Data
see section 3.5), to see if there are any unprocessed Transaction Corrections.

Process Transaction Correction function immediately. Such a check should take
place after all other existing checks.

An event needs to be recorded when a user is prompted. Section 20.15 of [CDBT]
defines how the event should be categorised. This is a new event with Identifier 62
and needs to include a parameter indicating the number of Outstanding Transaction
Corrections.

2.5.1.6.4 Protection against Data Loss

This is a new logon check. The logic
in section

s similar to that done at End of Day described

A check is required on the following:
= How many days ago was the Branch rolled over into the current Trading Period?

= How many days ago was the current Stock Unit rolled over into the current
Trading Period?

If either of these periods is greater than a configurable parameter (configurable via
Type C Reference data to allow tuning ~ the proposed value is 38 days), then a
warning is displayed to the user indicating this fact.

2.5.1.7 Process Transaction Correction

The March 2003 costings for this assumed that a centrally generated memo view was sufficient
and so no counter functionality was required. Any counter work is therefore in addition to the
March 2003 costings.

This supports the Business Process Handle Transaction Corrections.
There are a number of aspects to this:
= Actual Processing of the Transaction Corrections
= Selecting Transaction Corrections
= Reporting on Transaction Corrections
These are discussed in the following sub-sections.
2.5.1.7.1 Actual Processing of the Transaction Corrections

This is new functionality to automate the processing of Transaction Corrections (a
replacement for Error Notices). It is only available to those Roles who can do an
Office Balance (ie Manager, Supervisor, Migrate, Auditor and Auditor - Emergency
Manager). This will be controlled using normal Menu Security functionality.

This function will be activated by a new button on Horizon or as part of the logon
process (see section 2.5.1.6). [BT025]

Given the security requirements, it is simplest to add the button to the Housekeepng
menu,

When the function is invoked, the user will be presented with a list of outstanding

corrections are found.

The list should be a picklist with the Transaction Corrections ordered based on Date
and Time generated. If multiple Transaction Corrections have the same Date and
Time generated, then they are further ordered based on the TC Reference field.

TC Reference is a concatenation of Iteration flag and Reference Id.

The user can then select a Transaction Correction from the list and process it.

Once a Transaction Correction has been selected for processing the system needs to
ensure that no other user is able to select that Transaction Correction for processing.

NB if it is simpler to lock out users from all TC processing rather than just locking out an
individual TC, then this is acceptable.

Also need to consider inhibiting this on an isolated Node.

The user will be shown what effect the Transaction Correction will have on their
branch position by displaying the Text field associated with the Transaction
Correction and will be invited to select one of up to 3 options associated with the
Transaction Correction (as specified in the Allowed Modes field).

[TCAIS] defines the interface in detail and in particular defines the 6 options that can
be presented to the user (though for any one Transaction Correction a maximum of 3
are available). Each of these Options is required to correspond to a new Settlement
Mode to simplify the passing of the data back to POL FS through the normal
Summarisation interface.

(CTRDEC] Seetion-3
Attribute Grammar.

defines how the Transaction Correction is to be held as

Depending on the mode selected the Transaction Correction will be processed as
follows:

= Mode MG (Make Good)

The Transaction Correction will define the Product to be transacted
(<Data.Article:>) and the accounting sense (<Data.AccountingSense:>), and also
the Product against which the Transaction Correction should be settled
(<Data.Instruction:>).

Following the UNDP discussions, it has now been agreed that in the following

circumstances the “Instruction” product may be substituted. These circumstances

are:

a If “Instruction” is “cash” (ie Product 1) and the accounting sense is such that
cash must be put in the till (ie TCINV — or do I mean TCCRM?)

a Then, Cheque can be used instead.

And so could Debit Card when CP 3785 is implemented.

= Modes HD (Plead Hardship), WO (Wrote Off) or AN (Assign to Nominee)

The Transaction Correction will define the Product to be transacted
(<Data.Article:>) and the accounting sense (<Data.AccountingSense:>).
Settlement will be against a fixed Settlement Product for the selected mode.

This fixed product would be defined in the normal ModeParameters Type C
Reference Data.

= Mode EV (Request Evidence)

In the case of Mode EV two transactions are written against the article Product,
one positive and one negative, thus having a null effect on the Branch accounts.
However both transactions will be passed to POL FS so that they can tell that this
has happened.

= Mode SW (Stock Write On / Off)

In this case there will just be a single transaction (with Quantity and no value)
against the Article product (<Data.Article:>). Since it has no value, then there is
nothing to settle.

In all cases the transactions that are generated by this process (including any
settlement transactions) need to include the TC Reference (<Data.Ref:>) and the
additional data field (<Data:AddRef:>) so that it can be passed to POL FS.

These should be put into two new attributes under
<EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData:> called Ref and AddRef.

Note that there are potential requirements to handle adjustments to both value and volume, In
this case we will need to use the loss price if available for the products.

Assumed out of scope.

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

When the Transaction Correction is processed a Transaction Correction Processed
message should be written as part of the same Riposte Transaction, thus enabling
reports to understand the outcome of the Transaction Correction and to ensure that it
is not reprocessed.

It will also be possible to abandon the Transaction Correction. Should the
Transaction Correction be abandoned, then there will be no impact on the system and
the Transaction Correction will still appear in the list of outstanding Transaction
Corrections and may be processed by a suitably empowered user at a later time.
However any locks applied to prevent other users processing the Transaction
Correction will need to be removed.

Should the user select one of the options associated with the Transaction Correction,
then the underlying Transactions defined in the Transaction Correction will be applied
in the Stock Unit in which the user is currently assigned.

Should any of the associated Transactions fail validation for whatever reason, a
suitable message will be displayed to the user providing them with information to
raise a Help Desk call. The Transaction Correction will then be marked as having
been processed, though no underlying transactions will actually be performed.

A consequence of this is that a new method needs to be made available by EPOSS
Core, such that it is possible to pass it a Transaction and to decide whether or not it is
valid. If it is decided it is valid, then any subsequent request to write that Transaction
would always succeed.

This is necessary since at present any problems with the parameters would result in
prompts to the user about “miss-typed transactions”.

2.5.1.7.2 Selecting Transaction Corrections

[CTRDEC] Seetien-3-3.2-describes how a Transaction Correction is stored within the
messagestore. Transaction Corrections can be easily identified by having a
<WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC> attribute and a <Data.Refi> and <Datatter:> TEId:=
attributes containing the unique Transaction Correction Reference defined by POL
FS.

A simple scan of the messagestore looking for all such messages will identify all
Transaction Corrections that have been received in the branch.

T suggest that the whole store is searched. It would help if the query is as refined as possible to
search on <WAlndex.LFSFlag:TC><Application:TC>, and only for the Correspondence server
Nodes.

This can be defined in the HLD. But it isn’t yer!

Once a Transaction Correction has been processed (as described in section 2.5.1.7.1),
then a Transaction Correction Processed message is written containing the
<WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP> attribute.

This mechanism then enables all Outstanding Transaction Corrections to be easily
identified as being those with a <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC> message and no
corresponding <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP> message for any given Transaction
Correction Reference.

Similarly all those Transaction Correction References with both a
<WAIndex.LFSFlag:TC> message and a corresponding <WAIndex.LFSFlag:TP>
message identify those Transaction Corrections that have been processed.

2.5.1.7.3 Reporting on Transaction Corrections

Two new reports are required to provide information about Transaction Corrections.
These are: [BT065]

= Outstanding Transaction Corrections Report
= Processed Transaction Corrections Report

Section 20.3 in Appendix B of [CDBT] defines the structure of these reports which
are both similar. Detailed definition of the report layouts will be defined as part of the
High Level Design phase in fCDIAG}[DIAGDEC].

The principle difference between the two reports is in selecting which Transaction
Corrections are to be reported on. This is described in section 2.5.1.7.2.

2.5.1.8 MiMAN

This is an aspect that was forgotten in the original design.

MiMAN is a desktop component that handles the initial startup of a new Branch in
Horizon.

It was designed to support the initial rollout of Horizon and enables opening values to
be input to Horizon to represent the state of each Stock Unit at the time that the Stock
Unit switches from manual processing to Horizon.

It is now primarily used when a new Branch opens or reopens after a long term
temporary closure.

MiMAN is driven by the Cash Account Reference Data and provides a fast
mechanism for taking on the opening position.

It is proposed that MiMAN is replaced by a simple function that identifies whether or
not the Branch should be opening in CAP of TP mode and sets up an initial opening
balance of zero and initialises the current CAP / TP as appropriate.

Uf anything other than this is required, then a CR/ CP will be required.

I need to define how we can control the initial decision benveen CAP / TP using the Soft Launch

mechanism.
2.5.2 Host Components
2.5.2.1 RDMC

Is there an impact on RDT?

The main changes here are to support the new Reference Data that will be received
from POL as Type A Reference Data. This will be defined in [RDSAIS].

In addition there will be a Check function provided which will ensure the integrity of
the summarisation Reference Data. In particular it will need to ensure that all Product
/ Mode combinations have a defined mapping onto an Article. If this isn’t the case,
then there is a risk that when the transactions from a branch are summarised that they
will not balance to zero.

2.5.2.2 LFS

Nothing was included in the March 2003 costings in this area.

The weekly Stock Reporting functionality can be removed. This affects both the LFS
Agent and the LFS Host. Since the information is currently unused, it might as well
be removed as soon as LFS is upgraded at the Data Centre. [BT058]

It has now been decided that the simplest way to do this is to change the LFS
Harvester such that it no longer attempts to Harvest the Stock Statements. At the
simplest level this is purely a case of removing the filter from the LFS Harvester, but
the opportunity should also be taken to remove the associated code modules that
process the Stock statements and in particular the modules that access the Stock tables
in the LFS Host

The LFS Host (and Maestro schedules) can then be enhanced to remove these tables
and the associated modules that process Stock Statements.

The following additional events are required:

Note that additional Product Ids will need to be provided by Post Office Ltd onto
which these Event Ids should be mapped by the agent. These Product Ids will be
formally defined in [MISAIS] once they have been allocated by the Post Office
Reference Data team.

= In order to support the generation of individual Transactions for POL FS, it is
necessary to pick up the various Reference attributes if they are present.

Reference attributes will be present on Remittance Balancing transactions (in
Attribute <EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.PouchId:>) and also for Transaction
Corrections (in Attributes <EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.Ref:> and
<EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.AddRef:>).

need to be retained while data is still being passed to OPTIP, however once the
branches are no longer operating on CAPs, it will no longer be sensible to report
on this.

Therefore, it is proposed that an additional check is included in the TPS Harvester.
When the Stock Unit Persistent Object is retrieved in order to calculate the CAP
and BP a check is made as to whether that Stock Unit is currently operating in
Cash Account or a Branch Trading Period mode ee-section 2-63-22). If the
Stock Unit is operating in a Branch Trading Period mode, the Stock Unit
Persistent Object will contain an attribute <Data.TP:> with a non-null value. In
this case no further attempt should be made to calculate CAP or BP and values of
zero should be input into the TPS Interface tables. Note that if no Stock Unit
Persistent Object is found (for example because it has been deleted since the
transaction took place), then again values of zero should be returned. If TPS is in
the early stages of migration, then this will result in the Transaction being handled
as an Exception, but that is no different to what happens at present.

ws Currently the CAPTrailer message is picked up in order to harvest Cash Account
related data. If the branch is operating in Branch Trading Period mode,
{identified by the presence of an attribute <Data.TP:> with a non-null value in the
EPOSSOffice CAP Persistent Object) then no further processing is required

2.5.2.5 DRS Host

The following changes are needed here:
= Remove reporting based on CAP (eg NB103) [BT062]

Dev are concerned that POL haven't thought through the full implications on this on the Pol
Reconciliation processes.

a Remove the NB103 drilldown functionality on the DRS Workstation

Potentially this should be done some time later since this is used to look at historic reports.

See also section 2.6.2

= Inanumber of the NB102 reports the CAP column will be blank.
The specific sections are 2, 3, 4,5, 8,9, 10 & 11.
No change will be made to these reports for Impact R3.

We should look at removing this column in a future release, but leave it there for Impact R3.

= The DRS function that copies in data from TPS Host about Cash Account
Delivery to POL needs to stop doing that. Note that the function cannot be
removed altogether since it also copies in data on non-polled offices and it is
assumed that this is still required.

Other than that the reconciliation process remains unchanged. [BT059]

In particular the reconciliation process remains unchanged. [BT059]
2.5.2.7 Generate MIS Info

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.

This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

Problems have been identified in the current AIS / implementation (which is based on the OPTIP
feed):

+ Currenily all transactions other than Cash and Bureau are sent at their absolute values
+ There are no AIS Rules for Cash signage for Transaction Correction Modes

The introduction of Transaction Correctiosn implies that we will need to support signs on any TC
transactions and we ened io understand what impact this has on all signs.

One possibility is to send all transactions as signed. mple for TPS, but will probably
require s change in POL MIS. Another is to take account of the “Accounting Sense”
Ref Data when mapping signs and this will probably result in current mappings for most current
products. Then just need to consider the impact on TC product

This process takes the transactions and events from the Temporary Transaction Store
and passes them to POL MIS in a file as described in section 3.2.7. [BT043]

This process will be similar to the current process that produces the Transaction Files
for OPTIP, however the file format has changed as described in section 3.2.7. One
further change is that Settlement Transactions are not to be passed through to MIS.
Settlement Transactions are identified by having an Attribute Transfer_Txn_To_MIS
set in the Product Reference Data for the Product

2.5.2.8 Transaction Summarisation

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.
This supports the Business Processes Accumulate Transactions for Summarisation.

Currently this is being done at the Branch and the summaries are harvested into TPS
for passing onto POL FS.

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area. This is because we
have chosen to do this as it makes the overall system simpler.

However what is now proposed is a new Summarisation function at the Data Centre
that will run as part of the normal overnight processing after the day’s data has been
harvested.

Summarisation is a three-stage process:

= Initial Summarisation of Product and Mode
= Summarisation for POL FS

= Summarisation for HR SAP

These are discussed further below.

2.5.2.8.1 Initial Summarisation of Product and Mode

All Transactions are summarised by Product / Mode combinations such that for each
Branch and Trading Day there is a single Summary Record for each combination of
Product / Mode that has taken place during the Trading Day. So as to support
Migration (see section 2.6.3.1.3), separate summaries are produced for each CAP,
thus enabling those transactions produced prior to Migration Point 30 to be separated
from those that take place after this point.

Note that those Product / Mode combinations that are defined in the POL FS
Summarisation Reference Data as needing to be passed through to POL FS at a
transaction level are not summarised, but passed through as individual transactions
into the intermediate summarisation tables.

2.5.2.8.2 Summarisation for POL FS

A further set of summarisation, based on Reference Data, then maps the Product /
Mode summaries for each Branch / Trading Day onto the data to be passed to the
relevant POL FS Accounts (based on Articles).

Only Initial Summaries for a CAP greater than the CAP that triggers Point 30 are
considered. All other initial summaries are ignored by this process.

The rules for Summarisation are as follows:

1) For each set of Transactions that have been summarised by Horizon Product
and Mode they can be further summarised as follows:

a) Reference Data will define the Article associated with the given
Horizon Product.

b) This Article will have associated one or mode Article Modes
corresponding to the Horizon Mode under which the Product was
transacted.

c) If there is a single Article Mode for all Modes, then that Article Mode
is used to accumulate the details for all the transactions for that
Horizon Product

d) If there are a number of different Article Modes for different Modes,
then the appropriate one is used to accumulate the details for all the
transactions for that Horizon Product carried out in the appropriate
Mode

2) If the Article Mode is described as being “non-summarised”, then the
underlying transactions need to be preserved without being summarised.

—- Such ra? hould—be-held-—in-thi 3 4 if-th
Beetle
3) A number of attributes are associated with the Article Mode and these will

need to be passed to POL FS with the associated Records.

A potential problem is that some transactions will have failed Harvesting and will
subsequently be passed through when they are repaired.

Recent analysis shows a number of causes:

BP

¢ Delete Stock Unit results in a zero CAP / BP

+ BdC problem where Reference Data allows a currency to be transacted, but First Rate
doesn’t provide a spot rate for that currency.

In all these cases the transactions would be OK as far as Summarisation is concerned. It is
proposed that these constraints are removed (see section 2.5.2.14). However Summarisation will
need to allow for potential errors.

The current frequency of such problems is about once per week so they can be handled manually
by the SSC.

In order to handle the case where Transactions are known to be missing (ie they have
failed harvesting), then there is no point in attempting to produce a sub-file for
passing to POL FS since it will be incomplete. Such cases can be detected by
examining the TPS Harvester Exceptions tables. Should any Transactions be in these
tables, the summaries should be held back for processing on a subsequent day when
the exceptions have been processed. A mechanism is required to take the corrected
exceptions and add them into the appropriate summaries.

A check is also required that all the data in a sub-file has a net value of zero. Should
this not be the case, then an exception needs to be raised and the summaries held back
until a correcting transaction is generated to enable the sub-file to balance correctly.

In theory this can’t happen, however in practice there could be bugs in the system or perhaps
even Reference Data errors that will cause this to occur. Therefore we need to allow for it.

We don’t want to repeat the mistakes we made with the original TPS processing where we
assumed that such errors couldn't happen!

James has confirmed that this holding back of sub-files is unlikely to give us SLA problems.

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

2.5.2.8.3 Summarisation for HR SAP

Only Initial Summaries for a CAP greater than the CAP that triggers Point 30 are
considered. Afl other initial summaries are ignored by this process.

A separate set of summarisation, again based on Reference Data, maps the Product /
Mode summaries for each Branch / Trading Day onto the data required for HR SAP
based on CTT Numbers. Note that not all Branches are required for HR SAP
summarisation (though it may be simpler to summarise for all branches and discard
those not required when the interface is built for HR SAP each month, since the
numbers of branches not required are fairly low - it is the Directly Managed Branches
of which there are about 600).

It is proposed that sets of summarisations are held for each branch for each target Pay
Period (as defined in Reference Data). Each day, the intermediate summaries
(described in section 2.5.2.8.1) are added into the set of summaries for the appropriate
Pay Period based on the Trading Date for which the transactions making up the
summaries took place. Note that for some CTT numbers (specifically Lottery
transactions), the summaries will need to be added into an earlier Pay Period than
others. This will be defined as part of the mapping Reference Data.

Any corrected Transactions (following Harvesting exceptions) also need to be added
into the appropriate set of summaries based on their Trading Date.

such and any attempt to add further data into those summaries should result in the
data being included in the next period. ption—be tod fi 4

2.5.2.9 Accept CAPO Data

The requirement for this has been removed and so the rest of this section has been deleted.

2.5.2.10 Generate HR SAP Info

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system. [BT112]
This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

PO:

Currently, Postmasters pay is calculated based on the work that they did 2 months ago
other than for Lottery Transactions, where it is based on the work done in the previous
month. In order to support this, data about transactions undertaken during a pay
period are passed to HR SAP each month to support a run of the payroll system. An
added complication is that for those branches where the contract is with a separate
organisation (such as Tescos) rather than an individual, the data has to be made
available to HR SAP ina separate file for a separate payroll run.

POL are planning to simplify this such that all Postmasters / multiples will be paid
based on the previous months trading data. However it is not yet agreed when this
might happen, so we have designed the summarisation and file generation
mechanisms to support the current interface.

The summarisation process (including any complexities associated with accounting
for Lottery transactions “early”) is described in section 2.5.2.8.3. This process is
purely concerned with the ability to generate the two separate files each month to
contain the data for the relevant branches.

A single file generation process is required, however a parameter will be required
indicating whether it is to produce the files for the “multiples” (as—defined—in

fARSAPAISH) or the-file for the bulk of the branches (as-definedin fHRSAPAIS2P.
The format of both files is defined in [HRSAPAIS1].

This parameter will also control which branches should be included in the selection of
summarisation data. The identification of Branches into these two categories (or as
not required for HR SAP) will be done through Reference Data.

There is no requirement to consider the case of a branch changing its categorisation
during a month. In order to detect the situation where data comes from branches after
the data has been sent to HR SAP, the process should mark all summaries that have
been sent to HR SAP thus enabling the summarisation process to include them in the
next period’s summaries. raise-an-exception-in-this-ease: All data should be sent even

if a branch has been closed.

It is assumed that this doesn't give us a problem in terms of Reference Data having removed a
closed branch. In particular the branch would be marked as ‘Closed’ rather than being
physically removed.

2.5.2.11 Generate POL FS Info

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area. This is because we
have chosen to do this as it makes the overall system simpler.

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.
This supports part of the Business Processes Deliver Data to External Systems.

A set of files is required to be generated each night for passing to POL FS. The
structure of the file is basically the same as for S60, however the detailed record
formats have changed. Instead of building up the summaries at the counter and
passing them straight through to the file generation function, the summarisation will
now take place at the Data Centre. Some transactions (as defined in Ref Data) will
still need to be passed through “un-summarised”. All records for a single Branch /
Trading Day should have a net value of zero. This needs to be checked as part of the
file generation process and exceptions should be raised if that isn’t the case.

In order to support SLA Monitoring, information needs to be passed to the POA Data
Warehouse defining which Subfiles have been delivered to POL FS and the number
of Transactions associated with these sub-files. The calculation of the number of
transactions is already being made for the flow to MIS, and there is no need to re-
calculate this. Any differences (eg due to exceptions) can be ignored.

2.5.2.12 Transaction Correction

This functionality will be done within the TPS Host system.

This component takes the file produced each night by POL FS of Transaction
Corrections and passes them on to the specified Branch. [BT113]

This is a standard File Load and Distribute process very similar to that used for LFS
Planned Orders and Replenishment Deliveries.

In addition to loading the data some mapping is required based on Reference Data
(see section 3.5).

This mapping will be used to convert the Article and Instruction fields of the
Transaction Correction into the corresponding Horizon Products. Checks are also
done that the resulting Horizon Products can be transacted for the amounts specified
in any of the Modes that are defined as part of the Transaction Correction.

In addition the Allowed Modes field needs to be mapped through to the list of actual
modes that are allowed to simplify the branch processing.

Any failures from the above checks will result in the failing Transaction Correction
being rejected, but the remaining ones being processed as normal.

Note that some of these checks are not currently defined in [TCAIS], therefore a CR
will need to be raised to update the AIS once the detailed design for this function has
been done.

2.5.2.13 POA Data Warehouse

There is no specific requirement on Fujitsu to make the changes in this area. However there are
requirements for us to measure and monitor various SLA and this work is in support of this.

The POA Data Warehouse will need to be aware of all file deliveries that we need to
monitor. Each interface needs to be considered separately in the following

2.5.2.13.1 POL FS File Delivery

What is needed here is to report on how many transactions that were harvested into
TPS and aggregated to create the individual sub-files that have been successfully
passed to POL FS each day in time for loading.

In order to measure the delivery, TPS must provide the Data Warehouse with a file of
records in the following format

individual transaction records that have been aggregated to create each sub-file. In
addition, an acknowledgement file must be generated by TPS that confirms the
date/time that each sub-file was delivered to POL FS. This file must be in the

Table 32 — HR SAP File Delivery Information
New meta data will be required in the Data Warehouse that measures successful
delivery as being within 72:00 hours + 21:30 hours of the C_date.

Note that should the TPS System Parameter controlling how early the file generation
process is to be run be changed, then the Data Warehouse measure will need to be
changed in line with it.

The Data Warehouse will need to be updated to accept NULL FAD Codes.
2.5.2.13.6 SAPADS to MIS File Delivery

The requirement for this has been removed and so the rest of this section has been deleted.

2.5.2.13.7 Transaction Corrections File Delivery

The existing mechanism for writing acknowledgement requests to the counter
following the delivery of inbound data will be used to measure the delivery of
Transaction Corrections. The acknowledgement agent will then harvest confirmation
of receipt of the data into OMDB and this information will be transferred to the Data
Warehouse where the performance will be reported. No changes are required to this
existing mechanism.

The TPS system will present the following metrics to the Agent Loader process in
order to facilitate the measurement
Metric This defines the type of data being loaded (le: Transaction Corrections). The value

for this will be ‘T001’
Receipt_Date I This is the date/time that the data was made available to TPS.

Table 33 — Transaction Correction Metrics

The only changes to the Data Warehouse should be the addition of Meta Data that
defines the new METRIC and RECEIPT_DATE cut-off time along with the target
SLA times to be measured for Days A through J.

2.5.2.14 TPS Host

A number of changes are required here:

m Since the Transactions for dummy Settlement Products will now be harvested in
order to support the POL FS Information flow, then it will be necessary to
explicitly suppress this data on the flow to OpTIP. This is done in the same way
as on the POL MIS flow (see section 2.5.2.7)

a The new events being harvested by the TPS Harvester (see Table 27 in
section 2.5.2.4) must not be passed through to OPTIP. Therefore the process that
generates the file for OPTIP needs to suppress those events should they be

harvested.

= In order to reduce the number of TPS Harvester Exceptions, which will result in
failures to deliver data to POL FS, a review is required of the constraints on the
TPS Harvester Interface tables, thus allowing some Transactions that are currently
handled as exceptions through to the main TPS system for processing.

It is proposed that the following constraints are removed at point D in the
migration process (see also section 2.6):

o That CAP and BP are greater than zero

Further constraints that can be relaxed may be identified as more detailed design progresses.
These will be captured in the HLD.

It will not be possible to relax all constraints on the TPS Harvester interface
tables, so this means that the Transaction Summarisation Function will need to be
able to handle such cases (see also section 2.5.2.8). Since the current failure rate
is very low (about I per week), it is proposed that this change to the constraints is
done as part of the switching of the interface from OPTIP to POL MIS thus
avoiding the need to filter out such transactions from the flow to OPTIP.

This has the effect of potentially increasing the number of failures in transaction summarisation
during the period when data is being sent to POL FS and to OPTIP, however given the expected
frequency at which such problem occur, this should be OK operationally,

See also section 2.6.3.1.1

a TPS is involved in a number of reconciliation processes. In general, these should
continue as they are [BT059]. Specifically:

a The APS Transactions should be generated as at present for passing to the
APS reconciliation system

co The checks on the Branch Reconciliation Totals generated at EOD should
continue

May need to make some changes here so as to support end to end reconciliation from the counter
to the POL FS feed.

However the calculation of the “mini cash account” to reconcile against the
Branch’s Cash Account summaries can be removed from the code. There is no

longer a requirement to support this functionality during the early stages of Impact

a Changes are required on the current interface of Bureau transactions to FRTS,
since the control file includes summaries based on CAP.

Note that the transactional data flow to the POA Data Warehouse remains unchanged.
Similarly, the CTS file will continue to be delivered unchanged, though it will no
longer be co-ordinated with the other OPTIP files.

MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS

The requirements for migration require further work. This section has made a number of
assumptions as to how it will work. Should these assumptions be incorrect, then CRs will be
raised when a fill migration design has been agreed.

There are a number of assumption in this section which are recorded in section 8.4

Migration Overview

Figure I is adapted from [CDBT] and shows a timeline for the different aspects of
migration. This diagram has been expanded in [MIGSTGY] to include POL FS
activities as well, however the simpler diagram is sufficient for this DP.

Figure 6 — Migration Timeline

Migration will occur over a period of time. The key migration points are:

= Data Centre Migration (Point 10)

= Counter Software Upgrade (Point 20)

= Switch to new POL FS Interface (Point 25)

= Running the Final Counter Cash Account for CBDB (Point 30)

= Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS (Point 40)

= Delayed Counter Software Upgrade (Point 45)

= Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement (Point 50)
[BT114]

These are described in more detail below.
Data Centre Migration

This will be the normal upgrade process that takes place over a single weekend. It
will ensure that all the Data Centre Systems are able to support the new functionality,

while also retaining support for the existing functionality, prior to it being switched
off.

Once this migration has taken place, it will be possible to receive the additional
Reference Data required to support the new functionality from NRDS and to
distribute it as required.

Tt is expected that NRDS will have been upgraded prior to this point so that the new
Reference Data can be prepared, thus enabling the new Reference Data to be
distributed as soon as the Horizon Data Centre is migrated. However until this point
the pre-S80 interface will be supported by NRDS in delivering Reference Data to
Horizon.

2.6.1.2 Counter Software Upgrade

This will follow the normal pattern for a Software rollout and include some initial trial
Branches to ensure that the process runs smoothly, prior to rolling the software out to
the full estate. Some of the new functionality will become active as soon as the
Branch is upgraded, while other functions will be controlled by a Soft Launch
mechanism and so be activated at a later time.

2.6.1.3 Switch to new POL FS Interface

In order to support a possible pilot of POL FS for full Impact R3 functionality, then it
is necessary to continue supporting the Impact RI interface to POL FS until the pilot
is complete. This allows TPS to support both flows in parallel. This delay in
switching the interface also allows time for the new Summarisation Reference Data to
be distributed from NRDS to Horizon.

Once the pilot is complete it is then necessary to switch to using the Impact R3
interface prior to the new data being generated.

This point is chosen so as to ensure that it occurs before any Branches are trading in
the CAP following the CAP that triggers Point 30. It is Post Office Ltd’s
responsibility to ensure that no Branch is running too many CAPs ahead of where it
should be. It is expected that setting this point 2 weeks before the scheduled Point 30
is sufficient to achieve this.

Should any Branch have rolled over into the CAP following Point 30 prior to this
point, then the Opening Figures and initial transactions for that Branch are likely to be
incorrect and will have to be manually corrected. It is Post Office Ltd’s responsibility
to make any such corrections in POL FS.

2.6.1.4 Running the Final Counter Cash Account for CBDB

It is a requirement of the POL FS designers that the switch over of the accounts from
CBDB to POL FS occurs at a single point in time, which coincides with a POL Month
End. [BT003] A specific Cash Account Week will be identified such that once that
Cash Account has been produced, all subsequent transactions will be summarised and
passed to POL FS. In addition a special migration flow of data will be required to
pass the Closing Figures from that Cash Account through to POL FS as Opening
Figures for the corresponding accounts.

POL will be required to ensure that all Branches generate this Cash Account on time.
This will ensure that we have a clean cutover.

There will also be some minor changes to the menu structures, particularly under the
Housekeeping menu at this point. Other than that, this should be invisible to Branch

staff.
As far as the Data Centre is concerned, this is the point at which the new Impact
Release 3 data is first sent to POL FS. #-i pected-that-the-intert: ibs

There may need to be an earlier pilot of a small number of branch’s data to a test POL FS.
Should such a pilot be supported, then there will need to be a period of a few days between
ending the pilot and switching to the new interface to POL FS, The design will only support such
a pilot while we are passing Live Data to the Live POL FS using the Impact R1 interface.

We have only provided for supporting the pilot in our development costs. No operational or test
support has been included since the migration strategy is not clear.

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

2.6.1.5 Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS

Once all Cash Account data from the final cash account has been successfully passed
to OPTIP, the Transactional flow to OPTIP can be discontinued and replaced by the
new flow to MIS.

This should be invisible to Branch staff.

This point also indicates that migration to POL FS is complete, so process used during
the migration can be stopped at this point. From this point onwards, the Data Centre
is operating the complete Impact R3 functionality.

Delayed Counter Software Upgrade

This point is included as a potential contingency for fallback should there be problems in keeping
to the development schedule.

It is not considered further in this document.

Should such a contingency be invoked, then a “sanity check” exercise is required to ensure that
no inconsistencies occur.

Should the counter rollout be delayed, a number of changes are required to the
migration strategy. The main one being that all functionality identified below as
being activated at Point 20 will, in fact be activated at Point 45 instead. It also means
that there will be no S80 functionality at the branch to support Point 30, and so this
will need to be achieved as a Reference Data change on a given effective date (ie just
after midnight on the day after Point 30).

This is not as good as what is proposed below with a “Rollover Triggered Soft Launch”, and in
particular may introduce problems for a Branch that doesn’t complete its rollover witil the
Thursday morning since Error Notices and Suspense items will not be available. There may also
be problems for any branches that rollover early and then use the Error Notice facilities in the
new CAP on Wednesday evening, since these would need to be passed to POL FS!

The acceptability of this approach will need to be agreed with POL.
2.6.1.7 Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement

At some later time the branches need to switch to using the new processes. This can
be done by different branches at different times, thus allowing a pilot to be supported.
However the changes in process at any branch need to occur immediately after rolling
over into a new Cash Account Period.

This will be achieved by introducing a new type of “Soft Launch” which will be
triggered as part of the rollover process to a specified Cash Account Period. This is
known as a “Rollover Triggered Soft Launch”.

This section has been restructured and so no attempt has been made to explicitly mark deletions.
New text is marked where possible.

As can be seen from Table 34, a number of migration activities need to take place
other than as part of the normal Software introduction changes.

These are:
= Data Centre Changes
o Switch on Transaction Correction Feed

a Switch the POL FS Feed from Impact Release 1 to Impact Release 3 interface
and generate Opening Balances where required

o Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS
o Generate HR SAP Info

co Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement
co Merging of Non-Value and Value Stock
a Support of nRDS supported Settlement Products

2.6.3.1 Data Centre Changes

The simplest way to describe the specific migration considerations is to go through
the Migration Points in turn

2.6.3.1.1 Point 10

At this point all new Data Centre processes are delivered and a Maestro scheduled is
produced that will run all the relevant proce: However some processes will be
designed such that they will test TPS System Variables to decide at which point in the
migration process the system is and where appropriate exit without doing any further
processing. This approach avoids the need to provide and test a number of different
Maestro schedules during the migration period.

2.6.3.1.2 Support of a POL FS Pilot
We are required to support a pilot of the migration to POL FS.

However there is no explicit numbered require this

Should such a pilot be required, then it will need to operate as follows:
= During the Pilot the existing S60 data flow to POL FS will continue as normal

ws In addition, the Initial Summarisation process and POL FS Summarisation
processes (described in sections 2.5.2.8.1 and 2.5.2.8.2) will be activated, together
with the POL FS migration processes described in section 2.6.3.1.3 to provide the
psuedo-S60 and Opening Figures flows to POL FS.

The TPS System Parameter that defines the Point 30 CAP will be set to the “Pilot
Point 30 CAP”

= Other tasks that are due for activation at Point 25 will not be run, thus ensuring
that there is no data being produced for HR SAP

= Once the pilot is complete, then any persistent data generated in POL FS as part of
the pilot needs to be cleared out and the various TPS System Parameters reset to
the correct values.

2.6.3.1.3 Point 25
This is the point where a lot of the new functionality starts to become active.
Specifically:
s Transaction Correction Processing is activated

However it is unlikely that any Transaction Correction files will be received until
some time later. Any alerting produced as a result of Transaction Correction Files
not being received need to be suppressed / ignored at this point.

How is this to be achieved?

Do we raise such alerts?

a The interface to POL FS is switched from the Impact Release 1 interface to the
Release 3 interface.

= Transaction Summarisation within TPS starts at this point. However in order to
support the migration requirements, the Initial Summarisation (described in
section 2.5.2.8.1) will produce separate summaries for each CAP within a Branch
and Trading Date.

a The normal Summarisation processes for POL FS and HR SAP (described in
sections 2.5.2.8.2 and 2.5.2.8.3 will restrict themselves to those initial summaries
where the CAP is greater than that defined as triggering Point 30, or as being
NULL (indicating that the branch has passed Point 50)

Due to still having the full TPS Harvester constraints until migration point 40, there will be an
increased likelihood of Summarisation failures during this early period.

Assumed to be acceptable.

« From this point onwards, HR SAP summarisation and File generation can operate
in “final form”.

= A separate POL FS Summarisation Process is provided that will summarise all
Cash and near-cash data from the Initial Summaries which have a CAP of less
than or equal to the CAP that triggers Point 30 and generate an appropriate
balancing transaction, thus ensuring that the Impact Release one subset of data
continues to be passed to POL FS at this time. In order to support this a special
set of “S60 mappings” will be defined as standing data within POL FS. This
mapping will be based on [POLFSMAP].

= In order to provide Opening Figures for POL FS, a further process is provided that
will take details from the Cash Account produced at the end of the CAP that
triggers Point 30 and generate the Opening Figures for all Stock, Suspense and
Discrepancy products other than those such as Cash and Cheques which are
already known to POL FS from Impact Release 1.

= Since CBDB is not concemed with any Cash Accounts beyond Point 30, the TPS
function that passes Cash Accounts through to OPTIP will suppress any Cash
Accounts for a CAP greater than Point 30. This is necessary since Point 40 is
likely to be over a week after Point 30.

2.6.3.1.4 Point 40

This is the point where a migration from CBDB to POL FS can be considered to be
complete from a Horizon Perspective.

Specifically:
= The migration process for POL FS (described above) can be withdrawn
« Switch of TMS feed of Transactions from OPTIP to MIS

2.6.3.2 Counter Changes

2.6.3.2.1 Process the final cash account for CBDB

In general this phase should have minimal impact on the branch processes. However
there are some changes required to the menu structures at this point. These changes
will be triggered by a new type of Soft Launch which is invoked as a result of the

Stock Unit or Branch rolling over into a specified CAP number defined in the Soft
Launch Reference Data. H-is-expectedthatthe+ toa Pod ager tise

This CAP will be flagged as requiring a Rollover Triggered Soft Launch quiescent
voHever (see section 2.6.3.2.5). This will ensure that the soft launch functionality is
triggered correctly.

It is expected that the same CAP will trigger this change across the full estate.
The changes that need to happen at this point are:

= The Permissions should be changed on the Housekeeping menu to restrict access
to Managers / Supervisors etc.

Since this is a global Reference Data change and it would be simplest to do this at
a fixed time across the estate. Therefore, a date will be chosen when most
branches have moved to S80, but prior to point 30. NB it shouldn’t matter if there
are still some branches on $75.

Provided branch staff are expecting this then there should be no problem, since it is anticipated
that only Managers / Supervisors should be attempting to use this functionality anyway.

Assumed OK.

a The existing Error Notice, Cash Shortage / Surplus and Vouchers buttons should
be removed from the Housekeeping Menus since these functions are no longer to
be used.

Note that any amounts held in Suspense Accounts that are removed at this point
will remain in Suspense until Transaction Corrections are introduced at Point 50,
and POL FS generate an appropriate Transaction Correction to clear the Suspense
item.

= Buttons to support the new “local write off’ products should become available on
the Housekeeping Menu (see section 9.3)

2.6.3.2.2 Upgrade of Counter processes to operate Branch Trading Statement

This is where the main changes occur at the Branch. Again it is triggered by a Soft
launch product linked to a given CAP. It is expected that in this case, different
branches will migrate at different CAPs.

The process is expected to operate as follows:
a Each Stock Unit will rollover into a new “CAP” following the pre-S80 processes.

As part of this rollover a new flag needs to be included in the Stock Unit
Persistent Object to indicate that this Stock Unit is now operating in Branch
Trading Period mode rather than Cash Account mode. This flag is needed so that
other processes such as the TPS Harvester can tell in which mode this Stock unit
is operating.

Version: 1.1
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/09/2004

This CAP will be flagged as requiring a Rollover Triggered Soft Launch quiescent
rollover (see section 2.6.3.2.5). This will ensure that the soft launch functionality
is triggered correctly.

= When all Stock Units have rolled over in this way (including inactive Stock
Units), the Office can then be rolled over into the new CAP and produce the final
Cash Account Report.

= From this point onwards, all reports will be in their new format and any
functionality identified as “Point 50” in Table 34 will be made available. In
particular the buttons used to invoke the non-value stock functions will be
removed.

2.6.3.2.3 Merging of Non-Value and Value Stock

This can be seen as a product introduction / change process. It is not expected that
any changes in functionality are required, however there will be changes to Reference
Data. Further analysis may be required on a product by product basis to sort out the
exact consequences.

This should be handled as an OBC change once all branches are operating on the new
processes. Any changes other than those handled through the normal OBC process
are currently out of scope. [BT055]

This is discussed in section 2.5.1.1.3 and there are some outstanding issues to be resolved before
I can consider this further.

Assumed out of scope.

2.6.3.2.4 Support of nRDS supported Settlement Products

There is probably no migration development required here as such, however there is a
need to identify exactly how this migration is to take place.

The current state is that we have Type C Reference Data that defines the current
Settlement Products with appropriate Product Mappings. We also have Product Mode
Reference Data that identifies the Settlement Products.

Moving to Type A Reference data may give us problems in that the existing Type C
Reference Data will be using a particular suffix, and we need to ensure that the new
Type A Reference Data will use an appropriate suffix and not clash and we have a
mechanism to end date the old Reference data and start-date the new reference Data
smoothly. There should be no need to co-ordinate this in terms of CAPs since both
products should have identical mapping s and so will be treated identically.

2.6.3.2.5 Support for Rollover Triggered Soft Launch

A new technique is introduced, that of a Rollover Triggered Sofi Launch. What this
means is that once a Stock Unit has rolled over into a specified CAP, the soft launch
mechanism is invoked so as to update the Horizon Menus to reflect the changes that
are required at that point.

It is proposed that this will operate as follows:

= The CAP for which this rollover is to apply is defined in Reference Data using the
standard Soft Launch control mechanisms.

m Whenever a Stock Unit completes a CAP rollover or a user logs in or is attached
to a different Stock Unit, the Soft Launch mechanism is invoked to ensure that the
correct Horizon Menus are displayed according to whether the Stock Unit is
operating before or after the “target CAP”.

Full details how this is achieved are described in [MIGOVW].

Need to define how we are to handle the case where multiple Soft Launch products are made
available with different target CAPs in the same Branch.

POL have indicated that we should take the earliest one.

Data Model

3.1 GENERAL

Figure 1 shows the interfaces between Horizon and other components involved in
Impact Release 3 and the breakdowns in Figure 2 to Figure 5 show the interfaces
between the components of Horizon. Figure 5 also shows some data stores. These
Interfaces and Data stores represent the Data Model. They can be divided into
External interfaces, Internal interfaces and Data Stores:

= External Interfaces
These are described in section 3.2
co Reference Data (section 3.2.1)
a Client Access (out of scope)
co Bank Statements (out of scope)
co Transaction Corrections (section 3.2.2)
co SAP ADS Transactions and Summaries (out of scope)
o Ledger Entry Information (section 3.2.4)
a TMS Info from Clients (out of scope)
co Remuneration Information (section 3.2.6)
co Management Info (section 3.2.7)
co CTS File (section 3.2.8)

3.2 EXTERNAL INTERFACES

3.2.1 Reference Data

Changes will be required to [RDSAIS] to include the changes to Reference Data
described in section 3.5.

3.2.2 Transaction Corrections
This is a new data flow from POL FS to Horizon giving details of Error Notices that
are to be distributed to the branches to be actioned.

The interface will be an overnight file from POL FS containing all the Error Notices
to be distributed for that day. Feedback will be provided to POL FS via transactions
in the normal Ledger Entry Information flow (see section 3.2.4).

The interface is formally defined in [TCAIS].

3.2.3 SAP ADS Transactions and Summaries

POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.

3.2.4 Ledger Entry Information

This is primarily an expansion of the summarised financial information being passed
to POL FS at RI to cover all Horizon products rather than just cash and near cash
products. However the details format of the data has changed.

The interface is formally defined in the AIS [POLFSAIS].

3.2.5 TMS Info from Clients

POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.

3.2.6 Remuneration Information

This is the interface to HR SAP and is formally defined in [HRSAPAIS1] and
fARSAPAIS2} which is based on [HRSAPAIS].

At the time this DP was originally produced, [HRSAPAIS 1] was not available and so
a number of assumptions were made about the interface (documented below). Now
that [HRSAPAIS1] has been produced, they have all been confirmed as correct:

In-the-ab: £-an-AIS—the follow: ti de:
s 5 S F °

= That data will be provided one or two months in arrears as specified in the
summarisation Reference Data.

= Two separate interfaces will be used:
o Aninitial feed for “multiples” (about 250 branches)
a A full feed for other sub-post offices (about 16,000 branches)

Reference Data will be used to identify in which feed the data for a branch is to be
included. Note that some branches (Directly Managed Branches) are not included
in either feed.

= There is no requirement to migrate a branch from one feed to the other.

= That any migration to the target situation of data being passed across as a single
feed, 1 month in arrears is out of scope of Impact S80 and will be handled by a
separate CR, though the design should take into account the fact that this is likely
to be required in future.

= Itis assumed that a Calendar will be provided via Reference Data defining the cut-
off dates for summarisation and also the dates at which files will be sent to HR
SAP.

a It is assumed that the mapping of products to CTTs will be provided by Reference
Data. This mapping will also indicate whether the summary is to be passed to HR
SAP one or two months in arrears.

u It is assumed that it is acceptable to use the Reference Data currently available at
the Data Centre at the time the Transaction is harvested available—for
summarisation is—to—be—used for the Summarisation and that there is no
requirement to maintain historical mapping data associated with the time that the
transaction was actually carried out should that be differed (eg following non-
polling)

= It is assumed that not all transactions will be mapped to a CTT, and so no
checking is required regarding transactions that are not mapped to any CTT
number as part of the summarisation process.

= Changes due to removal of the Cash Account

The CAP and BP fields will be retained, however the values will be null once the
branch has moved from Cash Account to Trading Period (point 50 in the
migration — see section 2.6).

= Additional Transactional Information

There are a number of the more recent “specialised” transactions where all that is
passed to OPTIP is the basic EPOSS Transactional Data. Sections BS and B6 of
[MISAIS] define the additional data required.

It has also been agreed that the Quantity field can be extended to accommodate
Bureau Quantities rather than having to hold it as an additional field.

= Additional Event Information

Section B7.2 of [MISAIS] identifies some additional events that are to be passed
through to MIS. This is also defined in Table 27.

3.2.8 CTS Files

The starting point for this is the current OPTIP AIS and is formally defined in
[TIPAIS]. A new AIS has been produced defining this interface [CTSAIS].

The CTS file is currently delivered as part of the current OPTIP set of files as a
separate file. The file itself will remain unchanged.

3.3 INTERNAL INTERFACES

3.3.1 Branch to TMS: Transactions

This is the current flow of data to the TPS Harvester.

It may need some minor changes.

Chapter 4 -
Environmental Constraints

4.1 GENERAL

This chapter is concerned with the Technical (as opposed to Application) Interfaces.

Information is also included about the operational schedule, SLAs and Volumes
associated with the interfaces, which although included in the AISs is more relevant to
this part of the document.

There are a number of aspects to this:

__Technical-Interface-fi SAR-ADS

= Technical Interface from NRDS

= Technical Interfaces to and from POL FS

= Technical Interface to HR SAP

= Technical Interface to MIS

= Technical Interface to CTS

These are described further in the following subsections.

Since all of these interfaces are bulk file transmissions and most are from the Horizon
Data Centre to Huthwaite, then they will be formally defined in an update to
[POLTIS].

Assume this is the only TIS needed.

Assumption recorded in section 8.4

4.2 TECHNICAL INTERFACE FROM SAP ADS

POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been de d without

being marked as such.

4.4 TECHNICAL INTERFACES TO AND FROM POL FS

The technical interface that was introduced as part of Impact Release 1 will remain
unchanged.

However the volume of data will be increased significantly (since now all transactions
are summarised rather than just cash and near-cash movements) and there is a need to
measure delivery times to support SLA measurement (see section 5.5).

a These files need to be audited on despatch and receipt

4.5 TECHNICAL INTERFACE FROM EDS

4.6 TECHNICAL INTERFACE TO HR SAP

This is a new interface.
It is assumed that we will send this file to the remote FTMS Server at Huthwaite.
The following assumptions are made:
= Approx Monthly File Size
0.9mb for the first interface (company franchises) and 30mb for the main interface
= Proposed Operational Schedule
Each month there will be two separate “pay runs”:
o At the beginning of the month to cover the “multiples”
o At the middle of the month to cover the bulk of the branches

Each “pay run” will take place over a weekend. The exact dates for these pay
runs and the range of Trading Days to be included in each pay run will be defined
in a Reference Data Calendar (see section 3.5). Data delivery should be by 21.30
on the Friday preceding the pay run. Data must not be delivered more than a
week before hand. Therefore, to provide operational flexibility and opportunity to
sort out any unexpected problems it is proposed that the file is generated and sent
a configurable number of days en-the-day before the required delivery date-iethe
Fhursday). This will initially be set to 3 days beforehand (ie Tuesday).

For simplicity, this task will be scheduled to be invoked each day, and the first
check that is made is whether there is anything to be run. If not it will exit with a
response indicating that there was no work to do, thus allowing Maestro to by-
pass the remaining work associated with delivering the file.

a See section 5.5 for SLA requirements.

Non-Functional Requirements

5.1 GENERAL

These can be broken down into a number of areas:

Availability

Usability

Volumetrics

Service Level Objectives
Security

These are discussed in the following sections.

5.2 AVAILABILITY
None of the changes proposed will impact on the current systems availability and any
changes should be made in line with current practice, thus ensuring that systems
availability is not impacted.

5.2.1 Resilience

No special considerations are required for Resilience. Existing mechanisms within
the Host systems and agents will provide the necessary Resilience.

5.3 USABILITY

The changed counter processes will conform to the existing systems and any text
displayed to the clerk must be agreed with Post Office Ltd.

5.4 VOLUMETRICS

Volumetrics will be described in the relevant AISs. [VOLS] will be updated to
include the volumes associated with the new interfaces.

A key change here is the increased data retention period at the counter and the

removal of the weekly Stock on hand files — see section 5.5.2), so no changes are
needed here.
5.5.1.2 TMS - POL-FS
Stated Requirement: to be consistent with that being developed for S60.
For S60 there is no SLA on this interface and no measures are in place.
[CDPOLFS], however, says that the ‘Tequirement is for Horizon to deliver the files to
POL FS by 03:00. We ved-suid fem Post Office Ltd has indicated

Stated Requirement: to be like Planned Orders — 95% by 08.00 and 100% by 24.00

this-as-below:

This SLT appears to have been based on the previous version of the Horizon
agreement whereas However, the current SLT for Planned Orders reads:

Provided data delivered by 06:00 from SAP ADS:

co 90% by 08:00 on Day A

a 96% by 12:00 (noon) on Day A

There is no LDT and ARL is 95% by 12:00 (noon) on Day A.
¥Fherefore The requirement as stated is self-contradictory.

Proposal: Fhatwe-accept-asimilar Fujitsu will support a contractual SLT similar to
that for Planned Orders and Remedies to be consistent with LFS Remedies (as set out

in Schedule 15, Annex 2, Paragraph 2.4.5.3), rather than that stated in the CD.

TMS — MiS (SAP ADS data)

POL have dropped the requirement for this, so remainder of section has been deleted without
being marked as such.

TMS — MIS (Horizon data)

Stated Requirement: by 03.00.

Proposal: Fhat-we-aceept Fujitsu to support an SLT similar to that for the current
OPTIP delivery namely:

co 96% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day B
a 97% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day C
a 98% of Transactions to be delivered to MIS by 03:00 on Day D

5.5.1.6 TMS — HR SAP

Stated Requirement: 100% by 21.30 on Friday preceding weekend of pay run.

Given that the Friday that we need to load this data is beyond Day J for any of the relevant data,
then I don’t see any problem with this.

Proposal: Fhat-we-accept Fujitsu will support an SLT as follows:

That the file containing data for HR SAP is delivered to the Huthwaite remote
gateway by 21:30 on Friday preceding weekend of pay run, provided that the date
has been notified at least 2 weeks in advance.

CAPO data will not be included in this file as the interface with CAPO is
currently out of scope.

CAPO -data-will-only-be-inchided-in-this-file-previded-it-has-bi received-by-th

There should be no LDT but the ARL should be the same as the SLT.

Remedies: in the event of failure to achieve the ARL then Post Office shall be
entitled to recover Post Office Additional Costs from Fujitsu Services.

5.5.1.7 TMS (CTS file)

Stated Requirement: ne-SLA The overnight CTS file should be loaded onto the
Horizon-Post Office gateway by 07:30/!.

Proposal: We-accept-+this This is an acceptable operational measure, subject to the
following qualification:

The measurement will be treated as design target with Fujitsu Services taking
responsibility for tuning the infrastructure to meet the design targets and
discussing any changes in infrastructure through the Capacity Management
Service.

5.5.1.8 TMS (FRTS file)

In this case there is no formal requirement, however for completeness it is proposed
that we measure delivery of the overnight FRTS files against a target delivery time to
the Horizon-Post Office gateway of 07:30 on Day B.

5.5.2 SLAs to be removed

The following interfaces are removed as part of the introduction of Impact R3 and so
the associated SLAs need to be removed:

5.5.4 Migration Implications

The SLA changes will take places at different times during the migration.
Section 2.6.1 defines the various migration stages.

of this SLT should align with the ceasing of the OpTIP

SLT, i.e. there will only be one SLT or the other SLT in
operation at any one time.

Chapter 6 -
Testing and Acceptance

6.1 GENERAL

Each element of the new solution will be tested independently based on their interface
specifications. Testing up to the service boundary between Fujitsu Services and Post
Office domain is assumed on the basis of DIT testing at the boundary.

[CDBT] specifies that an End to End test will also be required.

A Test Strategy will be produced defining in detail the testing that will be carried out
at the various stages. The results of tests will be made available to Post Office Ltd as
described in that Test Strategy.

6.2 PRODUCT TESTING

6.2.1 Test Stages

The following test stages will be applied to each component:
= Unit Testing - module testing

= Link test — testing the interaction between modules

a Product Introduction Test (PIT)

a Direct Interface Test (DIT) tests new or amended interfaces to internal or external
systems

In particular a number of DIT tests are required:

Pve excluded any SAP Hosting interfaces

c Interface from NRDS to Horizon (Reference Data)

o_ Interface from TMS to POL FS (Summarised Transactions)

co Interface from POL FS to TMS (Transaction Corrections)
o..Interface-fromSAP-ADS.to-TMS (Cash Centre Transactions)

co Interface from TMS to MIS (Horizon aad-Cash-Centre Transactions)

co  daterface-trom-EDS-to-FMS-(Cash-Account- Enlivenments)

a Interface from TMS to HR SAP (Postmaster Remuneration Data)
a Interface from TMS to POL (DRS Reports and CTS Reports)

= Business Integration Test (BIT) to prove the business integration of the various
components of the system on a live-like infrastructure

m Release Test (RT)
This also includes Migration Testing
a Live Support Test (LST)

Note that LST does not include a POL FS system and so will not test any
interfaces to POL FS.

In addition there will be support for the Post Office End-to-End Testing. This will
include the use of a POL FS system and so can be used for any required testing of the
interface to POL FS.

6.2.2 Test Environments

No specific test environments or test harnesses are required. Since the new external
interfaces are Bulk File interfaces all that is required is the generation of these files
and the checking of the revised files that are transmitted.

6.3 ASPECTS TO BE TESTED
The following sub-sections are provided as input to the Test Strategy and are aligned
with the requirements of the Test Strategy.
Note that there will be a number of non-functional tests being carried out for the
Hosting of POL FS, however those are all outside the scope of this DP.

6.3.1 Business functionality
The Business Functionality is described in Chapter 2. All new Business Functionality
as described there will need to be explicitly tested.
Existing functionality needs to be regression tested to show that it hasn’t been
changed and that the service provided has not been degraded. [BT002]

6.3.2 Performance

The following needs to be considered for Performance Testing:

= Impact on overall Counter Performance, in particular the effect of the increase
from a 1 week CAP to a monthly Trading period and the corresponding increase
in message store sizes on the time for report production

a The time taken to summarise the transactions with the TPS Host prior to delivery
to POL FS

= The time taken to produce the monthly files for HR SAP
= Ability to deliver the various data flows within their targets

Note that it should be assumed that all counters will have been upgraded to 256Mb of
memory prior to the rollout of S80.

6.3.3 Volume
The main effect of Volumes is on the ability to summarise the Transactions prior to

delivery to POL FS. In addition need to consider the implications of the longer Data
Retention period on the counter and Correspondence Server.

The volume of data to be passed to MIS will be similar to that currently passed to
OPTIP.

6.3.4 Integrity

This cover auditing of the interfaces that are subject to DIT.
6.3.5 Resilience

There is no specific resilience testing required.

6.3.6 Recoverability (including backup and recovery, including disaster
recovery)

There is no specific recoverability testing required.
6.3.7 Networking
There is no specific network testing required.
6.3.8 Security
There is no specific security testing required.
6.3.9 Supportability
There is no specific supportability testing required.
6.3.10 Manageability (system management)
There is no specific manageability testing required.
6.3.11 Migration
Migration is described in section 2.6. The migration requirements are fairly complex
and particular attention needs paying to testing the various migration scenarios, and in
particular the ability to migrate from the final cash account to the first Branch Trading

period while still providing valid data. The soft launch of the various features will be
tested as part of this test phase.

6.4 ACCEPTANCE

[CDBT] specifies some acceptance criteria and the way in which they will be
accepted against each requirement. The focus of acceptance testing will be on

there are agreed exceptions.

6.4.1 Live Pilot

There are no explicit requirements for a Live Pilot, however there are requirements to
support Soft Launch for some aspects of the functionality (see section 2.6), which will
enable a Live Pilot to be supported.

It should be assumed that a Live Pilot will be required in line with best practice on
other releases.

6.4.2 Capacity Modelling

The changes introduced here will have an impact on the overall system capacity.
Testing will demonstrate that the changes can accommodated within the current
headroom in the system.

Compliance Matrices

8.1 GENERAL

The purpose of this chapter is to list all the formal Requirements identified in [CDBT]
and [CDPROG] that are identified as being on Fujitsu Services together with
compliance statements and references to where in this document the meeting of the
requirement is described. Details of acceptance criteria are also included.

I've ignored [CDPROG] since it isn’t yet aligned with [CDBT].

NB it does have some high level requirements which may need to be added in here.

POL have categorised the various requirements with acceptance mechanisms. I’ve
included the mechanism to be used in the following section. Table 37 contains the
key.

Document review Requirements that cannot be objectively verified by a test of
the Work Package solution may be satisfied by PO undertaking
a Document Review. The outcome of any such review will be
documented by PO in the Document Review report.

DW I Design Walkthrough Requirements may be satisfied by PO evidencing a Design
Walkthrough of the Fujitsu Services Design as specified in the
Design Proposal. The outcome of any such design
walkthrough will be documented by PO in the Design
Walkthrough report.

FST I Fujitsu Services Test Tests that are run and managed by Fujitsu Services for the
purpose of verifying that a Fujitsu Services Work Package
satisfies the Work Package Acceptance Criteria. Fujitsu
Services shall produce a test report presenting the results of
the tests. The assessment of the results of these tests will be
by inspection carried out by Fujitsu Services or jointly with PO,
in conjunction with the Acceptance Criteria.

POT I Post Office E2E Test Tests that are run and managed by PO (which in terms of the
scope of this document), are for the purpose of verifying in
terms of the E2E solution, Acceptance Criteria have been met.
PO shall provide appropriate evidence to FS, if any non-
compliances are identified.

M Monitoring PO shall specify any requirement beyond the level of support
that Fujitsu Services are required to provide under normal
operational practice (such as a report etc). Typically the
duration of this requirement may be of the order of one month
and no greater than 3 months, but in any event to be agreed in
advance between PO and FS.

SOF I Statement of fact Where the solution to a Requirement is self-evident and does
not lend itself to formal proving,
SOO I Statement of obligation Relates to requirements that represent either:

* An existing Fujitsu Services obligation or

* Agreed additional Fujitsu Services obligation (to be
recorded subsequently as an amendment to the contract
clauses, schedules, or contract controlled documents)

BT038 I Anew check is to be introduced after producing the Trial
I Balance (ie when the “rollover” button is pressed prior to
I producing the Final Balance). This check will act as follows:
I 1. If itisn’t the last Stock Unit to rollover, the clerk will be

advised that the Discrepancy is to be posted to a I
“local adjustments” account. They have the option of I
accepting or rejecting this action.

a. Should they accept it, then a pair of
transactions will be generated resulting in
the Discrepancy being reduced to zero and
a corresponding amount being put into a
“local adjustments product”.

b. Should they reject it, then the rollover is
aborted and the clerk is free to do whatever
they wish to balance the Stock Unit and will
then need to balance the Stock Unit again at
a later time.

c. The “local adjustment” is not associated with
any Stock Unit (as with a Suspense
account). Items can be added to it by any
clerk, but only as part of the Balancing
Process. Managers / Supervisors will be
able to move items from it into cash in their
SU to be Made Good.

2. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover an additional
check will be performed to ensure that the net total of
transactions, within the Trading Period, in the “local
adjustment” account has a net value of zero.

3. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover, then the user
will be informed if the Stock Unit has a Discrepancy
and that this must be resolved before the last Stock

i Unit can be rolled over.

I Local Adjustment will behave in a similar way to existing

I Suspense Account items, namely the values will not be

I associated with any Stock Unit, but is considered as part of the
_ overall Branch balance

...Adttachment to a new SU;

It is acceptable to prohibit further
processing in a Stock Unit that has rolled
into a new CAP until the Branch is rolled
over into the new CAP for the two special
rollovers, ie the final CAP to CBDB and
the final CAP prior to switching to Branch
Trading Processes (points 30 and 50 in

id Logout.
Following the final CAP rollover for
CBDB, changes will be made to the
housekeeping menu to support changed
Suspense accounts; prevention of Error
Notice and Voucher processing; and
introduction of new Housekeeping
functions to replace vouchers.

Detailed design now shows that this is

_ not desirable or necessary

I The proposal now is that the menu
I structure presented to users reflects the

current state of the Stock Unit and Office

I CAP or TP mode
cases, any attempt to logon or attach toa»
stock unit in the new CAP will result in all:

‘This is the current baseline. However

I POL ate still considering raising a CR to
_ change this

Restricting the Housekeeping menus as
specified in requirement [BT040a] will
happen at a specified date prior to the
final CAP for CBDB being rolled over at

all branches (ie it will not be co-ordinated _

to a CAP rollover). In particular this
change will take place at the same time
in all branches and will not be available
for piloting.

Transactions Corrections will not be able
to be processed until the branch is
operating in Branch Trading Mode (ie
point 50 in the migration process)

Transactions Corrections received earlier _

than point 50 will be retained and can be
processed after point 50 until 42 days
after they were delivered by POL FS.

it must be possible to support a pilot
“POL FS" for selected branches in
parallel with normal “S60” operation of
the live POL FS. Such a pilot can then
be stopped and a “proper” migration
supported. The term pilot is taken to
mean the provision of data from selected
branches to a test instance of POL FS.
whilst continuing to provide an
operational feed to CBDB. On
completion of the pilot, it is assumed that
the data in the POL FS test instance will
be discarded.

The flow to POL FS will conform to the
$60 AIS until we first pass through the
$80 Data (i.e. Point 30 in the migration
process). Therefore late data from
branches that are still operating at S60
will then pass the data through the S80
interface (but include a Balancing
account)

There may be circumstances under

which S80 Transactions from Horizon get _

passed to POL FS prior to the Opening
Balances.

' Itis understood that a CR will be raised if
I a Pilot is to be operated, at which time

+ operating, infrastructure and test rig

I costs will be assessed, i.e. costs for Pilot
I operation are not covered by this CT.

The details have now been changed

_ such that Point 25 has been introduced

i for the change from the S60 AIS to the

I S80 AIS. Also detailed data delivery has
I been changed as a result of

_ CP POL_FS_AIS

[POLFSAIS] now reflects this.

8.5 CHANGE REQUESTS
Post Office Ltd have raised a number of Change Requests on Fujitsu for Impact
Release 3. There are 2 types of Change Request:
= Soft Changes

Where the change is considered to be a clarification and has no material impact on
the overall costs of Impact Release 3

Such changes will not result in a CP being raised.
a Hard Changes
Where there is a real change involved.

Such changes will result in a CP being raised. In some cases the CP may not be
scheduled until a later Release than the rest of Impact Release 3, in which case the
CP will not be included in this document.

The following tables list all the CRs that have been raised on Impact Release 3 split
into Soft and Hard Changes:

Chapter 9 -
Retained Information

9.1 GENERAL

This chapter has been added to hold text that has been removed from the DP, but is
perhaps relevant to future changes or Lower Level design documentation.

9.2 NON-VALUE STOCK ANALYSIS

I This text was previously part of section 2.5.1.1.3.

The remainder of this section is an analysis of the sort of things that could be done,
however at present it is assumed that none of this will be done for Impact R3.

Table 44 — Categories of Non-Value Stock

My system has 4702 Pre Pack Currency instead of N Lott Chqs.

Table 44 identifies the various types of non-value stock in the current system. The
following subsections consider each one in turn.

9.2.1 Travel Schemes and Local Authority Vouchers

These can be converted into controlled stock fairly simply. They are currently
defined as a single product which is used both for the non-value stock declaration and
for the transaction of the item within the Serve Customer menu. The following is
required for these products.

Note that these changes should not be done on Live until after the cash account has
been removed (ie after point E in the migration strategy). This will mean that there is
no need to worry about the impact on cash account mappings.

= New buttons are added to the Rem In / Out from ADC and Transfer Out menus to
support Remitting these products in / out and transferring them between Stock
Units. These buttons should use the same pick lists as are currently used on the
Serve Customer menus for these products.

Version: 1.1

= RDS generates a new version of the Reference Data such that the product is
defined as a Stock Item with any necessary changes to the product mappings so
that it is reported correctly.

Since changing mappings on an existing product is likely to cause unpredictable
effects, it will be necessary to introduce new, equivalent products with the new
mappings and withdraw the old ones. Since these products appear on picklists,
then this should not cause any problems other than to any PLU lists.

The product will also need to be included in the Stock Adjustment and Stock
Declarations lists.

= Following the change of Reference Data, the next time the Stock Unit is balanced,
then the user will find that the system generated Stock Position will not match
reality. This should be rectified by making a Stock Adjustment (or in a shared
Stock unit it could be done by making a Stock Declaration on each drawer and
accepting any discrepancy that results). This will result in the systems generated
position being brought in line with the amount present.

Note that to avoid this resulting in a corresponding cash discrepancy it will be
necessary to ensure that all such products have a zero “loss price” (at least until
this adjustment has been carried out).

Need to check if these adjustments will cause any problems for POL FS. I would assume that
they won't since there will have been no “opening figures” for these products.

= Ifrequired it should then be OK to change the “loss price” to a non-zero value.

9.2.2 MVL Disks

MVL Disks are currently sold by the AP application and detailed investigations are
required to decide what can be done.

Here there are currently different stock products for each expiry date. Changing the
DVLA application to take this into account is considered to be outside the scope of
Impact, so it is assumed that it is sufficient to mange the stock of MVLs at the generic
level. Currently there is no link between DVLA Transactions and an explicit month’s
tax disk.

Te it is sufficient to know that a branch has 70 tax discs and not know that there are 10 for each
month from September 2004 to March 2005.

9.2.3 Other Tokens

It isn’t currently clear what these products are used for. They seem to be all
Electricity tokens of some sort, but it isn’t clear how they are used. They are assumed
to be related to AP Transactions. Detailed investigations are required to decide what
can be done.

9.2.4 NRA Rods

Looking at these products there appear to be separate service products for a single
stock product (eg a Salmon licence can be sold as a number of different products
depending who it is sold to and for what period of time). There is little that can be
done here without Product re-engineering.

9.2.5 N. Lott. Chqs

This has been discussed as a potential product for re-engineering and it is proposed
that it is left uncontrolled until such re-engineering takes place.
