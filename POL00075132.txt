SECTION 2

REMUNERATION

GENERAL

1, A Subpostmaster is paid according to the amount of work which is transacted at his

sub-office.

FREQUENCY OF PAYMENT

2. Remuneration is paid monthly, in arrears, normally at the rate of 1/12 of the annual

remuneration, by bank credit transfer.
3. The amount of work undertaken at a sub-office is assessed periodically. The

Subpostmaster’s remuneration may be increased or decreased accordingly, except that

if the work done is below a specified level, a fixed minimum payment will be made.

REVISIONS

4. The assessment of work done for the purpose of a periodic revision of remuneration is

undertaken in the following way.

5. Every major item of work undertaken in sub-offices has been assigned a “unit credit”

e.g. the unit credit for the payment of a pension is 3. The amount of the unit credit

sned to a particular tra

ction is intended to reflect the amount of time required to
complete the transaction and any associated accounting work. A list of the items of

work to which unit credits have been assigned and the current amount of those unit

credits, which is applied uniformly for all sub-offices, is at APPENDIX 1. The amount
of any unit credit may be increased or decreased, after negotiations with the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters a new unit credit or cash allowance will similarly be
introduced when Subpostmasters are required to undertake any major new item of

business.

POL00075132

Information about the number of transactions for those items of work listed at
APPENDIX 1 undertaken at the sub-office, over the 12 month period of which the

revision is being prepared, are extracted from accounting records.

The number of transactions of each item of work which has been performed is
multiplied by the unit credit assigned to that item of work. Total unit credits are so
determined for every item of work, at APPENDIX 1. They are totalled and increased
by 3% to allow for other minor items of business which do not justify a specific unit
credit. The figure which results is the final total of unit credits applicable to the office

concerned.

The annual amount of remuneration to be paid in respect of the sub-office is
determined by reading from a table which lists the annual amount of remuneration
payable in respect of any final total of unit credits. This table, called a unit scale, is
published (as a supplement to Counter News. The cash figure given by the unit scale is

called the “scale payment”).

In addition to the scale payment determined according to paragraphs 5 to 8 above,
certain cash allowances may also be paid. The circumstances in which such allowances

are paid, and their value, are also set out in a supplement to Counter News.

The scale payment is in respect of the provision of Post Office Counter services during,

the hours of opening,

FREQUENCY WITH WHICH REVISIONS ARE UNDERTAKEN

11.

The Procedure described at paragraphs 5 to 9 is normally undertaken at every sub-
office, and the Subpostmaster’s remuneration adjusted accordingly, at yearly intervals

(the “annual revision”).

DATES ON WHICH ANNUAL REVISIONS ARE DUE

12.

Annual revisions in the area controlled by The Regional General Manager are carried
out according to a rota. Every office occupies a particular place in that rota and the
date when revision is due is fixed accordingly. It does not depend upon the date when
the Subpostmaster was appointed, and may not be altered, except that: the Regional
General Manager may bring forward the date of an annual revision by not more than 3
months. If he does so, and the revision results in a reduction in the Subpostmaster’s
remuneration, this reduction will not be made until the “old” revision date, unless the

appointment has become vacant in the meantime.

INFORMATION ON WHICH REVISIONS ARE BASED

13,

The dates on which revisions may be due, and the corresponding period from which

records of work done will be used are:

DATE ON WHICH REVISION DUE: PERIOD FROM WHICH RECORDS USED:

1 January Year Ended the preceding 30 September
1 February Year Ended the preceding 30 September
1 March Year Ended the preceding 31 December

14. Normally the actual record of transaction:

must supply certain information for use in the revision. However, certain adjustments

may be made to the figures actually recorded.

Where a type of work (e.g. savings bank work) has been entirely withdrawn in the

course of the year covered by the returns of work or subsequently, but before the due

date of the revision, no unit credits for this work will be included in the final total of
unit credits used for determining the future scale payment. However, unit credits
based on the annual equivalent of the work performed up to the date of withdrawal
will be included in the final total of unit credits used in calculating any arrears of

remuneration which may be due.

Where there has been a temporary increase in the work undertaken at a sub-office for
whatever reason, the increase in the work will be included in the figures of business

used at the time of the next revision.

When a sub-office is temporarily closed (except to allow the Subpostmaster to take a
holiday) or a particular type of work is suspended for a period falling within the year
covered by the returns of work, the actual figures of work done in the 12 month period
will be increased proportionately in order to cover the temporary closure or suspension.

Details of the figures on which an annual revision has been based are given to the

Subpostmaster before any adjustment is made to his remuneration.

BACK-DATING OF RESULTS OF REVISIONS

20.

21.

If following an annual revision the Subpostmaster’s remuneration is to be increased,

then this increas

is backdated to a date 6 months before the date on which the revision

was due, Arrears of remuneration are paid accordingly.

If following an annual revision the Subpostmaster’s remuneration is to be decreased,
the reduction will come into effect only from a current date, i.e. the date on which the

revision is finalised and implemented.

POL00075132

INTERMEDIATE REVISIONS

22.

A Subpostmaster will not normally be allowed to claim a revision of remuneration
between annual revisions. However, where he can demonstrate exceptional
circumstances, which cause a major change to the volume of business transacted (e.g.

closure of a neighbouring office or other clearly identifiable change) the claim should

be submitted via the Regional General Manager to Post Office Counters Business
Headquarters who will have sole discretion to decide whether an abnormal change in
business has occurred. Where Post Office Counters Ltd is satisfied that such a case

exists any intermediate revision will attract arrears to the date of the increase in work,

which must not be before the date of the figures of business for the previous revision.

ADJUSTMENT OF REMUNERATION FOR NEW TYPES OF BUSINESS.

23,

24,

If a new class of business is required to be undertaken at a sub-office, except at
minimum payment sub-offices (see paragraph 3), an estimate is made of the additional
amount by which the new work is likely to increase the Subpostmaster’s annual
remuneration. The estimate is arrived at by taking the figures for the new business
transacted during the month following its introduction and multiplying appropriately
to produce an annual figure. Two-thirds of the estimated increase in remuneration
should be paid as soon as possible after the introduction of the new work. The increase

is adjusted as appropriate when figures of business for a full year are available.

No change is made at minimum payment sub-offices except where the new class of
business warrants a higher minimum payment. This higher rate is paid from the date

of introduction of the new business.

SEASON SUB-OFFICES

25.

Where a sub-office is regularly open for part of the year only, remuneration will be
paid for the period of opening only. The minimum payment for the class of office or
half the estimated remuneration, whichever is the greater, will be paid provisionally
and, at the end of the season, the remuneration will be revised on the basis of the actual

work performed.

SUBPOSTMASTER’S PERSONAL BUSINESS

26. Full credit is normally allowed for the personal Post Office business of a Subpostmaster
and members of his household, but Post Office Counters Ltd reserves the right to

withhold credit for part of such business at its discretion.

RETURNS COMPLETED BY SUBPOSTMASTERS FOR REVISION PURPOSES

27.  Subpostmasters will be notified by the Regional General Manager of the periods during
which counts of items for revision purposes are to be undertaken. It is essential that
Subpostmasters complete and return these records without delay failure to do so may

adversely affect calculation of the Subpostmaster’s remuneration.

CANVASSING

28. Canvassing of persons, firms or companies or any action having the object of inducing
the transaction at a sub-office business of persons, firms or companies residing at or
carrying on a business at a place nearer to another Post Office , or the deliver of stamps
or postal orders at the premises of persons, firms or companies is forbidden.
Remuneration may be withheld in respect of any business obtained by a Subpostmaster

in breach of this rule.

QUESTIONS ABOUT REMUNERATION

29. Ifa Subpostmaster considers that the foregoing rules have not been correctly applied in
the case of his office he should make any representations to the Regional General

Manager.

SECTION 3.

SUBPOSTMASTERS’ ABSENCE FROM OFFICE

GENERAL

A Subpostmaster, under the terms of his contract, is not obliged to render personal
service and is therefore free to absent himself from the office, provided he makes

suitable arrangements for the conduct of the office during his absence.

He should notify the Regional General Manager on form P2593 when he will be away

for a period of more than 3 days and give the name of the person substituting for him.
A Subpostmaster’s responsibility for the proper conduct of the office, or for any losses
occurring during his absence, is in no way diminished by his absence from the Sub-
Office. He must make proper provision, at his own expense, for the conduct of the
office while he is away, but assistance towards the cost of his own substitution is

provided, in respect of certain absences, under the terms outlined in other relative

sections listed below:-

SECTION 4 Absence on holiday

SECTION 5 Absence on Territorial Training

SECTION 6 Absence for Jury Service

SECTION 4

ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY - HOLIDAY SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

A Subpostmaster is not entitled to annual leave as such, but subject to the following
conditions he may claim for reimbursement of the necessary cost of his substitution
when taking a holiday. To qualify for reimbursement, the Subpostmaster must be able

to certify that he renders on overage not less than 18 hours personal services each week.

The reimbursement of the costs of substitution is paid as Holiday Substitution
Allowance and the maxima payable are published annually in Counter News. The sum
reimbursable is the net additional cost necessarily incurred by the Subpostmaster in
providing during his own absence for the Post Office duties which he normally

performs.

To assist Subpostmasters to overcome the difficulties sometimes experienced in
obtaining suitable substitutes in a particular year the holiday substitution allowance
extends over a period of 2 years, The holiday periods for which the costs of

substitution are payable are:-

For a Subpostmaster with I

ss than 10 years service; a total not exceeding 7 weeks in a
period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 7 weeks for this purpose

consist of 42 weekdays plus not more than 7 associated Sundays.

For a Subpostmaster with 10 years or more aggregated service; a total not exceeding 8
weeks in a period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 8 weeks for this

purpose consists of 48 weekdays plus not more than 8 associated Sundays.

NOTE: Subject to the above limits on holiday periods, Subpostmasters may claim

reimbursement of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days, provided that

claims are aggregated and made quarterly.

16 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved

POL00075132
POL00075132
Proportionate adjustments will be made to the period for which reimbursement can be
claimed when a Subpostmaster qualifies for the higher allowance during the 2 year

cycle.

Subject to the limits in paragraphs 3,4 & 5, a Subpostmaster is free to take up to the
maximum of the period for which he may claim holiday substitution allowance at any
time during the 2 year cycle provided that he makes suitable arrangements for the

conduct of the office during his absence. A further cycle will recur in every odd year,

The Subpostmaster must do his best to find his own substitute and make all necessary
arrangements for his absence, which should be notified to the Regional General
Manager on form P2593. In cases of difficulty the Regional General Manager or the
Secretary of the local branch of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters may be able
to give the names and addresses of local people known to be willing to offer their
services as holiday relief’s to Subpostmasters. Responsibility for concluding

arrangements with such people remains with the Subpostmaster concerned.

CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

The Subpostmaster must submit a formal claim for reimbursement of the holiday
substitution allowance on forms P2340 and P2340(A) (obtainable from the Regional
General Manager) within three months of the end of the period of substitution to which
the claim relates, except in the cases as in paragraph 10 where claims should be

submitted quarterly. He must certify:-

9.1 that he has taken a holiday both from the Sub Post Office and from his private

business during the whole period covered by the claim; and

9.2 that in respect of the services he provided as subpostmaster, he has actually and
necessarily incurred additional expenditure equating to the amount claimed, in
respect of a paid substitute or substitutes, payment will not be made in respect of
substitution by family members who work in the Sub-Post Office unless their

involvement is occasional or, if regular, minimal.

14,

Claims for refundment of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days (see Note at
paragraph 5) should be submitted on form P2340 and P2340(A) at the quarter end,
showing the separate dates of absence and the costs of substitution incurred.

In addition to the arrangement quoted above, with effect from January 1990 all claims
for reimbursement of the cost of employing a substitute for periods longer than 2 days
in the event of holiday or sickness, should be submitted for payment to the Regional

Office no later than six months following the date the claim is made.

Where a Subpostmaster is employed by the Post Office either on a full or part-time
basis, e.g. Auxiliary Postman, it is essential, in view of the terms of the certificate
required as a condition of refundment of the cost of his substitution as Subpostmaster,
that he should be absent from all Post Office work during his holiday as

Subpostmaster.

A Subpostmaster who holds more than one sub-office appointment and who satisfies
the general conditions entitling him to claim reimbursement must also satisfy the
further condition that he is absent from all his sub-offices at the same time, i.e.
irrespective of the number of sub-office appointments held, he shall only be entitled to

claim reimbursement for a total period of:-

12.1 not more than 7 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has less than 10 years service;

12.2. not more than 8 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has 10 years or more aggregated service.

Only one claim for reimbursement is admissible and not one claim per office held.

Reimbursement of the cost of annual holiday warranted under the foregoing rules will
be suitable restricted in respect of a Subpostmaster’s first and last 2 years of
appointment to amounts proportionate to the actual periods of appointment during

those years; any overpayments which may thus occur will be recovered subsequently.

ense with the preparation of cash accounts on up to

one oc h account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions, and on two
additional occasions 2 weeks transactions. Alternatively, on two occasions a cash
account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions. In no circumstances may two occasions

be consecutive.

Applications to dispense with cash accounts should be made on form P2639, to
Regional General Managers at least 2 weeks before the date of absence, but they can
only be allowed when the 2 or 3 weeks involved fall within the same accounting

period. (The accounting periods are shown in front of the cash book).

“Despatch of Accounts” instructions to cover the period concerned will be supplied by

FC4,3/CAG Chesterfield and for Scotland, Scottish Accounting Office AD1.

It will not be possible to dispense with 2 consecutive cash accounts when one or both of
them, or the next account that would be due, is for longer than a normal cash account
week, e.g. Christmas and New Year. However, applications to dispense with one

account at such times will be considered.

Where a cash account is prepared during the Subpostmaster’s absence on holiday and
is signed by a substitute on his behalf, a note to this effect should be made on the

Account.

SECTION 7

SUBPOSTMASTER’S SICK ABSENCE SCHEME - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

1. ASubpostmaster is not required to give personal service and is not entitled to sick
leave as such. However, subject to certain conditions and limitations described below,
he is entitled to claim sick absence substitution allowance, in respect of the costs of

substitution necessarily incurred, when he is absent from his sub-office through illness.

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

2. With the exception of women over 65 and men over 70 years of age, all Subpostmasters
who give 18 hours or more personal service a week, who are absent from their sub-
office through illness, are eligible to claim Sick Absence Substitution Allowance. The
maxima rates payable are published from time to time in Counter News. The

allowance is payable subject to, and in accordance with, the following conditions:~

3. The allowance will be payable when the period of any continuous sick absence
amounts to three weeks (21 days including Sundays) or more and it will be paid

retrospectively for all but the first week (seven days including Sunday) of absence,

4, Payment of the allowance will be limited to an aggregated period of 13 weeks (91 days
including not more than 13 associated Sundays) in any consecutive period of 12

months.

5. Where a Subpostmaster is incapacitated by an accident or illness which results, or is
likely to result, in a continuous absence beyond 13 weeks, Regional General Managers
may authorise payment of the allowance to be extended up to a maximum period of 26
weeks (182 days including not more than 26 associated Sundays) in any one period of
12 months. Where a Subpostmaster has already received up to 12 weeks of the Sick
Absence Substitution Allowance entitlement in the previous 12 months he may,
because of an absence resulting from an extended illness, be entitled to an allowance up

to a maximum of 26 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

23 Issue

POL00075132
POL00075132

Where a Subpostmaster's period of reimbursement of sick absence substitution costs is
extended beyond 13 continuous weeks, such extension will be reviewed periodically.
Under no circumstances will a Subpostmaster be allowed to aggregate separate periods

of sick absence beyond 13 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

The maximum allowance payable will be the total amount calculated by applying the
Subpostmaster’s appropriate Holiday Substitution Allowance rate for the period for
which sick absence allowance is payable, or the actual additional costs of substitution

incurred for the same period, whichever is less.

The maximum amount of the allowance for the period of absence for which an.
allowance is payable will be abated, where applicable, by the statutory national
insurance sickness benefit or maternity allowance and earnings related supplement
received by the claimant in respect of the same period. Details of these are recorded on
DSS forms BS12 and BF168 which should accompany the Subpostmaster’s claim for the
substitution allowance (see paragraph 10). Where however, a Subpostmistress receives
a NHS Maternity Grant, the substitution allowance should not be reduced by the

amount of that grant.

(NOTE: Statutory national insurance sickness benefit means that benefit which is
payable to a person otherwise than in respect of another person who is a child or an
adult dependent.) Where a Subpostmaster is not eligible for DSS benefits, a medical

certificate should accompany the claim for payment of the substitution allowance.

Subpostmasters holding more than one Sub-Office appointment will be entitled to

claim the allowance in respect of only one appointment.

Any Subpostmaster who qualifies for the sick absence substitution allowance and can
produce evidence to show that substitution costs were incurred should submit a claim
to the Regional General Manager after he has been absent for three weeks. Thereafter
he should claim the allowance at the end of each subsequent period of absence of four
weeks (or al the end of the period of absence if that is reached earlier). Claim forms

will be supplied by the Regional General Manager on request.

PERIODS OF SICK ABSENCE OF LESS THAN 3 WEEKS

11. Where an eligible Subpostmaster as defined above is absent sick for a period of less
than three weeks, and does not qualify for payment of the sick absence substitution
allowance, he will be free to claim, in respect of any substitute for him, Holiday
Substitution Allowance for the period of absence up to the limit of any outstanding
balance of his HSA entitlement. Form P2340 and P2340(A) should be used by
Subpostmasters when making these claims. The amounts payable will not be the
subject to abatement of any national insurance sickness benefit received. Any period of
sick absence for which HSA (as distinct from Sick Absence Substitution Allowance) is

paid will count against HSA entitlement.

SECTION 8

STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME

INTRODUCTION

1. Under the terms of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982 employers are
responsible for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of their employees. An
employee is interpreted as including office holders who receive emoluments liable for
income tax under Schedule E. Subpostmasters come within this category and
consequently Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to comply with the conditions of the
Act.

2. The use of the words “employee” and “employer” are used in the context of this
particular piece of legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster’s status as

an independent contractor.

GENERAL

3. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit
for their first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get

Statutory Sick Pay, known as SSP, from Post Office Counters Ltd. SSP is paid ata flat

rate, There are 2 weekly rates and eligibility depends on an employee's average
earnings over a specified period. There are no allowances for dependants. SSP is

taxable and subject to NI contributions.

EXCLUSIONS

4. A Subpostmaster will not get statutory sick pay if he comes within one of the following,
groups. If a Subpostmaster falls within one of these groups he should still notify his

Regional General Manager about his sickness.

A Subpostmaster reaches the end of his entitlement to SSP from Post Office Counters

when:

(a) Subpostmasters who already had twenty eight weeks of SSP from Post Office
Counters Ltd in a tax year in any one period of incapacity for work (referred to as
PIW)(linked or unlinked);

(b) his linked PIW with Post Office Counters Ltd has run for 3 years;

(©) she is pregnant and reaches the “disqualifying period”;

(d) his contract for service ends;

(e)  Subpostmasters who fall sick in a country outside the EEC;

(9 heis no longer incapable of work, ie. he returns to work or stops sending,

certificates of incapacity;

(g) _ he is taken into legal custody.

QUALIFYING CONDITIONS

5. Statutory Sick Pay can only be paid for qualifying days. It has been agreed with the
National Federation of Sub-Postmasters that qualifying days for Subpostmasters will be
those days they are normally required to provide the services detailed in Section 1 of
this contract. Where Subpostmasters are required to give services for only part of the
day, that day will count in full for statutory sick pay purposes. For the majority of
Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in each week (Monday to Saturday).
if a Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as qualifying days he

should seek confirmation from his Regional General Manager.

27 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved
The entitlement of a Subpostmaster to SSP, rests on 6 qualifying conditions, all of which
must be fulfilled.

(a)

(e)

The Subpostmaster must have notified his Regional General Manager of his

absence;

Days sickness must be days of incapacity;

The Subpostmaster must provide evidence of incapacity;

Period of incapacity for work (PIW) must be formed and PIW consist of 4 or
more consecutive days, including Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays, when
a Subpostmaster is incapacitated for work. It is immaterial for this purpose
whether or not the Subpostmaster would normally have worked on those days.
PIW’s which are separated by 8 weeks (56 calendar days) or less are linked and

count together as a single PIW;

When a Subpostmaster falls into one or more of the categories listed below he

will be excluded from receiving SSP;

(i) he is excluded from receiving SSP. A Subpostmaster who has been
excluded cannot return to SSP entitlement during the course of a PIW, nor
at the start of a PIW which links with a previous one during which he was

excluded even though he ceases to be a member of an excluded group.

(ii) Over State pension age;

A Subpostmaster who is over State pension age (65 for a man, 60 for a
woman) is excluded from SSP. However, if when a Subpostmaster reaches
State pension age he has a PIW which links with a previous one, he will be

entitled to SSP for as long as his PIW’s continue to link.

(iv)

(vi)

Short contract workers;

A Subpostmaster whose contract of employment is for a specified period of
3 calendar months or less is excluded from SSP. However, if the contract
does not at first exceed 3 months, but a Subpostmaster works past the time
stated in the contract so that the total period worked becomes more than 3
calendar months the employee becomes entitled to SSP as soon as it is

known that the total period will be more than 3 calendar months.

Low average earnings;

A Subpostmaster whose average earnings are less than the lower earnings
limit for NI contribution liability is not entitled to SSP. When one PIW
links with a previous one, the first day in the earlier PIW is used for

calculating an employee's average earnings.

Recent State benefit entitlement;

A Subpostmaster who has received, or in some cases claimed but not
received, certain State benefits within the 8 weeks period before the first
day of a PIW is not entitled to SSP. The benefits are:

- Sickness Benefit;

- Invalidity Benefit;

- Severe Disablement Allowance;

- State Maternity Allowance (but not Statutory Maternity Pay);

- Unemployment Benefit, but only in very limited circumstances.

No work done;

A Subpostmaster how has done no work under a contract of employment
is not entitled to SSP under that contract. If he is a new employee and he

reports sick before he takes up duty, he is not entitled to SSP. However, if
he reports for work on his first day of service, but goes sick on the second,

he is entitled to SSP if he fulfils the other qualifying conditions.

(vii) Trade dispute;

If a Subpostmaster is participating in a stoppage of work due to a trade

dispute, he may be excluded from SSP.

Pregnancy;

There is a “disqualifying period” during which the Subpostmistress is not
entitled to SSP. The “disqualifying period” begins with the 11th week
before the expected week of confinement and runs for 18 weeks. This is the
same as the period for entitlement to state or statutory maternity pay to
which the Subpostmistress is entitled provided she fulfils the appropriate

conditions.

Already been due 28 weeks SSP from former employer(s);

A Subpostmaster is excluded from SSP if he gives his Regional General
Manager a leaver's statement (SSP 1(L)) showing that he has been due 28
weeks SSP from his former employer(s) and the gap between the first day
of the PIW (with the new employer) and the last day of SSP shown on the

leaver’s statement is 8 weeks or less.

Abroad outside the EEC;

A Subpostmaster who is abroad outside the EEC at the start of a PIW is not
entitled to SSP. He is

xcluded even it the PIW links with a previous one

when he was in the UK.

Legal custody.

A Subpostmaster who is in legal custody on the first day of a PIW is not
entitled to SSP. “Legal custody” means that the person concerned is
detained, usually arrested and/or in prison. A person who is voluntarily
helping Police with their enquiries is not excluded. A Subpostmaster in
legal custody is not entitled to SSP even if his PIW links with a previous

one when he was not in legal custody.

(9) Days of incapacity to be a qualifying day.

If a Subpostmaster becomes incapable of work part way through a day, that day

cannot count as a qualifying day unless he has not commenced work on that day.

NOTIFICATION OF SICKNESS

A Subpostmaster or his representative must inform his Regional General Manger by
telephone of his incapacity for work on or before his first working day of sickness

irrespective of whether he is entitled to statutory sick pay.

Subpostmasters, including those nominated by limited companies, who hold more than
one appointment, must notify the appropriate Regional General Manager who is
responsible for the collection of primary National Insurance contributions in respect of

his appointments. (See section 10, paragraph 1)

If a Subpostmaster is late in giving notification of sickness, he should advise the
Regional General Manager of the reason for the delay. If the Regional General
Manager is not satisfied with the reason given for the delay, any period of sickness
prior to the date of notification will not count for the purposes of statutory sick pay. If
a Subpostmaster is not satisfied with the Regional General Manager's decision on this
matter he may apply to the Department of Social Security for a ruling. Ifa
Subpostmaster does not qualify for statutory sick pay, he will on notification of sickness

be sent a form SSP1 (E) by his Regional General Manager.

EVIDENCE OF SICKNESS

10.

11.

Subpostmasters must provide Post Office Counters Ltd with evidence of incapacity for
work by means of either a doctor’s medical certificate of by a self certificate if the
incapacity is less than eight days. A proforma to be used for self certification can be

END OF ENTITLEMENT TO STATUTORY SICK PAY

12. When a Subpostmaster has exhausted his entitlement to statutory sick pay he will be

sent a form SSP1(T), on which, if he is still sick, he can claim state sickness benefit from

the Department of Social Security.

RULES OF PAYMENT

13. In accordance with the Act, Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to abate any
remuneration due by the appropriate amount of statutory sick pay. The effect of this
will mean that for the first eight weeks of sickness, remuneration will be paid in full
and that statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional”. Consequently although
statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional” the total remuneration paid the
Subpostmaster will continue to attract income tax and National Insurance contributions

in full.

DUAL EMPLOYMENT

14. Ifa Subpostmaster who is sick is also employed either by the Post Office (e.g. as an
Auxiliary Postman) or another employer, and provided National Insurance
contributions are paid separately for each employment and alll other conditions are met,
he must claim statutory sick pay in respect of both his Subpostmaster services and

other employment(s).

SICK ABSENCE SUBSTITUTION SCHEME

15. The provisions of this Scheme, which are set out in Section 5, remain except that no
claim will be entertained unless the Regional General Manager has been properly
notified of the Subpostmaster’s sickness. Claims for reimbursement for up to 28 weeks’
sick absence will not be subject to abatement in respect of Statutory Sick Pay. Claims
for reimbursement for a period of sickness which does not attract statutory sick pay

will continue to be subject to abatement.

1. For National Insurance purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office holder with
emoluments chargeable to Income Tax under Schedule E. As such, all Subpostmasters
are liable to make National Insurance contributions in accordance with the provisions

of Class 1,

Class 1 contributions comprise 2 parts:-

(a) _ the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employee's

contribution;

(b) _ the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer's

contribution.

PERSONS TAKING UP APPOINTMENT AS A SUBPOSTMASTER

2. All persons taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional
General Manager with their National Insurance number by means of a NI number card,
form P45 and/or P60 (see leaflet NI217) and also any current certificate of Earner’s
non/reduced rate liability that they have. Where for one reason or another a new
Subpostmaster does not supply a NI number the action outlined in the Employer's

Guide to National Insurance Contributions (NP15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

Under the Social Security Act 1975, pensions for retirement, widowhood and invalidity

consist of 2 parts:-

(a) _ basic pension;

(b) and additional pension related to an employee's reckonable earnings between the
lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit.

4. Anemployer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which
provides an additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board is satisfied that his
occupational pensions scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As
Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Counters Ltd they are ineligible to
belong to the Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme and therefore are not contracted
out of the State Scheme.

CONTRIBUTIONS

5. DSS leaflet NP15 “Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions” gives a
guide to the contribution arrangements.

6. Provided that earnings reach or exceed the lower earnings limit, a Subpostmaster will

be liable to pay primary contributions on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit at:-

(a) the standard rate; or

(b) _ the reduced rate (see paragraph 8); or

(©) isnot liable for contributions because he/she is over pension age or has made

other arrangements (see paragraph 9).

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

7. There is no longer a right to choose to pay reduced rate contributions. However, a
woman entitled to pay at the reduced rate for the 1977-78 tax year continues to be able
to do so for subsequent years unless:-
(a) _ she revokes her election;

(b) asa married woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(©) _ she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow's

benefit;

(d) during 2 consecutive tax years which fall after 5 April 1978 she was neither liable

to pay a Cl

98 1 contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions of a Class 1 contributor’s
contribution at the reduced rate. As Post Office Counters Ltd will be held responsible
for any deficiencies in contribution, deductions will be made at the standard rate unless

the Subpostmistress produces a valid certificate.

NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS

8. No contributions are payable by men over 65 or women over 60 and in such
circumstances DSS will normally issue a certificate of age contribution. However, if
some other definite evidence is being held to show that a Subpostmaster has reached
age 65 (60 for a woman) his/her deductions may be ceased even though a certificate of

age exception has not been produced.

9. The Secondary contribution (see paragraph 2) is due at the same rate regardless of the

Subpostmaster’s rate of contribution or even where he is non liable.

ARREARS OF REMUNERATION

10. Arrears of remuneration resulting from a revision or other payments made to adjust
remuneration paid in an earlier month, will be treated as part of the total remuneration
in the month in which the payment is made, regardless of the period for which they are

proper to. This applies whether or not the additional payments are made regularly.

11. Where arrears of remuneration are due to a former Subpostmaster national insurance

contributions will be calculated from the weekly contributions table published by DSS.

DEATH OF SUBPOSTMASTERS

12. Contributions are not payable on any remuneration that might be due to a

Subpostmaster’s estate after his death.

HOLIDAY AND SICK ABSENCE PAYMENTS

13. Contributions are not due on any payments made under the holiday substitution or

Sick Absence Substitution schemes because all payments are made in respect of specific

costs incurred.

SICKNESS BENEFITS

14. NI Contributions continue to be payable when a Subpostmaster who is sick continues
to receive his scale payment. NI sickness/industrial injury benefits received are not

assessable for NI contribution.

SUBPOSTMASTERS WITH MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYMENT

15. Primary Class 1 contributions are normally payable in respect of each job including
other Sub-Office appointments for which earnings exceed the lower earnings limit,
unless a current form RD950 has been received from DSS. Even where a form RD950 is

held, POCL is obliged to collect Secondary Class contributions.

SUBPOSTMASTERS SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT REINSTATEMENT
16. Any payment withheld during suspension and subsequently paid upon reinstatement
should be treated as part of the total remuneration in the earnings period in which it is

paid regardless of the periods to which it relates. The NI contribution rate current at

the time of payment should be applied.

CHANGES IN NATIONAL INSURANCE STATUS

17. In the event of a change or impending change in national insurance status, a

Subpostmaster should consult his local DSS office as soon as possible.

deferment of NI retirement date (normally the 60th birthday for women, the 65th
birthday for men) see DSS leaflet NI92 - or where he wishes to cancel his deferment, the
Subpostmaster should be asked to consult his local DSS office so that the necessary

arrangements can be made and certificates of age exception obtained.

Mi

imum Pension will be preserved by DSS.

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

expenditure which they incur in providing Post Office services should do so with all
haste, Such information will be restricted to Post Office Counters Ltd and Department

(b) Subpostmaster has no alternative but to move his NIL
premises or alter them to meet requirements beyond

his control.

(©) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 50%
accommodation, which will neither increase nor
improve the Post Office accommodation, but will

require security equipment to be moved.

(d) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 80%

accommodation, which will reduce Post Office
accommodation, though not to a level unacceptable
to the Regional General Manager, but security

equipment will need to be moved.

have discretion to fix the level of contribution according to the circumstances of each

particular case.

RESIDENCE

8. A Subpostmaster who does not reside on the premises must satisfy his Regional
General Manger that he has made proper provision for the safety of Post Office

Adequate lighting and ventilation;

Adequate heating in winter.

The Subpostmaster as occupier of the premises, is required to provide most of the
above facilities under the provisions of the Offices, Shops and Railways Act 1963. It is
likely that the presence of postmen on the premises will require the Subpostmaster, as
occupier, to comply with other provisions of this Act. In addition duties are laid down
in Sections 3 and 4 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, as regards persons not in
his employment. Bearing in mind that the responsibility is his, it is in the

SECTION 15

ASSISTANTS

GENERAL

A Subpostmaster must provide, at his own expense, any assistance which he may need

to carry out the work in his sub-office.

Assistants are employees of the Subpostmaster. A Subpostmaster will be held wholly
responsible for any failure, on the part of his Assistants, to apply Post Office rules, or to
provide a proper standard of service to the public. He will also be required to make

good any deficiency, of cash or stock, which may result from his assistants’ actions.

ASSISTANTS’ CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

AGE

Wages, hours, holidays etc., are a matter to be settled between Subpostmaster and the

assistants concerned. However, they should be no less favourable than those enjoyed

by shop assistants generally in the same district, Post Office Counters Ltd reserves the

right to intervene if such conditions are considered inequitable.

The Subpostmaster is responsible, as employer of his assistants, for complying with the

provisions of any legislation which imposes obligations on employers.

Asa general guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Sub-Office

work, or have access to mails, unless however there is no reasonable alternative to the

part-time employment of an Assistant under 16 years of age.

SUITABILITY OF APPLICANTS - REFERENCES

6. Inthe light of the Subpostmaster’s responsibilities, set out in paragraph 2 above, he is

strongly recommended to satisfy himself of the character and suitability of an applicant

for employment as an As

ant before a firm offer of employment is made. Generally

the Subpostmaster should:-

(a)

(b)

obtain proof of the identity of the applicant, e.g. birth or marriage certificate,

unless the applicant is known;

seek information form the applicant about any conviction or finding of guilt for
any offence in a Court of Law (including Juvenile Court or Court Martial). In this
connection the Subpostmaster should be aware of the Rehabilitation of Offenders

Act 1974 which restricts the information that needs be given;

enquire whether the applicant has ever been employed by the Post Office,
worked for another Subpostmaster or held sub-office appointment. If the former
then details of such employment should be entered on form P250 (see paragraph
8) and a reference waited from the Regional General Manager. If previously the
applicant has worked at another Sub-Post Office, including as a Subpostmaster,
details should be given on form P250 and a reference in respect of that

employment sought from the Subpostmaster concerned;

obtain references from all previous employers or schools attended over the last 3
years or from the last employer where the applicant has been employed during

the whole of that period.

7. When seeking references the Subpostmaster is advised to enquire if the applicant had

found to be completely trustworthy and ask the reason for his leaving that

employment. In some instances a Subpostmaster might have to employ an Assistant

before the procedures suggested above are completed. Bearing in mind the

complexities of current employment legislation a Subpostmaster in such a situation is

recommended to offer initially only short term employment pending receipt of

satisfactory references etc.

8. The Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager of his intention to

employ a new Assistant on Post Office Counters Ltd work or when an Assistant ceases

to be employed in the sub-office.

PERSONAL DECLARATION

Before any person (including a member of the Subpostmaster’s family) is allowed to
have access to mails or to perform, either temporarily or permanently, any Post Office
work, he/she must make a personal declaration on form P13 (see section 16, appendix
2).

The declaration of the Subpostmaster’s Assistants and of any members of his family
who perform Post Office duties should be signed in the Subpostmaster’s presence in
circumstances which will help to fix the occasion and the declaration in the memory of
the signatory. The declaration should be made with proper deliberation and the
Subpostmaster should stress its importance and witness the signature. A signed and
witnessed copy of the form should be given to the signatory at the time and he should

be advised to preserve it carefully.

Forms P13 can be obtained from the Regional General Manager as required and must

be returned to him when signed.

SUB-OFFICE ASSISTANT ACCUSED OR SUSPECTED OF DISHONESTY ETC.

10.

11.

In cases where an Assistant is accused or suspected of dishonesty or any other offence
such as wilfully delaying postal packets, the Subpostmaster must report the particulars
to the Regional General Manager as soon as possible and await instructions. If the

report is made by telephone it must be confirmed in writing as a matter of urgency.

In cases where a person employed by the Subpostmaster is guilty of misappropriating
Post Office Counters Ltd money, any sum which may be tendered by, or on behalf of,
the offender may be accepted but a receipt must be given showing that the money is
held pending possible investigation and without prejudice to any action that Post
Office Counters Ltd may be advised to take. The Subpostmaster should be careful not
to take any action which may be liable to prejudice the question of legal proceedings. A

copy of any receipt must be kept for reference,

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

12.

In order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable or dishonest persons on Post

Office work, a Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager if he

dismisses an employee on these grounds, or if his enquiries about an applicant for
employment give him reason to believe that the applicant is an unsuitable person. Brief
particulars of the evidence should be forwarded to the Regional General Manager who
will decide what steps should be taken to prevent the applicant obtaining employment

elsewhere in the Post Office or at another sub-office.

13. Where Post Office Counters Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its
best interests for a particular person to have access to Post Office Counters Ltd cash
and stock as a Sub-Office Assistant it may call upon the Subpostmaster to:

(a) refrain from offering that person a post if not already employed;

(b) ensure that the person is not further employed on Post Office business if employed.

OUTDOOR POSTAL WORK

14. For any outdoor postal work required, provision is made either by the employment of

staff in the direct employ of the Post Office or by a special allowance to the

Subpostmaster for the engagement of casual labour.

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION, CORRESPONDENCE AND

INTERVIEWS.

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

1, The unauthorised disclosure, or use directly, of any information or document which

has come to the knowledge of a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant through the

work of his Sub-Office is forbidden. Any such disclosure may render the offender liable

to prosecution under Post Office legislation or the Official Secrets Act (see paragraph 3)

2. Subpostmasters and their employees must not disclose any information regarding

postal packets passing through the post except to the person(s) to whom such packets

are addressed; nor may they make known information that may come to them officially

concerning the character, standing, or responsibility of individuals or firms, or the

private affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3. (a)

(b)

All Subpostmasters on taking up appointment and newly recruited Sub-Office
Assistants are required to sign a Personal Declaration (form P13) which reminds
them of the duty of the Post Office to ensure that all communications and items
entrusted to it reach the people for whom they are intended promptly and safely,
and that the information in them reaches no one not entitled to it. The Person
Declaration also brings to the notice of newly appointed Subpostmasters and
Sub-Office Assistants on taking up employment their obligations under the
Official Secrets Acts and various Post Office and Telegraph Acts. Extracts from
these Acts are reproduced at Appendices 1 and 3. A copy of form P13 is at
Appendix 2.

A Subpostmaster on termination of his appointment is required to sign a
Declaration (P301) as a reminder that the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts
continue to apply to him after he has left in respect of all the information which
he has acquired or to which he has had access by virtue of his appointed position

as Subpostmaster. A copy of form P301 is at Appendix 3.

(c)  Subpostmasters and Sub-Office Assistants are given a copy of their P13 and
Subpostmasters on termination of their appointment, additionally of form P301
for retention as a reminder of their importance and of the message they contain.
The duty not to disclose information is imposed by the relevant Acts, not by the
Personal Declarations. Consequently no Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
can avoid these legal obligations by refusing to sign form P13 (also for
Subpostmasters form P301) or attempting to revoke or disclaim his signature on

the form(s).

4, Any request made by the Police or any other authority or by a private person for
information which may be confidential, or may concern matters connected with the
duties of another Subpostmaster or a Post Office employee, or with regard to the
address of a person who resides, in the neighbourhood should be referred immediately

to the Regional General Manager.

CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC NEWS MEDIA

5. The Post Office has a duty to safeguard its own interests and those of its employees and
sub-office personnel in relation to material which is published in the news media. The
Public Relations Department of the Post Office is primarily responsible for deciding
whether the Post Office should enter into public correspondence and for ensuring fair
and accurate presentation of facts about the Post Office and its services; comment by
other persons is undesirable and in particular, untrue, ill-informed or reckless comment
will not be allowed to go unchallenged. While recognising the right of any individual
to comment publicly on matters of general interest therefore, the Post Office expects
Subpostmasters and their employees who wish to comment upon matters affecting the
Post Office to exercise those right in a responsible manner. Subpostmasters must
ensure, when communicating with the press or offering comment which may be
broadcast on radio or television, that their comments do not go beyond the accepted
bounds of propriety and are not likely to cause embarrassment or to mislead the public.

The Regional General Manager should be asked to advise in cases of doubt.

6. A Subpostmaster wishing to communicate with the public news media should be

guided by the following:-

(a) there must be no unauthorised disclosure of official information (see paragraph

1);

(b) _ views and opinions expressed publicly must not bring the Post Office or its

employees or any other Subpostmaster into disrepute;

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear that

he is commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of the Post Office.

7. A Senior Representative (as defined in the national agreement on facilities for
recognised unions) may wish from time to time to represent the view of the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters, particularly on matters affecting his
Branch/Committee/ Federation. In doing so he must indicate his position as a

Federation spokesman and give his own name.

8. Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or

broadcasting reporters or interviewers,

PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

9. No Subpostmaster may, without the Regional General Manager's permission, use
information derived from official records or experience for the purpose of publishing
any document, book, play or article, broadcasting on radio or television, producing or
exhibiting a film or photographs, giving a talk or lecture or taking part in a public

discussion.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC

10. A Subpostmaster should not, without the permission of the Regional General Manager,
write to or interview members of the public on Post Office matters other than for the

purpose of correcting an error committed at his own sub-office.

67 Issue

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

11. No Subpostmaster may, without permission, make an official document or a letter from
the public, or any other document which may come into his hands officially, the subject

of legal proceedings.

USE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION OR POSITION FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES

12. No Subpostmaster may use his position to further his private interests, or act in any
way which might give rise to the suspicion that he has used, for private purposes,

information available to him in his capacity as Subpostmaster.

BREACHES TO BE REPORTED

13. A Subpostmaster must report to the Regional General Manager any case in which there
appears to have been a breach of the above rules by anyone employed by him on Post

ensure the continued viability of Post Office Counters nation-wide network.

2. It is, therefore, in the interests of all Subpostmasters that Post Office Counters Ltd
should be able to seek, negotiate and manage retail business in the market place
without the risk that it will find any Subpostmaster competing against it for the same
business, and accordingly a Subpostmaster must not undertake in a private capacity

any business, or allow anyone else to undertake on the premises in which a sub-office is

situated, business of the kind which Post Office Counters Ltd requires him to provide

for itself or its clients.

The current restrictions on private business activities on the premises in which the sub-

collection of revenue whether by sale of stamps or other means on behalf of local

authorities;

iii, sale of “unbooked” travel tickets or passes on behalf of any transport company or

local authority;

If an opportunity for new business occurs to a Subpostmaster, or if a Subpostmaster
receives any communication from a third party which amounts, or may amount, to an
offer to the Subpostmaster to undertake the work, which come within the current

lotteries must not be sold over the sub-office counter nor must the Post Office be used
in any way for advertising purposes, e.g. in giving addresses at which tickets are

available, nor must advertisements include the words Post Office, Sub-Post Office or

Subpostmaster.
LICENSED PREMISES
9. A sub-office may not be situated in premises for which an “on” licence allowing for the

sale of drinks, other than a restaurant, has been granted, unless the premises have been
clearly divided so that Post Office customers do not need to go through the licensed
premises. There is no objection to the Subpostmaster holding and “off” licence

provided the liquor is sold in closed vessels.

POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

10.

11.

A Subpostmaster is free to take part in any national and local political activities subject

to the following conditions:

(a) he must not engage in or allow his

stants to engage in political activities

whilst engaged on Post Office business or on the sub-office premises;

(b) he must not exhibit any notice soliciting votes for any particular candidate or
with any party or political object either in the sub-office or on any vehicle under
the control of the Post Office; and no leaflet or address with a party or political

object may lie or be exhibited within the sub-office.

A Subpostmaster who intends to stand for Parliament must notify the Regional General
Manger accordingly at the earliest opportunity. He must cease to have connection with
the running of the sub-office from the day he is nominated when the office will be
placed “in charge”. On receipt of the notification the Regional General Manger will
inform him of arrangements whereby he may name a deputy to act as Subpostmaster
should he be elected. If he is elected he will be able to resume office when he ceases to
be a Member of Parliament, provided he has complied with the arrangements for
naming a deputy and the sub-office has not been closed through normal changes
during his absence; should he fail to comply with these arrangements he will be
regarded as having resigned on the day he is elected. If he is not elected he may
resume office after the election result has been declared. A Subpostmaster who is
elected retains the right to resume office after he ceases to be a Member of Parliament,

provided the break in his service does not exceed 5 years.

USE OF THE NAME “POST OFFICE”

12.

A Subpostmaster must not use the name “Post Office” in connection with any of hi
private business activities or in such a way as to imply that the Post Office is in any

way connected with these activities.

whatsoever connected with the Subpostmaster’s private business at anytime when they

are employed in Post Office duties.

NOTE: In view of the implications of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 the agreement
of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has not been sought in the terms of

this section.

SECTION 18

NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURE

ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES

1, Although there may be instances where civil or criminal proceedings are contemplated
in which it would serve no useful purpose to call for a written explanation, in all other
instances, and without prejudice to any subsequent proceedings, any Subpostmaster
will be afforded an opportunity of giving a written explanation of allegations of non-

compliance or non-observance of the rules which are made against him.

2. At the discretion of the Retail Network Manager which will not normally be withheld,
the Subpostmaster may, if he wishes, meet the Retail Network Manager to discuss the
allegations. he may be accompanied by a friend while doing so. The friend must be
aged 18 or over and cannot be someone involved in the enquiry. The friend must be a
Subpostmaster, sub-office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local

NFSP representative.

3. As repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may lead to the

determination, without further warning or appeal, of the contract by means of the

giving of three months notice, it is strongly recommended that Subpostmasters take the
opportunity to make such written and verbal explanations of their actions at the time of
the alleged breach of rules. A record will be kept by the Retail Network Manager of

any such discussions and of any written warnings issued to the Subpostmaster.

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS

4, Without prejudice to the above a Subpostmaster may address at any time the Regional
General Manager and representation he may wish to make having reference to his
duties, remuneration or any other Post Office matter. The decision of the Regional

General Manager as to his response to such representations is final.

POL00075132
POL00075132

APPEALS

5. __ If the Subpostmaster wishes to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate his
contract for services, he may do so either in writing or by personal interview and will
be allowed ten (10) working days from the date of the termination letter to make
application, to a member of the Post Office Counters Ltd “Appeals Authority” whose
de

n will be final. There is no formal appeal against three months notice of contract

termination or against termination with pay in lieu of notice. Appeals on all other

issues (e.g. recovery of loss

caused by the Subpostmasters negligence) are heard by

the Regional General Manager whose decision is final.

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE

6. Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask
persons outside the Post Office to take up the case on his behalf although this does not
prevent a Subpostmaster from obtaining such advice and support from the NFSP or
any other outside person as may help him to present his case effectively. The
Subpostmaster should not detain Post Office papers or allow them out of his custody
for the purpose of such consultation without the permission of the Retail Network

Manager.

SECTION 19

OFFENCES: SUSPENSION: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION
DIVISION

1. Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
believed to have carried, or taken part in, an act of dishonesty against Post Office
Counters Ltd may be prosecuted. Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved
renders himself liable to summary termination of his contract. The case of an Assistant
Post Office Counters Ltd may recommend to the Subpostmaster that the Assistant

should no longer remain in his employ on Post Office Counters business.

ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS

2. A Subpostmaster must report to his Regional General Manager if he is arrested and
refused bail, or if he is convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic

offence for which the penalty has not included imprisonment).

IMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

3. It is the aim and practice of Post Office Counters Ltd to maintain, to the maximum
extent compatible with needs of service to the public, an attitude of non-interference in
the private lives of Subpostmasters. However, where facts come to light calculated to
cause public scandal or grave embarrassment to the Post Office in connection with a
Subpostmaster’s private conduct, the question of his fitness for retention in office may

have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4. A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at any time if that course is considered

desirable in the interest of Post Office Counters Ltd in consequence of his: (a) being,
arrested, (b) having civil or criminal proceedings brought or made against him, (c)
where irregularities or misconduct at the office(s) where he holds appointment(s) have
been established to the satisfaction of Post Office Counters Ltd, or are admitted, or are

suspected and are being investigated.

POL00075132

5. Where a Subpostmaster is suspended his remuneration in respect of any period of

suspension will be withheld so long as such suspension continues.

6. On the termination of the period of suspension whether by termination of contract or
reinstatement, the Subpostmaster’s remuneration in respect of the period may, after
consideration of the whole of the circumstances of the case, be forfeited wholly or in
part. If remuneration is paid any rent or other expenses which may have been paid to
him in respect of the continued use of his premises for Post Office purposes during the

period of suspension will be deducted,

CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING

7. If a Subpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal conduct
affecting the Post Office on the part of any person including, a Sub-Office Assistant or a
Post Office employee he must, if there is any apparent need for immediate action, at

once tell the Regional General Manager confidentially of his knowledge or suspicion.

INDUCEMENT TO ACT CONTRARY TO RULES

8. If any person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act
contrary to the rules (if, for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers
irregularly with a view to either himself or the offender afterwards enclosing therein
betting slips or other communications relating to the result of some race, game or sport)
he should, while avoiding compliance (save in the case described in paragraph 9, also
avoid putting that person upon his guard by definite refusal). The Subpostmaster
should as soon as possible tell the Regional General Manager what has happened
giving a full report and description of the person so that an immediate report can be

made to POID and instructions sought.

9. A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of
post for despatch or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped,
addressed to a betting agent, and presumably already containing a betting slip or other
communication respecting the result of some race, game or sport, should accept it and
with it any bribe offered for compliance. He should at once initial the cover and hand it
and the bribe to the Regional General Manager, to whom he should report as provided

in the last sentence of paragraph 8.

THEFTS BY STRANGERS

10.

A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who sees a theft of Post Office Property
committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the

matter to his Regional General Manager as soon as possible.

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

1.

In line with any employee of the Post Office a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is
expected to report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty or criminal intent which
may in any way affect the Post Office, whether the likely offender be connected with
the Post Office or not. He is similarly enjoined to render all possible assistance to

officers of the Investigation Division (see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12.

13.

The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or help the Police to
investigate, criminal offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and
the Department of National Savings. the Investigation Division does NOT enquire into

matters where crime is not suspected.

Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by outsiders.
If follows that a common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking interviews
with persons employed on Post Office business is to get help in clearing up such

offenct

. Usually the help takes the form of a witness statement that provides evidence
about a particular act or acts that the witness has carried out in the course of his or her

duty.

POL00075132
POL00075132

Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime investigations,

there are many ca‘

ses where the possibility (or even direct suspicion) arises that persons

employed on Post Office business may be involved. Officers of the Investigation

ion conduct interviews about these suspected offences and they are required to
observe the same code of conduct when obtaining evidence as that laid down for Police
Officers. This provides for an officer investigating a criminal offence to question any
person, whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful information may be
obtained. As soon as the Investigation Division officer has evidence which would
afford reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has committed an offence, he
must caution him before asking any questions about that offence. The caution must be
in terms which make it clear that the suspected person is not obliged to say anything
unless he wishes to do so and that what he says will be put into writing and given in

evidence.

If a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is questioned as a suspected person by an
officer of the Investigation Division, on statements made by a third person, and
expresses a desire to be confronted by that person, such confrontation will, if
practicable, be arranged. At the confrontation, the suspect will be at liberty to question
the third person on his evidence and the questions and replies will be recorded by the

Investigation Division officer.

FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS

16.

Atall interviews between Investigation Division Officers and a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant, the interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the nature
of the enquiry, the ask the person to be interviewed if he wishes to have a friend
present. The introduction and explanation are necessary first steps so the person to be
interviewed knows what is involved when he makes his free personal choice whether

to ask for a friend to be present at the interview or not.

86 Issue

19.

POL00075132
POL00075132

A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over
and cannot be someone involved in the inquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster,
Sub-Office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local NFSP
representative. To avoid unreasonable delay and to ensure that interviews will not
commence until a friend, if requested, is present, the person being interviewed will be
asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or subsequently) chosen is not
available or may be involved in the enquiry.

If a person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but changes
his mind later, he may ask for a friend to be called at that stage. If he is not questioned
as a suspected person at the outset (i.e. not under caution), but fresh evidence emerges
during the interview which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion, the Investigation
Division officer will make this clear and explain that he proposes to continue his
questions after caution. Before the caution is given the Investigation Division officer

will ask if the presence of a friend is desired during the remainder of the interview.

A friend may only attend and listen to questions and answers. He must not interrupt

in any way, either by word or signa

; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave at

once and the interview will proceed without him. Whatever is said at the interview is
to be treated as in strictest confidence. The friend may take notes of the interview but
he must keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The only communication the friend
is entitled to make on behalf of the person who has been questioned will be in the form
of a written “in strictest confidence” statement which may be submitted by the latter, in
support of any official appeal which the person questioned may desire to make in
connection with the methods followed at the enquiry. No other communication about
the interview is allowed (unless made by permission of the Post Office) as it might
constitute a breach of the Official Secrets Acts. The questioned officer may, however, if
he so desires, communicate the friend’s statement to the National Federation of Sub-

Postmasters in strictest confidence.

19.10.SEARCHES

20.

21.

Ifa person agrees to his property or house being searched by Investigation Division
staff the Investigation Division officer will ask, before the search is carried out, if he

wishes to have a friend present.

Investigation Division officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant or their homes unless the have first obtained the agreement of the
person concerned or they have obtained a warrant to do so. In practice Investigation

Division officers only seek authority or permission to search when it is deemed

absolutely necessary or in the interests of the person involved (e.g, as a pointer to their
innocence). If search by consent is carried out during the course of enquiries which do
not substantiate any suspicion that may have been directed at a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant, he will be handed at a later stage a written apology for any
inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he readily agreed to the search

and that nothing which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 20

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners
or hospital specialists, and to refrain from providing “Personal Service”, by taking,
leave of absence, through sickness if advised to do so. This is both for their own good

and that of others,

Contact with a person suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a
Subpostmaster from providing Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1

may apply if the medical practitioner so advises.

“Open cases” of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from the Post Office,

before a Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of “Personal Service”.

If the local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the
office, the Regional General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In such
cases the question of continuing payment of the subpostmaster’s emoluments subject to

a deduction in respect of any saving in expenses, will be considered on its merits.

These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on Post
Office duties, Also, in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by the

Subpostmaster or Sub-Office A

tant in consequence of the latters enforced absence
will be considered on its merits. It should, however, be understood that the object of

any payment that may be made by Post Office Counters Ltd in these c

to prevent

there being any inducement to the sub-office Assistant to come on duty when his

presence would be a source of danger to the public or the Post Office employees with
whom they might come in contact in his Post Office work. Post Office Counter

recognises no other obligation in the matter.

SECTION 21

TELEPHONE FACILITIES AT SCALE PAYMENT SUB-POST OFFICES

PROVISION OF TELEPHONE FACILITIES

1, A Subpostmaster must, in connection with official business of Post Office Counter Ltd,
and in the interests of security, arrange for the provision of telephone facilities at his

sub-post office. The following facilities are required by Post Office Counters Ltd:-

(a) a direct exchange line; or

(b)  anextension plan installation comprising a portable telephone and two sockets:
‘one to be installed in the sub-post office and the other in the Subpostmaster’s
bedroom. (This type of installation is only required where the Regional General
Manager considers it is desirable, as a security measure, and where the
Subpostmaster resides on the premises. However, Post Office Counters Ltd will
not require this type of system to be installed at island and small rural offices
where the Regional General Manager considers that the risk of criminal attack is

clearly negligible).

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSTALLATIONS COSTS

2. Post Office Counters Ltd will reimburse the Subpostmaster for costs incurred in the
installation of the required telephone facility provided that excessive expenditure is not
involved. However in the event that the Subpostmaster decides to have installed a
system other than that required by Post Office Counters Ltd the Post Office
contribution to the total installation costs will be no greater than the cost of installing,
the facilities outlined in paragraph 1 above. If a Subpostmaster is required to make
provision for an extension plan system as described in paragraph 1(b) and chooses to
have an extension socket in a room other than his bedroom the Post Office contribution
to the installation cost will be no greater than would be incurred in respect of the

installation of a direct exchange line.

RENTAL CHARGES

3. Post Office Counters Ltd on production of a paid quarterly telephone account, will
reimburse the Subpostmaster the rental charges billed by BT including the VAT
element (see paragraph 10) appropriate to the type of telephone facility that the

Regional General Manager has agreed is necessary (see paragraph 1). Rental charges
which exceed the levels so authorised by the District Manger remain the responsibility

of the Subpostmaster.

CALL UNIT ALLOWANCE

4. Each Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance of call
units for official purposes, based on the scale of Post Office business transacted; any
part of the allowance not expended in a telephone account period cannot be carried
over to the next. The Subpostmaster is due to pay for all call units used in excess of this

allowance.

5. The standard allowances have been fixed at a level which takes into account the

varying conditions between offices. They also allow a margin for contingencies.

6. The scale of allowances, related to the telephone account period, is as follows; the call
unit allowance in column (b) is intended to reimburse Subpostmasters for longer
distance calls to DNS, Girobank etc., where these are not covered by the basic

allowance in column (a):

Offices in unit bands: Official call units Additional call units
per annum per annum.
(a) (b)
Up to 85,000 260 NIL

7. Where calls from a sub-post office to the Regional or Controlling Crown Office are not
within a local call area and are charged on the basis of the distance between two points,
the standard allowance of official call units (paragraph 6, column (a)) will be subject to
the following multipliers:
Distance in miles from District or Rate of charge Multiplier to be
controlling Crown Office applied to official
allowance
Up to 35 miles a 5
over 35 miles b 4
SUPPLEMENTARY ALLOWANCE
8. A Mailwork Subpostmaster may claim an additional allowance, in respect of calls made

in connection with his Mailwork responsibilities, providing that the standard allowance
has been expended. A claim, supported by documentary evidence should be submitted

to the Regional General Manager with the telephone account for the period concerned.

EMERGENCY REPAIRS

9. Some British Telecom General Managers are prepared to provide emergency repair

facilities for Subpostmasters. The service allows for attention to faults reported:-
(a) Monday-Friday between 1700 and 0800 hours;

(b) Saturday up to 0800 and from 1300 hours;

(Q) all day on Sunday, Public and Bank Holidays.

All other times repair facilities apply. Subpostmasters will be billed for use of the

emergency service on the normal quarterly bill and Regional General Mangers will

reimburse these costs on presentation of the bill.

SECTION 22

QUALITY STANDARDS

1. Post Office Counters Ltd, through its network of post offices, aims to give customers
and clients a high quality service. The Subpostmaster must therefore give high priority
to serving customers quickly and efficiently, and to fulfilling the documentation
requirements of clients with accuracy and professionalism. Also the Subpostmaster
will participate in “Putting the Customer First” by attending the training sessions
which form the programme and carrying out the interim activity required between

sessions.

The interim activity consist of commitment to display the Customer Charter in the
public area of the sub post office, and to hand out questionnaires inviting customer
feedback. On an ongoing basis questionnaires will be handed out at regular intervals,
to be determined by POCL, but not more than once every six months. In addition to
the issue of questionnaires Subpostmasters, particularly those in larger offices, will be
encouraged to measure customer service as described below. Subpostmaster’s sub-
office assistants are also expected to undergo the “Putting the Customer First”
programme, either at sessions led by the Subpostmasters themselves, once they are
trained, or the retail network manager. Subpostmasters should make all reasonable

efforts to encourage their staff to participate in the training.

Payment for attendance at the four “off site” sessions, led by retail network managers,

within the “Putting the Customer First” programme, will be for travel and substitution.

WAITING TIME

2. The Subpostmaster should ensure that the time for which customers wait to be served
is kept to the minimum, and make any adjustments to the staffing pattern accordingly.
To help achieve this objective Subpostmasters in offices displaying the charter,
particularly those in larger offices, will be encouraged to monitor waiting times using

the system developed by POCL.

94 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved
POL00075132
POL00075132

This entails counting the number of customers queuing and the number of clerks
serving, three times a day and to supply the information to POCL to enable the results

to be analysed and fed back to the Subpostmaster.

While POCL has an overall national objective for customers to wait for no longer than
five minutes before being served, it is recognised that customers have different needs
and expectations of waiting time in different offices, and at different times of the day or
week, However, Regional General Managers will treat very seriously any evidence
which suggests that the Subpostmaster is not making all reasonable efforts to ensure

that customer waiting time is minimised, to meet the needs of customers locally.

TRANSACTIONS

3. The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out
accurately, that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all
documentation is properly completed and despatched at the due time. Where under
the terms of its contracts with its clients Post Office Counters Ltd incurs financial
penalties as a result of the Subpostmaster’s failure in this regard, Post Office Counters.
Ltd may pass on this additional cost to the Subpostmaster. The Appendix to this
Section sets out the current maxima of the penalties which can be passed on to the
Subpostmaster. In such circumstances, Post Office Counters Ltd will furnish copies of
the appropriate documents as evidence in support of any action, Failure to properly
complete accounting and traffic information documents may lead to the exclusion in

whole or in part of business transacted for the purposes of determining payment.

4, The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and
helpfully. Persistent failure to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post

Office Counters Ltd could result in termination of contract.

REDEMPTION OF TELEPHONE, TELEVISION, MOTOR VEHICLE AND OTHER
SAVINGS STAMPS

1. A Subpostmaster must only accept savings stamps either in total or part payment for

the relevant transaction to which they refer.

2. It is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a Subpostmaster (or anybody acting on his
behalf) to:-

(i) exchange redeemed savings stamps for cash;

(ii) affix savings stamps to savings cards and claim them as if they had been

redeemed by a customer in the normal course;

(iii) convert total of partial cash or cheque payments for licence or accounts payments

into stamps and claim them as if they had been presented by a customer;

(iv) convert official cash (whether directly from the till or paid in over the counter)
into savings stamps (whether affixed to a card or not) for use as a means of
saving for any purpose whatsoever; or to take action which improperly sets out

to increase his remuneration.

3. Redeemed savings stamps must be despatched immediately following completion of
the cash

ccount on which the trans

ction to which they refer takes place. It is not

acceptable to remit redeemed savings

imps later than the scheduled despatch date or

to remit several weeks redemption together.

4. In the event that cases of falsification come to light Post Office Counters Ltd will view

such activities extremely seriously and in such circumstances almost certainly consider

termination of the Subpostmasters Contract for services
