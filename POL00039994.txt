Dear Ms Vennelis

Horizon computer system

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is an independent public body that was set up
in March 1997 by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995. Our purpose is to review possible
miscarriages of justice in the criminal courts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
and refer appropriate cases to the appeal courts.

For obvious reasons, we have read the recent media coverage concerning the Post
Office Horizon computer system with interest. Clearly, it would be very useful for us to
have more information directly from the Post Office, especially accurate information as
to number of criminal convictions that might be impacted by the issue and what action
is proposed, or being taken, in that respect.

We see that the Attorney General was called upon on Tuesday to set up an enquiry
and we are in contact with his office about that.

In essence, the Commission’s role in this is likely to relate to anyone who is convicted
of a criminal offence (in England, Wales or Northern ireland), where evidence from the
Horizon computer system is relevant, where (i) they have already tried to appeal
against that conviction or (ii) they were convicted at Magistrates’ Court following a
guilty plea.

I look forward to receiving your reply.
