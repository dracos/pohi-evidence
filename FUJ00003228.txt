At a working level, Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account)
generally recognise the term Business Continuity as having three closely related
components: resilience, contingency and recovery

May be defined as the steps taken to avert a loss of service or disaster or reduce
the likelihood of a disaster or loss of service.

Contingency May be defined as the interim processes and procedures adopted during the loss of
service.
Recovery May be defined as the business and technical arrangements to restore a lost

system or service and manage the process of reversion to normal processing and
full resumption of service.

Post Office Account HNG-X Business Continuity Framework

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1.

Introduction

A key requirement in the Post Office Account solution is that of business continuity i.e. ensuring
there are operational processes and procedures in place to ensure that any component failure
has minimal effect on the services provided.

This will cover failures in the core Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) services e.g. DCOS,
BNS and the underlying services e.g., NBS, TPS, APS, and as defined in table 4.2 support
services and client services where appropriate.

A principle requirement specified within schedule B2 of The Agreement is the provision of
Business Continuity Plans which conform to an overall ‘Service Continuity Framework’.

It is the objective of this document and associated Business Continuity Plans to satisfy that
requirement and Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) and Post Office Limited have agreed
that the title of this document should be ‘Business Continuity Framework’.

Specifically this document will cover the following areas.

a) Provide a baseline definition of the Business Continuity Framework and Business Continuity
Plans as specified in Schedule B2.

b) Provide a detailed definition of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) deliverables associated
with business continuity and the methods of review and assurance.

c) Define the contents and format of the Business Continuity Plans.
d) Define the overall test strategy adopted for testing of the Business Continuity Plans.

€) Define the management processes for the management of Major Business Continuity
Incidents.

Scope

The scope of this document is targeted towards how Business Continuity tests will be conducted
and recorded on the Post Office Account, Horizon infrastructure and related applications.

The general framework defined in this document is release-independent.

This document does not include any details in respect of the results of technical testing of the
recovery processes.

Framework Overview

Introduction

The Business Continuity Framework defines the methodology agreed between Fujitsu Services
(Post Office Account) and Post Office Limited for handling all aspects of Business Continuity.

The constituent elements of the Business Continuity Framework may be represented as follows.
Each element will be looked at in more detail below.

Figure 1 Service Elements

3.1.1 Business Continuity Plans
There are three Continuity Plans for HNG-X:
HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan — (SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)
HNG-X Support Services Business Continuity Plan — (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001)
HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan — (SVM/SDM/PLA/0031)

The HNG-X Business Continuity plans will define the applicable sections of the Horizon Services
Business Continuity Plans that support the services and infrastructure being utilised in the data
centres to support Horizon counters.

The contents of the Business Continuity Plans are specified within Schedule B2. All plans must
be of the document type Business Continuity Plan and shall contain Continuity Plan within the
title. Each plan shall have a specified owner. (Further details in section 8)

The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments as agreed by
Fujitsu Services and Post Office. Such assessments shall be reviewed when agreed by the
Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

The Business Continuity Plans shall include without limitation the following:
Prevention measures;
Preparedness measures;
Contingency measures;
Recovery of normal service;
Contact lists.

The major elements of the plans are as follows.

3.1.1.1. Risk Analysis and Service Impact
Each Business Continuity Plan will identify all potential risks in terms of likelihood and service

impact.

Post Office Account HNG-X Business Continuity Framework

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

Once an incident occurs which has a service continuity impact, there must be a mechanism in
place to assess the impact of the incident and the possible effect(s) it will have on the end to end
service. This is fairly complex and will be dependent upon time of day and therefore will be a
real-time process i.e. the impact of the service failure at 2am will be different from the impact at
8pm. However, a high-level impact statement will be included in the relevant Business
Continuity Plan.

3.1.1.2 Escalation Contacts

Each Business Continuity Plan will contain escalation routes in conformance to Cross-Domain
Business Continuity management processes.

3.1.1.3 Resilience Strategy documents
Each Business Continuity Plan will contain, where appropriate, references to the underlying
resilience strategy document and/or technical design documents.

3.1.1.4 Contingency Procedures
Each Business Continuity Plan will contain a section defining contingency actions.

From an operational perspective contingency actions are documented in a number of places,
depending upon the severity of the service element failure.

1. Where appropriate, contingency actions are documented within the Action column of the Risk
Analysis (and service impact) section of each plan.

2. Where appropriate, for potential MBCIs and MBCI contingency actions are documented in the
contingency section of each plan.

3.1.2 Service Framework

The BCF shall be defined in terms of services rather than components of infrastructure. The
definitions of the services that are a subject of the BCF are defined in this document.

Section 4 contains details of the service elements and components together with their
relationship to each of the Business Continuity Plans.
3.1.3 Business Continuity Management Process

The resolution of incidents will be dealt with through the standard Service Desk Incident
Management process.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident there will be a need for controlled and co-
ordinated activity across Post Office Account and Post Office Limited. (See section 5)

3.1.4 Test strategy and plans

The test schedule and method will be defined as a separate document (SVM/SDM/PLA/0003)
and will be referred to within the Business Continuity Plans. The overall high-level strategy will
be defined in this document for agreement. (See section 6)

3.1.5 Review strategy

A review strategy defines the joint review mechanism prior to acceptance and also the review
mechanism of the processes following acceptance. This is defined in a later section for
agreement. (See section 7)

5 Business Continuity Management Process

An incident is an unplanned occurrence that adversely impacts upon the normal service in
some important way. The scale of the event can range from a minor fault to a major outage
e.g.:

Minor incident e.g. HNG-x counter failure affecting service at an individual Branch.

Major incident e.g. loss of the Active HNG-X Data-centre, outage of key back-end system
affecting service at all Branches.

The resolution of minor incidents will be dealt with through the standard Service Desk
Incident Management process.

Major Business Continuity Incidents will have a significant impact upon Post Office Limited.
In such cases there will be a need for controlled and co-ordinated activity across supplier
organisations and Post Office Limited. Consequently all Major Business Continuity Incidents
will be managed via the ‘Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) Business Continuity
Management’ process ( SVM/SDM/PRO/0028) and the Post Office Limited and Fujitsu
Services Business Continuity Interface Agreement (CON/MGM/005). These documents
support the immediate escalation of major incidents to a Cross Domain Business Continuity
Management Team (BCMT). The BCMT consists of operational managers from each
organisation.

6 Test Strategy and Plans

6.1

6.1.1

6.2
6.2.1

Requirements
Schedule B2 requires that:
‘The Business Continuity Plans shall include a testing strategy with two distinct parts

) Initial testing before commencement of Roll-Out of Services
b) Regular testing’

Unless agreed otherwise in accordance with paragraph 6.1.3 below, the Business Continuity
Services shall in respect of any new service introduced through the Change Control
Procedure:

include the performance of substantially the same business continuity tests as are
described in this Business Continuity Framework prior to the introduction of that new
service; and

include any specific business continuity tests agreed by the Parties.

The tests referred to in paragraph 6.1.2 above shall be conducted with the business continuity
tests conducted for the infrastructure supporting the Applicable Services and scheduled in
accordance with working practice for the Applicable Services. The frequency of and method
used for all business continuity tests shall be documented in the document entitled "Business
Continuity Test Scheduler Planner" (SVM/SDM/PLA/0003).

Business continuity tests to be carried out under this Business Continuity Framework may be
cancelled or rescheduled and/or the method used for a test may be varied for operational
business reasons by agreement in writing between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).

Initial Testing
Existing Services

Initial Business Continuity testing was conducted prior to the full operational introduction of
the Horizon Service (Core System Release) and the subsequent release of major services,
e.g. MBS, NBS and ETS services. Test reports have been produced for this testing and are
maintained in SharePoint within BCP directory, the summary of the test reports will be
formally e-mailed to POL on annual basis.

6.2.2 New Services

Where services are introduced for HNG-X the Test Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0003), (REF3) will
be revised to include the Business Continuity testing of those services and define when the
initial testing will be conducted.

For HNG-X SVM/SDM/PLA/003 defines the Test Plan and provides cross reference to the
test scripts which have been produced for the Business Continuity initial testing.

The level and schedule of testing is dependent upon operational constraints and is
accomplished by a mix of operational tests and procedural walk-through. Where involvement
is required from Post Office Limited the test schedule will be agreed in advance.

When services are withdrawn, and infrastructure tests are no longer relevant or are
superseded, the applicable tests shall be removed from Business Continuity Test Scheduler

7 Review Strategy

A Business Continuity Steering Group has been established between Post Office Limited and
Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account). This group reviews the progress of each release
against the Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) delivery and acceptance plans. It also
facilitates the co-ordination of joint development review and assurance activities where
necessary. This forum also provides an objective feed into the release authorisation process
for new releases.

This team, or subset of the team, reviews all aspects of business continuity on an ongoing
basis, during Live Trials and beyond. The remit of the team is to continually look at ways of
improving cross-domain business continuity processes.

8 Business Continuity Plans

8.1

8.2

8.3

Throughout section 8, the use of /talics denotes the actual words in Schedule B2.

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments and agreed
by Fujitsu Services and Post Office .....

Ownership of Plans

‘Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the Business Continuity Plans. ”

Each Business Continuity Plan will clearly state the owner of the plan who is responsible for
the definition, maintenance, testing and review of the plan.

In addition to this, the Fujitsu Services (POA) Business Continuity Manager will have overall
responsibility for the development, co-ordination and integration where appropriate of all
Business Continuity Plans and providing Post Office Limited with a single point of contact.

Plan Activation

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall include activation procedures and time periods within
which the contingency measures shall be activated.’

Where appropriate Business Continuity Plans will contain a risk and impact assessment for
both the core post office day (Monday to Friday 08:00 to 18:00 and Saturday 08:00 to 13:00)
and the non-core post office day (18:00 to 08:00) (See 8.3), For services where the impact
of the service element failure is common throughout the day, a single risk and impact
assessment will be documented.

Alternatively, a single risk statement may be documented throughout the day in the risk table.
The Critical Time Factors (CTF) here shall be determined by the criticality of the service
activity. I.e. for on-line service, e.g. NBS and DCS the CTF is identified against Post Office
Core Day processing, whilst for file transfers, e.g. APS and TPS the CTF is identified against
Post Office Non-Core Day processing. The risk assessment identifies the critical time periods
for activation of contingency measures and identifies the associated contingency actions.

Impact and Risk Assessment

‘The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments by Fujitsu
Services and Post Office...’

Contained within each service are a number of critical components, the failure of which
would cause a potential service disruption. Consideration shall also be given to the impact
arising from the loss of building or staff. Each of these critical components and the
associated failure scenarios will be identified and documented within a risk and impact matrix

within the Business Continuity Plan. This matrix is used as a tool to present in a tabular form
all risks identified with a service together with the impact of that risk occurring, the time after
which that impact becomes critical, and the contingency actions to be taken.

Associated with each of the above elements are impact statements, which will define the
likely business impacts of failure of the critical components. To aid in the definition of these,
each Business Continuity Plan, where appropriate, will contain a schematic defining the
operational day for that particular service. SLA liabilities will be used as an aid in determining
business impact. Where the impact triggers either a Potential MBCI or an MBCI, the
appropriate action will be identified from within the matrix.

Associated with the impact statement will be a reference to the specific recovery and
contingency procedures required.

Business impact assessment will be reviewed jointly with Post Office Limited and will be
subject to ongoing review.

The combination of risk and impact will also determine the level of ongoing testing that will
form part of the testing strategy.

Other Requirements
‘The Business Continuity Plan shall include, without limitation, the following
a) Prevention measures
b) Preparedness measures
C) Contingency measures
d) Recovery of normal service

) Contacts list’

In addition to the above the plans shall include details of the individual services, references
to the relevant operations manual and references to the underlying resilience strategy
document and/or technical design documents, where appropriate.

Preventative Measures

Preventative measures are defined as those measures that are in place to prevent service
continuity failures in the first place. There are two aspects that are considered.

8.4.1.1.1 Technical Design

A key element of the design of the service is the elimination of single points of failure and the
ability to fail-over to contingency infrastructure, e.g., an alternative live BladeFrame image,
an alternative network circuit, and thereby recover the service in a timely manner.

This capability is documented in a number of technical design documents, which in turn are
referenced within the relevant Business Continuity Plans.

From an HNG-X service perspective IRE11 is the active data-centre and IRE19 is intended
to be used as a HNG-X disaster recovery data-centre and only invoked for major incidents,
e.g., fire, flooding. Note from a network perspective IRE11 and IRE19 will be used in a
live/live mode of operation.

8.4.1.1.2 Security

Plans and processes will be established to comply with the Business Continuity requirements
of 1S027001 and SVM/SEC/MAN/0003.

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

Another preventative measure is the denial of access to the service to anyone who may wish
to deliberately cause disruption. Although not mentioned specifically within Business
Continuity Plans, this requirement is met through general conformance to Access Control
Policy and the Security Functional Specification.

The Security Business Continuity plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0031) has been produced to meet the
requirements of ISO 27001 and should be used in conjunction with the HNG-X Services,
Support Services (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001) business continuity plans.

8.4.2 Preparedness Measures
Preparedness measures are implemented in a number of ways:

a) The provision of risk and impact assessments, along with references to
appropriate recovery and contingency procedures will allow appropriate actions
to be carried out in a pre-prepared manner.

b) Initial technical testing and the operational testing of Business Continuity Plans
will ensure all activation of the Business Continuity Plans will have been carefully
rehearsed.

c) Joint process and procedure walk-through will, as above, ensure all Cross-

Domain (multi-party) Business Continuity processes are tested thoroughly.

8.4.3 Contingency Measures

Contingency measures may be defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage prior to
recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management and
initiation of recovery procedures. These will be documented within the Business Continuity
Plan and also as references to supporting documentation.

An example of contingency measures is failing over the host server in the event of the prime
server experiencing a failure.

8.4.4 Recovery of Normal Service

These procedures will be mainly of a technical operational nature and there may be
references to other activities that may impact across service boundaries. Where appropriate
these will be referenced within the plan.

8.4.5 Contact List

Each Business Continuity Plan will document the contacts for initial contact and technical
liaison where appropriate, together with details of escalation contacts. This will be in
accordance with the Business Continuity Management process.

Introduction

This section defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity requirements
of Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account).

Also included within this section is the method of acceptance planned for each deliverable.

Methodologies used in the acceptance process include those identified below:

Joint Review

Joint review is by circulation of, discussion about and agreement upon the structure and
content of a document by Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) and Post Office Limited.

Document Inspection

Formal inspection of a paper copy, by Post Office Limited, of a commercially sensitive (i.e.
technical design) or Service Provider (i.e. Fujitsu Services Core Services) operational
document, by the appropriate reviewing authorities, whilst under supervision by the document
owner. No paper or electronic copies must be taken. Objective of this process is to verify the
existence of the document; no approval rights are associated with this activity.

Inspection to take place at the premises of the document owner.

Procedural Walkthrough

A paper based technique whereby a scenario is selected and the actions and procedures of
those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted followed through to ensure that both individual
service delivery unit procedures, and cross boundary SDU procedures, are both complete
and fully integrated. Where appropriate, i.e. affecting Post Office Limited services, Post
Office Limited will be invited to procedural walkthroughs.

Operational Test

An exercise using live operational service components, or where more appropriate and
agreed by Post Office Limited a test environment, whereby a scenario is selected and the
actions and procedures of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted are followed
through. This is to ensure that both individual service delivery unit procedures, and cross
boundary SDU procedures are both complete and fully integrated, and that the desired
outcome on the operational service components is achieved. This is then followed by the
total regression of any changes made to the live service components.

An example of live operational functionality testing was the Campus Fail-over test that was
conducted during CSR Live Trial. An example of a business continuity operational test in a
test environment is the verification of recovery procedures for the Reference Data RDT Host.
