The attached went to Brian on Tuesday (which is the original drafts of the stacking and prosecutions paper). I'll give you a
call about what to do with the new note from Chris.

Subject: Re-drafted draft prosecutions paper

Is attached. It is not complete, but I thought that I would try to set out a sense of direction for it. There is still some good
stuff in Rod’s original paper that I haven’t included, but maybe someone could do a sweep of that during the course of
the day. Could I ask one or both of the recipients of this email to have a go at polishing it to the next stage? Cheers Chris
