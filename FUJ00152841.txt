I met with the defence solicitor yesterday and she informed me that all witnesses are required for the forthcoming trial. I will contact you
towards the latter end of next week but envisage that you will all need to attend either on Monday PM or Tuesday of that week. Please
ensure that you keep your diaries clear.

Phil - Can you confirm whether the third officer (Lisa Allen) is really needed. Can you also liaise with our barrister Warwick Tatford and
get a pecking order so that we can inform each witness on what day they should attend court
