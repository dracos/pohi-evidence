Case ‘ory

2. This case was listed before the Nottingham Magistrates Court on 14"
November 2011 when the defendant pleaded guilty and the case was

defendant was dealt with as above.
Prosecution case
3. The defendant, Tahir Sethi was during the relevant period the sub postmaster

at Farnsfield Sub Post Office. He had been working as such for 10 months

prior to his suspension.
4. On 27" July 2011 auditors attended the Farnsfield Sub Post Office following a
telephone call from a member of staff raising concerns that the sub postmaster

was removing post office funds from the branch.

5. On the date of the audit, 27" July 2011, the auditor found a total shortage of
£13,174.23 made up as follows:

e £11,151.65 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures

e £510.40 (-) identified as a difference in stock figures

e £1,007.99 (-) identified as a difference in postage figures
e £504.19 (-) Discrepancy as per office snapshot

6. Mr Sethi was asked if he knew what the outcome of the audit might be and he
replied that the cash would be short by £11,000.00. He explained that he had
been struggling financially and bailiffs had attended another of his businesses
demanding cash and he had taken the cash the previous night as a short term

solution to give to the bailiffs.

7. In his interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 27" July 2011,
the defendant said:

— He confirmed the account given to the auditors.

— The money was to go to the bailiffs who were at his 24 hour Nisa store
in Mansfield Road.

— He said that there was another carried forward loss of £506.00

— He overstated the cash to cover the loss

— He was intending to put the cash back.

— He had borrowed money before from the Post Office when the banks
were closed in sums of £100-£300. He put it back in the morning.

— He admitted that “borrowing” as he had done was, “In a way it’s

stealing I suppose.”

Defence case

8. In interview the defendant admits both taking Post Office money and

fraudulently covering up losses.

Discussion

9. This is a case where the defendant effectively pleaded guilty at the first
appearance in the Magistrates Court. It is difficult to see how he could have
been assisted by the issues raised by the Second Site Interim Report which,
even had we been aware of it we almost certainly would not have disclosed at
this stage or indeed at all in this case where there were full admissions to the

offence charged.

10.On his own admissions in interview and those made through his legal

representatives he is guilty of the offence to which he pleaded guilty.

Conclusion

11. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the Second Sight Interim
Report, we would not have needed to disclose anything contained therein to
this defendant. The passage of time has not changed that position, in my

opinion, and we need take no further action upon this file.
