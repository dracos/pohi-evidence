VISIT TO SOUTH RIBBLE AND CHORLEY CONSTITUENCIES: 16
NOVEMBER 2000

Further to my minute of 11 November and briefing for your visit to the Preston and
Chorley on Thursday, 16 November, the Post Office have supplied the following
briefing on constituency specific post office network issues.

The issues that have been identified are predominantly around the uncertainties about

the future of the network. As a number of sub-postmasters have been invited to attend

the meetings, these have been included, although there should be nothing unexpected.
Issues

¢ The Branch Office in Chorley remains as part of the Crown office network.
However, Royal Mail have moved from the building to a new location and the
building, apart from the PON part, has been sold for development. No other
movements in the network were reported.

¢ Worries about investing in their businesses when the future looks uncertain to them.

Even in the uncertain climate some Subpostmasters have spent large amounts of
their capital to transform their offices, in some cases with the assistance of PON, in

others without this assistance. New Hall Lane, Cemetery & North Rd have all made

major investment - all three Subpostmasters have received invitations to meet Alan
Johnson.

¢ Subpostmasters who wish to sell their business are finding that 'buyers' are not
coming forward mainly due to the publicity around the ACT issue. Some offices
have been for sale for more than two years.
¢ Horizon has in the main been well received in local offices. There have been some
teething problems, but Subpostmasters see this investment as a positive step to
increasing business in the future.

The local representative is Trish Kelly, Subpostmaster at Ainsdale.
