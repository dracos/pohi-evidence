I don't believe this 's a fault. If the clerk enters the posteode either on the criteria screen or subseduently, it w)
shouldn't be cleared down if they then change the service. The system doesn't make any assumptions about =f
where the postcode was entered i.e pre or pest service selection screen. The sar uid be true for fields such PAS<
as weight For fields such as the value of goods, that can only be entered past ‘Service selection screen’ then
these should be cleared down if the service is changed.

ba
vé the issue that the PAF validated
an but is not selectable? .

address captured initially is displayed on the PAFLite

The address at the top is not suppo s it is history text generated by tt e normal PAF
step. This is standard behaviour of normal PAF in thet the history text will be a d to the screen and therefore
visibie on other screens. it happens to be uded onto the screen for PAF lite and not the other Po:
screens, because PAF Lite is an included use case. I think we need a xd reason to overrict is standard
behaviour, as this history text may be useful information to the clerk. If this answer is sufficie en T suggest
this peak is closed as no fault. However, if there shouldn’t be history text, then ensuring that the history text
generated from normal PAF does not appeer on the PAF lite screen is not strai rward, It would require a
change to the normal PAF use c (Acquire Address Details) anc this can't be resolved through modifying PAF
Lite. The ‘Acquire Address Detalis' would need to suppress the adding of the history text. wever, other use

< are aiso calling this use case such as APADC which require the history text. The solution would require
modification to ‘Acquire Address Details’ such that a parameter is passed in €.g. noHistoryOutput. Such a flag is
available for calling use cases to use for manual address capture, The address details would then added to the
history for nen-postal services use cases and not for Postal Services (Source and Destination address capture). It
needs to be investigated if this approach is actually a fix or a change to the use case.Can you therefore disc:
. I with POL as to whether this is } kely sce: te happen and whether it should be addressed or not?~~~DO NOT
