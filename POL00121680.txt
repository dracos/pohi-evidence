I have developed Procedures & Standards in respect of Committal Papers and this has been agreed by the Criminal
Law Team. Accordingly the P&S and the relevant forms are associated with this Email. Arrangements are in hand to
publish the documents on Sharepoint and the GSD

A presentation has been delivered to RML & PFWW investigators as they do not get the same number of committals
as Investigators in PO Ltd so you may wish to merely forward this to your Investigators for their information in respect
of the procedures and amended forms.
