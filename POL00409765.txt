Subject: Induction

Alice, to let you know that Alwen will send across a proposed induction schedule (today/tomorrow am). Tracy is already in
contact with your office to secure dates.

We have prioritised the important areas, focusing on the future strategy, current challenges and the Exec team. This
‘phase 1' induction will also include branch visits and a ‘Front Office of Govt’ demo, as I'm keen that you see similar
models to those that Edward Davey has visited to provide a common understanding for any early conversations you may
have. Front Office and Network Transformation are Government's two big solus topics in respect of Post Office.
(Politicians and senior officials)

This will also help with your first meetings with the NFSP (National Federation of Subpostmasters), the CWU and
probably Ed Mayo (CEO Cooperatives UK), who BIS engaged to provide the background report for the Autumn
consultation on Mutualisation.

Phase 2 takes in more of the POL senior team and stakeholders.

I have also briefed an ‘info pack’, which I'll take you through and leave with you when we meet. Alwen will detail what is in
this in her covering note.

Donald, thank you for agreeing to ‘cast an eye': when you see it, please let Alwen know if you have anything to add. (I
deliberately haven't added in any refs to Politicians/Officials as Alice and I should probably talk this through - but any
thoughts would be welcome.)

Best, Paula

Ps. Alwen, please add a copy of the Cooperatives UK report to the documents list for Alice.
