1 Incident Summary/Overview

1.1. Description

On 27.03.2023, at approx. 18:56 the IRE19 Galleon NTS-6002 time server time/date had reset
to 11th August 2003. This affected all platforms running time off these servers, including live Network
Reverse Proxy servers. This caused NRP005, NRPOO6 and NRPOO7 to believe that client certificates
were expired and only NRP008 servicing the traffic. As a result, counter service impact was observed
starting from 18:58:15 when first Counter Super Event — 0440 was observed until approx. 04:00, when all
impacts were resolved.

Example branch traffic during the impact - about 1 transaction per minute was observed between 19:47
and 22:12.

The batch schedule delays were observed, but all files were delivered within the agreed time window.
Example: previous week Santander GIRO files were sent to NBIT at 20:50, on 27.03.2023 they were
delayed to 22:20.

Also, EPAY service was impacted by this issue from 19:47 until 22:12.

Multiple Windows servers were impacted and had to be recovered. SSNv2 (Windows 2012) access was
affected as well causing partial impact to monitoring tools (No issues with SSNv1). Windows NRPs were
affected, however, on Linux platforms the NTP service was stopped, but it did not refer to the default
date due to the safety mechanism that did work (“tinker panic” setting).

During the tech bridge call, once issues with the IRE19 Galleon server were identified, the faulty
IRE19 Galleon Server was removed from the service via GUI (“soft shut down”) and the working IRE11
Galleon Server configuration was updated to remove the peer of the IRE19 Galleon Server. A decision
was then taken by Fujitsu Service to manually point NRPOO5, NRPOO6 and NRPOO7 to the working
IRE11 Galleon Time Sync server. Following this and reboot of the NRPs, the services started to
gradually recover.

The IRE19 Galleon NTS-6002 Time Sync Server time/date reset to 11th August 2003 was due
the GPS Antenna counter resetting itself. Due to a faulty GPS Antenna, this counter was steadily
increasing to a point when it reset itself which could be to a GPS antenna default date/time.

1.3 Root Cause

The IRE19 Galleon NTS-6002 Time Sync Server time/date reset to 11th August 2003 was due
the GPS Antenna counter resetting itself. Due to a faulty GPS Antenna, this counter was steadily
increasing to a point when it reset itself to the GPS antenna default date/time.

1.4 Summary of the Impact to POL and their Customers and
or Suppliers

,--Live branch traffic was significantly degraded between 18:58 and approx. 04:00, when only one
NRP (IRRELEVANT; was servicing traffic.

Example branch traffic during the impact - about 1 transaction per minute was observed between 19:47
and 22:12.

2 Post Incident Review Notes

OBSV1: Underlying cause of the issue — investigation with the vendor.
See action 1.

OBSV2: The IRE11 Galleon server could face the same GPS Antenna issue anytime and cause further

See action 2, 3 and 4.
OBSV3: Need to establish how the time service is provided to the POL Counters.
See action 5.
OBSV4: Issue with 2012 Windows NTP setting time when difference is greater than 5 mins.
See action 6.

OBSV5: We need to make our time solution more robust. We should also have MSF (Radio) signal
received and GPS in NTPs in IRE11 and IRE19. Relying only on GPS signal could be risky, given it
could face aerial issue or be turned off unilaterally by the GPS solution provider (United States Air
Force).

See action 7.
OBSV6: Need to update Galleon firmware. The update will prevent time reset to default
See action 8.

OBSV7: When investigating the incident on the tech bridge, it was spotted that there are different
configurations on the NRP servers. Some of them had multiple entries of time servers and some of them
only had one entry.

See action 9.

OBSV8: The IRE11 and IRE19 Galleon servers - are they load balancing, or do we have a primary and
secondary?

See action 10.

OBSVS9: It appears that SMC junior staff was covering the nightshift when the issue occurred. POA
OOH DM had an impression of SMC engineers being unsupportive on the tech bridge call, not
responding to requests, there was no Minimum Data Set ready on time and there was no mention of the
Counter Super Event incident for at least 2 hours since the impact started.

See action 11.

OBSV10: Check with SecOps how often SOC 24/7 log into their accounts. Not enough support from
other engineers until James Horsfall joined the investigation.

See action 12.
OBSV11: Review possibility of improving the NTP solution — cloud source etc.
See action 13.

OBSV12: In POL Major Incident Review meeting, a potential impact to audit was discussed and POL
requested Fujitsu to check Audit logs to ensure no transactions have been dated 2003.

GPS Antenna issue in both servers. completed
03.04.2023

Closure/Comments: 28.03.2023: Update from Shaun Wood from Galleon regarding debug,
public time source and possible diagnosis for IRE11 Galleon server:

Not much value in debugging the time server. The debug shows the time information coming from the
antenna, in case of an issue with the antenna, we will get an event and some warning, but we cannot
tell when it will go wrong.

It was confirmed that if the running IRE11 Galleon Time Sync server was not able to get a time source
due to potential GPS Antenna issue, then the client devices should ignore it and the client should then
pull back to their own internal clocks i.e. network devices would then start using their clocks. This
situation creates a risk to live service as stability of the service can be guaranteed only if all the
devices within the service infrastructure refer to the unified time source — therefore the NTP solution is
in place.

As a preventative measure to limit this risk, Galleon vendor suggested the antenna cable should be
removed from IRE11 Galleon server to prevent the GPS reset-to-default time issue.

Galleon engineer's visit to IRE11 and IRE19 has been arranged for Monday, 03.04.2023, 10:00. The
aim of the visit is to replace the faulty antennas, test the existing cabling, connect to the new
antennas, test the MSF aerials.

31.03.2023: CHG0362095 (POL change ref. CHG0053803) raised to cover the Galleon engineer visit
in IRE11 and IRE19 on 03.04.2023 to install replacement antenna and recommission time server.

Time server is currently isolated from the network, and engineer will require site access (including live
comms rack access) to connect new antenna located on outside of the building. Once new antenna
are connected, device time sync will be tested and verified. Pending verification of time sync — time
server will then be re connected to the network and peering with IRE11 to be re-established.

03.04.2023: Following CHG0362095 activities, IRE19 Galleon server is now all fixed, the
Galleon engineer has jointed the new cables and made good all connections including the
connection into the back of the IRE19 Galleon Time Server. We have a good GPS / MSF signal
are IRE19 and this is now offering out a time service and chatting to the IRE11 Galleon Time
Server.

The "peer" setting on the IRE11 Galleon Server has been re-added and this is now chatting to
the IRE19 Galleon Time Server.

5 Need to confirm how the time service is provided to the Matthew Closed

Service 06.04.2023

What responsibilities we have documented? POL to
confirm with DXC and Verizon.

Closure/Comments: 29.03.2023: As part of the tech bridge call that Matthew Hatch was holding with
Post Office and DXC, the question about the time service at the counters was asked, however DXC
were not able to answer.

Ravi (Saini) confirmed to Andrew Hemingway that as a part of the migration to Verizon, we made a
network time source available via our router handoffs.

There is a document called EUC responsibilities - what responsibilities have we documented?
To be reviewed within the POA Service team first.

03.04.2023: An extract from End User Compute Towers Responsibilities and Requirements for
Horizon Anywhere document (REQ/SIR/SRS/2605):

3.8.1 Time Synchronisation

The EUC tower will provide time sync service to the HNG-A counter. The system clock will not “drift”
from real time by an amount agreed between Fujitsu and Post Office. Note that the provision of the
NTP time service was the subject of GAP analysis change request HNG-A CP1563, it will still be the
requirement that EUC will configure the O/S to set the time correctly.

The HNG-X time servers will be part of the same time service as the Verizon (network providers) time
servers. The Verizon routers in Fujitsu data centre will obtain their time from the HNG-X time servers.
The HNG-A counters will indirectly (via EUC and AD) take their time from the Verizon servers. Hence
they will all be part of same time service system allowing correct time synchronisation.

Reviewed the statement on the POA Service Team Weekly Round-up.

06.04.2023: POL provided a statement on this action from Verizon and DXC:
Dxc:

“We don’t use Fujitsu to synchronize the time in Azure.

The time on PDC is synchronized with AZURE Stratum 2 internal NTP provider.
All the servers in the AD synchronize with PDC.”

Verizon:

“For the POL core network, branch network, branch test network and the admin network,
Verizon use Fujitsu's NTP servers located in IRE11 and IRE19. Having said that, I've been
assured our network would not fail with the loss of NTP time sync from these NTP servers.

There have been discussions recently about the strategy for NTP once the FJ data centres
close, as NTP cannot be hosted in the AWS cloud.”

6 INC 12598983 / PC0305349 raised to investigate the issue I Shaun Wood, I Target date:
with 2012 Windows NTP setting time when difference is Mike 31.05.2023
greater than 5 mins. Conneely

Closure/Comments: 28.03.2023: Shaun Wood: This incident has been raised to investigate why the
NTP service on Windows 2012 R2 platforms did a date / time leap from 2023 back to 2003 as this was
the date provided by the IRE19 Galleon Time Server, such a large gap should not normally be acted
upon by a time service as is far exceeds a certain tolerance range.

On the Linux Platforms the NTP daemon didn't change to the 2003 date and the NTPD daemon
stopped, and the time/date remained unchanged on the server.

Mike Conneely: Looking at the Windows NTP config, it doesn't have the following option set which is
present on Linux servers: “tinker panic 300”.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED

The current value used for Linux, 300, should cause NTP to abort if the time server is more than 300
seconds difference from the client. That said, it’s supposed to have a default of 1,000 seconds so, if
Windows supports it, it doesn’t explain why any of the Windows 2012 servers would change the time
back to 2003.

What might explain it is a message seen in the Windows event logs, at the time of the issues on the
27", where the NTP service states ‘using Windows clock directly’. That implies it’s falling back to the
time value in the CMOS clock, virtual in this case, and it’s something that could be checked in case it’s
got, or might have had, a value of 2003.

If falling back to the CMOS clock is potentially an issue, it can be excluded as an option in the NTP
config on Windows.

The revised config would therefore be to include ‘tinker panic 300' and to exclude the hardware clock
as fallback.

Shaun Wood: / have checked the changelog for Meinberg NTP and since our current version these
are 1828 Bug/Sec/Other changes

I have checked on the Windows NTP software provider site :-
https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/sw/ntp.htm#ntp_stable

Their change log shows the following release fate on 2011 for the version we have running on all
Windows Platforms making this 12 year old.

(4.2.6p5) 2011/12/24 Released by Harlan Stenn
The latest version is 4.2.8p15.v3 from 24th February 2021.

PC0305349 to go through the BIF/PTF route for approval to proceed with testing and if successful,
live implementation.

30.03.2023: Michael Conneely: Having checked in source code for the version of NTP we're using on
Windows, it does look like it'll be using the default of 1000 for 'tinker panic' so changing it to 300 will
make little difference.

What seems to have been the issue is the Windows NTP service being restarted, by ntpmon, when it
wasn't at stratum 2.

It looks like it's applied the iburst setting, at startup, to quickly stabilise NTP and that the ‘tinker panic’
value only applies to steady running. The restart was initially introduced on BPL servers at the time
when they were acting as time sources for the counter estate and were losing their stratum level even
when the higher level time sources were working. It's probably unnecessary across all Windows
servers that run the NTP service and could operate like Linux where it's an alert only.

On Linux, where it only alerts when the stratum is incorrect, rather than restarting the NTP daemon,
there were no issues other than correctly reporting, in ntp.log, that the time source difference was too
great.

It's definitely worth updating the Windows NTP to a newer version given that the version deployed is
based on an ntp.org release that's 12 years old. It's likely that any newer version would minimise the
instances of stratum being incorrect as long as the higher level time sources are available.

04.04.2023: PC0305349 reviewed in the BIF/PTF meeting. Proposed for next Sysman Maintenance
Release 44.09. 8" of May is Integration date for the Release.

13.04.2023: PEAK PC0305349 is progressed in test. 31° of May 2023 is the live date for Release

IRE11

Closure/Comments: 29.03.2023: Shaun Wood to monitor this and raise change for the upgrade.

04.04.2023: Shaun Wood: Change request CHG0362793 has been raised to upgrade the firmware on
the IRE11 Galleon Time Server from V12#9 to V12#11 which is the latest version which doesn’t set
the clock back due to a faulty GPS antenna. This is planned for implementation this Thursday 6" April
at 18:00. A further change request will be raised to upgrade the IRE19 Galleon Time Server from
V12#9 to V12#11 on Thursday 13" April at 18:00.

06.04.2023: The IRE11 Galleon NTS-6002 was successfully upgraded to the latest firmware this
evening.

14.04.2023: Completed. The IRE19 Galleon NTS-6002 Timer Server was successfully upgraded
to the latest firmware last night under change request CHG0364035 (POL change:
CHG0053971). This now completes this upgrade as both of the Galleon NTS-6002 Timer
Servers are now on the latest version of firmware.

Shaun Wood additionally checked with Galleon on the Warranty of our two Galleon NTS-6002
devices. We have 3 years of warranty left on them which is good news and will take us to 2026.

Closure/Comments: 29.03.2023: Shaun Wood: all devices within the system should always have
both time servers configured and it came to the light that this is not the case.

Suggestion: Configure DNS naming rather than IP address on the devices.

Andrew Hemingway: Networks to use Cisco Prime to get that info. This action needs to have multiple
owners, depending on the platform.

Need to understand why NRP008 stayed all despite all the event that led to the incident. Need to

Shaun Wood: We currently have two Galleon NTS-6002 Time Servers which provide the time service
to all datacentre platforms including servers, network devices, appliances, blade frames, storage etc.
The Symmetricom Time Servers were decommissioned in 2021 and their DNS entries
(Iprnt001/Iprnt004) were updated to point to the IP addresses of the Galleon Time Servers, this was
done so that the NTP config on all servers didn’t require an update.

All network devices, appliances, blade frames, storage etc should be configured with the following
time server entries and should ideally use the hostname if they are able to resolve DNS, if this is not
possible then the IP address. As part of the PIR for the Time Service issue this was one of the follow-
on actions as during the issue it was noted that the BlueCoat Reverse Proxy systems didn’t all a
common set pf NTP server entries so these do need to be updated to have both of these hostnames /

IPs configured.
This is covered by PIR Action 9 which is with Andy Hemmingway.

« Configure DNS - potential service improvement.

o AH: This is an individual service improvement. Need to be on the CSI item list. This
needs Solution Architect's view.

o Data provided by Shaun could be useful there. General recommendation is to config
items to use the hostname rather than IP Address of the time sync server. It's more
beneficial to have the host name configured - that way the device uses DNS to
resolve the IP address. It is possible that if we decide to move the time server to
different IP address, then DNS would be updated with its new IP address. That would
then mean all the end systems would not need to have any conflict changes done on
them.

o Future service improvement, Refresh 3 will be probably looking into it.

o Piotr to add a new item to the Internal CS! Spreadsheet and track the action there.
Internal CSI item INTCS1008 raised. CLOSED

e Need to understand why NRP008 stayed - SOC ECS to check all NRP config.

o NRP008 was configured to take the time from IRE11 Galleon server, while other live

NRPs were configured to take the time from IRE19 Galleon which failed. Il.e. NRPs.
005, 006 and 007 had the IRE19 Galleon server set as primary.

o ~NRP config work required -!
Galleon server first, and IRE11 Galleon second
pointed to the IRE11 Galleon server first and IRE19 Galleon server second. This is
recommended, most logical way of setting up the live NRPs.

o AH: Is there a time service design? Shaun: Service should work in the way that it
speaks with all time servers within configuration and it should be able to determine
which one provides good time.

o Recommendation for the NRP config change described above to be sent to Network
Design Architects Ravi Sani and Dave Haywood for review. Action on Piotr to type
an email to Ravi and Dave. Email sent — see attached.

19.04.2023: Chaser sent by PN to Ravi and Dave.

« Need to understand what devices were impacted by the issue, but the impact did not
manifest - all system administrators / solutions owners to review NTP settings.

o Need to reach out to non-Cisco devices owners.

o Shaun Wood: All the servers are configured correctly; they don't need to be checked.

servers. complete
29.03.2023

Closure/Comments: 29.03.2023: Shaun Wood: We do not have a primary and secondary. The
two Galleon servers run as a unit, and we have them peered. What they do is they are able to
see their time sources from the GPS or MSF (Radio) and they are also able to see the other
time server in the other data centre. So they communicate between themselves and they are
able to identify any delays in the time, because obviously it takes X amount of milliseconds to
send a packet from one data centre to the other. So the Galleon servers then offer out to all
their clients a time service and a client will call in and it will work out, which is the most
reliable and closest time service.

Closure/Comments: 29.03.2023: SMC shifts:
* Early Shift (09:30 to 17:30 BST) or (8:30 to 16:30 BST Day light saving)
* Late Shift (17:30 to 2:30 BST) or (16:30 to 1:30 BST Day light saving)
* Night Shift (2:30 to 9:30 BST) or (1:30 to 8:30 BST Day light saving)
Need to review how many SMC engineers are on the shift? When is the shift handover?

31.03.2023: Incident Management team produced a list of observations for the SMC Improvement
Plan and sent to Jerry Acton (SMC SDM) for review with SMC Management. The list contains
observations from this incident:

o Observation from the “Galleon” incident: It appears that SMC junior staff was covering
the nightshift when the issue occurred. POA OOH DM had an impression of SMC.
engineers being unsupportive on the tech bridge call, not responding to requests,
there was no Minimum Data Set ready on time and there was no mention of the
Counter Super Event incident for at least 2 hours since the impact started.

© Initial SMC shift appeared to be in experienced and lacked the knowledge to deal with
the issue.

o SMC having issues with raising the MDS to log an incident with POL

o Not responding to asks on the technical bridge. Quiet and non-responsive.

o Unsure if the SMC escalated to Ramana or not.

o Better traction from the SMC once additional staff joined the technical bridge.
o Asked for impact details but could not be provided

o The SMC could have compiled a spreadsheet of all the incidents raised so they could
be assessed on the technical bridge.

12.04.2023: Response from SecOps:
Who in the SOC 24/7 team has an MSAD account?

e Various team members within ATC have access via MSAD and are managed using the AD
templates to ensure minimal access.

« The 24/7 team have 2 login’s one for MSAD and one for the NSM box which is managed by
the ATC infrastructure team this team only manage the IDS box at this time. Are we sure this
is the team from the Major Incident?

Are there records or a way to determine how often people log into their accounts? If so, can
this information be shared with the Service team?

e All MSAD accounts are reviewed by the SecOps team weekly and any accounts over 90 days
are disabled.

e The 24/7 team has high focus with there MSAD accounts and we do regularly review with the
team leads for this team as well as 2" line to ensure logins are regular to cover shifts and on
call, if this is the right team we would need to understand who had the issues to identify with
the leads as to why this failed.

How long do the logins last before they require a reset or become inactive due to no usage?

e  Itis unclear the exact time but believed to be between 30 and 45 days although ikeys are
more frequent

Is there something in writing instructing holders of the accounts to log in on a regular basis to
ensure that the accounts are kept active?

e There are frequent reminders to login to ikey (means you have to access MSAD as well) sent
out at the start of every month by POA User Management to all MSAD account holders this is
sent at the same time as the team verification.

19.04.2023: PN emailed James and Andrew Hemingway to confirm if the actions can be closed.

18.04.2023: Following further conversations, Gerald Barnes requested SecOps to perfom the
following:

Please try and do the following to check to see whether there are any transactions with the
wrong date.

Run a query for audit point BRDB and sub point AUD and also (at the same time)
audit point AUDIT and sub point HxLog1 for the date 27” March 2023 to 28 March 2023.

Delete the files with sql in displayed.
Retrieve all the files. This may take a while.
Now do a free text abstract search for <Date>2003

See what the size of the QUERY_AT/FINAL/Filteredhx.xml file is on the audit server. If
it is bigger then 0 try and get it back to the audit workstation for further analysis. It might be
very big.
