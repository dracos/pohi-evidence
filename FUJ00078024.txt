1. INTRODUCTION

This paper provides the response to a specific risk identified by BA/POCL from the
Pathway Proposal concerning the development of the EPOS package.

2. STATEMENT OF THE RISK

“The EPOS package appears to need significant development to meet the POCL
requirements. The timescale of Q1, 1996 may not be achievable.”

3. PATHWAY RESPONSE

3.1 Functional Specification

Pathway has produced and developed the Functional Specification for EPOS and
OSS in direct and specific response to the requirements from the SSR, the schedules
and the POCL Applications stream meetings.

3.2. Implementation Plan

Pathway has established an associated Implementation Plan which analyses the
forms and modules to be implemented together with estimates of the development
work involved.

Pathway has committed resources to the implementation of EPOS and OSS.

This implementation plan will:

1. Define the API and business application components to be developed

1. Estimate the size and complexity of each component
1. Estimate the time and resource required to implement each component

3.3. Elements of the EPOS/OSS implementation

The EPOS/OSS functionality will be provided using the layered software architecture
shown. The TMS API is that provided by Riposte.

3.3.1. POCL Counter Applications

This set of application modules includes the actual business functionality of the
EPOS/OSS functional specification, comprising the Counter and Office functions and
Transactions . It is expected that the business applications will be developed using
Visual Basic.

3.3.2 EPOS/OSS

This will comprise an “umbrella” set of function modules which will fit logically
between business applications and Riposte. This will:

¢ Provide a logical separation between Riposte and the POCL Counter Applications
e Provide the set of EPOS/OSS objects

e Provide a set of Business Application Support Objects and Functions

e Provide the Serve Customer functionality

The EPOS/OSS layer functions will be produced in C/ C++.

3.4 Summary of EPOS/OSS Development Resource (Man days)

Counter and Office Functions 206
Transactions 46
Serve Customer Application 50
Business Application Support Objects 232
General EPOS/OSS Objects 134
Total 668

4 PLANS TO ADDRESS THE RISK
Pathway will:

e produce implementation specifications for EPOS and OSS
¢ maintain specifications under review with POCL from time to time as required
e implement EPOS and OSS after confirmation of specification by POCL

Given Pathway’s understanding of the earliest probable procurement timetable,
delivery in Q2 1996 will provide for the operational and live trials.

5. SUMMARY

Pathway has a well defined specification for EPOS and OSS and will implement it in
time for the operational and live trials.
