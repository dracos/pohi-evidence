Even with an 11.00 start with 2 hours for each demonstration I suggest we should be able to cover this in one

day. (11-00 until 1.00) and (2-00 until 4.00). Thursday 28 Looks like the best date as both SME’s are
available.

Hope that is OK.

Pete,

Coyne is available on 27, 28 or 29 June. Please would you let me know which works best for the people that will be
facilitating the inspection.

Robert and Chris will struggle to arrive before 11:00am. Factoring that in, do you still think that a day would be
sufficient for both inspections? Or could they be split with two 11:00am starts?

Kind regards

Jonny
