The note is with Christa for review but unfortunately she is a bit tied up with meetings this afternoon. She said she we
will either be able to get it over to you later this evening or otherwise first thing tomorrow morning. I hope that is ok.

Kind regards
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan

Would you please be able to let me know when we can expect to receive a note of the options. We have a meeting
with the CEO on Wednesday at 4pm and need to put together a plan in advance of that based on the options.

Best wishes

Belinda

Thanks. I attach the note setting out our thoughts on what a report into Horizon would entail.

We will aim to get you an outline of our thinking to date on the options work as early as possible on Monday.
Kind regards

Jonathan,
Post our conference call I think the plan remains as we discussed on the phone.

e® On the assurance work you are sending your note through today.

® On the options work we will look to get a couple of hours in the diary to discuss options — probably on
Tuesday. To support that work it would be good if you can set out where your thinking has got to on the
potential options and their viability. It would be good to have that paper as early as possible in Monday.

e — I will ask Chris’ office to set up the meeting.

Thanks

David
