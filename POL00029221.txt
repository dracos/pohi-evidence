2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

2.1 KEY POINTS — NOVEMBER 2000

e During November the number of incidents received by MSU increased to 109, in comparison to October where 91
received and resolved by MSU. A total 98incidents were cleared and 13 will be carried forward into December.

e The most frequently occurring incidents in November were both types of Receipts and Payments Incidents (Migration
and Post Migration), with 31 incidents per category. The Migration incidents have remained at the same level,
whereby the Post Migration occurrences have increased. This was followed by 17 Transactions Polled by TIP but not
by HAPS, these were due to delayed transactions as reported on APSS 2133c. These transactions are added back
into normal processing.

e Report 3.3 indicates that the ratio of incidents to outlets in November has remained the same at 0.01, compared to
October, although the number of incidents received and handled by MSU increased. Report 3.5 shows Non Polled
Outlets, whereby it can be noted on the 27" November there was a peak of one thousand plus offices due to counters
remaining at POLO logon until PM’s logged back on the Monday. This reduction in numbers, due to logging back
onto the system, is noted on the report on Tuesday 28" November.

«The incident analysis for November indicates that the reconciliation SLA is 100%, whereby incidents were
successfully cleared achieving the 5 day SLA.
