Thanks - I was coming at it from the angle of not paying out any more money than we needed to? P

Tony was comfortable with) where the letter only deals with the work that they are doing for the wc.
That said, the confidentiality provision in the letter does by its nature provide some protection in that
it prevents them from divulging information about the post office to 3rd parties, including MPs, without
our express consent - the idea here was that we could give them consent (say in the form of a side
letter) to issue some form of “end of term" report should we want (and should the WG agree). This works
to our advantage in that our position would clearly be that all the information that we have given them
is caught by this provision (and by the earlier NDAs that Susan had them sign) and accordingly they
cannot divulge any information, including their so-called "job 1" report, without our approval.
Unhappily, that doesn't prevent them from preparing such a report and then getting MPs to put pressure on
us to have it released .

Yes, thanks.
Does the letter restrict them in the context of Ron trying to open up his brief again last night?

>> Hi Paula - I don't have the paper in front of me, but what it says is that we now have agreed all the
clauses in the engagement letter, with the exception of the post termination restrictions, which SS want
limited to 12 months. If the board agrees that it is comfortable with a 12 month period, we could go
ahead and sign the engagement letter and then, should we wish at a later date to terminate it, either 1)
give them notice as per the engagement letter (which I am pretty sure is 30 days), or 2) just instruct
them via the working group to down tools (the contract is on a time and materials basis). The
alternative, as Richard rightly points out, is not to sign any form of engagement letter, and simply

tell them we no longer want them to continue to work for us, and stop paying their invoices: the drawback
with this second approach is that we then have no post termination restrictions.

that the Sparrow one says we now have an engagement letter with ss.
