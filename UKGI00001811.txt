Attachment: HORIZON LINES FOR DPMQS.doc

Revised lines for DPMQs are attached, taking into account Jo will now be making a statement. We would then envisage
using something like this for PMQs, but updated for the outcome of Jo's statement.

Sue - this is as up to date a briefing we can give you for the PM for PMQs before 1pm. We'd then amend this afternoon
to update.
