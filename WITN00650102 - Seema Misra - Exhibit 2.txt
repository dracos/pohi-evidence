IMAGINE a scene in which Paula Vennells has her knee pressed on Seema Misra’s neck so she cannot
breathe.

This is effectively what Vennels, chief executive of the Post Office. and her senior staff did when pursuina

It now tums out she was completely innocent. There was a glitch in the Post Office's Horizon computer
system which was responsible for the shortfall.

The only way justice can be done in one of the worst miscarriages of justice Britain has seen in decades
is for Vennels and her senior executives to be prosecuted and given exemplary prison terms. Ten years
would not be too much.

Seema, who collapsed in court when her sentence was announced, said: “I would definitely have killed
myself if | hadn't been pregnant.”

It must be a bad joke that Vennels describes herself as “an Anglican minister”. She stepped down £5
million richer in February 2019 after seven years in the job.

The buck should stop with her. She should be stripped of her ill-gotten gains as well as the CBE she was
given for “services to the Post Office and to charity”.

The court of appeal last week quashed the convictions of 39 former sub-postmasters. Seema was one of
them. The others included Khayyam Ishaq, Rubina Shaheen, Kashmir Gill, Vijay Parekh, Tahir Mahmood
and Harjinder Butoy.

Seema was suspended in 2008 after an “audit” found the accounting discrepancy. Over two years she
had attempted to balance her books, borrowing money and transferring takings, but failed to keep her
head above water.

During the trial, the Post Office deliberately withheld information that would have helped her. A fair judge
might give Vennells an extra five years for that.

“They played with people's lives,” said Seema. “Those at the Post Office who knew what was going on
should go to prison.”

During her trial, she refused to plead guilty, believing justice would prevail. Seema now thinks racism was
partly to blame for her conviction at the hands of an all-white jury.

“The court documents read ‘The Queen vs Seema Misra.’ It played with people's emotions. Why would
people believe the Asian lady over the Queen?” she pointed out.

Seema was given a conditional release after four months, but had to wear an electronic tag. “People
stopped talking to us,” she recalled.

Her taxi driver husband, ‘evealed: “| was beaten up and called a ‘f***ing P*ki’, coming to this
country and stealing old people's money.”

Seema, who was dubbed the “pregnant thief” ant
home. They now live in nearby

now 45 and 49 respectively, were forced to

“No amount of money can make up for the struggle | went through,” she said.

What we need are the internal Post Office documents that would identify the culprits behind Seema's
prosecution.

The Conservative peer, James Arbuthnot, described the Post Office's actions under Vennells’ stewardship
as “cruel and incompetent”.

Another sub-postmaster, Harjinder Butoy, who was also wrongly convicted of theft and jailed for three
years and four months in 2008, called the Post Office “a disgrace”.

He said those responsible for the scandal “need to be punished, seriously punished”, addina: “They're iust

Neil Hudgell, the lawyer who represented 29 of the former sub-postmasters, said the Post Office “has
been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely
expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of
reputation and profit. They readily accepted that the loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary
people was a price worth paying in that pursuit.”

The Horizon software system was developed by Fujitsu Limited, a Japanese multinational information
and communications technology equipment and services company.

How the Post office did not realise that the computer system was at fault when pursuing so many sub-
postmasters is hard to explain.

The Metropolitan Police are conducting an investigation into Fujitsu workers after Justice Fraser wrote to
the director of public prosecutions expressing “grave concern” about the evidence provided in earlier
court hearings.

The Communication Workers Union and MPs have backed lawyers in the call for Post Office officials who
“maliciously ruined the lives of innocent people by prosecuting them in pursuit of profits” to be
investigated.

Vennells should be among those to face questions from police, it said.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said last week: “| welcome the court of appeal’s decision to overturn
the convictions of 39 former sub-postmasters in the Horizon dispute, an appalling injustice which has
had a devastating impact on these families for years. Lessons should and will be learnt to ensure this
never happens again.”

That's not enough. Vennels and her team must be prosecuted. Just as white police officer Derek Chauvin
was tried and found guilty of killing African American George Floyd in Minneapolis.
