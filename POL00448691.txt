Nick ,

Do you and the GE have anything to add to the note from Ben ?

In view of all the issues with regard to our treatment of Postmasters at the Inquiry I am not sure we are well
placed to take this further .

The Established Loss was only £16,977 and this arose ( according to Martin ) over many years . I understand EJ
has settled this . The amount does not seem material or anywhere close in terms of the throughput in EJ's
branches .

The note says EJ " cooperated".

Any severe censure ( such as asking for his resignation ) may be regarded as PO breaching its contractual duty
to act " reasonably " .

There seems to be a PO complaint that EJ did not always highlight " Conlicts " in that he was a Postmaster . He
might reasonably argue that it was well known that he was a Postmaster !

When I spoke to Martin I formed the impression that the matter was closed as far as he was concerned . Clearly
not ?

Is it your and the GE's view that this should be taken further ? I worry what the Inquiry would make of that .
Henry

Dear Henry, Ben, Amanda, Lorna and Nick

As you are aware an investigation was raised following concerns over shortfalls in Elliott Jacobs branches. The reports
and the legal analysis of these reports have taken some time to finalise.

A legal risk note which I received on the 19‘ of September is attached. External lawyers have reviewed the information
provided in the Project Venus interim investigation reports dated 20 November 2022 and 30 June 2023, together with the
Central Operations Director Report dated 28 July 2023 (the COD Report), (collectively the Venus Reports).

In summary:

Next steps

Happy to arrange a meeting to discuss once everyone has had an opportunity to review the materials and to formalise
decisions and recommendations.

In the meantime, I hope you have a lovely weekend.

Kind regards

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside normal working hours, I do not expect a response during that time.
