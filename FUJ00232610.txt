1 ‘Introduction

This document describes the process that will be used by Fujitsu to conduct the HNG-X Counter

Performance assessment as described in Schedule B6.1. This activity (also known as Transaction Time
Benchmarking) is concerned with a comparison of applicable sets of Horizon and HNG-X representative
transaction types and comprises the formal basis for the acceptance of the HNG-X counter performance.

This document describes the key stages of this assessment process, the analysis method that is to be
used, the sources and usage of the underlying transaction component time data and the basis for any
adjustments to these component timings.

A key change from the previous Horizon Transaction Benchmarking process is the introduction of
system generated transaction component times to replace Video Benchmarking (Subject to!
Gonfitmation)'. Validating that this approach provides accurate and comparable timings is a necessary
stage in ensuring both POL and FS can have confidence in this approach going forward, and this aspect
is covered in this document.

As noted above, the overall objective of this process is to satisfy the contractual obligations and
acceptance criteria contained in Appendix A & B. Separate from these specific activities is the ongoing
Transaction Time Benchmarking Service which is described in SVM/SDM/SD/0016 - Management
Information Service — Service Description. This service will utilise some of the deliverables from the
counter performance assessment and this aspect is also described in this document.

This document and the associated assessment activities are intended to be completed and assessed as
part of Acceptance Gateway 3 (Readiness for Pilot), and so will act as one of the entry criteria into Pilot.

1.1 Scope
This document is organised as follows:-

Section 1 — Introduction - provides an overview of the scope of the process and the contractual
background.

Section 2 — Counter Performance Assessment Process — describes the tasks within the two main
streams of activity, namely

e The validation of the system derived transaction component times
e The analysis, calculation and comparison of the HNG-X Counter Performance

Section 3 —- Representative Basket Mix — describes the approach to establishing the representative
workload profile

Section 4 — Assessing the HNG-X Counter Performance — describes the analysis and calculations that
underpin the comparison calculations.

It should be noted that the calculations and performance comparisons that underpin this process are
based on averaged representative transaction types, and that various adjustments will be applied to take
account of agreed differences between Horizon and HNG-X transactions, typically revised user
interactions or UI functionality. Accordingly no direct inference can be drawn from these averaged
figures to the typical transaction times that will be experienced by Branches.

Other performance assessment activities, such as the outcomes of the testing carried out via
TST/SOT/HTP/0008 HNG-X Counter Performance High Level Test Plan, may provide information in this
area.

* The introduction of system generated transaction component times is subject to the successful completion of the Steam 1 activities
described in section 3.

2 Counter Performance Assessment Process

The counter performance assessment process comprises two main streams of activities: -
e Stream 1 - Verify the system generated transaction component times

e Stream 2 - Create and compare the transaction times of the Horizon & HNG-X
representative basket mix.

The objective of Stream 1 is to establish that the system generated transaction component times are
accurate. This will be achieved by using a proven measurement technique — Winrunner — to obtain
timing data for defined transaction sequences and then validating these values against the equivalent
system generated component time data.

The objective of Stream 2 is to establish the representative basket mix and the associated transaction
types, obtain the component time data, and generate the comparison data.

The main stages of each of the two processes are shown below: -

3 ‘Stream 1’ activities

The POL Requirements SVC-808 and SVC-809 state that Video Benchmarking should be applied to both
Horizon and HNG-X transactions (for the purposes of comparison) and that subsequently transaction
component times should be derived directly from the counter application. SVC-810 states that this
transition requires that the results must be calibrated (to verify that the system derived times are
comparable to previously acquired values).

Fujitsu have assumed that the requirement to employ video benchmarking for HNG-X was intended
solely to acquire transaction time data using an existing and established technique.

Fujitsu believe that a more flexible approach can be employed using Winrunner, a standard transaction
scripting tool used by Joint Test Team, rather than Video Benchmarking. This will enable the accurate
execution of multiple scripts to be run and modified as necessary for a range of transactions. Winrunner
scripts also provide transaction component times.

Accordingly Stream 1 will define a range of HNG-X transactions that will be executed by Winrunner with
timing data being obtained from both Winruner and the counter application. Demonstrating that these
times are comparable will allow system generated timings to be introduced and used in the main counter
performance assessment, and remove the need to conduct any HNG-X Video Benchmarks.

3.1 Define Sample Transactions
Stream 1 will define a sample set of transactions that include a range of measurement points including: -
e Arrange of different user input and output UI constructs
e Transaction steps involving the operation of all counter peripherals
e Initiation, wait and respond to on-line steps
e Report production
e The use of local (e.g. cash) and on-line settlement

The number of transactions is expected to be relatively small (<20) since this activity is only concerned
with verifying that a representative selection of measurement points has been included.

The specific transactions and their measurement points will be described in SVM/SDM/REP/0007 —
Validation of HNG-X System Derived Transaction Component Times.

3.2 Obtain Timing Data

The set of transactions identified above will be run a number of times and the component times from
both sets of measurements averaged.

The types of component time data that will be obtained includes: -
« Counter processing time
e User waiting time
e Peripheral time
¢ ‘On-line’ communication time
as well as the total duration of the transaction.

It will be important to verify that the measurement points for both sets of timings are identical, such that
accurate comparisons can be made. The granularity of all of the measurement points may be different

4 ‘Stream 2’ activities

Stream 2 is concerned with delivering the counter performance assessment described in Schedule B6.1
and in meeting the various POL requirements contained in Annex A. The principal activities of this
stream are to establish the Basket Mix, obtain the HNG-X and Horizon timing data and to establish the
applicable transaction steps, taking account of any adjustments arising as a consequence of introducing
HNG-X.

4.1 Create Representative Basket Mix

In order that the ‘agreed sets of representative transactions’ (Schedule B3.1 / Annex 3) can be
established it is necessary to analyse data from the ‘Benchmark Period’ in order to ascertain the most
frequently occurring transactions. In order that this reflects the actual business throughput of a Branch
the approach to determining this representative workload will be on the basis of Baskets or Customer
Sessions. These represent the actual units of work undertaken by Branches rather then just establishing
a ranking of discrete transactions.

The representative basket mix will be established by taking the transaction data associated with all
customer sessions for all Branches during the Benchmark period. The source of this data is intended to
be the POL-MI data for this period.

This data will be analysed to establish the number of customer baskets containing one or more ‘logical’
transaction types, these being determined from the actual discrete transactions, and in particular the
product ID of the item being transacted.

For example three separate baskets each containing a single bill payment involving a different utility
company will count as three instances of a basket with a single AP In-Pay transaction.

The results of this analysis will be ranked by occurrence such that a workload profile or Basket Mix
analysis is established identifying the most commonly occurring baskets through to the most infrequent.
An analysis of this type conducted on data approx two years ago showed that whilst there were approx
10,000 different basket / transaction combinations, the top 20 entries accounted for approx 80% of all
baskets. It is expected that a similar workload profile will result from this updated analysis and if this is
the case it is proposed that the top 20 transactions are used as the set for which transaction time
analysis is done.

The results of this analysis will be recorded in SVM/SDM/REP/0009 — HNG-X Representative Basket
mix.

4.1.1 Benchmark Period

The Benchmark Period is the period from which the Horizon transaction data will be drawn to establish
the average workload profile. This period should be representative of normal Branch trading, and should
therefore exclude seasonal periods but should include normal cyclical activities such as month end
trading.

It is proposed that the Benchmark Period will be the two weeks straddling the end of March / start of April
— 23/03/09 to 05/04/09.

This period has been verified as representative by Dave Chapman — architect for HNG-X System
Qualities & Capacity Management.

4.1.2 Transaction Types

Each actual transaction will be counted as an instance of the logical transaction type that it relates to.
This essentially ensures that discrete transactions that are realised through the same set of user / system
activities (i.e. realised through the same Use Case) are counted as the same. The set of Transaction
Types will be:-

e Retail — all simple ‘EPOSS' style transactions

e AP In-Pay — all basic ‘AP’ style transactions

e Bureau — all sell and buy Bureau de change transactions
e Banking — all Banking deposit and withdrawal transactions
« ETU -—all types of E-Top up transactions

« Back Office / Admin transactions — see section 4.1.2.1

e Other — all other transactions (excluding those in section 4.1.2.2). Additional Transaction Types
will be introduced as necessary if the volume of transactions / baskets cause them to appear in
the ‘top 20’.

In addition a settlement transaction will be associated with each basket. This will either be a Debit Card
transaction or a local settlement item (i.e. Cash / Cheque etc.).

4.1.1.1 Back Office / Admin transactions

Where possible the Transaction Type analysis will also aim to identify Back Office / Admin transactions
although these may not always be derivable from the overall transaction data.

The volume of such transactions will be much smaller than the customer facing transactions that form
the vast majority of the Basket Mix analysis, and so their overall effect on an average basket is expected
to be quite limited. In addition although the actual transaction content will be different, most Back Office
/ Admin transactions will involve many common transaction components (data input response, peripheral
operation, screen updates etc) that will have been included in the main customer facing analysis.

The results and contribution of any Back Office / Admin transactions will be included in
SVM/SDM/REP/0008 — HNG-X Counter Performance Assessment Results.

4.1.1.2 Candidates for Exclusion

Horizon Mails transactions may be excluded from this analysis as they are wholly replaced by HNG-X
Postal Services which has different user process and system interactions. Only those transaction steps
that are comparable in terms of user interactions will be included in the comparative timing analysis.
See also section 5.

4.2 Create HNG-X Timings

Specific transactions will be identified that represent each of the logical transaction types in the basket
mix analysis. If the most frequently occurring basket is a Banking Cash Withdrawal, then a specific
instance of this transaction will be scripted (using the most frequently occurring product from the product
frequency analysis) and used as the basis for gathering transaction component time data.

Each transaction (representing a transaction type) will be decomposed down into its constituent
component parts these representing the measurement points for which timing data will be obtained.

These measurement points will separate out user activity (i.e. awaiting user input, entering data), local
counter / peripheral processing, and external / on-line activities.

Transaction scripts will be created for each transaction and recorded in SVM/SDM/SSD/0003 — HNG-X
Representative Transaction Scripts. They will be executed on a suitable test environment.

The applicable component times (see section 4.2.2) taken from the system generated timing data will be
summed for each transaction type within each basket to give an overall duration for each basket entry in
the ‘top 20’.

4.2.1 Product Frequency

The data used to create the basket mix analysis will also be used to ascertain the volume and frequency
of specific products being transacted. This ranking will be used to select the specific product to be used
when identifying a specific transaction to represent a transaction type.

4.2.2 Adjustments

Certain adjustments will be made to the transaction component analysis to allow for those items that are
not applicable to the counter performance assessment calculations. These are:-

e Steps involving User actions — i.e. screen observation, user input or action. For scripted
transactions this will only affect the data input steps since there is negligible ‘wait’ time between
script steps.

e Steps that have changed as a result of any changed processes or UI interactions that have been
introduced in HNG-X. Examples include the introduction of any new message dialogues that
require user confirmation, any changes to the sequence of user actions where a comparable
Horizon sequence does not exist, any changes arising from UI Constructs that require additional
user actions to perform or complete data input.

e Steps that are waiting for an external response. This assessment is concerned with the
performance of the HNG-X counter and so external dialogues will be excluded. In live operation
FS and POL will be monitoring the key online interactions since they are subject to Service
Level Targets and their assessment will take place once a representative workload is in place.
This will not be the case at the point at which this counter performance assessment takes place,
just prior to Pilot.

4.2.1.1 Menu Hierarchy

The Menu Hierarchy for HNG-X has been redesigned and as such there can be no comparison with the
menu navigation undertaken on Horizon. Accordingly for any transactions that are selected from menu
buttons, all user selections and timings associated with menu navigation will (where possible) be
reported but excluded from the comparative timing analysis, since the measurement point for all such
transactions will commence with the final button selection that initiates the transaction.

4.3 Create Horizon timings

Horizon component timings will be applied to each of the transactions that make up the set of
transactions for each entry in the basket mix analysis, taking account of any adjustments. These
component times will be taken from the data gathered as part of the Horizon Video Benchmark analysis
of $92.

It is expected that the range of transactions for this assessment will have increased from the set used for
previous Horizon transaction time benchmarking, and so it may be necessary to extrapolate from
existing timing data to establish values for previously unmeasured transaction steps.

The number of these will be reviewed to ascertain whether any other method of obtaining any missing
Horizon component time data is practical and necessary.

4.4 Assessment Results

With the Horizon and HNG-X component time data applied to each of the transaction types for each of
the entries in the ‘top 20’ basket mix analysis, an overall transaction time for Horizon and HNG-X will be
obtained.

Comparing each basket line entry will give a view as the relative performance of HNG-X. The overall
comparison is based on the timing for an average customer basket, and so the set of all entries in the
basket mix analysis is adjusted by the volume of occurrences.

The average Horizon basket time is as follows: -

Basket entry 20

> (Horizon basket time) * (Volume of baskets per entry)

Basket entry 1

(Total volume of baskets for top 20 entries)

The same calculation is done for the HNG-X entries and the HNG-X counter performance assessment is
met if the average basket time for HNG-X is less than or equal to the average basket time for Horizon.

The results of this analysis will be recorded in SVM/SDM/REP/0008 — HNG-X Counter Performance
Assessment Results.

5 Future Transaction Time benchmarking

As well as meeting the formal counter performance assessment obligation, this process establishes the
foundations on which the on-going Transaction Time benchmarking Service will be based. This service
will support the introduction of future HNG-X releases and will enable the effect of change, either at
transaction or workload profile to be assessed.

The Basket Mix analysis and the HNG-X timings will act as the starting point from which future HNG-X
Release assessments are made. In order that an accurate Release 1 position is established it will be
necessary to substitute the Horizon Mail transactions with the associated Postal Services transactions in
the relevant Basket entries. The HNG-X timings can then be added to complete the starting position for
HNG-X Released 1.

For future releases it is expected that, subject to agreement, the same approach will be used to assess
the impact of changes on the previous baselined position. This revised approach to Transaction Time
benchmarking is expected to deliver the following benefits: -

e Speedier execution of the benchmark transaction set

e Speedier analysis

« More timely availability of results to facilitate feedback prior to deployment to the live estate
e Larger sample size to improve statistical confidence

e Reduced scope for human error

e More flexibility in the benchmark transaction set in response to changing customer needs

The operation of the Transaction Time Benchmarking Service is described in SVM/SDM/SD/0016 -
Management Information Service: Service Description - Annex A.

Extract from Schedule B6.1

The following text is reproduced from Schedule B6.1, Annex 3 version 2.0

The Business Equivalence Principles do not apply to the System Capacity and Performance
Requirements or associated Service Levels, but it is accepted that the performance
characteristics of the HNG-X System counter applications and associated infrastructure must be
acceptable to the Post Office. This specific aspect of the Solution Baseline will be assessed to
determine that the HNG-X System counter performance delivers equivalent or better
performance characteristics to the Applicable Horizon Baseline, based on the following
principles:

4.1 Post Office and Fujitsu Services will jointly agree an assessment process that will:

« define and agree sets of representative Transaction types and a measurement period;

e establish system component benchmark measurements for these Transaction types on
the Horizon system and on the HNG-X System (taking account of any changed
processes or UI characteristics that may be present in the HNG-X Transaction); and

« allow Post Office to request that the set of Transaction types is augmented (agreement
to such requests not to be unreasonably withheld by Fujitsu Services) if anomalous HNG-
X Transaction performance characteristics are identified prior to the commencement of
the HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout).

4.2 Acceptance by Post Office of the HNG-X System counter performance will be based on the

average system component benchmark measurements for each of the agreed sets of
representative Transaction types for the HNG-X System being no worse than the comparable
measurements for each of the Transaction types within the Applicable Horizon Baseline or where
comparison is not applicable, to their agreed design targets.
