Dear Mike,
Re: Our client Mrs Susan Rudkin
Further to our conversation today, I can confirm that Mrs Rudkin is going to decline your offer

to attend Loughborough Police Station on a voluntary basis. Please find enclosed a copy of a
letter from her doctor confirming that she is not fit to be interviewed.

Yours sincerely
