Stephen,

Thanks — in that case, could you please let me have a copy of the PoC and the Reply as served in
electronic format to save re-typing?

On the question of transfer, I think we were going to write a letter inviting comments from
Castleton’s solicitors — can I leave that to you?

Thanks,

Richard

Dear Richard,

Mandy Talbot of the P.O has given sanction to amend the Particulars and to suggest transfer to
CLCC.

On the £176 lottery point, the loss apparently occurred on 23 March (the date he was
suspended) not 24 March (the date on the error notice). The error notice says 24 March
because that is the trading week end. Basically the P.O took £176 on lottery on 23 March which
it didn't put through Horizon. I've asked for documentary evidence on the date point and will
revert to you once received.

I'm conscious that you've also asked for the original contract which you'll need for the
drafting and have chased that up.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
