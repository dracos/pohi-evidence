Please see attached. Statements from me, Andrew Wise (2" officer at first interview), Kevin Ryan (2"@
Officer at 24 Interview) and Kath Smith (Auditor who assisted).

Also note I have been informed that Dennis Watson (Lead Auditor) has retired from the business and I
have spoken to Kath today, she says the statement is fine but is currently on long term sick.

If you wish to discuss give us a ring.
