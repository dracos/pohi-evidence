Dear Helen

I now attach the finalised statement for your signature please. I have converted the statement to a pdf so that the
formatting does not change when I email it to you.

Signing a statement of truth

The purpose of the witness statement is to provide written evidence to support Post Office's case that will be used as
evidence in court. The statement is a crucial part of the case, designed to show it in its strongest light.

You may be asked to attend court to explain the issues covered in the witness statement to the Judge, and be asked
questions on the evidence by the other side.

Awitness statement must have a "statement of truth". This is a statement confirming that the person making it
believes that the facts stated in the document are true. The penalties for signing a statement of truth without an honest
belief in the truth of the facts being verified are potentially severe. A person who makes a false statement in litigation
in an attempt to interfere with the course of justice will be in contempt of court, which is punishable by a prison
sentence of up to two years.

Please could you:
carefully review your witness statement;
if you are satisfied with the content of the same, please sign the statement of truth;

email me a PDF of the signed witness statement; and

send the original signed witness statement to Victoria Brooks at Womble Bond Dickinson, Temple Quay, 3 Temple
Back East, Bristol BS1 6DZ.

Thank you very much for your hard work in getting this over the line.
