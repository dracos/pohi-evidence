Hi Peter,

Thanks for this. Grateful if we could have a word about handling (1 have also left you a message).
Having had a good opportunity to look at the letter I think that it contains some very significant points which have to be
addressed by both Post office and the Chair of the Working Group.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Belinda

Many thanks for your time yesterday. Please see attached two draft letters, one that we are proposing to
send to Alan Bates, and one to Sir Anthony Hooper (on the assumption that the JFSA is unable to provide a
reason for us not to forward the letter).

We've included the final paragraph on the letter to Sir Anthony as a means of giving Jenny a future hook into
the process (for example in the event that she feels she needs to intervene). I would be grateful for your
views on the benefits of including this hook, versus the risks of perceived infringement on Sir Anthony's
independence.

Jenny's box closes at midday tomorrow, and any comments by then would be much appreciated.

Best wishes

Peter

Please find attached, as discussed, a copy of the published documentation for the Scheme. There is a
flowchart but there is little about actual timescales although it says that SS will take between 1 and 3
months to investigate a case. However, as discussed, the Scheme allows for the Working Group to vary
the process as necessary for the proper administration of the Scheme. It has done that. Specifically the
Post Office investigates the case in the first instance and then passes its investigation to Second Sight to
review.

Let me know if you need anything further.
