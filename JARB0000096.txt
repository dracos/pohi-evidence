Briefing note to add to CCRC application for my constituent, Jo Hamilton

I have been pondering whether or not to send the enclosed to you. It is a briefing note
drafted by Ian Henderson, one of the independent investigators from Second Sight, to the
Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee in advance of his giving evidence to that
Committee at their inquiry session in January of this year.

I have come to the conclusion that as Jo Hamilton’s Member of Parliament it is my duty to
pass on all information that is relevant to her application and this note most certainly is. The
redacted files it discusses are directly related to her case.

I deem this note to be of the utmost importance, particularly so given Mr Henderson’s clear
discussion of the matter of access to legal files.

I would be grateful if you would treat the note as confidential.
