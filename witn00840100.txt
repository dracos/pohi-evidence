                    In the making of this statement, I have sought to refresh my memory from the

                    contemporaneous documents provided insofar as is possible. I make this

                    witness statement to the best of my recollection, knowledge and belief. I have

                    been assisted in preparing this witness statement by my legal representatives,

                    Reed Smith LLP_


            BACKGROUND


                5. I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Computing from Newcastle Polytechnic

                    and an MBA from Newcastle University. I started my career at Newcastle

                    Polytechnic within its Computing department as a trainee Computer Operator. I

                    left in 1985 to join Northern Rock as a trainee programmer. I worked at

                    Northern Rock until 2010. During my 25 years at Northern Rock, I held

                    numerous IT roles and led many major IT programmes. When I left Northern

                    Rock I held the position of Managing Director of IT.


                6. I joined POL as Head of IT & Change in April 2010. I held this role until

                    approximately Q1/Q2 2012, reporting to Mike Young, Chief Operating Officer

                    ("COO"). In around Q1/02 2012, at short notice, Mike Young left POL. I was

                    asked to step in as Interim Chief Operating Officer while a restructure was

                    considered. I held this role until around Q3/Q4 2012, reporting to the CEO

                    Paula Vennells. From this time, I joined the Executive Committee (the "ExCo")

                    By the end of Q4 2012 I was the CIO, reporting to the Strategy Director, Sue

                    Barton. I reported to her until she left POL at the end of 2013. I then reported

                    to the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Chris Day, until the end of 2014. In

                    around early 2015, following a restructure, I became Operations Director in

                    addition to CIO. I was not part of the Group Executive that was created in late

                    2014. I reported to the new CFO, Alasdair Cameron, until I left POL at the end

                    of November 2015 (1 resigned in early June 2015 and was on gardening leave

                    from 1 October 2015).


                7_ On joining POL, my understanding was that I had been brought in to oversee

                    the Separation from RMG and the resulting IT transformation and to build the

                    IT capability post-Separation. To provide some context about

                    Separation/POL's IT transformation, from an IT perspective, the scale of the

                    process was enormous. It was probably one of the largest IT transformations

                    in the UK at the time. The professional challenge of overseeing an IT

                    transformation is what appealed to me. Prior to Separation, the majority of IT

                    services used by POL sat within RMG and POL was able to piggy-back off

                    these. The main IT service that sat within POL was the contract with Fujitsu

                    who, at that time, provided front office and network services to the branches

                    along with a couple of smaller systems. My task was to take the shared IT

                    services from within RMG and build those services from scratch within POL.

                    My objective was, with the support of the executives and the Board, to build a

                    holistic IT strategy for Separation. Horizon and the relationship with Fujitsu

                    was one part of the overall IT strategy. The IT Strategy Update of January

                    2015 in POLOO109859 gives an idea of the scale of the IT strategy, however it

                    broadly included reviewing the IT organisation and its processes and creating

                    an operating model which could support Separation and the transformation

                    activities. There were a number of systems built during Separation which

                    required significant procurement exercises, including the Fujitsu contract. I

                    provide further detail about the IT strategy I put in place at paragraph 67 below

                    and how Fujitsu fit into that.


                8. Initially, during my tenure as Head of IT & Change, the day-to-day operational

                    service management of Horizon and the management of the contractual

                    relationship with Fujitsu was the responsibility of the Managed Services team.

                    Andy McClean led this team and reported into the COO Mike Young. Managed

                    Services at this time was also responsible for the management and oversight

                    of the outsourced business activities and relationships (e.g. Bank of

                    Ireland/HP/Telephony). As Head of IT & Change, in so far as Horizon was

                    concerned, I had responsibility for any IT change activity (i.e_ introduction of

                    the Post & Go machines). If there were any significant incidents (i.e. a P1 or

                    P2 as I refer to below at paragraph 18) the IT team would be involved to

                    support any investigation into the incidents. I raised with Mike Young, that the

                    responsibility for the operational management and contractual relationship

                    management of the Horizon contract was in the wrong part of POL and should

                    have been under IT. As I have set out above, if there was a significant incident

                    involving Horizon, the Managed Services team, supported by the separate IT

                    team, would work together to investigate. The issue with this was that the IT

                    team did not have full oversight of Horizon (the contractual relationship with

                    Fujitsu and day-to-day management). This changed when the Head of

                    Managed Services left in Q3/Q4 2011. From that point on, as Head of IT &

                    Change, I took responsibility for Service Management, which included Horizon

                    (the contractual relationship with Fujitsu and day-to-day management).


                9. As CIO, my priorities included: (i) delivery of the IT strategy and new IT

                    operating model; (ii) delivery of RMG/POL separation technology activities; (iii)

                    acting as Chair of the IT Transformation Committee; (iv) procurement and

                    implementation of all IT services post-separation (including the Fujitsu contract

                    which was put to the market for the re-procurement of services which were

                    covered under that contract); (v) management and oversight of the outsourced

                    business activities and relationships (e.g. Bank of Ireland/HP/Telephony); (vi)

                    stakeholder engagement regarding IT matters; (vii) Account Executive

                    engagement with key suppliers, auditors and advisors; and (viii) operational

                    cost reduction_ As CIO I was the executive accountable for the contractual

                    relationship with Fujitsu in respect of Horizon. This included overall oversight

                    of any change activity and provision of operational service from Fujitsu (I

                    provide details of my team in the following paragraph). From late 2013 into

                    2014, I took on additional responsibilities for Information Security which

                    included (i) reviewing the Information Security operating model, policies and

                    procedures; (ii) commissioning a Deloitte maturity review to inform the

                    operating model; and (iii) recruiting a new Head of Information Security. In

                    2015, while reporting to Alasdair Cameron, and with the additional role of

                    Operations Director, I also took on the additional responsibility for back-office

                    activities for Product and Branch Accounting ("P&BA") and HR. I have

                    considered FUJO0175161 and agree with the description of my "agenda" as

                    CIO_ During my tenure I was not responsible for prosecutions of SPMs. While I

                    was involved in the commission of the Second Sight Report and the Project

                                                             Page 5 of 4l

                    Zebra report, I was not responsible for the action points arising from the

                    recommendations of each of these reports, which were dealt with by the

                    Sparrow Working Group (initially set up to manage the Second Sight Report)

                    which I was not a member of and which reported to the Board.


                10.As CIO I brought in an experienced IT Programme Lead/Transformation

                    Director, Neil Wilkinson, who was responsible for delivering Separation and

                    then more broadly the IT Transformation (procurements and delivery). I also

                    brought in a Chief Technology Officer, Paul Bleasby, who led the architecture

                    team and was the Chief Architect of POL's IT systems. He worked closely with

                    third party suppliers (including Fujitsu) and the wider business on developing

                    the IT strategy and delivering aspects of the IT transformation programme. I

                    would rely on Paul for technical input. David Hulbert was the existing Head of

                    Service, responsible for the day-to-day operations of all the IT services

                    (including Horizon). All directly reported to me, in addition to a Head of

                    Business Relationships, Head of Quality and Standards, Head of Managed

                    Services and Head of Projects.


                11. 1 have been asked to summarise my professional career since leaving POL. In

                    December 2015, I joined a start-up private equity backed specialist mortgage

                    lender as COO. I led the business build programme and was accountable for

                    technology, change, new mortgage business and account servicing. I left in

                    November 2019 and retired from full-time employment. Since the Covid-19

                    pandemic, I have supported `Be the Business' (a small business giving small

                    companies support) and I am a governor of a college.

            THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

                12. I had no knowledge of Horizon before joining POL other than at the interview

                    stage being told about key suppliers, including Fujitsu. On joining POL, I

                    learned more detail about Fujitsu building Horizon and that the contract had

                    been in place since the 1990s. I understood Horizon to be the point-of-sale

                    system at the Post Office counters (SPMs, Crowns and Multiples) which would

                    be used to process and record all transactions performed within a branch. I

                    cannot recall any of the specific details, but during my first few weeks at POL it

                    is likely that I would have been given a walkthrough of Horizon and it is

                    possible that some high-level architectural presentations regarding Horizon

                    were delivered to me. Beyond this, the only formal training on Horizon I recall

                    was for Christmas support for the Post Offices, which was limited training on

                    Horizon and more specifically on the Post & Go machines. I would have had a

                    high-level awareness about how the system was architected, however as

                    Head of IT / CIO I was neither a technical nor a functional expert in Horizon.


                13.1 do not recall reading the May 2009 Computer Weekly article before joining

                    POL. I was not employed by POL at the time of this article and do not recall

                    being involved in any internal discussions about it when I joined. I do recall

                    reading Computer Weekly articles at some point during my tenure but I cannot

                    recall when I did so or specifically which ones.


                14. Around the time I joined POL in April 2010, I recall that the second iteration of

                    Horizon ("HNGx") was in the process of being rolled out. I understood that the

                    changes were primarily as a result of a cost reduction exercise, a refresh of

                    some of the hardware, and application changes to support SPMs. I later

                    understood that there was a level of resilience removed as part of the HNGx

                    roll out. Previously branches could continue to operate if the branch was

                    unable to connect to the datacentre, however HNGx required the branches to

                    be connected to the datacentre to be operational. Coming from a banking

                    background (where branches could continue to transact if they lost connectivity

                    to the datacentre) I had concerns about this from an operational resilience

                    perspective (i.e., customers could not be provided with services if branches

                    lost connectivity). This issue was addressed in papers to the Board (see

                    POL00096035 and UKG100018115 by way of example).


                15.On joining POL I was not aware of either (a) bugs, errors or defects in the

                    Horizon IT system ("BEDs") (b) a lack of integrity in the Horizon IT System or

                    (c) complaints addressing BEDs or concerns with integrity.


                16.1 had no input into the commission of or production of Rod Ismay's report of

                    August 2010. I received a copy of it due to my role as Head of IT shortly after I

                    started at POL. To the best of my recollection, it was around this time that I

                    first understood that there were challenges to the integrity of Horizon. The

                    report suggested that these concerns were not founded. I took the report at

                    face-value, and it was my understanding from reading the report that there was

                    not an issue relating to the integrity of Horizon and that there were significant

                    business controls in place. I have no recollection of whether the report was

                    used in POL's response to complaints made by SPMs concerning the integrity

                    of Horizon. I do not think I would have been aware of this at the time.


                17. 1 recall an issue shortly after I joined POL which led to the roll out of HNGx

                    being halted. This was not a software fault relating to Horizon, rather a

                    database issue which was causing performance issues with Horizon. The roll

                    out was halted until this was fixed. The first software fault relating to Horizon I

                    can recall was "the 62 bug" in 2010 (see POL00134346 which provides an

                    overview of this). I also have a clear recollection of the "Local Suspense

                    Incident" affecting 14 branches in 2013 (see POL00190016). My

                    understanding for these faults was that the affected branches were all

                    contacted and that the faults did not result in a negative financial impact.


                18. There were two broad categories of technical issues relating to Horizon which I

                    would be made aware of (i) complete Horizon network outages, which I

                    referred to as "P1s" and (ii) technical issues affecting a significant number of

                    branches, which I referred to as "P2s". There would have been exact

                    definitions of P1 and P2 faults but I do not recall these. The "62 bug" and

                    "Local Suspense Incident" referred to above were P2s. POL00190037 and

                    POL00029627 confirms that there was no negative financial impact for SPMs

                    and no prosecutions in relation to these two bugs. More generally, I was not

                    aware that any of the errors or defects that my team investigated were linked

                    to prosecutions.


                19. Prior to my taking responsibility for Service Management in Q3/Q4 2011, it was

                    the responsibility of the Managed Services team to inform me of these issues

                    and engage with the IT team. In some cases, these issues would be escalated

                    to the Executive. An Incident Review would then be carried out by Fujitsu, who

                    would provide a written response to POL. Any significant issues would be

                    discussed at the operational and executive supplier reviews with Fujitsu. I

                    understood that operational reviews took place between Fujitsu and Service

                    Management every week. I was not involved in these meetings. It is my

                    understanding that Executive reviews were not taking place prior to me taking

                    responsibility for Service Management. Once I had taken responsibility for

                    Service Management, I attended Executive meetings either monthly or bi-

                    monthly depending on need with my senior team, a Fujitsu account executive,

                    sales executive and service executive. Service Management, David Hulbert or

                    the Duty Manager would communicate P1s and P2s to all key stakeholders

                    across the business, keeping them updated in relation to the issue, impact and

                    reso►ution. I would also assist in communicating P1s and P2s at Executive

                    level, often by text message, telephone call or in-person.


                20. To the best of my recollection a small number of P1s and P2s occurred during

                    my tenure. Following review of the documents I do recall the 4 significant

                    services failures which occurred over a 9-month period in 2011/2012.

                    POLOO105585 provides detailed explanations from the technical team of each

                    incident. As a result of these service failures, two reviews were undertaken —

                    a tactical review and a strategic risk and resilience review (by KPMG), both of

                    which were reported to the POL Board. The tactical review examined each

                    individual incident, reviewed the root cause and established lessons learnt and

                    improvements were implemented. The strategic review which was conducted

                    by KPMG considered the resilience in the infrastructure as compared against

                    other retailers or banking. This was an area of concern for me as I have

                    detailed at paragraph 14 above. The strategic review gave the Board clarity on

                    recovery of the datacentres (post implementation of HNGx) and costs to move

                    to a more resilient platform.

                21.Technical issues relating to individual branches or a smaller number of

                    branches (i.e. not P1s or P2s) were dealt with by the operational IT service

                    team who were the primary interface with Fujitsu. David Hulbert, the Head of

                    this team directly reported to me from Q3/Q4 2011. P&BA and the National

                    Business Support Centre ("NBSC") reporting to Rod Ismay, were the primary

                    contact points for the SPMs. I would only be involved in dealing with this type

                    of branch IT issue if they were directly escalated to me. I would raise any such

                    escalations with David Hulbert for action and with the Fujitsu Executive, if

                    necessary.


                22. 1 have considered an email thread dated 7 October 2014 (POL00210241) in

                    which Kevin Gilliland (Retail Director) escalated a branch Horizon network

                    connectivity issue to me. The documentation shows that I asked Ian Thomas

                    to look into this, copying David Hulbert and Andy Grant. I cannot recall who

                    Ian Thomas or Andy Grant are. I then ask "We do seem to be getting a lot of

                    issues in this area — is there an underlying systemic problem?" By systemic, I

                    meant is this a widespread issue which is affecting many branches. While I do

                    not recall this specific issue today, it appears from the email thread to have

                    been a local branch network issue and not an issue with the Horizon software.


                23.1 do not recall the specific term 'ARQ data'. I assume that this refers to the

                    Horizon audit transactional data stored within the audit database. I did not

                    have a low-level detailed knowledge of what data fields were stored, I do recall

                    it being a secure audit log of all transactions performed at a branch, which was

                    described as being stored in a WORM (write once read many) storage and

                    signed with a digital key. I remember attending a meeting with either Second

                    POL representatives where Fujitsu presented the details of Horizon's

                    architecture and explained how transactions were stored securely and could

                    not be altered given the digital key against each transaction. I refer to this at

                    paragraph 63 below.


            OPERATION OF POL AND HORIZON

                24. 1 was not involved with concerns about disputed shortfalls in branch accounts.

                    As I recall, the primary point of contact for these queries was via P&BA which

                    was managed by Rod Ismay, or escalated through the Retail team managed

                    by Kevin Gilliland. Only during 2015 (when I took on additional operational

                    functions as referred to above at paragraph 6) did P&BA report through to me.

                    Angela Van-Den-Bogerd became Operations Director/Head of Operations in

                    2015 and was responsible for P&BA and HR back office. She reported through

                    to me. However, I understand that separate to the work that I had oversight of,

                    she was heavily engaged with and reporting to Sparrow at this time (Sparrow

                    was a Working Group set up to manage the Second Sight review, which I

                    address further at paragraph 47 below). At this time (nor at any other time),

                    was I involved in the day-to-day activities of the support PB&A provided to the

                    branches. I do not recall any escalations during that period with regards to

                    shortfalls in branch accounts.


                 25. My understanding of how SPMs would raise concerns about the IT system is

                     that concerns were reported to and managed by the call centres, in particular

                     P&BA and a help line in Fujitsu. I had no direct involvement in this process.

                     Day-to-day oversight of the IT help lines was within Service Management and

                     Fujitsu, and also Atos towards the end of my tenure (I refer to Atos at

                     paragraph 67 below. In short, this company was appointed as Service

                     Integrator in respect of POL's new IT tower model post-Separation (from

                     October 2013)). I was only made aware of any issues in the event of a P1 or

                     P2 issue, or an escalation of a branch issue as described above.


                 26. 1 set out here the ways in which reported problems with Horizon could be

                     escalated within POL and/or Fujitsu:


                     (i)     Escalation from the IT help desk through to the Head of Service

                             Management (David Hulbert) and ultimately onto me. This would be

                             escalated at the same corresponding levels within Fujitsu.


                     (ii)    Some issues were escalated through POL executive, typically via the

                             CEO, Retail Director or via P&BA.


                     (iii)   Whilst I cannot recall the specific details, I do recall that SPMs could

                             follow a complaints process.


                     (iv)    My understanding was that within Fujitsu, concerns could be escalated

                             to them by POL (e.g by the Retail Director) via Service Management.

                             The chain of escalation from there was to a senior manager for service

                             and then through to the executive line.


                 27. 1 would not be aware of the volume of complaints about Horizon as this was

                     managed through another business area within POL. I do not recall which.


                 28. 1 understood advice and assistance was provided to SPMs by PB&A. I am

                     unable to provide a view of the adequacy of this advice. I recall that general

                     advice and support was one of the points that came out of the first Second

                     Sight report in July 2013 as needing to be addressed, and I recall this was fed

                     through to the Sparrow project (the Working Group set up to manage the

                     Second Sight review, which I address further at paragraph 47 below).


                 29. 1 do not recall which business area handled training on Horizon. I personally

                     do not recall having any involvement with or oversight of this, although it is

                     possible that my team would have been asked to comment on training

                     materials. I cannot, therefore, express a view on whether the training provided

                     was adequate. I recall the Second Sight Interim Report commented on

                     training not being adequate. This would also have been fed through to the

                     Sparrow project.


                 30. I had no involvement in POL's audit of SPM's branch accounts.


                 31. 1 became aware around the time of the Rod Ismay report that prosecutions

                     were taking place, but I did not appreciate the full scale of these until later. I

                     understood that data from Horizon was being used as part of the supporting

                     evidence in those legal proceedings and the importance of the integrity of the

                     data. At some point (I do not recall when) I became aware that there was a

                     contractual obligation for Fujitsu to provide audit data as part of any

                     investigations. I do not recall appreciating that POL could prosecute

                     individuals itself without referral to external authorities until around the time of

                     the Second Sight review. At this time, I did not give this much consideration

                     and would not have been able to comment on the prosecutions themselves.

                     At the time I joined POL, the prosecutions had been ongoing for many years. I

                     did not have involvement with these as they were handled by the legal

                     department. I can see from the documents provided an occasion in 2013

                     when Simon Baker (a member of my team) was asked to obtain information

                     on "bugs" in connection with a prosecution (please see POL00164510 and

                     POL00060572) but that was the extent of my involvement.


                 32. 1 understood that Gareth Jenkins was a Fujitsu technical expert on Horizon

                     and later a technical witness for POL in legal proceedings. I did not have any

                     professional relationship with Gareth Jenkins, although the documents

                     provided show an occasion where I did have email contact with him following

                     an escalation to an account executive at Fujitsu. In addition, I have also

                     reviewed FUJO0124536 in which Gareth Jenkins sends me a copy of his final

                     witness statement from the 2010 Misra case heard at Guildford Crown Court

                     on 28 June 2013. I do not recall being aware of the Misra case in 2010. I had

                     not long joined POL. I was not responsible for prosecutions and I do not recall

                     having any active involvement in prosecutions. I do not recall asking for this

                     statement or how it was asked for and it would be extremely unusual as CIO

                     to request a copy of a witness statement. I can only assume (given the timing)

                     that I had been asked to obtain it as part of the Second Sight review or it may

                     have been related to the prosecution referred to in the above paragraph (I

                     have no recollection of this but note the emails are a few days apart).


            THE ERNST AND YOUNG ("EY") 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 AUDIT FINDINGS
            AND ACTION THEREAFTER

                 33. Shortly after I joined POL in April 2010, I was asked to attend an end-of-year

                     controls audit final review meeting with EY and other POL employees

                     regarding the 2009/2010 audit. I recall that this audit was being overseen by

                     the Finance team as part of the normal financial year end activities which is


                                                             Page 15 of 41

                     not unusual, but it appeared that Finance had taken a lead role in the IT

                     elements. The operational responsibilities for Horizon at this time were

                     through Managed Services (Andy McClean) reporting into the COO (Mike

                     Young).


                 34. Coming into POL, I recall being concerned by the findings of the 2009/2010

                     audit, in particular the number of findings and recurring issues. Having read

                     the summary document to refresh my memory, EY had a number of

                     challenges in identifying an individual within POL who owned the relationship

                     with outsourced providers (including Fujitsu) who could reinforce EY's

                     requests to Fujitsu for evidence required to complete the audit. EY required

                     intervention from senior POL staff and senior Fujitsu UK executives. This was

                     not something I was involved with.


                 35. 1 do not recall the date on which responsibility and senior engagement for the

                     IT elements of the controls audit moved to me. I do not recall what

                     involvement I had in the 2010/11 audit other than I can see from the

                     documents provided that my involvement in the 2010/11 EY controls audits

                     appears to start in around March/April 2011. At this point the operational

                     management of the Fujitsu contract was still within the remit of Managed

                     Services. At the time I took responsibility for the audits, I assigned

                     responsibility to one of my team, Andy Jones (Head of Quality and Standards

                     within IT), to co-ordinate between EY & Fujitsu and to track and ensure

                     actions were being completed with appropriate evidence for the auditors.

                     Andy Jones continued in this role for the duration of my time at POL. I also

                     recall engaging with Internal Audit during my tenure to validate that external

                     audit actions had been completed or were on course to be completed.


                36. The EY audit was an annual activity, and I led the move following the 2010/11

                    report from a standard audit with Fujitsu to an ISAE3402 standard (which

                    superseded SAS70). The main benefit of this for POL was that this was a

                    recognised standard for the controls over a service provider that the auditors

                    could test and POL could rely upon. From my perspective, it appeared that the

                    main issue was that no one within POL had taken ownership of the IT controls

                    in place with Fujitsu. I made Andy Jones accountable for the annual audit

                    process and management of audit actions with clear objectives through his

                    annual performance reviews (POL00137282). The audit outcomes needed to

                    be significantly improved so that POL could become comfortable with the

                    controls. It was made clear to the RMG Board that a move to the ISAE3402

                    standard would take around 2 years; 2011/2012 being foundational and

                    2012/2013 for completion of the ISAE3402 (RMG00000003). I worked closely

                    with EY and the executives at Fujitsu to ensure they knew how important this

                    was. Paula Vennells and Mike Young were also involved in gaining

                    commitment from the most senior levels within Fujitsu. Fujitsu also committed

                    to covering the costs for the ISAE3402.


                 37. The IT team worked with Fujitsu and EY to define the scope and requirements

                     of the ISAE3402, and Fujitsu engaged a consultancy firm (possibly KPMG) to

                     perform their audit and prepare the ISAE3402 prior to EY performing the

                     annual controls audit. This was presented to the Senior IT team and myself

                     on an annual basis. Whilst I cannot remember the specific outcomes of the

                     EY audits, I recall that there was a significant improving trend. This can be

                     seen from POL00021431 and P0L00105629.


                 38. Based on my previous experience in a banking environment, I understood and

                     agreed with the importance of the controls described by EY regarding systems

                     access and management of technical or systems changes to Horizon. Having

                     refreshed my memory by reading the management letter from the 2010/2011

                     audit and the summary of the 2009/2010 findings, I did agree with EY's

                     findings that there needed to be an improvement in the governance of the

                     outsourcing contract and other areas identified. As I set out in paragraph 8

                     above, my view during 2010/2011 was that the contractual relationship and

                     day-to-day operational management of the Fujitsu contract was in the wrong

                     area of the business, although IT and Managed Services did report through to

                     the same Executive Director (the COO). I agreed with EY that a move to a

                     ISAE3402 standard would be beneficial for POL and would provide a much

                     more structured approach for POL/EY whereby the control objectives (over

                     management of change and access to systems) and required outcomes were

                     clear for all parties. Having read the audit report provided it is clear that as

                     the 2010/2011 audit was the first full year audit following the implementation

                     of HNGx, there was a lot of work to be done by Fujitsu around the control

                     environment and within POL to be comfortable with the controls in place. The

                     documents reference Fujitsu's CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) being

                     involved. I vaguely recall this escalation as part of the resulting actions taken.

                     From the documents provided there were also areas where POL needed to

                     assess the risk and compensating controls, especially for privileged users

                     which I believe were considered by the Audit, Risk and Compliance

                     Committee (subcommittee to the ExCo).


                 39. 1 recall concerns were raised by the Board about the cost of the EY audits as

                     they were expensive due to the additional testing EY had to perform to satisfy

                     the end of year audit requirements and they queried why POL should pay

                     rather than Fujitsu. Fujitsu bore the cost of the ISAE3402 once implemented.

                     Aside from this, I do not recall cost being a factor in relation to the steps POL

                     took in response to EY's findings.


            SHOOSMITHS LITIGATION

                40.1 recall this threatened litigation but do not recall being actively involved in

                    POL's response to it. At this time, I was Head of IT & Change and reported to

                    Mike Young (COO). From a review of the documents, I can see that it was

                    initially proposed that I would be a member of a Steering Group to manage

                    POL's response to challenges to Horizon from Shoosmiths /Access Legal and

                    the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance ("JFSA") but as seen in

                    POL00294878 Rod Ismay asked me if I would involve or devolve to David

                    Hulbert and/or David Gray who were both on my team. It is likely that I would

                    have devolved the responsibility to the experts in my team, and document

                    POL00294844 confirms this. I have no recollection of having direct oversight of

                    my team's work on this. My team would have worked directly with Rod Ismay

                    on this. At this time Separation and the associated IT transformation was my

                    key priority and was taking up the majority of my working day. I have no

                    not think I would have had a detailed understanding of this at the time due to

                    my limited involvement.


                41. The only thing I can recollect in relation to legal professional privilege being

                    used within POL is that the legal department asked that anything to do with the

                    Horizon IT system in relation to threatened litigation to be marked as privileged

                    and confidential. I have no specific recollection of who in the legal team

                    communicated this or how/when this was communicated.


            ENGAGEMENT WITH MPS IN EARLY 2012


                42.1 was aware that meetings were taking place between MPs and Paula

                    Vennells. I also recall that Angela Van-Den-Bogerd and Alice Perkins were

                    involved in attending meetings with MPs. I recall being asked to attend the

                    office of Jo Swinson, the then Postal Minister, with Mark Davies

                    (Communications and Corporate Affairs Director) and Alwen Lyons (Company

                    Secretary) at short notice but I do not recall the date. I recall standing outside

                    her office in the corridor while her aides came out and asked us questions. I do

                    not recall any specific questions, only that they were Horizon related. I would

                    have been involved in the preparation for other meetings between MPs and

                    POL executives, together with my team (for example by commenting on

                    briefing papers as seen in POL00145100) but I cannot recall specific details of

                    what I did beyond what is seen in the documents. I (or my team) may have

                    been asked to comment on responses to journalists. I can see some examples

                    from the documents (POL00145113 and POL00142801) although beyond this

                    do not recall any specifics.

                43.In relation to POL00105481 I note 3 action points assigned to me "(i) be ready

                    to present our view on Computer Weekly and what these views are based on;

                    (ii) find out the views of the IT industry and the Govt on Computer Weekly

                    (possibly ask Ian Watmore's new CIO); and (iii) consider who we might

                    suggest as an independent IT consultant who could carry out a review, 2 or 3

                    possibilities so there is a choice". The action points referring to Computer

                    Weekly were in relation to a suggestion made by James Arbuthnot MP that

                    POL should bring them into the business to carry out a review of Horizon. In

                    relation to point (iii) above, I recall that the UK government had set up an area

                    called Government Digital Services. I was tasked with going to talk to

                    government leaders and others in the industry to seek their views on Computer

                    Weekly and if they were able to conduct a review of Horizon. The proposal to

                    bring Computer Weekly journalists into POL to conduct this review was

                    unusual. The appropriate response, in my view, was to bring in an independent

                    expert to carry out a forensic review of whether there was a systemic issue

                    with Horizon (see POL00137248). I recall suggesting that Deloitte undertake

                    the independent review as they were on POL's consultancy panel and could

                    be contracted quickly to do such a piece of work_ Second Sight was eventually

                    instructed to carry out this review and I set out my involvement in that review

                    below in paragraphs 46-51.


                44."Remote access" has a specific meaning in IT which is the ability for support

                    staff to access the systems for support purposes i.e., software updates or

                    hardware diagnostics etc. I understand the Inquiry is referring to whether

                    Fujitsu had the ability to alter SPMs transactions when it uses the phrase

                    "remote access". I recall an occasion early into Alice Perkins' tenure as Chair

                    of the Board when I gave a presentation to her walking her through how

                    Horizon worked at a high-level. The Powerpoint presentation would have been

                    prepared by one of my team. Beyond this, I cannot recall providing any formal

                    briefings to senior managers or board members on the integrity of Horizon.

                    Although I do not recall specifics it is likely that there would have been informal

                    discussions around the subject. I can see from the documents that,

                    throughout my tenure, I would be asked to provide feedback and updates to

                    the board as and when required on a number of IT related subjects. They also

                    show I was asked to provide information by Paula Vennells regarding remote

                    access, prior to her attending the Select Committee (please see

                    P0L00150993, P0L00311320, P0L00151029, P0L00311345 and

                    POL00311353 by way of example). As can be seen from POL00150993, I

                    would rely on my team to provide technical details. In terms of what

                    information was given, I would be transparent and did not intentionally hold

                    anything back. If something was highly technical, when presenting to the

                    Board or senior management, my practice would be to try and turn that into

                    plain English.



                45. 1 have considered page 10 of UKG100016088 and what is meant by "Lesley

                    Sewell reported that a tactical review was underway to understand the single

                    points of failure within the system. A more strategic review was also needed

                    for re-visiting decisions made on critical back-up for system failures". I

                    addressed this at paragraph 20 above. As a result of 4 significant service

                    failures over a 9-month period in 2011/2012, two reviews were undertaken — a

                    tactical review and a strategic risk and resilience review (by KPMG), both of

                    which were reported to the POL Board. The tactical review examined each

                    individual incident, reviewed the root cause and established lessons learnt and

                    improvements were implemented. The strategic review which was conducted

                    by KPMG considered the resilience in the infrastructure as compared against

                    other retailers or banking. The strategic review gave the Board clarity on

                    recovery of the datacentres (post implementation of HNGx) and costs to move

                    to a more resilient platform_ To the best of my knowledge none of the incidents

                    covered by these reviews led to prosecutions.


            INSTRUCTION OF AND ENGAGEMENT WITH SECOND SIGHT

                 46. 1 recall being involved in early discussions with the General Counsel (Susan

                     Crichton), Paula Vennells and possibly others in the ExCo about how best to

                     conduct a forensic review of Horizon. By forensic review I mean a detailed,

                     low-level analysis of data, audit and system logs, functionality, and potentially

                     application code, which would aim to identify any anomalies within the system.

                     This was an action point arising from the meetings with MPs. Susan Crichton

                     led the review. I refer to para 43 above in which I set out that I recall

                     suggesting that Deloitte carry out the independent review and the reasons for

                     this. I was not aware of Second Sight prior to 2012 and believe it was Susan

                     Crichton who suggested them. I vaguely recall meeting with Deloitte and

                     Second Sight with Susan as part of the selection process. I do not recall who

                     ultimately made the decision to appoint Second Sight or any of the specific

                     details about why they were chosen. I would have commented on and fed into

                     the ambit of the investigation, but do not recall any specifics.

                 47.As regards the Sparrow Working Group, while I had some involvement in the

                     project for escalations and review of the interim report, I was not a member of

                     this group and had appointed representatives from my team to support

                     Sparrow. This was because I had been asked by the CEO to focus on

                     Separation and IT transformation. I recall that Second Sight were informed of

                     the P1/P2 IT issues and their resolution.


                 48.All requests for information from Second Sight were managed through

                     Sparrow_ My team were involved in actioning IT requests and supporting the

                     working group. Initially there was a Manager, Simon Baker, assigned to

                     support co-ordinating the activities reporting to the working group, who was

                     then later supported by Steve Allchorn. There was also a Manager assigned

                     from the IT team located in Chesterfield (Kevin Lenihan) who was the conduit

                     between Sparrow and Fujitsu for any information requests from Second Sight.

                     I was not involved in the day-to-day activities of the review save for that, as

                     CIO, I was a point of escalation with the Fujitsu Account Executive (if

                     required) as I had the senior Executive relationship with them. I recall one

                     issue that I was asked to escalate to the Fujitsu Account Executive which

                     related to a SPM going into a basement at Fujitsu's offices in Bracknell in

                     2008. The SPM reported that they had witnessed Fujitsu employees changing

                     transactional data The purpose of the escalation was to ensure full access to

                     information from Fujitsu for Second Sight and the working group. I recall that

                     Fujitsu were adamant that the basement was a standalone test system not

                     linked into the Horizon network. I enquired of Fujitsu what the physical

                     infrastructure was as can be seen from P0L00029605_ They confirmed that

                     the test system infrastructure was physically separate from the data centre

                     which processed the live network data. They also told us that it was common

                     practice to invite stakeholders in to see the testing environment. There was no

                     reason to doubt the information provided by Fujitsu as it was all plausible.


                 49. 1 am reminded by POL00099063 that the interim report said that there were

                     no systemic issues with Horizon and that Second Sight were made aware of

                     the 2 incidents as detailed in paragraph 18 above. Other findings were that:

                     (i) where there was a power or communications failure during the processing

                     of a transaction, timely, accurate and complete information about the status of

                     a transaction was not immediately available to SPMs; (ii) support and advice

                     to SPMs in response to concerns needed to be improved; (iii) the lack of an

                     effective `outreach' investigations function within POL resulted in POL failing

                     to identify the root cause of problems and missing opportunities for process

                     improvements; and (iv) the lack of a 'suspense account' meant it was difficult

                     for the SPMs to deal with disputes.


                 50. POL00099153 appears to be a list of suggestions from me to the Sparrow

                     working group about what should happen as a result of the Second Sight

                     report. I had come to POL from a banking background and in a bank

                     environment there would typically be a suspense account at a branch level.

                     By `suspense account' I mean a branch level account where transaction

                     anomalies could be parked until they were resolved. As I understood it at the

                     time, there was no ability to do this within post office branches and SPMs had

                     to balance at the end of each day. The implementation of a suspense account

                     was one of Second Sight's recommendations, and the action to 'consider a

                     suspense account at branch level was to assess what would be necessary to



                                                             Page 25 of 41

                     make this change. While I did not take a leading role on follow-up actions, I

                     did give a view to the Sparrow working group on next steps. This included

                     scoping the suspense account' changes and further guidance to the branches

                     on communication failures.


                51. 1 was concerned the initial review by Second Sight was not forensic enough. I

                    would have voiced this to Paula and Susan. As regards the views of others, I

                    vaguely recall others having concerns about how the review was being carried

                    out and how long it was taking, I cannot recall specifically who but am

                    reminded by POL00145100. The first review was at a much higher level than I

                    had expected and, in my view, from a technology perspective, Second Sight

                    needed to go into the transactional and low-level system logs to do a deep

                    technical dive. Whilst the initial report said there were no systemic issues with

                    Horizon, I expected a more detailed analytical review of the individual cases.


            THE INTERIM REPORT AND THE MEDIATION SCHEME

                52.After Second Sight were engaged, my main involvement in the preparation of

                    the interim report related to obtaining material from Fujitsu in relation to the

                    Bracknell matter. As regards any "preparation for and response to" the interim

                    report, as set out above, in POL00099153 I made suggestions about what

                    could be done in response and how any subsequent actions could be

                    structured. I was not involved in the day-to-day working group action plan. I

                    have no memory of requesting any amendments to the report, but from the

                    documents provided it is clear that I reviewed the interim report and provided

                    comment to Paula Vennells and Susan Critchon (POL00099088). I can see

                    from POL00099088 that I have provided comments on a marked-up version of

                    the interim report in relation to two areas in which POL and Second Sight had

                    conflicting views (the Bracknell matter and one of the spot reviews which

                    related to a connection failure).



                53. 1 was not actively involved in the Mediation Scheme or the Working Group. As

                    regards POL00089708, I am listed as a member of the Mediation Scheme

                    Working group in 2013, but not in 2014. The provenance of this document is

                    not known to me. I was not a member of the Working Group, although as can

                    be seen from the documents, I was copied on emails relating to the interim

                    report. In the second half of 2013/2014 I was focused on Separation and IT

                    transformation. I also was heavily involved with the Deloitte review (see

                    "Project Zebra" below).



                54. 1 recall that Second Sight produced a second report in August 2014, although I

                    do not recall the detail. I was not actively involved in its preparation as, at this

                    time, I was focused on the areas set out above. I can see from POL00207852

                    that I had been away on holiday and on my return, David Hulbert provides an

                    update to me about the second report. I cannot recall being involved in POL's

                    response to the second report.



                55. As I saw it, Project Sparrow was in place to manage the Second Sight review

                    and any resultant actions, and to oversee the Mediation scheme. As I was not

                    part of the group I am unable to provide any more specific detail. I do not know

                    why the Project Sparrow committee became a formal subcommittee of the

                    board and would expect those who sat on the board could confirm this.

                56.1 do not recall any policies or strategies POL adopted in responding to

                    complaints made about Horizon, both in the mediation scheme and more

                    widely. I therefore do not recall any factors taken into account when deciding

                    on any such policies or strategies, or any disagreements. By the end of 2014, I

                    did not sit on the Group ExCo. I recall it was meeting daily during this time.

                    joined a monthly meeting to prepare any board papers. I am therefore unable

                    to comment on this and I imagine most of the discussions about this would

                    have taken place at group executive level.



                57. I do not recall being involved in briefing Paula Vennells, Alice Perkins or other

                    senior managers within POL in respect of the Mediation Scheme, whether in

                    readiness for a board meeting or otherwise.



                58. 1 have addressed my involvement relating to the ambit of Second Sight's

                    investigation above at paragraphs 46-51. My team facilitated access to IT

                    documents from within POL and from Fujitsu. As regards POL's approach to

                    disclosing documentation to Second Sight, if my team were asked to collect

                    information it would have either gone directly to Second Sight and/or to the

                    legal team. I would have asked my team to be transparent in terms of

                    providing information.

                    any knowledge I have will be the media.

            POL'S RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT'S FOLLOWING THE MEDIATION SCHEME

                60. I understand that the Mediation Scheme ran from August 2013 unti► the end of

                    Q1 2015. At the time, I would have been aware of the Mediation Scheme and

                    potentially the Working Group closing but I was not actively involved in either. I

                    would have been copied in on emails regarding criticisms of POL in the media

                    (such as the BBC's Panorama episode) and in Parliament. While I do not recall

                    the Bracknell issue re-surfacing in 2015, I can see from POL00002575 that

                    Nigel Shaw, Account Executive of Fujitsu, wrote to me about it in connection

                    with the Panorama programme. I had dealt with this issue when Second Sight

                    was completing its interim report. I do not recall being involved in any briefing

                    to the POL board and / or more senior managers on the integrity of Horizon

                    following the closure of the Working Group.



                61.1 cannot recall being directly involved in POL's internal communications

                    regarding challenges to the Horizon IT system. While it is possible I may have

                    been asked to comment prior to communications being issued, I do not recall

                    any specific instances. I am not aware of any POL policy in respect of such

                    communications.



            PROJECT ZEBRA

                62.To the best of my recollection, the request for a further review of Horizon came

                    from the POL Board. I am reminded by POL00138190 and POL00138191 that

                    POL sought legal advice from Linklaters about what an expert report into

                    Horizon should cover. I was not involved in obtaining this legal advice. The

                    Deloitte report was instructed by the General Counsel (by now Chris Aujard). A

                    Terms of Reference was agreed with Deloitte as can be seen from

                    POL00108462_ I also had input into this, as can be seen from POL00147961,

                    where I commented that there was not enough detail in the first draft. The legal

                    team led the review. Phase 2 was at the request of the Board (I am reminded

                    by the documents that there was a meeting on 30 April 2014).


                63.As to why Deloitte were selected, I can only assume it was because they were

                    on POL's consultancy panel and were known to POL having previously

                    completed work within IT and Information Security. I had also recommended

                    them in the past. The review was limited to a desktop review, meaning it was

                    restricted to reviewing documentation and speaking with technical experts. I do

                    not recall why it was limited to assurance work only, although performing a full

                    end-to-end system historic forensic review would have been challenging given

                    the original Horizon system had been replaced by HNGx. I also recall the time

                    and possibly cost of a deeper forensic dive being an issue, in particular time,

                    as if I recall correctly, POL wanted the review to done quickly. My view was

                    that a forensic review needed to take place but that this was a good start. I

                    recall my team being involved in ensuring Deloitte had access to resources

                    required within Fujitsu (from system architects and specialists) and by

                    engaging with the Fujitsu Account Executive to facilitate this. I remember

                    attending a meeting with either Second Sight or Deloitte and Fujitsu

                    (Executives and Fujitsu systems experts) and POL representatives where

                    Fujitsu presented the details of the systems architecture and explained how

                    transactions were stored securely and could not be altered given the digital

                    key against each transaction. If I recall correctly, Fujitsu stated in this meeting

                                                             Page 30 of 41

                    that correctional transactions could only be added through a facility that

                    required the SPM to accept.


                64. 1 am reminded by POL00138271 that Deloitte were asked to put more

                    information in the second interim version of the report and to structure it more

                    clearly. The Deloitte summary paper of their initial findings (prior to completion

                    of the full report) was presented to POL Board and they were asked to attend a

                    Board meeting. I attended for this agenda item and the General Counsel was

                    also in the meeting. The full review would have gone to the General Counsel

                    and myself, and most likely to a wider circulation. I was not involved in the

                    wider distribution of the report. I can see from POL00138432 that a summary

                    of the findings and recommendations of the Deloitte report were presented to

                    the Board Risk and Compliance Committee by the General Counsel Chris

                    Aujard. I was not a member of this committee and do not recall seeing this

                    summary at the time. Having reviewed this document now, I do not think it fully

                    conveys the findings from the Deloitte report and in particular I note that it

                    recommends that there is not a review of the transactions. As I understood it at

                    the time, the key actions arising from the Deloitte report fed into the Sparrow

                    Project and were presumably dealt with by them. Other actions, such as future

                    looking considerations, I would have expected to have been fed into the IT

                    programmes.



                65.1 am reminded of the findings of the Deloitte report from the documents

                    provided and can recall that I broadly agreed with them. I recall that Deloitte

                    identified that 1 transaction had been added by Fujitsu during the time of the

                    HNGx pilot or early roll out. I immediately escalated this internally within POL

                    to the CEO and General Counsel. I recall this as I was angry on finding out this

                    information. Fujitsu had consistently contended that data could not be added

                    or amended without the knowledge of the SPM or their consent as the SPM

                    through a system facility called Transaction Corrections. I do not remember

                    the transaction type (the Deloitte report details it as a `Balancing Transaction')

                    however my understanding prior to this was that any changes of this nature

                    had to be accepted by the SPM and there was a full audit trail. I understood

                    that although the balancing transaction was outside of the normal process, the

                    SPM was aware. I escalated this with Fujitsu who were asked to provide

                    details of this case and to assure POL there had been no other transactions of

                    this nature. I believe confirmation was provided by running a program against

                    all transactions to determine if there had been any other transactions of this

                    type. The Deloitte report makes reference to an email regarding this type of

                    transaction. I would have shared the results with my team.



            THE FUTURE OF THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

                66.1 took a lead role in any discussions regarding the future use of Horizon at POL

                    and therefore have a clear recollection about this topic. These discussions

                    took place throughout my tenure and it was a constantly evolving process_ As

                    set out above at paragraph 7 I was accountable for POL's IT strategy post-

                    Separation with approval at Executive and Board level. I would have taken in

                    views from all key stakeholders across the business about the IT strategy

                    (including the future use of Horizon) and would have ensured it aligned with

                    POL's business strategy. From early on in my tenure, it was clear that the legal

                    team had concerns about the Fujitsu contract as it was originally formed in the



                                                             Page 32 of 41

                    1990s and had never been out to public tender. It was therefore difficult to

                    assess its value for money, particularly from a public purse perspective. I also

                    recall concerns from other business stakeholders (i.e. marketing and retail)

                    about how user-friendly Horizon was and the time it took to change when

                    introducing business changes. In addition, technology had moved on

                    significantly since Horizon was introduced. These concerns were continually

                    raised and discussed throughout my tenure.



                 67. The IT strategy I was developing was complex. As such, the work was

                     supported by external consultants, primarily Deloitte and Berkerley

                     Partnership who assisted in developing the IT strategy as well as providing

                     support for the numerous procurements that had to take place. The

                     procurements were also supported by external legal representation as well as

                     the internal procurement and legal teams. It was a huge undertaking and was

                     probably one of the largest IT procurements in the UK at the time. The IT

                     strategy put in place was a tower model for IT outsourcing. This model

                     operated with a service integrator ("SI") sitting at the top which managed

                     specific areas of technology underneath it on behalf of POL e.g. end-user

                     (desk-top), network, front-office, back-office (HR, finance, systems) and digital

                     (website). All parts of the tower model, including for the SI, went out to

                     procurement. Atos were awarded the contract for the SI in October 2013.

                     Prior to the tower model and prior to Separation, by contrast, from an IT

                     perspective, POL's only material contract was with Fujitsu.

                 68. The Fujitsu contract was one part of the wider IT strategy landscape. There

                     were numerous discussions with Fujitsu regarding the future of Horizon and

                     more broadly the POL IT Strategy throughout my tenure. These discussions

                     were with the account executives (which changed over time) but I recall Paul

                     Patterson and Helen Lamb in particular. At executive meetings, Fujitsu were

                     given an update about POL's IT strategy, although we had to be careful about

                     what could be said given the ongoing procurements. About a year after I

                     joined POL, Fujitsu made a proposal to extend its services beyond the end of

                     the current contract. The contract ran until March 2015 and the proposal was

                     for a 5-year extension. POL00114269 (19 September 2012 Board Paper) has

                     refreshed my memory on this topic. Some of the Fujitsu software and

                     hardware was coming to the end of its life. POL had to decide whether it

                     would proceed with the 5-year extension with Fujitsu or to continue with the

                     new IT strategy/tower model_ I recall Fujitsu's proposal was discussed at

                     length internally and it was decided not to proceed with it due to legal reasons

                     (i.e. because the contract had not been out to tender and it was difficult to

                     demonstrate value for money) and also because the contract was perceived

                     as lacking flexibility when considered alongside the business and overall IT

                     strategy, which was forward-thinking and focused on new technologies (such

                     as digital) in contrast to the legacy Horizon system. I recall this decision was

                     communicated to Fujitsu in September 2012. If I recall correctly, the full IT

                     strategy was not quite finalised at this point. Although it was decided not to

                     extend the Fujitsu contract for 5 years, it is clear from the Board paper above

                     that any move to a new solution/provider would likely require a short

                     extension to the Fujitsu contract to manage the risk of moving platforms.

                 69. Fujitsu, through executive engagement, were well aware of the plans to

                     eventually move to a tower model. As the procurements for the towers model

                     progressed, if I recall correctly, Fujitsu decided to bid for Front Office

                     (Horizon), and End User. There may have been other areas it bid for too.

                     Fujitsu was not successful in its bid for the End User procurement. After this,

                     recall that Fujitsu took the stance that they did not want to continue with the

                     bid for Front Office. This was at the end of 2014. At that point, Fujitsu wrote to

                     POL stating that they were effectively in exit mode. Please see

                     POL00109859 which includes a paper to ExCo and the Board regarding the

                     Fujitsu Transition and Risk Management, and an update on the broader IT

                     transformation programme. The Board paper details all the material risks and

                     actions being taken. In my view, Fujitsu did not like the tower model IT

                     strategy and that they would be managed by an SI. The tower model posed a

                     threat to Fujitsu's supply of IT services to POL and its revenue. While I cannot

                     recall the precise figures, I was aware that the POL contract had contributed

                     to a significant percentage of Fujitsu's UK revenue.



                70. Front Office was eventually awarded to IBM. At some point after I left POL I

                    became aware from the press that POL had decided not to move away from

                    Fujitsu as it was too great a risk for the business to take and POL extended the

                    contract for Front Office with Fujitsu. I recall during my tenure that Fujitsu

                    repeatedly told POL that they thought it was a risk to POL to move away from

                    them.

                 71. In my view the support and operational service that POL received from Fujitsu

                     did not change over time. It was in Fujitsu's interests that they maintained

                     good service levels because as per the contract, Fujitsu had to pay

                     compensation to POL if there were any material service outages. The

                     relationship, however, did change over time. As I set out above, Fujitsu

                     cha►lenged the tower structure, as this was a risk to their revenue. When

                     Fujitsu were not successful with any bids and removed themselves from the

                     Front Office procurement, that marked a key change in the relationship. As

                     can be seen from POL00109859, POL put in place a dedicated transition

                     manager to closely manage Fujitsu. In 2015, as can be seen in

                     FUJ00175195, Alisdair Cameron was involved as part of the Transition

                     services agreement and ensuring support at the highest level for POL's exit. I

                     recall that Fujitsu wrote not only to myself but also Paula Vennells in 2015

                     (see FUJO0168944 and FUJO0168945). It was clear from the letter that they

                     were in exit mode. Fujitsu also stated that they would not support any

                     subcontracting if POL should need it. It was disappointing but not unexpected

                     given that they were in exit mode.



                 72. Any reviews of Horizon with regards to security and stability that had taken

                     place over the previous years would have fed into the procurements and were

                     considered. The alternative technologies proposed were current state-of-the-

                     art and more advanced than HNGx. To the best of my recollection, the

                     concerns about Horizon that were voiced internally as regards IT

                     infrastructure related to the legal (contractual) issues, user-friendliness,

                     operational resilience and lack of flexibility of the system as referred to above

                     allegations against SPMs.



            LEAVING POL

                73. 1 resigned from POL in early June 2015. By the end of 2014, I was very

                    unhappy at POL. There were a number of reasons for this. Towards the end of

                    2014, Paula Vennells decided to change POL's structure and create a Group

                    Executive. This was not well managed. I had always reported through to an

                    executive but also sat on the ExCo from 2012. Paula's view was that I should

                    not sit on the Group Executive and lose the Executive title and be part of the

                    lower-level leadership team. This was notwithstanding the fact that my

                    responsibilities were increasing (becoming Operations Director in addition to

                    CIO). I was no longer involved in broader group executive decision making or

                    group discussions. Paula had also brought in a Transformation Executive who

                    sat on the Group Executive who took responsibility for all transformation work.

                    It felt as if my role was moving towards a more operational role after many

                    years of working on Separation and IT transformation. I felt that I could no

                    longer do my job properly. I also felt that the culture at POL had changed.

                    When I started at POL there was a warm culture, but towards the end of my

                    tenure, the culture was not supportive and did not fit with my personal values.

                    All of this made me so unhappy that it was affecting my physical and mental

                    health. In early June 2015 I resigned without having another job secured. I was

                    put on gardening leave from 1 October 2015 rather than working my full notice

                    period until November 2015.

            GENERAL

                74. Having spent time reviewing the documentation provided by the Inquiry and

                    reflected on my time at POL, I do believe that POL would have benefited from

                    having an independent technical expert (or recruiting a POL employee with

                    sufficient remit and authority) able to conduct technical forensic reviews at the

                    stage at which Horizon was being challenged. Their role would have been to

                    challenge the accepted position that Horizon was not the root cause of any

                    issues and remove the reliance on Fujitsu technical expertise and system

                    knowledge_ Fujitsu owned the intellectual property rights to the majority of

                    Horizon and POL was reliant on Fujitsu for technical expertise. This individual

                    would have been involved in the external reviews which were conducted, and

                    provide a central, consistent 'font of all knowledge' for all things to do with

                    challenges to Horizon. An independent technical expert would have benefited

                    the Second Sight report, as it appears that they performed an initial

                    investigation of cases, then referred the detailed technical investigation to

                    Fujitsu/POL.


                75.The key actions that resulted from the Deloitte review (Project Zebra) were as I

                    understood managed under the Sparrow working group. On reflection, while I

                    was not asked to do this at the time, I feel that these would have benefited

                    from oversight by IT.


                76.1 do not feel qualified to pass comment on how POL handled challenges to the

                    integrity of Horizon by SPMs, MPS, journalists and members of the public any

                    further than I have already done so throughout this statement. I did not have

                    sufficient involvement with the prosecutions to offer comment on POL's

                    approach to the prosecutions or disclosure of information to SPMs.


                77. There are two other matters that I consider are of relevance to the Inquiry that I

                    would like to draw to the attention of the Chair: (i) attempts by Paula Vennells

                    to contact me after I left POL in 2015; and (ii) a recent attempt by the BBC to

                    contact me for comment.


                78.As part of my preparation to make this statement, I have checked my personal

                    mobile telephone, personal email account and my iPad to see if there were

                    any relevant communications I had with former POL colleagues after I left POL

                    at the end of November 2015. To the best of my knowledge and research,

                    Paula Vennells contacted me 4 times in 2020 and 2021 via either email,

                    telephone call or text message. It has taken me some time to locate all of

                    these communications. On 8 March 2020, Paula Vennells emailed my

                    personal email account from a personal email account of hers. I exhibit a copy

                    of that email at WITNO0840101. In that email, she asked if I could spare her

                    some time for a call as she had "been asked at short notice to appear before a

                    BETS Select Committee on all things Horizon/Sparrow and need to plug some

                    memory gaps! My hope is this might help avoid an independent inquiry but to

                    do so, I need to be well prepared". I had not spoken to Paula since I had left

                    POL in 2015. We spoke on the telephone later that day. I made brief notes in

                    relation to that call which I exhibit as WITN00840102_ I recall the call was

                    short. I had no POL papers to refer to at the time to refresh my memory so

                    anything discussed was from memory alone. I was not following the POL

                    litigation. I was never contacted about the litigation.

                79. Paula contacted me again on 15 June 2020 via text message requesting a call.

                    I cannot recall what was discussed and I cannot find any notes I made in

                    relation to this call. Paula contacted me again on 11 December 2020 by calling

                    my mobile telephone. I cannot recall what was discussed. I did not make any

                    notes in relation to this call. Paula contacted me again on 12 April 2021 via text

                    message requesting a call. We spoke for longer this time and I made a file

                    note which I exhibit as WITN00840103. My notes are in shorthand and it

                    appears as though I have recorded what Paula said to me. I can see from my

                    notes that there is reference to the Project Zebra Deloitte report and a

                    reference to a call to Gareth James of Deloitte who I recall was the lead on this

                    project who I worked with a lot. I cannot recall why he was mentioned. I do not

                    know what is meant by "lawyers say we didn't do anything about it". Paula

                    must have said this to me and I do not know to which lawyers she referred. I

                    suspect the reference to "can we publish" relates to the fact that POL wanted a

                    report from Deloitte that it could publish. I recall Deloitte were nervous about

                    this and the reference in my notes to "massively caveated" may have been a

                    reference to Deloitte's position i.e. the report could only be published if it was

                    subject to caveats. I do not know what "PV got jumpy" means. I can see

                    reference in my notes to the EY audits. I can only assume the reference to

                    "very little testing done" is to the Deloitte report being a desktop review. I think

                    the reference to "Stage 2 work" was a reference to the recommendations

                    coming out of the Deloitte report more generally. I believe the reference to "in

                    light of 3700 lost money as result of shortfalls" is a reference to the number of

                    SPMs with shortfalls. I also recall Paula converting this number into a monthly

                    average of SPMs with shortfalls. I had not heard these figures prior to this

                    conversation. If I had been aware of the magnitude of the losses during my

                    tenure I would have been surprised and concerned about this. My notes refer

                    to the "Court of Appeal case on 23 April 2021". I do not recall being aware of

                    these legal proceedings at the time I spoke to Paula. I had no involvement in

                    those proceedings. I can also see that I have made reference to "Deloitte

                    report said that transactions could be amended/changed?" and have added

                    "not my understanding". At the time of writing this note, my understanding of

                    the Deloitte findings was that only 1 balancing transaction had taken place.


                80. Paula contacted me on four occasions in total. I recall blocking her number

                    after the last call as I did not feel comfortable with her contacting me. I had no

                    access to POL papers and was relying on my memory only. I exhibit the text

                    messages arranging the four calls as WITN00840105.


                81.1 was contacted by Olivia Davies of the BBC on 3 April 2024. I exhibit that

                    email as WITN00840104_ She was seeking information about POL from an

                    Information Security perspective (i.e. not in relation to Horizon). I forwarded the

                    email to POL's witness support team and they responded on my behalf the

                    following day saying that I did not wish to speak with the press.
