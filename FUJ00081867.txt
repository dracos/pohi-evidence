[here are two issues that I can see:

h. Error : 0437
[his error happens when NIC gets exception executing the request.

FUJ00081867
FUJ00081867

P. Once the transaction, which is auditable, fails it starts giving error 0784/0783 becuase the previous auditable message had not
peen returned.

The issue #2 is being addressed in other peak i-e. PC0194931...
Ii think we should address only issue #1 in this peak.

Regarding issue #1 :
According to log reason is: "Error connecting to data centr
linputstream when it tries to access service.

", though it throws ClassCastException while parsing the supplied

Ir suggest getting the osr message.log to see what response caused the Counter to blow up, Clearly the BAL could serialise the message
Iso why could the Counter not deserialise it.

Based on the evidence you should be able to guide SSC to locate the appropriate BAL message.
then you can investigate why the Counter could not parse it.

lfter going through the BAL message.log i can see the Response is received OK.

In Communications. java parseNormalResponse() method after receiving the reponse from BAL it is parsing the response xml string and
fenerating the root object of this xml using the dtotypemappings.

can you reproduce the issue? Your earlier statements are contraditory - in one place you say that the XML can be parsed, later that
setReportDataResponseDTO causes the problem.

jot convinced. At Communications.java:126 the cast is to ResponseDTO. This should be a safe cast.

However, I have reproduced this using the first example I found in the logs, and it is indeed failing at this line.

Hsing 519246 example. The message received at 010-04-07 13:28:56,573 UIC then fails parsing at 2010-04-07 13:28:56,593

Ihe message returned is a com.fujitsu-poa.domain.base.dyno.SimpleDynoImpl rather than a ResponseDTO.
It'd try to ascertain if this applies to older Counters and older OSRs.
