Charles/Rod

Second Sight have now comeback on the paper and asked for information on the suspense account.
Specifically "can we have details of month end balances for this account for the last 3 years together with details of
amounts released to P&L"

Charles had previously suggested providing a ballpark figure, but if we do that we would have to wrap a
significant amount of information around that as context. However, Andy Parsons has sketched out a suggested
response below. I do not know whether the published accounts give any details or whether we do ever make this
information otherwise available but I would be grateful for advice on how best to respond.

I think that we should consider this through the lens of an Fol request and how we would respond to that.
Anyone could ask the question (and may have done so in the past) therefore we need to be sure that whatever
response we give would not result in less information being released than if they requested the information under
FolA.

Second Sight are producing a draft report either today or tomorrow which is likely to reference this so we will
need to have a response within the next couple of days.

Best wishes
Belinda

Belinda, Angela
As discussed briefly yesterday, I suspect that the information requested by lan below is highly commercial sensitive.

It may also be that the figures in question are quite high and this may then be portrayed as if there are significant sums
each month that cannot be reconciled within POL's accounts. The inference from this is that POL's processes /
accounting systems are flawed given the volume of discrepancies. Whether or not this is correct, it is an easy leap to
make.

Assuming that POL finance say that this info cannot be disclosed, I've penned out a short response to lan below.

Kind regards

The information you are seeking is highly commercially sensitive and therefore would only be made available in
exceptional circumstances.

As described in the Suspense Account Note provided to you, sums in POL's suspense account do not impact on
branch accounting but reflect unresolved matters between POL and its clients. I'd be grateful if you could explain why
SS need visibility of the suspense account figures given that the Part 2 Report and the CRRs are only focussed on the
impact on SPMRs.

Kind regards
Andy

In the light of the disclosure of rolling 3 year suspense account can we have details of month end balances for this
account for the last 3 years together with details of amounts released to P&L

Many thanks
