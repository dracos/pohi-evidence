Pocket Notebook Usage.

* The amount of information recorded in a PNB
will vary according to the circumstances.

* As a minimum the record should contain
sufficient information to recall the
circumstances of the event at a later date, in
particular when giving evidence in court.

You should include:

* All relevant times e.g. of the incident, arrival
and departure.

* The exact location.

* Type of occurrence or offence

+ Name, date of birth, occupation, address,
telephone numbers/contact details of all
persons involved or suspected.

* Details of other investigating officers/other
agencies present at the scene.

* Direct speech used, unsolicited comments,
admissions, denials etc.

* Vehicle details (if relevant)
* Property recovered.
* This list is not exhaustive.

19/02/2015

The PNB should be the primary record in the
following circumstances:-

* Details of tape-recorded interviews;

* Significant statements which must be put to
the suspect at the start of the interview
Unsolicited comments made by a suspect
outside the context of a formal interview
which may be relevant to an offence.

Recording of Evidence
or Significant Occurrence.

The primary purpose of the PNB is to record
evidence and also as an aid to memory.

The PNB should always be the first record of
evidence.

Investigating Officers should not use their own
statement of evidence as the first record of
evidence unless their PNB was not available at
the time and the record was made on the day
of and as soon as practicable after the incident.

+ Investigating officers must record the full
details of any incident and any other details
they feel may assist them to recall the
circumstances of the event at a later date, in
particular when they are giving evidence in
court,

19/02/2015

Investigating Officers should ensure that
verbal evidence recorded from suspects in
their PNB is shown to the suspect and the
suspect given the opportunity to read and sign
the PNB.

A refusal to read or sign should be noted by
the officer in his/her PNB.

If this process is not undertaken the evidence
may be deemed inadmissible in court.

The longer the delay in completing the entry
the greater is the chance of the investigating
officer’s memory becoming unreliable and
evidence being compromised and/or
challenged in court.

If operational considerations mean that an
entry cannot be made at the time of the event
it should where possible be made before
moving to another case.

Subsequent Contact

+ The CPIA 1997 places a statutory responsibility
on all Investigators involved in the conduct of
a criminal investigation to record and retain
relevant material.

Any contact, either in person or by other
media e.g. text, voicemail, e-mail etc must be
regarded as potentially relevant and therefore
should be recorded and retained in a durable
and readable form.
