1. Tracking Summary

Comments

TIME

The Horizon Online pilot has been extended and is now operational
in 144 live branches.

However due to a number of live issues experienced across the
network, further migrations have been temporarily suspended.

The intention is to re-start the pilot w/c 8" March, subject to the
successful implementation of fixes to improve the service
experienced by branches, and evidence of improvements in the level
of support provided, in particular by the HSD.

An action plan has been developed to track progress and success
against these items. However it is essential that meaningful data can
be supplied to show that improvements have been made before the
continuation of the pilot can be agreed. This data has started to
come through but needs further refinement before it can be acted on.

In addition, serious live issues were encountered today (3° March),
and these have further undermined confidence in the readiness of
the solution. This has also caused further negative feedback from
the Network and NFSP, and we are in danger of losing any
remaining goodwill from the frontline.

As a result of the above, the end date of rollout has already gone
back into June, but given the current level of ongoing problems this
may be an optimistic position.

A full discussion is therefore required at the Board of how the
programme can be brought back on track — or what assurance
Fujitsu can provide that further slippage will be minimised. At
present, Post Office has little confidence that the solution is stable, or
that the problems highlighted are under control.

Reverted to Amber (from Green) due to likely over-run of programme
and additional costs incurred.

e User opinion. This has deteriorated significantly since the last
meeting, and we are in danger of losing remaining goodwill. This
is down to the number of live issues experienced, some concerns
around transactions, and continued changes to migration dates.

e Screen Freezes, Re-boots and Recoveries. The rate of screen
freezes and recoveries has been significantly greater than
expected and needs to reduce rapidly in order to extend rollout.
This is under urgent investigation and action by Fujitsu
