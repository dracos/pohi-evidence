Subject: Channel 4 doc next week re POL and our Horizon system - heads up
POL has just informed us that they are commenting back to Channel 4 on a documentary to be aired next Monday re
the plight of a few sub-postmasters who have claimed that Horizon (our system) was the cause of financial
irregularities that led to them losing their jobs. This appears to be related to Horizon and not HNGx and also are not
related to the service interruptions we experienced during March/April.
POL will send us the comments they have made tomorrow. Verbally POL has confirmed to us that these cases are
known to them and they see no cause for concern. In case we are approached — as usual — we should refer all
questions back to the POL PR team.

If anything changes tomorrow that is a cause for concern I will let you know.

Kind regards,

Gavin
