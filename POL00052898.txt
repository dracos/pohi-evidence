cP Asks if green giro’s are checked

them off and that would have been the same as well with the benefit

dockets when we did have them add them up physically and send

them off”
13:50 cP “Just explain to me when you say add them up physically, what do
you do?”
™ “With the calculator”
cP “The Horizon sheet prints off a list”
™ “A list of it yeh then what I do I just add the dockets or the giro’s up

on the calculator and what ever figure I get on the calculator it has
to match the”

14:10 cP “So basically it’s a fail proof system and there shouldn't be any
errors”
™ “Yeh yeh”
cP “So it’s your green giro’s and your pensions, do you do the same

with everything else do you?”

™ “More or less yeh yeh”
cP “So that eliminates any errors then”

cP “What do you do is out when you don’t balance what do you check,

do you double check every thing?”
™ “Yeh cash, stock transactions that have gone out”
cP “So you double check everything?”
™ “Yeh”
cP “What do you do if you are out, say a large amount?”
™ “Right that’s where will get to erm when I first took over the business

I checked it all thoroughly everything if I mean at first weren’t having
bad errors if I was £10 £20 out I would put it straight back in
physically myself. Now after the last audit that we had I spoke with
my Retail Line Manager Steve Taylor and I also realised that
procedures were changing as well with Post Office Ltd and I was
told that if you were to make any shortages while I mean I was
holding things in the suspense account as well that Steve Taylor
knew about we agreed with him that I could pay the shortage back
through my wages”

Discussion reveals that TM had a loss of about £4,000 before the
last audit in March 2003 and that the shortage was found during an
check by post office auditors. That the RLM informed TM that if
further losses were incurred they would have to be made good
straight away as he would not be allowed to put them in the

suspense account any longer.

16:30 ™ “This is when my problems started kicking off I was on my own most
of the time in the post office I have got two kids now who are three
and two years old so they were born in that period. I had many
sleepless nights and that and I did make errors I'll admit I probably
did and er you know I was coming up with shortages of like a

thousand two thousand a week now obviously natural instinct was

how the hell was I going to put this back in so I just panicked, I'll be
honest I just panicked and I didn’t you know cause I didn’t know how
to physically put it back in I just added the figures on myself which I

know I made a mistake there”

cP “If you made a mistake you would have received error notices

wouldn't you?”

™ “Yeh that’s what I thought but I mean what”
17:20 cP “You are not getting error notices back are you?”
™ “See what could have happened also I could have given the money

out physically to a customer I could have done like say when
customers come in to pay a bill I have given the money out rather
than taking it it could have happened”

cP Informs TM that he had said he would check documents before they
are sent away and TM says that for the last two years he has not
been concentrating properly because he was under so much
pressure.

cP Reminds TM of his previous comments on checking documents to

which TM replies that’s how he would have done it at the start.

cP “But you said that is how you did it until the pensions stopped and
the pensions have only just stopped”

™ “Yeh pensions and that I mean I will do that but I am talking about
the cash the rest of the stock I was just adding figures on I mean
what I was doing was I was taking from last weeks balance snap
shot taking away from the week and just making up the figures”
18:10
cP “When did you first do this then”

™ “That was the first when I got the first shortage of about four or five

hundred pound after the first audit about two years ago or
something when my you know clear accounts had been cleared
every thing was cleared back to normal again”
Questioning reveals that the first large loss occurred two to three
weeks after the audit in 2003.
18:40

™ “You see what you have got to understand is that I weren’t putting
the losses through showing them on the figures”

cP How much was the first loss in April?”

™ “About four or five hundred”

cP Asks if TM had shown the loss and TM explains that he did not
show the loss because his father had put a lot into the business by
putting his house up as security for the business and that he did not
want to let him down.

cP “So in April 2003 you had a loss of four to five hundred pound, you
didn’t show it so what did you do?”

™ “I just added it into the figures”

CP “Into what figures?”

™ “The cash cash figures”

cP “Then what?”

™ That's it I was balancing like I weren't really after that I weren't really
counting the cash I was just like adding it on and taking it away from
the last figure and then adding it on”

20:00
cP “So you falsified your account?”
™ “Yeh you could say that yes”

cP “Well you did”
™ “Yeh I did yeh”
cP “By your way of thinking and your method of balancing you have
been falsifying your account every week”
™ “You could say that yeh”
cP “Well”
™ “Yeh yes yes I agree with you”
20:50 cP Asks how he would do it each week.
™ “Like I say I take way the figure from the last night before from the

balance snap shot that day and then I just what the difference was I

had added on to the cash or take it off the cash”

TM agrees that by his actions he has also falsified his Over Night
Cash Holding figures every night.

21:50 ™ Says that when he realised things were getting too much, about
three months ago, he informed his father of the situation and the
amount of shortage then was about £25,000 adding that he was not
really checking.

CP “If you are taking one figure away from the next you will know it was
about thirty odd thousand. When you did your balance on
Wednesday, when you did your balance on Wednesday you had to
falsify your account didn’t you?”

22:10 ™ “Yeh but see the way I was doing it is taking it away I weren't really
checking what the figures were as long as them two figures matched
at the end of it. That's what I was doing I was making sure the

figures matched I weren't really counting the cash and stock”

cP “But you were making sure you were taking one figure away from

the other...

™ “yeh pull off a snap shot”

CP ...-but you actually had to inflate your cash to do it didn’t you?”

™ “Yeh sometimes yes there was figures that were high so I was
adding that amount on”

22:40 cP “To falsify your account to cover up a shortage you have to increase

your cash which is what you said you have been doing”

™ “That is what I was doing yeh”

cP “So you must be fully aware it was over £30,000 on Saturday

because last Wednesday you must have falsified your account for

over £30,000”
™ “Mmm mmh”
cP “So last Wednesday you must have known, yes?”
™ “Well yeh”
23:50 ™ Explains that his father had obtained a loan to help and put the
money back.
24:50 Following a discussion on when the loan was actually obtained TM

says that his father will not pay the money if the office does not stay
with them.

cP Explains that TM had worked in retail previously with no problems,
that there are only two error notices issued against his post office in
one year, that TM checks his vouchers before they are sent off and
that he himself agreed the system was fail proof. TM agrees and

CP adds that this would eliminate any errors.

cP Says that TM had lost £33,437.39 since March 2003 and asks TM if
he was expecting us to believe that he had given all this money to
customers.

“That's what I am saying that is all I know what more can I say”

“You can tell us what you have done with the money for a start”
“Well I can tell you that it has been losses I haven’t done nothing

with it why would I want to bite the hand that feeds me”

Explains reasons why some people may do it and TM says it was
none of them and that he has family to support him and he has no

reason to take the money.

Asks TM if he had actually balanced the office in the past twenty-
five months to which TM replied that he hadn’t and that he had
changed figures himself.

Says that in twenty-five months TM would not have known whether
he had had a gain in the accounts.

“It was stupid as well it was a stupid thing to do"

“No it's criminal”

“Yeh it is I agree with you”

Discussion reveals that TM has a BTEC national qualification in
Retail and Distribution and part of which is accounting but TM was

not fully verse with accounting.

Asks if this would make TM more verse in accounting than most

Subpostmasters and TM replied that he would say yes.

TM says that he was under pressure because of sleepless nights
with his children and the shortages happening.

Explains that he obtains a balance snap shot then subtracts the
figure from the previous days snap shop and uses that figure for his

daily cash.

™ “I would only check the cash when the rems come in I just count it to
make sure it’s there then put in into the safe”
31:10 ™ Says that he would never count the cash daily for his Overnight
Cash Holdings or on balance days
cP Introduces schedule of losses and gains for weeks 20 to 52 of 2003

and 2004 and asks TM to explain how he can have shown losses
and gains weekly if he was only taking one cash figure from another
to use in the balance of his account.

™ “I don’t know some weeks I did put it through as shortages and that
and that’s all I can explain I didn’t one or two weeks I probably
would have put it if I was short about eighty but I can’t I can’t

remember these things”

32:10 CP “But how would you know you were short by eighty if you did not
count your cash”
™ “Sometimes I did it was not all the time”
cP “You see sometimes you count your cash”
™ “Once or twice that's it”
cP “Once or twice right in the last year, two years once a month”

32:30 cP “So how often do you count your cash?”

period 2004 to 2005 and weeks 1 to 5 of 2005 to 2006 and explains
that there are more gains than losses shown in the balances and

TM says that he was not doing the job properly.

34:20 cP Asks TM why he would show a surplus of £438.65 in week 34, 17
November 2004 if he was short.
™ “I can’t remember, I can’t remember to be honest in this period my

head was all over the place I was just trying to find the shortest was
possible the quickest way possible of doing the balance and getting
out of the office”

34:50 MC. Asks why all the alterations were being made.

™ “Because when I found out that I was out I had shortages and that I
wanted to I didn’t know how to pay them back. You know there was
some stages where I had you know where I had you cause that’s
where I was lead to believe that I was £25,000 odd I didn’t know
how to pay it”

36:00 ™ Says he is aware of the post office rules and regulations concerning
losses and gains and explains the rules including that he would

have to make good the losses.

37:20 MC. “So you have already told us over two years you have been altering
your accounts”

™ “I know that yeh that’s that’s I mean that’s my stupidity I’ve done I’ve
been stupid I'll admit that you know I weren’t thinking straight and

you know it’s a lot of money to put back”

cP Asks what TM’s remuneration per month some 2 or 3 years previous
and TM replies but you have to look at all the bills and household
bills you have to pay, the remuneration of two and a half thousand.
Adding that the money does not stay with him he would just take out
what he needs and pass the remainder to the family, that he would
receive about two hundred. That Asian families work in a different

way and what ever money he earns goes to the head of the

household.

40:00 When asked TM said that he holds two bank accounts and that he
was willing to give authority for the banks to release details of those
accounts.

41:00 Discussion on what would happen if TM continued to have large

losses, about £1,500 per month and then asked what would happen
if he informed the post of these losses and said that he could not
make good the loss figure because he had no money.

™ “Like what you chaps are doing probably put me on to checks and
suspend my contract”

cP Asks what would happen if the amount was high and TM had
informed the post office he could not pay it back and TM says that
his contract would probably be terminated and that was what he was

fearing.

42:20 cP Recaps that TM has experience in accounting, in the post office
and there is a lack of error notices then asks who could believe this
as he had not told the post office, not reported the matter to the help
line, the RLM or the federation to say he might get in trouble or
asked them to help or advice.
