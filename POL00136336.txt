This supports what I always thought - if a SPMR gets to the end of the trading period and has a shortfall of less than
£150, they must make it good in order to roll over. They then contact NBSC to raise a complaint about the shortfall,
which is then investigated and, if appropriate, a TC is generated in a later TP creating an offsetting gain.

So in effect, for general branch losses under £150, it is "pay now, argue later". And if the SPMR is right to dispute,
then they get the money back later.

A similar system applies for TCs under £150 which cannot be resolved during the same trading period. The TC must
be accepted before roll over, thus creating a loss that must be made good (because it is for less than £150). The
SPMR can contact the named person on the TC (or NBSC who will put them in contact with the right person) to raise a
POL00136336
POL00136336

dispute. That may then generate a further offsetting TC if the dispute was found to be valid.
Correct?

Dave — please can you pick this up with Jonny re Alison's evidence.

Hi all

The info on the earlier question about the entry level for raising a dispute. Kath's view supports mine that
we would and do investigate losses less than £150.

I'll pick up with Alison Bolsover when she returns from leave to understand what documentation/policy she
is referencing.

Hi Angela

I have looked through the dispute process info I have and have also contacted Paul Smith from FSC -
see email chain below

e Essentially, the only reference to £150 that I (and Paul) are aware of is the ability to settle
centrally limit
POL00136336
POL00136336

e The attached Accounting Losses Policy (2003) refers to at Section 3 (extract below) £150
(community) and £400 (commercial) on authority to hold losses in suspense, but no reference

to being unable to dispute threshold and cant see this in a later version 2005/2006 (3°

attachment)

e Attachment - (dispute process) this was in 2008 (according to email that it was attached in
sent to Andy P from Andy W on 11/04/2013). The appeal process part doesn’t refer to £150

limit either

e SSRT has investigated less amounts <£150 and over the years in various roles I can’t ever
remember telling a Pmr that they could not dispute rather the opposite that we would support

Below is from Accounting Policy for Agency Branches (2003)
SECTION 3 - AUTHORITY TO HOLD LOSSES

Where authority is given, it will only be provided for the amount of loss discovered above a threshold amount (£150
for those in the community segment and £400 for those in the commercial segment) and providing that no other
losses are held in suspense at the time. A unique reference number will be allocated to any authority, which the

agent should note for audit purposes.

Hi Kath,

The only thing that I know of that is £150 related is the ability to settle centrally. Maybe the query is thinking about
the fact it can’t be settle centrally and blocked while disputed so the branch has to take the cash loss at the time.

Hi Paul

Thanks for helping, I have gone through these and what I had already and can’t so far see that there is anything that
mentions anything under £150 can’t be disputed? (which is a further query from AVB)

I was of the opinion (irrespective of the limit prior to settling centrally) that a loss below this threshold could be
investigated? I know we have in SSRT
POL00136336
POL00136336

I can see reference to limits of £150 & £400 in some older Losses Policy for authority to hold losses but nothing about
can’t be disputed

The attached from Andy Winn refers to the Appeal Process for a TC/BD —but doesn’t refer to a threshold being >£150
Would FSC block a debt and/or investigate for <£150?
