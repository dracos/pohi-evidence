ROYAL MAIL GROUP SECURITY - PROCEDURES & STANDARDS

REPORTING OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES TO POLICE P&S Doc. 1-X

1. PURPOSE.

The aim of this document is to provide Investigators within the Royal Mail
Group, with clear guidance concerning the required Procedures « Standards in
n to the above subject.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1 The development of the Phoenix National Criminal Justice Record Service
has enabled the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Disclosure
Group to design national standardised forms for the reporting of offences
and the results of prosecutions/cautions to Police Authorities.

2.2
The standard forms, which are designed for use by all Non Police
Prosecuting Agencies (NPAs), have been provided to all Security Managers
1. Form NPA 1 - Source Input Document for Phoenix
2. Form NPA 2 - Continuation Sheet for additional offences
3. Form NPA 3 - Notification of result of case
2.3

The Home Office has stipulated that in the interests of consistency each
N P A should have one central point of contact to whom the Police
Authorities will send details of previous convictions. That role is
undertaken by the Royal Mail Letters Security, Intelligence Transactions
team (RMLSIT) at Battersea SDO, Floor 2A, 202 Lavender Hill, London, SW11
1AA, and all Police Authorities in England and Wales have been notified
accordingly.

3. REPORTING PROCESS

3.1 During the course of a suspect interview, investigators should complete
the offender details on side 1 of form NPAl, (Name, sex, DOB, etc.) and
all of side 2, which deals with identification details of the suspect.
Form GS033 (Antecedent history) should also be completed and placed in
the case papers for the attention of Legal Services. (An aide memoir on
completing NPA forms is associated at pages 4 to 6.)

* In cases of arrest and subsequent charge of a suspect, investigators
will complete the Police Source Input Documents and the Police will
process the information for inputting to the Police National
Computer. Investigators should ensure that photographs and
fingerprints are taken at this time. If the case is then prosecuted
by Royal Mail Group (including Post Office Limited), investigators
should submit the NPA forms or copies of the Police Source Input
Documents in accordance with their particular BU processes.

* If the person has not been in police detention, the remainder of Side
1 of form NPA1 should be completed once the application has been made
for summonses or authority is given for the offender to be cautioned.
(From Prosecuting Agents downwards) It is important to remember that
any additional offences charged must be listed separately on form
NPA2's. (Offences "Taken to Consideration" (TICs) should not be
entered onto form NPA2's.) The completed NPA1 form (and NPA2's where
necessary) should be submitted to at this time, to enable a criminal

record to be created or updated.

* Copies of the NPA documentation should also be placed into the case
file.

it has been decided to prosecute, the relevant office, on receipt
of Form NPAl, will write to the local Police using Typist Draft Letter
GS040A, requesting that arrangements are made for photographs and
fingerprints to be taken after conviction (not after sentence).

On conviction, Legal Services will notify the relevant office.

After any subsequent conviction the relevant office will write to the
local Police using typist Draft GS040B in order that the Police can carry
out the request under Section 27 of PACE, which allows for the compulsory
taking of photographs and fingerprints within one month of conviction
provided the offender has not at any stage been in Police detention. This
must be done following conviction and not sentence, which may be up to 4
weeks after conviction.

When sentence has been passed, Legal Services will notify the
Investigator and the relevant office of the outcome. The relevant office
will report the result to the relevant Police Authority by means of form
NPA 3.

4. GUIDE TO NPA FORMS

4.1 Due to the requirements of the Police Forces and the necessity to report
a summons being served or formal caution being administered within 24
hours of the event, it is mandatory that form NPA1 is completed in all
cases and that Security Managers follow the guidelines to NPA form

4.2 completion below.

This guide has been produced to assist you in the completion of forms
NPA1 & NPA2. It is essential that this guide is followed and the forms

4.3 completed correctly as failure to do so will result in them being
returned to you.
