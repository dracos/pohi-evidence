POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN SCOTT

|, John Scott, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | was employed by the Post Office Ltd (“POL”) and other Royal Mail Group

(“RMG”) organisations from February 1993 to September 2016.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 12 April

2023 (the “Request’).

3. | have addressed the questions put to me by the Inquiry honestly and to the
best of my ability, based on my memory of events. However, | wish to highlight
that many of the events which | have been asked to comment on took place
some ten or more years ago and, due to this passage of time, it has been
difficult for me to recall certain events and information. Similarly, some of the
matters that | have been asked to comment on are outside my personal

Page 1 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

knowledge. Where | am unable to recall something or consider it is outside

my knowledge | have indicated this.

4. Please note that | use the term “Network” throughout this statement to
describe the various individuals and systems at POL which are responsible
for the overall management and operation of Sub Post Offices, Branch Offices
and Franchises (i.e. Branches within retail outlets such as The Co-Op and

McColl’s).

BACKGROUND

5. | have a MSc in Security & Risk Management focusing on preventive security
and criminology. | also have other supporting industry qualifications such as

a Diploma in Anti-Money Laundering.

6. From February 1993 until September 2016 | was employed by Post Office
Corporate Centre, Royal Mail Letters and ultimately POL, which separated

from RMG in 2012.

7. | assumed the role of POL Head of Security in 2007, and | held this position
until | left the organisation in 2016. Prior to 2007, | had held various roles

within RMG Security Teams, which | have outlined below:

1) Assistant Investigation Officer (1993-1995);

2) Temporary Investigation Officer (1995);

Page 2 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

3) Royal Mail Security Team Manager (1996-1998);

4) Reorganisation Project Manager (for Post Office Security and
Investigations Services and Royal Mail Security) (1998-1999);

5) Head of Security for Royal Mail International (1999-2004); and

6) POL Senior Security Manager for Physical Security (2004- 2007).

8. Cost reductions were a constant and increasing priority throughout the period
of my employment and the business was restructured many times throughout
my career in an effort to drive down cost. One such restructure in 2006 led to
the formation of a centralised Security department within POL; prior to this,
the security functions had operated under various other departments. Upon
assuming my role as Head of Security in 2007, | organised this centralised
team into core “strands”, each with responsibility and conduct over a particular
security discipline. Some strands evolved or were amalgamated over time,

but broadly, the strands were as follows:

1) Risk (Analysis and Intelligence) strand.
2) Commercial Security strand.

3) Asset Security strand.

4) Physical Security Operations strand.

5) Fraud strand.

9. The Risk strand dealt with security events such as burglary, robbery, kidnap,
and internal and external fraud providing data, intelligence and statistical

analysis.

Page 3 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

10. The Commercial Security strand dealt with policy standards and procedures
for POL products and services such as mail, telephony, government, mails

and financial services, with a view to preventing fraud and money laundering.

11. The Asset Security strand was responsible for defining the policies, standards
and procedures for buildings, vehicles, equipment and people in respect of

physical attacks (such as burglary, robbery and kidnapping).

12.The Physical Security Operations strand was an operational team, which
engaged with Post Offices and Cash Centres across the UK. Amongst other
things, this team provided advice on, and responded to, incidents of burglary,

robbery and kidnapping at POL sites.

13.The Fraud strand was a nationwide operational team responsible for
conducting investigations into alleged criminal offences such as theft, fraud
and false accounting in respect of Post Offices, Cash Centres, Cash in Transit
vehicles and corporate matters (such as travelling expenses). The Financial
Investigations team, which dealt with the recovery of assets, sat within this
team, as did the Fraud Prevention team, which was responsible for conducting
analysis, supported by the Risk Strand, to develop loss and fraud preventative
measures occurring in various areas (for example, postage label fraud). The
former was in existence prior to my taking over the team, while the latter was

set up after my arrival in 2007.

Page 4 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

14.Around 2011, | merged the Fraud and Physical Security Operations strands
to create the “Security Operations” strand. This decision was made as part of
the effort to drive financial efficiency in line with POL’s aforementioned cost-
saving agenda, and to create a strand which would be multi-skilled thereby

increasing flexibility and resource capability.

15. From 2009 to 2012, the Information Security Team - which previously had
been operating under the IT department - was transferred to the Security
Team becoming an additional core strand. This team was responsible for
information security policies, standards and procedures in relation to systems

and data access, and for providing related advisory services to POL.

16. Each strand was led by a Senior Security Manager, who was colloquially
referred to within POL and their teams as the “head of’ their relevant team. |
note that the Inquiry has asked me to provide an overview of my role as “Head
of Commercial Fraud”, and | believe this is likely to be a reference to the
Senior Security Manager in the Commercial Security strand. This is not a role

that | have ever held.

17.As Head of Security, | was the principal manager of all the strands. However,
in general, | had little to no involvement in their day-to-day operations; | dealt
with things at a corporate and organisational level. | have not sought to lay out
every element of the job in this statement, but | have below provided a broad
overview of what my responsibilities and key priorities were. This information

provides context to later paragraphs, where | have responded to specific

Page 5 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

questions the Inquiry has asked in respect of my role and my involvement in

investigations and prosecutions.

18.The Fraud team had been in place since 1999. | was informed by my
predecessor, Tony Marsh, that the Fraud Team was well established, that the
investigative framework was effective and running well, and that the
investigators were proficient in their role and able to effectively organise and
run investigations. That was also my experience. The team also worked
directly with the Legal function which provided advice and direction on many
aspects of their work. | had one-to-one meetings with the “heads of” all the
strands monthly and no issues were ever flagged to me in respect of the Fraud
team and the operation of criminal investigations. | was not involved in
carrying out or overseeing criminal investigations on a day-to-day basis and
an investigation was only ever flagged to me on rare occasions where it was
of a particularly serious or sensitive nature. Even when a matter was
escalated to me, | would not have had operational input into the investigation
itself; my role was primarily one of management and only occasionally one of
oversight in respect of specific investigations. To a large extent the Fraud

team ran itself with only a need for minimal input from me as overall manager.

19.My remit in respect of investigations did slightly change towards the end of
2013 when | was asked by my line manager at the time, POL General
Counsel, Susan Crichton, to review and sign off on any new investigation files
in respect of their progression to prosecution. | recall that she made this

request verbally and | do not recall what reason she gave. | agreed and took

Page 6 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

on the role of reviewing and signing off on any new prosecutions sometime
between mid to late 2013. In practice this required me to review those cases
that the Legal Team had determined met the standard for prosecution. | do
not recall the numbers or details of any of these cases but think it likely that |
would have approved the recommendation of the Legal Team in most or all of
these cases. This is subject to the important qualification that at this time, and
until | left POL in 2016, no prosecutions of new cases were proceeding
because it had been deemed necessary to identify a new subject matter

expert to give assurance on the Horizon system for court proceedings.

20.In my role as Head of Security there were a range of serious issues that
required my attention. One area which was a particular priority for me was

physical threats against Sub Postmasters (“SPMs”), and POL employees.

21.As noted, | held the role of Head of Physical Security Operations from 2004
and at this time POL experienced around 1000 plus incidents a year including
burglaries, robberies and kidnappings. | managed to successfully put in place
measures to reduce this number, but many attacks continued to take place.
As POL Head of Security, the most serious of these incidents would be
reported up to me. | would immediately become the operational lead upon
notification and was required to assemble my team to respond to events in

real time.

22.1 recall one such event following a robbery at a Post Office which had tragically

resulted in the murder of the son of the SPM. This event led to an intense

Page 7 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

flurry of action over a period of several weeks, where | was co-ordinating my
team to support the police investigation, supporting those who were directly
responsible for providing support to the deceased's family, and managing the
flow of information to the relevant parts of the business, including to its parent
RMG senior executives. The latter responsibility entailed writing reports on a
daily basis, which | continued to do for a period of two to three months after
the event. | recall that | also dealt with numerous kidnappings during my
tenure, which often occurred at night and continued through to the next day.
False alerts were also not unusual. All these events took up a significant

amount of my time, attention, and resource when they occurred.

23.Physical threats by their nature would materialise suddenly and require an
immediate response, as indicated above. More consistent however was the
project management work | undertook as part of my role. There were
numerous large projects being undertaken across the strands which | often
set up and led on, and which often ran for several years. For example, | was
heavily involved in the payment card industry data security standards
(“PCIDSS”) project, which was set up under the Information Security strand. |
was also involved in a project which centred on the money laundering

regulations.

24.On assuming the role as Head of Security, | brought with me a personal
interest in information gathering and data/intelligence analysis to identify and
drive down losses. | had developed this in my previous role. | therefore was

keen to drive the compilation and analysis of POL information data

Page 8 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

(‘Management Information” or “MI”) across the security business in respect of
both crime and non-crime related losses. My ethos was one of loss prevention
rather than merely reacting to loss. Therefore, in addition to the projects
mentioned above, | set up and oversaw various loss reduction projects. This
includes the Loss Reduction Programme which | discuss at paragraphs 56 to
58. During the course of these projects, data would be gathered from various
systems and products to help to identify where losses were occurring. Manual
analysis would then be conducted in respect of the biggest and most repetitive
losses identified across POL sites, whether Crowns, Sub Post Offices or
Franchise Offices, so that solutions and controls could be developed and put
in place. Over the course of 2 to 3 years, analysis was conducted on around
15 to 20 products and services to identify how the losses were being created.
This analysis was conducted by the Risk Strand and supported by the Fraud

Prevention Team.

25.This manual approach to data collection required a good deal of resources
and management given the size of POL’s Network, which is why | suggested
that POL acquire a digital solution. | subsequently commissioned (supported
by Susan Crichton, POL General Counsel) Detica, a subsidiary of BAE
Systems Plc, to conduct an initial review of POL’s systems with a loss and
fraud digitalisation goal in mind. Following its review, Detica advised that data
mapping of all POL’s systems would be required to obtain a proper
understanding of data management. POL subsequently put out a tender for
companies to carry out this process, which Detica won. Detica carried out the

data mapping and published its final report in 2013, making various

Page 9 of 58
WITN08390100

WITN08390100

recommendations in respect of POL processes and systems. | have not
reviewed that report in preparing this statement and do not recall these
recommendations in detail. | do recall that | worked with Detica to draw up a
business case for implementing these recommendations. Detica estimated
that the cost of the proposal would be between £3m and £5m. | discussed the
case with the Chief Financial Officer who deferred the decision to the
Programme Director for the Branch Support Programme at the time - Angela
van den Bogerd. Angela van den Bogerd ultimately elected to go with a less
expensive alternative solution provided by Fujitsu. | had no part in this

decision.

26. To summarise, my role as Head of Security was a multifaceted one which,

amongst other things, required me to manage sensitive and demanding

situations, travel frequently, and oversee various large and complex projects.

ROLE OF THE SECURITY TEAM AND THE POLICIES / PRACTICES IN PLACE

RELATING TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION

27.1 have been asked by the Inquiry to comment on the role of the Security Team
and the policies and practices in place in respect of criminal investigations and

prosecutions at POL. Broadly, | have been asked to comment on:

1) the rationale for, and history of, bringing private prosecutions at RUG
and POL;

2) policies and processes governing the conduct of criminal

Page 10 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

investigations;
3) policies and processes governing audits and suspensions; and
4) policies and processes on prosecutions and criminal enforcement

proceedings.

| have addressed the specific questions raised by the Inquiry in each of these

areas below.

1. The rationale for, and history of, bringing private prosecutions at RMG

and POL

28.1 am reminded by document LCAS0000124 that RMG had a long history of
carrying out its own investigations and bringing private prosecutions. | do not
have any particular recollection of the rationale for this and had no particular
view about it. It was the position when | took up my role and continued to be

throughout my tenure.

29.As noted previously, POL separated from RMG in April 2012. | recall that at
some point before this separation | asked my line manager, Susan Crichton,
whether POL would continue to bring private prosecutions as an independent
entity, or whether | should plan to close down that side of my team. | raised
this query so that | could organise and resource my team accordingly ahead
of the separation. | understood, | think from Susan, that she took the query to
the board of directors who determined that prosecutions would continue at

POL post-April 2012.

Page 11 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

30.POL still had a policy of bringing private prosecutions when | left the
organisation in 2016, subject to a new Horizon subject matter expert being
identified. As far as | can recall, no new prosecutions were commenced from

July 2013 as a new subject matter expert was not in place.

2. Policies and processes governing the conduct of criminal investigations

General policies

31.1 have been asked to consider the following policies, and to explain my role in
their development: POL00030578, POL00104812, POL00104806,
POL00031004, POL00031003, POL00030580, POL00030579,
POL00026573, POL00104857, POL00031008, POL00104853,
POL00104855, POL00030786, POL00104929, POL00105226,

POL00030602, POL00031005, POL00027863 and POL00030902.

32. | do not recall these policies and | had no role in their development, though |

probably would have seen some of them while | was at POL.

33.1 note that some of the policies listed are RMG documents. Until 2012, all
RMG policies directly applied to POL as a subsidiary. These would therefore

have been written and developed by RMG.

34. | also note that some of the policies list me as the owner or as someone who

Page 12 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

has assured them, for example, POL00030578 and POL00030580. To
reiterate, | do not recall these documents and | am unable to comment as to

why | am listed as an assurer or an owner.

Organisation and structure of the Security Team

35. The Inquiry has asked that | comment on the organisation and structure of the
Security Team, and any significant changes made during my time as Head of
Security. | have provided general commentary on this at paragraphs 8 to 16

above but will elaborate further here.

36.As outlined, | inherited the Security Team in 2007 and restructured it into
strands, each strand with a separate function and set of responsibilities and
disciplines. There were no major changes to this general structure, save for
the aforementioned reassignment of the Information Security strand (in 2009
to 2012), and the merging of the Fraud and Physical Security Operations

strands.

37. From 2007 until approximately 2010 or 2011, | reported into the Director of
Operations, a role held respectively during that period by Ric Francis, Dave
Smith (temporarily, for about three months) and finally Mike Young. In 2010
or 2011, | began reporting into POL’s General Counsel instead. Susan
Crichton was General Counsel from around 2010 or 2011 until 2013. She was
succeeded by Chris Aujard in 2013, and then by Jane McCloud who assumed

the role in 2015.

Page 13 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

38.Whilst part of RMG, the Head of Security role had a “dotted line” reporting into
the RMG Group Security Director. From 2007 to about 2008, | reported to
Andrew Wilson and thereafter his successor Tony Marsh who was my

predecessor as Head of Security POL. This naturally ceased at separation.

39. The management structure of each strand varied slightly from strand to strand
but, as a rule, each team was led by a Senior Security Manager (or “head of’),
who reported up to me, with at least one other senior manager underneath.
All operational team members were middle managers or above. As previously
mentioned, | had one-to-one monthly meetings with the head of each strand,
during which they could raise any issues or concerns. | do not recall that any
issues in respect of the integrity of investigations or investigator's capability

were ever flagged to me, as explained earlier.

40.The Fraud strand, which from around 2011 merged with Physical Security
Operations strand to become the Security Operations strand, was the strand
responsible for carrying out criminal investigations. The team was led by a
Senior Security Manager who went under different informal titles during the
period in which | was Head of Security. They were colloquially known as the
“head of’ whatever the team was called at any given time. This role was held
by Tony Utting on a long term basis until 2007. Tony was succeeded by Dave
Pardoe, followed by lain Murphy (2010/2011), Rob King (2011/2012) and
finally Amy Quirk (2015) who was still in the role when | left POL in 2016. An

individual called David Pettit may also have performed this role for a short

Page 14 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

period. This Senior Security Manager was supported by another senior
manager and team leaders, who the investigators reported up to. There was

no direct reporting line from the investigators up to me.

The operation of investigations

41.1 have been asked numerous questions pertaining to the operation of

investigations during my tenure at POL, specifically with regards to:

i. who within the investigation team determined how a criminal
investigation would be conducted;
ii. the role and involvement of the Financial Investigation Unit (“FIU”);
iii. the role and involvement of other teams in the process;
iv. what legislation, policies, guidance and / or principles governed the
conduct of investigations and how this changed;
v. the process for dealing with complaints about conduct of an
investigation;
vi. the supervision conducted over investigations by Security Managers;
vii. | POL’s approach to suspected fraud and combatting fraud; and
viii. | any differences in, and changes to, the policy and practice regarding

the practice of Crown Office employees.

42.| have addressed these questions as far as | can in the paragraphs that follow,
but as explained above, | was not involved in the day-to-day operations of any

of the strands, including the Fraud/Security Operations strand. | would only

Page 15 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

have had awareness of specific cases on the rare occasions on which they
were escalated to me. Likewise, | only had and have limited knowledge on the

mechanics of an investigation.

43. The Fraud strand senior management and team leaders were responsible for
the conduct of the investigations along with the investigators. As explained at
paragraph 18, | was told by my predecessor that the investigators in the team
were experienced and | understood that they were well versed in investigative
processes. | therefore assume that it would have been the investigators
themselves who would decide how a criminal investigation would be

conducted, applying the relevant policies as appropriate.

44. In terms of the FIU, this was a subgroup that always sat within the Fraud
strand, including before it became part of the new structure in 2007. | did not
set up the FIU; the team was already established when | assumed my role as
Head of Security. This team was comprised of qualified financial investigators
with various powers under the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002, who were
trained, assessed and qualified by the police service. | understand that the
police provided supervision and oversight of their activities although | am not
certain on what basis. | am not able to comment on the specific circumstances

and process for engaging the FIU in an investigation.

45.From my knowledge | can say that the Fraud/Security Operations strand was
free to call upon any other team to assist with their investigation, including the

Legal Team (as explained further later in this statement), other operational

Page 16 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

teams and MI teams. They could also access external vendors such as
Fujitsu, Camelot and the ATM providers. The investigators would have had

constant engagement with wider teams in POL.

46.With regards to the legislation, policies, guidance and / or principles governed
the conduct of investigations, | have a general awareness of the application
of certain criminal legislation to criminal investigations. | am aware that such
legislation applied to POL investigations subject to their respective jurisdiction
(ie. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). As with all law
related matters, the Legal Team would have been expected to provide
guidance and direction as required. In terms of applicable policies and
guidance, | have read the various RMG and POL policies which governed
POL investigations but | cannot recall seeing these documents before (though
| may well have done) and | have no detailed knowledge of how investigation
procedures were implemented. Similarly, | am not able to comment on any
changes in respect of any relevant policies, guidance or principles; | was not

involved in any such changes.

47. In terms of complaints, | would have been aware that there was a complaints
process for investigations in place at POL and | have seen POL00104893 in
the Inquiry document bundle which details how to deal with complaints from
suspects. However, | do not recall this document and was not involved in
dealing with complaints generally, except on rare occasions when they were

escalated to me.

Page 17 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

48.In terms of the supervision of criminal investigations, investigators were
managed and supervised by team leaders, who in turn were supervised by
the senior managers. | would have expected any issues that required my
attention or involvement to have been escalated to me. My recollection is that

this happened infrequently.

49.Turning to explain POL’s approach to suspected fraud and the responsibilities
of the Security Team in combatting fraud, when | took up the role of Head of
Security in 2007, there was a strong pro-prosecution stance in respect of
losses resulting from fraud. As outlined at paragraph 24 above, | stepped into
the role with a more holistic view and agenda for dealing with losses generally,
and aimed to promote a broader strategy for the Security Team which would
focus more on prevention. The approach to combatting fraud was therefore
twofold; to investigate and prosecute fraud where appropriate in line with the
policy requirement, but also to look for ways to identify and prevent fraud

through other means.

50.On the preventative side, | had established the previously mentioned Fraud
Prevention team within the Fraud/Security Operations strand who were
helping to drive data analysis of root causes in respect of fraud and losses,
and to formulate controls to prevent loss and fraud. On the prosecutorial side,
namely where fraud was suspected, the investigators within the
Fraud/Security Operations strand would investigate and progress the case
accordingly. The FIU might feed into the prosecutorial approach, but as

mentioned above, | do not know the specific circumstances in which they

Page 18 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

would be engaged in an investigation, or triggers to their involvement.

51.Finally, with regards to investigations concerning Crown Office employees; as
far as | am aware, there was no distinction drawn between Crown Office
employees and SPMs in terms of the policies and practices regarding

investigation.

Specific policies

52.The Inquiry has asked me to specifically consider POLO0104900 and to
comment on the impact that the separation of POL from RMG had on the
criminal investigations policy within POL. | am not aware of any significant
impact; POL of course adopted its own policies, though as far as | am aware
these largely reflected the previous RMG policies and prosecutions continued

as they had before.

53.Similarly, | have been asked to comment on the rationale behind the
development of a Post Office specific “Conduct of Criminal Investigations
Policy” in 2013 (which | understand is a reference to POL00094143) and to
advise whether the draft “Post Office Fraud and Loss Prevention Policy” from
2013 at POL00038603, was ever finalised or approved. | do not recall seeing
these policies before. | am not aware of the rationale for the development of
POL00094143 and | do not recall making any contribution to it. | note that |
am listed as having reviewed and signed off on POL00038603 and | am not

sure why that is the case. | do not know if this policy was ever finalised or

Page 19 of 58
WITN08390100

WITN08390100

approved.

54.1 have also been asked to consider the document entitled “Security Team
Objectives 2013 — 2014” dated April 2013 at POL00105025. In particular, |
have been asked to explain what the Loss Reduction Board and the related
Loss Reduction Programme were, when they were set up, and what their

purpose was.

55.POL00105025 sets out the objectives of every member of the Security Team
for 2013-2014. | recall that this document was produced ahead of one of our
annual POL Security Team conferences. The conference was a two-day event
for the entire Security Team, during which we discussed the objectives for the
next 12 months, heard from various strands about the specific work they had
been doing, and engaged in team building activities. | do not know why
POL00105025 was produced but | think it must have been to provide visibility
of the objectives across the strands. | do not believe such a document was

ever produced again, although everyone had objectives set each year.

56. | can see that the Loss Reduction Programme and Loss Reduction Board are
referred to under my objectives. | can confirm that | was responsible for driving

and overseeing both of these areas.

57.POL’s loss ledger included losses from across the entire business, including
criminal losses such as fraud, burglary, robbery and kidnapping and non-

crime related losses. The Loss Reduction Programme was a project centred

Page 20 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

on driving down the non-crime related losses on the ledger. The purpose of
the Loss Reduction Board was to oversee the programme and to consider

how to deal with the losses. Crime related losses were dealt with separately.

58.1 am not exactly sure when this programme was set up, but | think that it was
some time in 2013. | recall that | set up monthly meetings for the Loss
Reduction Board which | chaired, and that | assigned Tony Newman, a Senior
Manager from the Commercial Security strand, as the project lead. He was

responsible for liaising with the relevant stakeholders on the project.

3. Policies and processes governing audits and suspensions

Audits

59.The Inquiry has asked me to address various questions about audits,
including their relevance to, and impact on, prosecutions. These questions

require me to comment on:

i. the circumstances in which an auditor would be sent to conduct an
audit at a Post Office Branch;
ii. the circumstances around an investigator’s attendance at, and role in,
Branch audits;
iii. how short falls identified as part of an audit were dealt with;
iv. cash verification exercises; and

v. _ the process followed by Security Team investigators when conducting

Page 21 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

a criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an

audit.

60.My insight into the audit process is limited, as the Audit team was a wholly
separate team to the Security Team during my tenure. | am therefore unable
to explain the specific circumstances in which an auditor would be sent to
conduct a Branch audit. The Security Team could instigate an audit as they
so desired and there were probably a range of circumstances which might
trigger this course of action. For example, where an outlier was spotted as a
result of analysis that the team had carried out, or where an issue was raised

.In respect of the circumstances around an investigator's attendance at, and
role in, Branch audits | have been referred to POL00084813. This is a guide
on audit attendance and it is not a document that | recognise and is most likely
an Audit team document. | would think that the terms of any audit attendance
would be organised by the investigator and / or team leader / management of

the Fraud/Security Operations strand with the relevant auditor.

62.1 have been asked several questions in respect of shortfalls identified during
an audit. First, | have been asked to advise who the auditor would report
shortfalls or discrepancies to. | am unable to comment on this; | have no
awareness of the what the Audit team’s notification or escalation processes

were.

Page 22 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

63.Secondly, | have been asked to explain what and who determined whether an
investigation into potential criminality was conducted by the Security Team
where a shortfall was identified, or whether the case was taken forwards as a
debt recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre and / or the relevant
Legal Team. | have also been asked to explain whether this process changed
during my tenure. | recall that as a general rule, it would be the Network
managers (a Branch manager, for example) who would request the
assistance of the Security Team. They may have had criteria to meet in order
to trigger an investigation, but | have no knowledge of this. If the investigator
had requested the audit, then the investigator would be involved in the
decision to investigate. | am not aware of any change to this process

throughout my tenure.

64. Thirdly, | have been asked whether the SPM'’s local contract manager would
have had any input into the decision to investigate where a shortfall was
identified following an audit, and whether this changed during my tenure. As
explained above, Network managers did have input into the decision-making
process, as they were the persons who decided to report to the Security Team

or not. | am not aware of any changes being imposed.

65. Finally, | have been asked what the triggers / criteria were for raising a fraud
case following the identification of a shortfall / discrepancy ina SPM’s Branch,
whether the triggers / criteria for raising a theft or false accounting case were
different and if so what were they, and whether this changed during my tenure.

| have been referred to Appendix 1 of POL00104825 as a document aid. | can

Page 23 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

see from this document that there were triggers / criteria for raising a fraud
case and | do not believe there would have been different triggers for raising
a theft or false accounting case. However, this is not within my knowledge and

| cannot confirm.

66.1 note that the Inquiry has specifically highlighted that by February 2013 there
was a set process/order of steps for Security Team investigators to follow, as
per POL00105223, and it has asked me to comment on how the process was
different prior to this date. | cannot recall this document; however, | do not

recall any significant changes to this process being escalated.

67.In respect of cash verification exercises, | have been asked to consider
POL00104825, which is a memo to the Security Team dated 15 December
2009. Specifically, | have been asked to explain the rationale for conducting
cash verification exercises in all Branches “(except Crowns)” ahead of the
migration to Horizon online, and to explain the impact of this requirement and
the migration to Horizon online more broadly on the work of the Fraud strand.
| do not recall this memo and | do not know whether | have seen it before.

However, | can understand its contents and | am therefore able to comment

on it.

68.The memo refers to a one-off programme of audit visits which were to take
place ahead of the transition from Horizon Legacy (Horizon Version 1) to
Horizon Online (Horizon Version 2). As part of the transition programme, it

was decided that, upon transfer, every office would go through a cash and

Page 24 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

stock verification exercise. | do not recall that the Crown Offices were not

included. | do not know why that was the case.

69.The rationale for conducting these audits was to ensure that any
discrepancies in the old system (Horizon Version 1) were addressed and not
carried through to the new system. | cannot specifically recall what the impact
of these audits was, nor can | recall the impact of the migration on the work of
the Security Team generally. As suggested by the memo, a possible spike in
the number of frauds uncovered was expected upon migration to Horizon

Online. | do not recall whether this spike did in fact materialise.

70.1 have also been asked to consider Appendix 2 within POL00104825, in
respect of the aforementioned cash verification exercise, which sets out three
levels of security officers. The Inquiry has asked me to advise whether the
requirement for cash verifications to be carried out at all non-Crown Branches
impacted upon the decision making around what level of officer should be
involved in potential fraud investigations. All investigations were led by, what
is defined within this document as, a level 1 competent investigator regardless

of Branch type or investigation type.

Suspensions

71. In respect of suspensions, | have been asked to comment on how decisions
about suspensions were linked to decisions about whether or not to raise a

fraud case. | have also been asked to consider and to explain the Security

Page 25 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

Team's role in suspension decisions where a shortfall was identified by an
audit, and whether the decision-making around suspensions differed as

between Crown Office employees and SPMs.

72.1 am not aware of a connection between a suspension and a decision to raise
fraud case. Any decisions around suspensions were considered in their own
right and the Security Team had no role in making them. The POL Network
would decide whether they wanted to suspend an individual or not. There
were times when investigators effected suspensions based on the decision of
the relevant Network manager and line management after investigation
findings were fed back to them, but investigators were never involved in the
suspension decision itself. It follows that | cannot comment on any differences
in the decision-making process with regards to Crown Office employees and
SPMs as the Network would make these decisions. | have considered
POL00104809 and POL00105231 which the Inquiry has highlighted as
relevant to the issue of suspensions. | do not recall seeing these documents

before and they do not affect the answer | have given.

4. Policies and processes relating to prosecutions

Prosecution policies

73.The Inquiry has asked me to consider the following policies and explain my
role in their development: POL00030659; POL00030800; POL00031011;

POL00030580; POL00031008 (in particular, paragraph 3.2.9);

Page 26 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

POL00030598; POL00030685; POL00031034; POL00104929;
POL00105226; POL00030602; POL00030686; and POL00030811. | do not
recall these policies and had no role in their development, including those that
list me as an owner or assurer, such as POL00030580. Any policies on
prosecution would have been decided by RMG prior to separation, and post

separation by the POL Board and the Legal Team.

74.1 have also been asked to describe POL’s prosecution policy, the rationale
behind it, its aims and any way in which is changed during my time at POL. |
have already provided commentary on this as far as | am able to, at

paragraphs 28 to 30, and 49 to 50 above.

Decision making

75.1 have been asked to explain who decided whether a SPM or Crown Office
employee should be prosecuted by POL, and what considerations determined

whether a prosecution was brought.

76.Until 2013, prosecution decisions were signed off by the head of the
Fraud/Security Operations strand. Investigators and their managers had an
open line of communication with the RMG or POL Legal Team, who would
provide the direction on prosecutions. | took over the “sign off’ function in mid
to late 2013. The process | adopted in assuming this decision maker role was
to review and consider the entire investigation file, including any notes or

advice from the POL Legal Team. As previously mentioned, | recall that | did

Page 27 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

authorise a number of prosecutions, however | do not recall any being

progressed as a new subject matter expert had not been identified.

77.The Inquiry has also asked whether the SPMs' local contract manager would
have any input into this decision-making process and whether this changed
during the period | work at POL. In addition, it has asked me to explain the

test for prosecution and public interest applied to cases.

78.1 do not know to what extent the local contract manager had any input into the
decision-making process, although | would have expected that there would
have been informal discussion between the investigator and the Branch. In
terms of the test for prosecution and public interest, this is something the Legal
Team would have provided advice on. | have seen the test mentioned in the
documentation provided by the Inquiry which would have provided the

direction of decision making at the time.

79.1 note that the Inquiry has requested my insight on what advice, legal or
otherwise, was provided to those making decisions about whether to
prosecute a SPM or Crown Office employee, whether legal advice was
provided internally or externally, and whether a particular approach applied to

cases where a shortfall was identified on audit.

80.As previously stated, all advice and direction on prosecutions decisions was
provided by RMG or POL’s lawyers, with whom the investigators and their
managers had an open line of communication. In addition, the team was able

to liaise with POL’s external lawyers in respect of advice on prosecutions. |

Page 28 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

am not aware of an alternative approach being applied to cases where a
shortfall was found during audit, but | cannot really comment because | was

not involved in dealing with audits.

81.The above only describes the position in England and Wales. My
understanding is that in Scotland the decision to prosecute was taken by the
Procurator Fiscal, and in Northern Ireland by the Public Prosecution Service,
in both cases, on the basis of their review of the evidence presented to them

by the POL investigators.

Financial Restraint and Confiscation

82. The Inquiry has asked me to explain in what circumstances steps to restrain
a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods, such as confiscation
proceedings, would be considered. More generally, it has asked who decided
whether such proceedings should be pursued and what factors they

considered in making such a decision.

83.1 am unable to answer either of these questions as | would not have had any
involvement in this process or decisions, although policies were in place. Any
decisions on criminal enforcement methods would be dealt with by the FIU
with their senior managers with direction and advice from RMG or POL’s

lawyers.

WITN08390100
WITN08390100

TRAINING, INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE TO INVESTIGATORS WITHIN THE

SECURITY TEAM

84. With respect to training and guidance given to investigators | have been

asked to provide information on:

1) training, qualifications and / or experience required for an investigator

within the Security Team to be able to conduct investigations where a

SPM / SPM’s assistant / Crown Office employee was suspected of a

criminal offence and whether these requirements changed;

2) documentation, instructions, guidance and / or training given to

investigators within the Security Team in respect of:

vi.

vii.

viii.

interviewing a SPM / SPM’s assistant / Crown Office employee

who was suspected of a criminal offence;

. taking witness statements in the course of an investigation;

conducting searches in the course of an investigation;

the duty of an investigation to investigate a case fully;

obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation;

whether, and in what circumstances, evidence should be sought
from third parties who might hold relevant evidence and, in
particular, Fujitsu, where shortfalls were identified in Branch;
an investigator's disclosure obligations; and

drafting investigation reports to enable a decision to be made

Page 30 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

about the future conduct of a case.

85.In considering the training, qualifications and / or experience required for an
investigator within the Security Team to be able to conduct investigations
where a SPM/ SPM’s assistant / Crown Office employee was suspected of a
criminal offence (and whether these requirements changed) | have been
directed to consider the following documents: Appendix 2 of POL00104825,
POL00104805, POL00104932, POL00104944, POL00104945,
POL00104948, POL00104953, POL00104952, POL00104986,

POL00104989, POL00105002, POL00105008 and POL00105099.

86.1 do not recall these documents, though | may have seen some of them when
| worked for POL. | have a general understanding of the training, qualifications
and experience required for the role of a POL investigator based on my own
knowledge. These requirements would have been set and assessed by the
RMG, and then later by POL Security Operations senior management.
Similarly, where new investigators were being recruited — although | was not
involved in the process apart from for senior managers - my messaging to the
team was that they should look to hire individuals with a police or law
enforcement background which would be an advantage, on account of the
skills and experience those individuals would bring. | do not recall being
informed of any changes in respect of the training, skills and experience

required of investigators.

87. Similarly, | am unable to comment on any instructions, guidance and / or

Page 31 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

training given to investigators within the Security Team in respect of the areas
listed at (i) to (viii) above. | note that the Inquiry has provided various policies
in relation to each of the areas, asking whether these documents were
provided to investigators and for a summary of the key points in each. For
brevity | do not cite all these documents here, but they have been included in
the Index to this statement. Nevertheless, as before, | do not recall these
documents; | do not know if or how they were provided to the investigators,
however | would expect the Fraud strand senior management to have

provided them.

ANALYSING HORIZON DATA AND REQUESTING ARQ DATA FROM FUJITSU

88. The Inquiry has asked me to answer a range of questions in respect of:

1) my knowledge on Horizon data; and

2) ARQ requests.

1. My knowledge on Horizon data

89.The Inquiry has directed me to consider the last heading on page 6 of the
document entitled “Security Operations Casework Review” (February 2013)
at POL00105223. | have been asked to comment on what analysis was done
by Security Team investigators on Horizon data when a SPM / SPM's

assistant / Crown Office employee attributed a shortfall to problems with

Page 32 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

Horizon, prior to the introduction of the tool Credence (which the Inquiry

understands to have been introduced in 2009).

90. | note that the heading | have been referred to on page 6 of POL00105223 is
“Credence”. | do not recall or have any knowledge of Credence or when it was

introduced.

91.1 do not know what analysis was done on Horizon data where a SPM/ SPM's
assistant / Crown Office employee attributed a shortfall to problems with
Horizon. | was not routinely notified of such issues; these would have been

dealt with by the management team in the Fraud/Security Operations strand.

92.1 have also been asked to explain the process for requesting Horizon data
from Fujitsu and how that process changed over time. In general terms, | know
that investigators would have been able to obtain information from Fujitsu, the
system developer, but | do not recall exactly how such information was

requested and obtained.

93.1 have also been asked to advise whether POL00105213 is of relevance to

this question and if | can assist with the likely date of the document. | do not

recall this document and have no idea of its date.

2. ARQ Logs

94.In respect of ARQ logs, the Inquiry has asked me to:

Page 33 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

i. outline my understanding of ARQ logs and their use, as well as any
other logs | was aware of and how they differed from ARQ logs;

ii. confirm whether there was a formalised process for requesting ARQ
data from Fujitsu prior to the publication of POL00105222 in September
2013;

iii. | explain who made the decision as to whether ARQ data was requested
from Fujitsu in any given case;

iv. comment on whether ARQ data was requested as a matter of course
where a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM’s
assistant/ Crown Office employee attributed the shortfall to problems
with Horizon but did not have corroborating evidence of material
problems with Horizon, and if not, why not; and

v. comment on whether ARQ data was provided to the relevant SPM as
a matter of course where such data was obtained from Fujitsu in
circumstances where a shortfall had been identified and the relevant
SPM was attributing the shortfall to problems with Horizon (considering

POL00004708).

95.1 am aware that ARQ logs were provided for within the Security Team budget.
| understood that ARQ was used as data analysis of the Branch activity in
question, but | have no knowledge of precisely what information was actually
contained in the report or how it was used. These records would have been
managed by investigators and the managers in the Fraud strand. | was not
involved in the process and had no awareness generally of how and when

ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu, how decisions were made and whether

Page 34 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

SPMs were provided with any data that was obtained.

96.1 have considered POL00105222 and POL00004708 and cannot comment in
respect of either document. | note that POL00004708 is an email chain which
refers to such a shortfall situation and a request for data. | am not part of the
email chain and do not recall seeing it before. | was not involved in these types

of discussions, as a matter of course.

ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND_ PRIORITISATION OF CRIMINAL

INVESTIGATIONS

97.1 have been asked to consider POL00031003 (in particular, sections 5.5 to

5.7) and POL00030786 (in particular, section 4) and to explain:

1) what principles governed the prioritisation of criminal investigations
where the level or volume of crime activity affecting a business unit
exceeded its capacity to investigate;

2) what factors were relevant when deciding on the level of resources to
be allocated to a criminal investigation, and who had responsibility for
making this decision; and

3) during my time as Head of Security, what factors | considered to be
relevant to any decision | made regarding the allocation of resources

for criminal investigations across business units.

Page 35 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

98.1 do not recall either POLO0031003 or POLO0030786. The prioritisation of
cases and allocation of resources was determined by management within the
Fraud strand, | assume in accordance with the relevant guidance and policy.
| do not recall any particular concerns being raised to my attention regarding

these issues.

99.As | took a fraud and loss preventative approach through in depth data
analysis, alternative loss and fraud preventative methods were adopted and
thereby investigations would not necessarily be the primary choice of
direction. Around 2008-2009, the Group Security Director of RMG to which |
had a reporting line, Tony Marsh, challenged this approach and insisted on
full investigations to be carried and prosecutions conducted where
appropriate. An assessment identified that this would require a further 40-50
investigators and after discussions at senior executive level by RMG and POL,
the preventative approach was accepted and adopted as the way forward for

POL.

100. With regards to the question as to what factors | considered relevant to
resource allocations, | was not specifically required to consider the allocation
of resources for criminal investigations across RMG business units (Royal
Mail Letters, Parcel Force etc). | was responsible for allocating resources
across the POL Security Team strands which | would do in conjunction with
the heads of the strands; we would discuss the priorities across the team and
workloads and design a structure to meet the requirements with the head

count we had. As the team head count reduced over time, the Fraud strand

Page 36 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

and Physical Security Operations strand were merged to become multi-

skilled, as discussed at paragraph 14.

CASES AGAINST SPMS

101. | have been asked to comment on my recollection of the criminal cases

against the following SPMs:

1) Nichola Arch;

2) Susan Hazzleton;

3) Lisa Brennan;

4) David Yates;

5) Carl Page;

6) David Blakey;

7) Tahir Mahmood;

8) Oyeteju Adedayo;

9) Hughie Thomas;
10) Suzanne Palmer;
11) Janet Skinner;
12) Jo Hamilton;
13) Pauline Stonehouse;
14) Susan Rudkin;
15) Julian Wilson;
16) Peter Holmes;

17) Seema Misra;

Page 37 of 58
WITN08390100

WITN08390100
18) Allison Henderson;
19) Alison Hall;
20) Joan Bailey;
21) Lynette Hutchings;
22) Grant Allen;
23) Khayyam Ishaq;
24) Angela Sefton; and
25) Ann Neild.
102. The only case | can recall from this list is the case of Susan Rudkin. | do

not recall the case in detail, but | recall that an aspect concerning the
appropriate calculation of the benefit of her alleged fraud for the purposes of
post-conviction confiscation proceedings was brought to my attention. | recall
this because | was surprised to discover that some element of uplift was added

to the amount said to have been stolen, which | thought was unfair

103. The Inquiry has also asked whether there are any prosecutions | had a
role in that | consider relevant to the matters being investigated by the Inquiry
(in particular, bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon IT System) and whether
| have any concerns about any such cases. | do not recall having an

operational role in any of the prosecutions listed.

KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS AND DEFECTS IN THE HORIZON SYSTEM

104. The Inquiry has asked whether | have, or whether | was aware of, any

Page 38 of 58
WITN08390100

WITN08390100

concerns regarding the robustness of the Horizon IT system. | do not recall
having any particular concerns about the robustness of Horizon during my
tenure. To the contrary, | understood that certain issues within the system had
been identified but the messaging within the business was that any issues
were not systemic, and that the Horizon system was robust. | did not have any

reason to believe this was not the case.

105. | have also been asked to consider section 6 for POL00086845 and
POL00088867 which are accounting losses policies, and to comment on
whether the suggestion that system faults with Horizon were “very rare”

corresponded with my understanding of the position in 2003.

106. | do not recall either POLO0086845 and POL00088867 and | had no
understanding of the position in respect of Horizon system faults in 2003. As
noted, | did not become Head of Security until 2007; in 2003 | was the Head
of Security for Royal Mail International, which was a different business unit

within RMG.

CHALLENGES TO THE INTEGRITY OF HORIZON AND POST OFFICE

INVESTIGATIONS

107. The Inquiry has highlighted that | was involved in an email exchange in
February to March 2010 (POL0005437 71), in which it was suggested that there
should be a ‘general’ due diligence exercise on the integrity of Horizon. | have

been asked whether such a ‘general’ due diligence exercise happened at this

Page 39 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

stage and if not why not. | have no recollection of this email correspondence
but note that | appear to have been copied to it. | do not recall being involved
in any conversations about it and | do not recall whether a due diligence

exercise happened at this stage.

108. A specific IT article is referred to within the aforementioned email chain
at POL00054371, and the Inquiry has asked me to confirm whether | read this
article, and if so, what my reaction was. | do not recall this article; however, it
is most likely | would have read it. | do not recall what my reaction to it was at

the time.

109. | have also been asked whether the challenges to the integrity of
Horizon changed my approach to decisions on whether individuals should be
prosecuted following the discovery of shortfalls in their Branches on audit and
if so how. My attention has been drawn to POL00030689 and POL00103242

in considering these questions.

110. | do not recall POL00030689. I can see this is an email from me to Chris
Aujard who was my then line manager. | think this was soon after he took up
the role. | do not recall the email or the reason for sending it. | do not have
access to the documents attached and | do not recall what they contained

though to some extent they are described in the email.

111. | also cannot recall POLO0103242. | do not remember the details of the

case referenced (Bashir) but | can see that | referred it on to Rodric Williams

Page 40 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

who was the lawyer responsible for Second Sight and Horizon issues.

112. There was never a time prior to my departure from POL when |
considered that the integrity of Horizon, in terms of its use as a source of
evidence in criminal investigations and prosecutions, was a problem. Even
after the Second Sight report, the message to the business was that Horizon
was reliable and its use in criminal investigations appropriate. My
understanding of the reason for pausing the prosecution of new cases from
2013 was the need to identify a new subject matter expert after the Second

Sight report raised questions about the current one (see below).

113. | have been asked to consider POL0O0026572, POL00043531,
POL00107129 and POL00099608, and to comment on my involvement in any
investigations carried out into the integrity of Horizon. | have been asked to
comment particularly with regards to the investigation, advice or reports that

were carried out by:

1) Second Sight

2) Cartwright King
3) Simon Clarke

4) Brian Altman

5) Jonathan Swift KC

6) the Bates & Others Group Litigation.

114. In respect of the listed policies; | do not specifically recall

Page 41 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

POL00026572, POL00043531, POL00107129 or POLO0099608, and
although | note that | am included as a recipient for some of these documents,

| am unable to comment on them.

115. | have set out my knowledge in respect of the individuals/cases

mentioned at (1) to (6) below.

1. Second Sight

116. Second Sight were forensic accountants appointed by POL to look into
the Horizon System. | think | may have had one telephone call with them very
early on in the process before | asked an Investigations team leader, Dave
Posnett, to liaise with them and facilitate the flow of any information they
required. | do not believe | ever liaised with them again. | know that they
published an interim report on their findings in July 2013. | cannot recall being
called into any meetings to discuss the findings. Broadly, | was aware of the
findings of the report. | remember that bugs were identified in the Horizon
system but, these issues were not considered systemic or significant in terms
of the reliance placed on it in criminal investigations. The concern | recall
hearing about, was that as a result of the Second Sight report, POL would no
longer be able to use the Fujitsu subject matter expert. This was the reason
why, around this time, POL had to set about finding a different expert witness.
However, prosecutions could not progress until such an expert witness was
identified. As far as | recall no new prosecutions after this time proceeded to

court. This was the position as at the date that | left POL.

Page 42 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

2. Cartwright King

117. Cartwright King were external lawyers appointed by POL. They did not
become known to me until just prior to or after the separation from RMG, but
it is possible that they had been brought on board as external counsel to
advise the organisation before this. | was aware in 2013 that they were
carrying out a review of criminal cases and my team was authorised to provide
them with the relevant papers. | was not involved in this review. Although not
in my direct knowledge, at some point, though | cannot remember the date,
Cartwright King attended monthly investigation case meetings which | had set

up to review the status of investigation and prosecution cases.

3. Simon Clarke

118. Simon Clarke is a senior lawyer at Cartwright King. It is possible that |
may have met him on a few occasions, but | am unable to recall exactly. | did

not have any day-to-day interaction with him.

119. In 2021 | became aware that Mr Clarke, in 2013, had provided two
written advice notes for POL, one in respect of the Second Sight findings on
the Fujitsu expert, Gareth Jenkins, and another on the disclosure obligations
of a prosecutor. During the course of the 2021 Court of Appeal hearings in the
Hamilton & Others Litigation - where several criminal convictions of SPMs
were overturned - | became aware that the latter advice on disclosure

contained an allegation in respect of a POL senior officer. The allegation

Page 43 of 58
WITN08390100
WITN08390100

centred on an order supposedly given to shred the minutes of a meeting where
Horizon issues escalated from the Network had been discussed. In the course
of hearings, | was identified as the individual who had allegedly given this

“shredding” instruction.

120. | know now, from reading the second Clarke advice, that the meeting
during which it is alleged that | gave this instruction was the third meeting in a
series of meetings set up in July 2013. Cartwright King were in attendance at
all the meetings to provide legal advice. | do not recall the specifics, but in
general terms | recall that these meetings were set up post publication of the
Second Sight interim report to consider holistically Horizon issues being
reported, and that various stakeholders across the business attended. Without
access to the underlying material, and with the passage of time, it is
impossible for me to recall with any certainty what instructions | gave during
the relevant meeting and for what purpose. | can however, say categorically,
that | never gave any instruction to shred documents or any instruction that
was motivated by any intention to suppress disclosure or otherwise interfere
with the POL’s disclosure and their legal obligations in respect of the
prosecutions being brought. | can also say that | was never criticised or
disciplined. As noted above, around this time | was tasked by Susan Crichton
to review and agree all decisions to prosecute, and | certainly do not recall her
saying anything to me about any suggestion that | had given such an

instruction.

WITN08390100

121. | do recall a meeting with Susan Crichton a while later where she raised
the requirement for a more structured centralised issues log which was not in
place at that time. Additionally, disclosure was discussed and the whole
Security Team subsequently went through disclosure training provided by

Cartwright King.

4. Brian Altman KC

122. lam aware of Brian Altman KC but | had limited dealings with him. |
believe that | may have met him once in 2015 or 2016 at a meeting | was
asked to attend by my line manager at time - POL General Counsel, Jane
McCloud. | do not recall why | was asked to attend the meeting or what was
discussed. | was aware in September or October 2013 that a QC was
commissioned to review POL’s investigation and prosecution framework. |
know now that Mr Altman was the person who conducted that review, but | did
not know at the time. To the best of my recollection | never saw the report, or
its findings; | heard about it from my line manager of the time, Susan Crichton.
| recall that her messaging was that the report did not suggest any issue with
prosecutions continuing and that the investigations were being conducted

effectively.

5. Jonathan Swift KC

123. lam not familiar with Jonathan Swift KC. | do not believe that | have met

or had any engagement with this person and so | am unable to comment on

Page 45 of 58

WITN08390100
any investigations, reports or advice which may concern him.
6. The Bates & Others Group Litigation
124. | am aware of the Bates & Others Group Litigation. However, | was not

party to those proceedings and | was not called upon to provide any evidence,

in writing or orally.

OTHER MATTERS

125. The Inquiry has asked me to highlight any other matters | wish to bring

to the attention of the Chair. | can confirm that | have no further matters which

| consider relevant to raise at this time.
