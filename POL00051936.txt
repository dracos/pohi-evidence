Dear Jarnail,

Regina - v ~ Julian Wilson - Worcester Crown Court ~ Plea
and Case Managment Hearing - 15th June 2009 at 10.00 a.m.

I attended Worcester Crown Court on Monday last. Mr. Cole also attended
to prosecute in place of his colleague Anthony Vines and Mr. Peter Hampton
of Counsel represented Mr. Wilson.

Mr. Hampton was anxious to reach some form of acceptable compromise to avoid
a trial and, as you may now have heard from Rob, a series of running confer-
ences took place during the morning, at the end of which a deal was struck
whereby Mr. Wilson would plead guilty on a basis, namely the acceptance of
false accounting in the years 2007 and 2008, but for the full amount of the
shortfall of £27,811-98. A written basis to this effect and wee prepared,
signed by both Counsel, and handed in to the Court.

On arraignment Mr. Wilson pleaded not guilty to Counts 1, 2 & 3 but guilty
to Counts 4 & 5. These pleas were accepted and the first 3 counts were dis-
missed, Mr. Cole presented a short outline of the circumstances whereupon,
on Mr. Hampton's application, sentence was adjourned to Monday 3rd August.
next at 10.30 a.m. for an all options pre-sentence report. Mr. Wilson's
unconditional bail was extended until then.

The Court was advised that Mr. Wilson is in the process of selling his Post
Office and completion is provisionally fixed for the end of July. Once sold
he will repay the above shortfall out of the sale proceeds and he hopes to
achieve this before the sentencing hearing in the hope that he will then

not receive an immediate custodial sentence. Please let me know if you become
aware that payment has been made.

I will arrange for Counsel to be attended at the above hearing and will let
you know the outcome immediately afterwards. I have already informed the
Case Officer Gary Thomas of Mr. Wilson's guilty pleas.

Yours sincerely,

JOHN H. DOVE.
