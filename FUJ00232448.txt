1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 OVERVIEW

The Horizon Service Improvement Process is intended to give users the facility to raise
proposals to improve the Horizon Service. The proposals raised will be assessed and
may be progressed by PON.

This document describes the Service Improvement Process. The process defines the
way in which service improvements are proposed, assessed, developed and managed.
It also defines the way in which the Process interfaces with other PON functions and
processes.

The Service Improvement Process forms part of the overall PON Business Service
Management methodology.

1.2 DEFINITION

Service Improvement - A Service Improvement is an original proposal intended to
improve, change or enhance an existing process, design or specification.

1.3. SERVICE IMPROVEMENT AND PROBLEM MANAGEMENT

Although both disciplines are concerned with improving the service, Problem
Management is concerned with actions to restore service to its ‘specification’, Service
Improvement is about improvements to allow the service to exceed specification. The
definition of Service Improvement should be contrasted with the definition of Problem,
below.

Problem - A Problem is an underlying cause which may result in Incidents. A Problem
potentially exists when a defect in the specification, design, production,
implementation, or use of any of the service components results in any aspect of the
service not meeting contractual specification [Ref. 3].

1.4 SCOPE

14.1 Fit

The Service Improvement Process is a new process. It is additional and complementary
to existing processes for identifying and developing change, and is not a replacement
for PON change processes such as PIP, Service Development Plan, etc.

Contact points for the progression of Service Improvements will be established in the
relevant areas of PON. At present these include:

¢ Service Development Team

e Horizon Maintenance Team

e Internal Account Management

¢ Transaction Processing

Business Service Management Page 1 of 3 File Name: SIP Version 1.1.doc
FUJ00232448
FUJ00232448

Document Date: — 20/10/2000 Document Type — L/001
Version 11 Reference No.: SRP/APR/001

Other contacts will be set up as and when identified, or as the need arises.

1.4.2 Coverage

The Service Improvement Process concentrates principally on an iterative and
evolutionary approach to improvement. It is possible that occasionally major step
change improvements (e.g. new services) may be identified within the process, but
these will be managed as discrete projects outside the process.

Overall responsibility for the end to end administration of the process will rest with the
Service Improvement Team.

The Service Improvement process caters for improvements to the Horizon Service, and
will be applied to:

¢ all Horizon operational services and, where these are affected by improvement
proposals, all their feeder, client and support services whether operated within PON
or by other service providers and suppliers;

¢ all Horizon infrastructure and environments including those of feeder, client and
support services;

¢ all Horizon related operational documentation at process and procedure levels.

The Service Improvement Process will be suitable for extension to other PON business
areas, systems, and services, as determined by PON.

1.4.3 Start and Finish Points

The Service Improvement Process will commence at the point that potential Service
Improvements Proposals (SIPs) are proposed, whether through Service Review,
network input or any other source. The directly managed process will cease when:
1) A business owner accepts responsibility for progressing the proposal.

2) The service improvement enters the Service Delivery Plan process.

1) The service improvement enters the PIP or OBC process

Despite the transfer of direct responsibility for the proposal at these points, the Service
Improvement Team will continue to monitor and record progress of the service
improvement on the SIP database and produce reports based on this information.

The Service Improvement Process will cease altogether at the point that an
improvement has been implemented, or when it has been rejected for business reasons
and has been given the status of “closed”. Service improvement proposals will remain
open on the database until implemented. Records will be maintained of all ‘closed’
service improvement proposals.

1.5 OBJECTIVES
The primary purpose of the Service Improvement Process is to harness business
experience to achieve continuous improvement to the Horizon service and associated

Business Service Management Page 2 of 3 File Name: SIP Version 1.1.doc
FUJ00232448

FUJ00232448

Version 11 Reference No: SRP/APR/001
SLAs.

A key secondary purpose of the Service Improvement Process, in conjunction with the
Service Review Process, is to ensure that users are empowered to influence the design
and direction of the service. This is particularly important in the context of PON
automating the customer facing business processes and concentrating on conformance.

1.1.1 Objective 1

To improve the quality, performance and resilience of the service and the levels
of performance provided to users, customers and clients.

1.1.2 Objective 2
To focus PON staff and systems effectively towards providing the greatest
improvement in service in the shortest time possible.

1.1.3 Objective 3

To provide an efficient process for dealing with the small scale changes that will
form the bulk of the Service Improvement Proposals, that as well as progressing
them effectively will also protect PON from wasting effort unnecessarily.

1.1.4 Objective 4
To foster in counter staff and agents a sense of ownership of the Horizon Service.

2. PRINCIPLES

In order to meet the objectives the Service Improvement Process must follow these

principles:

1. Subpostmasters, counter staff and all end users must have the opportunity to raise
improvement ideas.

1. Service improvement originators may be involved in the analysis and development
of service improvement proposals.

1. All service improvement proposals must be logged on a central database, and
progress recorded on the database. The database must provide a life-cycle audit
trail for every proposal that is logged.

1. The progress of service improvement proposals must be communicated to
originators and to the user community.

1. Service improvements proposals must be assessed against consistent and relevant
criteria.

1. Operational responsibilities for the capture, analysis, and development of service
improvements, and the management of the process, must be clearly defined.

1. Responsibility for the detailed analysis and development of a proposal is allocated
ona case by case basis, the allocation being based on factors such as technical
capability, resource availability, and the ownership of the business area that
potentially will benefit.

1. Service improvement proposals will be deemed to be closed when the improvement
has been introduced or has been rejected by the business.

1. The introduction of service improvements will be subject to Change Control and

control system within PON, this principle is currently not achievable.

If the proposal is not relevant to the forum it should be
returned to the Service Improvement team for re-allocation
For those proposals deemed relevant to the forum, the
forum must then agree whether or not the improvement is
worthwhile progressing.

It is likely that there will be recommended SIs for which it
is difficult to find a business owner, either because there is
no direct correlation with the Scorecard or other
performance indicators, or because the benefits are spread
thinly across a number of business areas.

At this stage no policy exists as to how to manage this sort
of issue, and it is not certain that the issue will arise.
However, experience with Problem Management indicates
that it is likely to.

In the first instance it may be possible to ask the SIT to
manage these issues, until a better understanding is
reached as to their frequency and validity.

9. APPENDIXC - SERVICE REVIEW PROCESS

This appendix gives an overview of the BSM Service Review Process.

9.1 PURPOSE

Service Review exists to help maximise the benefits of an automated network by
managing the quality of the service provided. A hierarchy of Service Review Forums
has been established headed by the Horizon Evaluation Review Forum and the
Horizon Service Review Forum, and supported by subsidiary forums focused on
specific operational and support services. The purpose of the structure of forums is to
provide quality management information to the appropriate people, to enable effective
supplier management and continuous service improvement. Service Review also
provides a clear structure for escalation and delegation of issues at a senior
management level and at an operational level.

9.2 SCOPE

Review at an operational level should be detailed and specific and focus on the relevant
service level agreements and operational level agreements. Representatives at the
forums should be close to the operation and able to:

™ report on the overall performance of the specific part of the service

™ identify and record associated risks, issues and problems with this part of the
service

® offer informed opinion on the service which can be escalated and easily understood

@ deliver delegated and/or escalated actions and ensure results are communicated

Review at a higher level will cover all aspects of the service and include:

™@ discussion of SLA performance and action required to rectify failure

@ dealing with issues that have been escalated

™@ receiving information on the operational situation via reports which are produced by
each forum

@ delegating actions to specific forums
