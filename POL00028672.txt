atleagee

The final rehearsal phases for Model Office Testing and End to End are completed and about
to complete respectively.

Weare due to start the Model Office Test proper and the final pass of End to End on

14 December 1998, My present assessment is that there are some significant problems with
the way Horizon passes information through to TIP. These relate to the provision of
balanced outlet cash accounts and the processing of the ensuing information via TIP. Whilst
we allocated some extra time during the Corbett review to sort out any outstanding issues
we need to be aware of a potential threat to 14 December date. :

Areview meeting was held with TIP management in Chesterfield last week. Asa result of
this a number of problems were designated for further work by the end of today
(Monday 16 Nov). This work will be reviewed by Horizon Release Management prior to a
meeting of all interested parties in Feltham on Wednesday/Thursday this week.

~ By the end of Thursday we need to have detailed problem statements, proposed solutions
and an assessment of the knock on impact on Testing timescales and subsequent milestones.
There is no indication that any consequent delay would involve moving the commencement
of national rollout outside my July - Sept 99 window.

Thave been written to by Vince Gaskell the CAPS Project Director in BA about this issue and
“ have promised him a meaningful response by this Friday (20 November). At that time we
must assume that what I reveal will be available to BA and DSS.
