Fujitsu Services Platform Physical Design for the Secure Access Server Ref: SD/DES/224
Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 24-Oct-2002

2.0 Overview

This section provides an overview of the design of secure support and the context in which it
operates.

2.1 Business Context

Full details of the business context of the entire Horizon project are defined in [1]. This
platform enhances the security and audit on support tasks required for the new Network
Banking Service and Debit Card System at BI3 and $30.

The introduction of this platform will overcome some of the security issues that have been
under manual control, and so at risk from deliberate or unintentional actions by support staff.
As a result of the lack of access restriction and audit by the support groups, there is the
opportunity to perpetrate fraud and to make changes to the operational systems that will
impact on the integrity, resilience and security of the systems and their data.

2.2. Technical Context

The documents in section 0.3 provide the technical context. Two platforms are present on
each campus site. There are three main issues resolved in this platform.

© Control access to operational platforms
e Audit access and changes

« Give remote access to tool sets on the operational platform

2.2.1 Access

All access to operational platforms will be controlled through the Secure Access Server. This
is built using the Microsoft Windows 2000 system software which includes the Terminal
Server products which monitor and restrict access to authorised roles with passwords from
authorised platforms. The Secure Shell software (SSH) is present as a client on the Secure
Access Server, affording access between the SSH servers on the operational platforms and the
SSH clients on the support terminals.

2.2.2 Audit

All transactions conducted through the Secure Access Server are audited. A command
logging service will create the audit logs in a predefined file. This data will be collected by the
Audit system and from a known file.

2.2.3 Tool sets

Tool sets to manipulate the data and systems on the operational platforms is being provided by
work packages to the SSH clients on those platforms and the support workstations. The
active product on the SAS is a mechanism to allow the support users access to operational
platforms.

2.3 Design Principles

The general design principles intended for deployment in all platforms, is the maximum re-use
of existing hardware platforms when software upgrades are required. It is an intention that
minimal new software shall be designed and written — maximum use of existing COTS
applications shall be made. In order to assist the production of the integration of COTS
applications and the ready production of what few applications are required, the Horizon
system will by default, look to use applications written for use with Microsoft NT4.0, SPéa.
Use of UNIX operating system and applications will be minimised.

In order to provide a more resilient system, the Windows 2000 operating system has been
chosen for the SAS platform. The facilities provided are limited to the SAS platform and all
other platforms remain at their current operating system.

2.4 Overview of SAS Architecture

Ref [1] contains a detailed description of the entire Horizon architecture. Ref [8] provides the
Secure Support System outline.

3.1. Overview

The Fujitsu Primergy provides the base Secure Access Server platform. For resilience there
are 2 SAS platforms at each campus site, in a separate security domain, accessed over the
Pathway LAN. The SAS acts as a secure an auditable router between the support units and
the operational platforms.

4.0 Software

4.1 Overview

Ref] provides the complete picture of the entire Horizon architecture, including the software
content. The architecture of the Secure Access Server environment is shown below.

The platform base software is Windows 2000. This supports the Terminal Server provided as
part of the Windows 2000 Server software. The Open Secure Shell or OpenSSH facilities are
provided by the COTS product which has been customised for Pathway’s use as part of the
CYGWIN environment. The platform security will be based on an enhanced version of Secure
NT Secure build and include Tivoli, Triage and Athene Acquire.

Terminal Server is a product that can be configured to provide comprehensive access or denial
options. It can be used to allow and deny access at specific times, by specific users, roles and
through specific platforms and sub-nets to files, discs, platforms and devices. Some of these
features will be used to support access between the support workstations and the operational
platforms. The Command Logger will log all access and commands for future use by the
Audit system.

Each campus will have 2 Secure Access Servers, built to the same specification.
5.0 Security Facilities

5.1 Encryption Software
No KMS keys will be used. TeamWARE Crypto is not used on the platform.

5.2. Windows Operating System

This platform is built with Windows 2000 Server with Service Pack 2 plus security hot-fixes.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 24-Oct-2002

5.3. Communications
All communication is through the Campus 100Mbit LAN.

5.4 Usability Features

The service has been designed on Microsoft Terminal Server. Although this provides a GUI
for interactive use, the system will not be used interactively except for SAS platform set up
and maintenance. Users from SSC, SMG and ISD, will log on through the Terminal Server
Client on the local Support Workstation, and be given access through the SSH, and through
the Terminal Server profile to the target system, application or file.

The system has system management requirements limited to support for Tivoli, which will be
used to download new versions of the software and to monitor the Application Event Log
(which is used as the system audit trail). It also provides a command logger file for use by the
Audit Server.

6.0 Resilience and Recovery Features

6.1 Hardware Resilience

Two Secure Access Servers are available on each Campus. There are no specific resilience
features built into the systems.

7.0 Audit Provision
7.1 File/Object Auditing

This platform is designed to provide Audit information on access by support personnel to the
operational platforms. Command Logger will provide the files for the Audit Server to
retrieve.

Tivoli events will be raised.

NB The event log production will correspond to the Windows 2000 system implementation
not the Windows NT4 implementation. As events are automatically logged to Tivoli, the
Event Logs will be cycled as in the standard server builds.
