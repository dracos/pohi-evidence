Subject: FW: PC0056922: PinICL - call transferred to Escher-Dev

63479.DIAG_EVT.zip

Mark,
| don't know if you've been ‘phoned about this one. It seems to have been passed to you on the Escher-dev stack.

Attached is a zipped event log for the counter. The problem seems to have occurred at about 18:32 on 1/11 when Riposte reported
the following error 82 "An unexpected error occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for
lock. (0xC1090003)". From the text of the PinICL it sounds like this lock was causing problems until the counter was rebooted the
following day. | assume that the problem is down to the previous Query from EPOSS, however | can't see why that would cause a one-
off problem on this system.

| don't know if it is relevant, but the machine appears to have been rebooted in the middle of the night a couple of days earlier (ie at
02:00 and twice at 03:00 on 30/10). The counter appears to be at Cl4 (Riposte 6.0.2.27) and has been since the start of the Event Log
(16/10/00).

Regards
Gareth
