Good morning Angela

Please find attached an extract from the draft Defence which relates to the procedures and processes within Post
Office. I have also attached a copy of the claim which Post Office is responding to and is referred to within the
Defence.

Kath and Shirley have provided their comments on these sections and Gayle has signed off on the section relating to

NBSC. However, it would be much appreciated if you could review the extract and provide any comments which you
may have. In particular, if there are any points which are incorrect, please could you flag and explain these.
