Subject: Readout from Jo's office on sparrow

Just had a chat with Claire about the sparrow sub and letters. Apparently Jo wasn’t overly happy with it — she feels she
wasn’t fully aware that POL were terminating Second Sight’s contract, or that the publication of the Second Sight
report was so imminent. I explained to Claire that a) the original advice did say that “this means POL will be
terminating their engagement with SS” and b) the Second Sight report was never due to be published and attempts to

portray it as such are misleading.

We are probably going to have to go chat to Jo on Monday to cover off these points, before she'll sign the letter. This
means delaying the SoS to Arbuthnot letter too, as SoS will want to ensure Jo is happy with it. I am waiting to hear
back from Tara on whether SoS had any comments on the letter or sub.

I think there might be merit in sending Arbuthnot and Bates a holding reply if we are not going to be able to reply
until next week. I’Il talk to private office about that when I hear back from Tara. Views welcome.
