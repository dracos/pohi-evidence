See attached — Andy asked me to agree a draft with you for him to review before we send to Fujitsu.
Let me know what you think.

Andy asked me to check in with you about how to present the schedule for the EDQ following our call with Fujitsu. He
said to keep it high level (1/2 pages max) not least because we're going further than strictly necessary in providing this
information, but also because we don't have full details yet anyway.

I was thinking about a basic table along these lines:

Location of documents Description Comments
eg Dimensions, KEL, Sharepoint, Briefly explain what types of Brief details of any significant
etc. documents are stored in that limitations on our ability to
location and in what format. disclose/the proportionality of
disclosing all of the documents.

What do you think?

Thanks

I have put a call in our diaries to speak with FJ tomorrow at 10:30am. I may be able to join some of this call but not all
of it.
WBON0001962
WBON0001962

The purpose of the call is to discuss with FJ them providing a list of locations in which they hold documents which are
potentially relevant to the Group Action and also to provide a heads up on any issues there may be with extracting
these from these locations. It would also be helpful if FJ could provide a list of 4 or 5 individuals who have contact with
the POL IT team who we could list in the EDQ as F's key custodians. This list of documents and custodians would
then be inserted as a Schedule to the EDQ.

The current documents / locations I am aware of are:

Technical documents in Dimensions

Known Error Log (do not know what database/software hosts this)
Peaks System (do not know what database/software hosts this)

HSD call logs before June 2014 (note — we are aware of issues with extracting them due to Windows 2003 issues due
to be hosted in Powehelp)

Transaction and event data in the Data Centre
Counter logs which had held on the Horizon terminals
SharePoint

Emails (assume Outlook)

Michael — please could you join this call with Andy and then going forward liaise with FJ to produce the schedule of
documents to be included in the EDQ. The EDQ is going to Rod on Monday evening so it would be good to have the
list from FJ by Monday lunchtime. If you read through paragraphs 42, 134 — 152 and 165 -170 of the attached witness
statement you will get a good overview of the current knowledge.

Thank you both

Chris, Matthew, Pete

Post Office are required to inform the Court of the location in which potentially relevant documents are located.
“Relevant document" is a very broad term and will encompass pretty much all dealings which Fujitsu have had with
Post Office in relation to Horizon and HNG-X spanning emails (both with POL and internally), documents stored in
Dimension, Transaction and Event data, HSD logs, Peaks system and any other document produced by Fujitsu which
relates to Horizon. I appreciate that this may be a large volume of documents.

So as we can understand the documents held by Fujitsu and where they are stored, it would be helpful if we could
have call. Would you be available at 11am on Thursday?

Kind regards

Amy
