Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/07/99

1 Introduction

This document describes the requirements to provide in-office migration during
National Rollout. The contractual elements associated with the provision of these
services are documented in the relevant schedules of the Main Contract. Service
levels required from in-office migration activity are defined within the content of this
document.

2 Scope

To define the requirements, processes and key responsibilities of both ICL Pathway
and the POCL Horizon Field Support Officers during migration throughout National
Rollout. The provisions of this document shall commence [10] weeks before the
scheduled start of National Rollout save that each of paragraphs 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and
3.6 shall commence only on the commencement of National Rollout. Any
amendments resulting from Horizon software releases subsequent to CSR2, during
National Rollout, will be incorporated through normal change management
processes into a new version of this document.

3. In Office Migration - Definition

The migration process and Migration Completion, verifies that the accounting data
provided by the Outlet Manager is transferred onto the Horizon system accurately.
The migration process does not verify the accuracy of the Outlet Manager's
accounts, balance for stock, cash or any other asset held within any individual
Outlet.

POCL shall provide adequate resource to execute the in-office migration of each
Outlet in a timely fashion. POCL shall use an in built application within the Horizon
counter system for manual offices (MiMan) and a laptop based tool (MiECCO) for
ECCO Outlets. ICL Pathway shall supply migration tools (MiMan and MiECCO), no
other system shall be used to support the migration. In a large, multi-stock unit
office, the MiMAN migration tool shall provide functionality to concurrently migrate
sufficient stock units to complete migration by 22:00.

The migration activities will comprise the transfer of figures reflecting the current
balanced position of the Outlet onto the Horizon system using MiMan or MiECCO
depending on Outlet configuration.

Migration Completion of an Outlet will have been achieved when the HFSO and the
Outlet manager agree that the output from the Horizon system represents the figures
provided as input to Horizon. This agreement will be recorded via the signature of
both parties on the acceptance form.

3.1 Execution of In Office Migration

The execution of in office migration will be in accordance with the currently agreed
in office migration strategy document (“In-office Data Migration — New Release 2”,
Ref. IM/STR/017) and training will be provided as described in paragraph 3.7.

3.1.1 Migration Commencement
Migration shall only commence when the following conditions have been met:

e Equipment installation (Manual office)

ICL Pathway shall have successfully installed the equipment by 18:00. Without
prejudice to paragraph 3.2.3 if this has not been completed by 18:00, the HFSO will
agree with POCL and the ICL Regional Implementation Programme Manager (IPM)
whether to proceed with migration or not. Every reasonable effort will be made by
ICL Pathway and POCL to complete the installation on time in order that migration
can proceed.

e Equipment installation (ECCO+ office)

ICL Pathway shall have successfully installed a minimum of the Gateway plus one
other counter system by 17:30. Every reasonable effort will be made by ICL
Pathway and POCL to complete the installation on time in order that migration can
proceed. Target completion of installation shall be 21:00.

e Evidence of Training

ICL Pathway will provide the HFSO with details of individuals that have passed
training. The HFSO shall confirm with the Outlet Manager that only users that have
received training, and reached the required standard, will be created on the system
during migration.

e Laptop (ECCO+ only)

The HFSO shall check that the provided laptop is in working order as defined in the
checklist contained within the HFSO Guide.

e System integrity

There shall be no system integrity failures or viruses present on any system or disk
to be used during migration.

« ECCO+ system

For ECCO+ offices the HFSO shall determine that the ECCO+ Back Office
Processor is operational and that CTD’s exist and are checked by the version of Dr
Solomons or such other virus checking software then in use on the MiECCO laptop.

3.1.2 Scheduling and Timing

POCL shall migrate Outlets in accordance with the beat rates described in the
currently agreed Installation Programme Plan IM/PLA/010 and from the rollout

schedule generated by the Rollout database (RODB), as amended from time to time.
Changes to the rollout schedule shall be notified, other than in exceptional
circumstances, no later than 5 working days before installation is due. However, in
exceptional circumstances, provision will exist to make changes to the rollout
schedule no later than 2 working days before installation is due. Levels of change
to the rollout schedule shall be consistent with those agreed with ICL Pathway’s
suppliers (see “High Level Counter Infrastructure Rollout Strategy”. Ref
IM/STR/0025) and shall be agreed with POCL.

For manual Outlets, HFSOs shall arrive at the Outlet 1 hour in advance of the
scheduled migration activities. _ For ECCO+ Outlets, HFSOs shall arrive at the
Outlet at least 1 hour before installation commences. Start times for individual
Outlet migrations shall be determined from the RODB, as amended from time to
time. On arrival at an Outlet, the HFSO shall contact the FSM to confirm arrival. A
POCL nominated representative (to be made known in advance to ICL Pathway) will
provide the ICL Pathway Rollout Helpdesk with a status report by 18:00 indicating
migration status. The format of the report will be agreed between ICL Pathway and
POCL.

3.1.3. Migration

All Outlets shall be migrated on the day of installation and shall be completed by
22:00 hours, Monday to Friday (ECCO Outlets shall not be migrated on a
Wednesday). Should the Outlet Manager and HFSO agree to extend the hours to
complete the migration exercise, any liability (including extra cost) arising as a result
of work executed within these timescales, shall, subject to paragraph 3.2.3, be the
responsibility of POCL.

3.1.4 Completion
Migration completion is defined in Section 3 of this document.

By 22:00, the HFSO shall notify the FSM of the status of the Outlet, being either
successfully migrated or failed. The FSM shall provide the ROHD with a status
report (in the agreed format), for migration activities in their implementation
programme area by 22.00. Additionally, if migration is not concluded a further
status report will be made by the FSM by 09.30 on the next working day for that
Outlet. In all cases whatever the timescales of migration completion, status of the
activity must be reported to the ROHD within the next scheduled report, 18:00, 22:00
or 09:30.

3.2 Migration Failure

Migration failure of an Outlet shall only occur if both migration of that Outlet shall
have commenced and Migration Completion of that Outlet shall have not occurred
by 22:00 on the day of commencement of migration.

3.2.1 Commencement

Subject to paragraph 3.1.1, Migration activities will be deemed to have started in
Manual Outlets upon commencement of Outlet balancing. Subject to paragraph

shall be liable for reasonable costs incurred by POCL and reschedule any Outlets
that require further migration activities arising from these circumstances.

office migration on the planned day and prevent the likelihood of having to abandon
migration activity once it has commenced.

between ICL Pathway and POCL to review issues and key learning points from the
previous week’s activities. The inputs to these forums will be defined and agreed in
due course. Thereafter, the normal series of scheduled meetings will be used as
the vehicle to review migration performance. ICL Pathway shall provide POCL, at
their request, with in-office migration performance data for discussion at
performance reviews. The following meetings and reviews shall be conducted
during the lifecycle of the migration:

Fortnightly IP Meeting
