Pete Markey drop against target and last year’s result. It was agreed that a note
would be circulated to explain the change.

opportunities and that the EBIT could range from £83m to £103m,

POL00021531

he wanted a more realistic approach in the budget and three year
plan. The Chairman stressed the need for realism.

£35m EBITDAS target proposed for 2015/16. This would be built into

target, the Business would need to deliver an outturn of £26m to
trigger the LTIP.

(f) The Board discussed the current risks and opportunities highlighted in
the plan and the need to continue to focus on reducing costs. The
CFO recognised the need to manage working capital to enable the

November Board. David Ryan reported that he now believed a 20%
reduction in change resource was possible as part of wave 2, taking
the team down from its current 80 FTEs to circa 60.

(c) David Ryan proposed that the Back Office Application Tower (BOAT)
work, which had been suspended to consider alignment with the wider
back office outsourcing, should now go ahead. The added risks and
cost of any further delay to BOAT outweighed any possible small
advantage. The Board agreed that the risks outweighed any benefits

and back office timelines were agreed.

risk for the Business. Lesley Sewell assured the Board that this was
the plan but still recognised the Fujitsu exit as a significant risk.

POLB 15/11 NETWORK TRANSFORMATION, MODEL PERFORMANCE AND
CROWN TRANSFORMATION Q3 2014

meeting and received an update on Network Transformation,

what was happening to their branch before the IT front office changes.

(c) Kevin Gilliland reminded the Board that the sub postmasters’ contract
requires the Business to give 3 months’ notice to sub postmasters but
that the proposed cliff would give 6 months. It was his intention to
have started conversations with all sub postmasters before May. The
September cliff had always been indicative and because NT was
ahead of plan the Business needed to bring this forward to keep up
the conversion rate.

(d) The Board agreed that the term cliff was unhelpful and that the
Business should try to smooth the changes as much as possibie.

(e) The Board asked how the NFSP and George Thomson are likely to
react to the change. Kevin Gilliland hoped that George Thomson
would understand the need to bring the date forward but he was
comfortable that this was the right thing to do irrespective of the NFSP
position. The Board noted that the MoU with the NFSP had still not
been agreed.
