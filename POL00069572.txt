Dear Mr Dilley
Marine Drive Post Office
I refer to your letter of 22" August and our subsequent brief telephone conversation.

I write to confirm that I took over the cash and stock at the above office on the afternoon of 23"
March 2004. I performed the duties of Sub-postmistress from that date until 21* April.2004.
During that time I performed five cash account balances on 24" March, 31" March, 7” April, 14"
April and 21* April. None of these balances resulted in any significant losses or gains. Whilst I do
remember having to reboot the system on one occasion (an action I have performed numerous
times in my own office!) this merely caused a temporary disruption to customer service and in no
way affected the transactional accounting.

T trust that this information is sufficient for your needs, however should you require any further
assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

GRO

Mrs Ruth Simpson
