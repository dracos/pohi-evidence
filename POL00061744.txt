A signature only makes a difference if the Statement is filed with a Court (at which point any false comment in the
Statement would be a contempt of Court). I'd be minded to keep the Statement unsigned as it helps us to maintain that it
is a draft document and therefore potentially subject to legal privilege (for DPA and FOIA purposes).

Kind regards

{think we just send the email to them and make them come back with the question they want answering and then deal
with that what we were trying to do with the email is to make the point that they cannot have source material such as
this as its totally inappropriate and also get them to ask the question which we can answer on the record.

A further question from me, is it worth getting that witness staternent signed?

Yes - we have addressed the issue under investigation by SS. This was about Mr Rudkin's visit to FU's office at Bracknell
and the “covert operations centre” he apparently saw. To dispel this rumour, we have provided SS with a statement from
Martin Ralfe (POL employee who conducted the visit) confirming that the “operations centre” was in fact a test

environment, not connected to the live Horizon system. This was Spot Review 5.

Unless lan is saying that Post Office are trying to conduct a massive conspiracy against SPMRs, then the trawi for emails

is clearly disproportionate.

Angela Van-Den-Bogerd;

Chris, Ian was chasing about the matter of retrieving emails for POL staff in relation to the matter of whether there is a
basement in Bracknell from where POL staff can manipulate branch Horizon data without the knowledge of spmrs. This
was drafted for you to send when Ian first raised the matter but I don’t think you ever sent it. Ian raised it again in your
absence. Are you content for me to send this on your behalf?

Tan
You raised this matter with Belinda in my absence, I apologise I had thought we had responded on this.

For me the starting point in considering your request is to understand why you feel you need access to this information.
The processes established by the Working Group are fairly clear: upon receipt of a CQR POL produces a report (along
with relevant supporting documentation) which is then sent to you for the purpose, inter alia, of providing a basis upon
which you can prepare a corresponding report for the Working Group. To the extent that you reasonably feel there are
ambiguities or omissions in the POL report you have the option of either commenting on this matter in your report (to the
extent it is not material), or (to the extent that it is material) requesting, via appropriate channels (and at all times copying
in Angela), clarification of issues raised. The point here is that such requests are specific and focussed on matters directly
relevant to the report produced by POL; they should therefore be made afier receipt of the POL reports, not before they
are written, not be overly general in nature, and certainly not so broad as to require the release of an entire class of
document, e.g. an entire inbox for POL employees. Put another way, it seems to me that the Working Group has not
asked you to conduct a trawl of the primary source documentation and records maintained by POL to ascertain what it

POL-0058223
POL00061744
POL00061744

relevant, and what is not. Apart from the need to maintain an orderly and workable process, there are it seems to me very
good reasons to ensure that we maintain discipline and focus on the cases at hand.

The current situation contrasts quite markedly to that which prevailed in the period prior to the release of your interim
report, when you were undertaking what was essentially an investigatory exercise. Given your role then, I can entirely
understand why generic information was provided to you as it no doubt formed the factual basis by reference to which
you wrote your report. However, the focus of your work now is on the mediation scheme, where your role is significantly
different from that which you occupied in respect of the interim report, and as such I cannot see any compelling rationale
for disclosure. Indeed, to retrieve files, documents and emails, review them and redact information which is commercially
confidential, privileged or personal would involve considerable time and resource, which I would find difficult to justify
without a clear need.

If you would like to let Angela know the actual question you are seeking to answer, we will endeavour to provide you
with the answer.

Regards

Chris

This is a long outstanding request that was left with Andy Holt. (Full email archives for 2008 for Martin ROLFE ~ a POL
employee working at Bracknell)

The request was passed onto CSC for action by them.

I would be grateful for an update on this as the underlying issues now apply to a number of cases.
Many thanks

Remind me the name of the person and the time frame of emails you want — I have given CSC clarity on the
requirement, they just need this to progress. Presume you want both sent and received.

Does that cover your requirement.
