Alan, Gareth S and Gareth J,

Please see attached Torstein’s draft witness statement. He has asked that the three of you review it and provide any
feedback / clarifications; he is next working on Tuesday 25", so it would be ideal if your comments could be fed back
to him by the end of Monday.

Note that currently the draft has been provided to Torstein by WBD based on a previous statement with yellow
highlighted sections where WBD are asking specific questions, and as you can see, Torstein has made amendments as
tracked changes, and added comments.

Please would you copy Pete Newsome, Dave Ibbett and me in on your responses back to Torstein; if you need any
clarification in the meantime probably best to go back to Pete.

Thanks
