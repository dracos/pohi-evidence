>> Dear Tom,

>>

>> I have just seen I am meeting Tim Parker this afternoon at 4.00pm but, unless I am going
completely dotty, I don’t think I have had a briefing session. Are you available for a call today? I
am available up to 10.00am or between noon and 1.45pm. If you are not available for a call who
else could brief me?
