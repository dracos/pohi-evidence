Hi Wayne,

Your timing is spot on — I am currently chasing Susan about this!
We'll have a new line at the end of March 2013 — I just need Susan to approve my business case.
Will let you know once we have more detailed plans in place — will be helpful to have your input.

Georgina

Subject: Whistleblower

Hi Georgina,
Just wondered if anything is being progressed with regard to a new POL whistleblower service?

Obviously the Group ‘Speak Up' line was in place previously, but I know that post separation there was an appetite for
R&C to take up the mantle in developing a new POL version.

You may recall that I instigated a watered down ‘Internal Fraud’ line as part of the Grapevine portfolio, and we do get a
trickle of calls through on that. However I'm assuming that a full blown whistleblower service will be developed and
branded by POL?

Regards

Wayne
