2. This Rule 9 request is primarily concerned with events that took place in 1997-1999.
In the course of preparing for this statement | have been provided with the
documents referred to in the Rule 9 request, some further material obtained by the
Inquiry from the National Archives and, at my request, relevant documents held by
the Department for Work and Pensions (‘DWP’) although | do not believe that this
material (taken together) includes all the material relating to Horizon that | would
have seen when | was a Minister. Subject to that proviso, | am able to answer the
questions in the Rule 9 request with some confidence, although | have been heavily
reliant on the documentation to provide some of the detail in my answers below and

have referenced the relevant documents as necessary.
Professional background
3. | have been asked to provide a brief description of my professional background.

4. On 11 June 1987, | was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Edinburgh
Central, a position | held until 2005. Following boundary changes | represented

Edinburgh South West from 5 May 2005 until 6 May 2010.

5. My ministerial career began on 3 May 1997, following the election of the Labour
Government in the 1997 General Election, and continued until Labour left office in

May 2010. During this period, | held the following Ministerial posts:
(a) Chief Secretary to the Treasury: 3 May 1997 - 27 July 1998;

(b) Secretary of State for Social Security: 27 July 1998 - 8 June 2001;

and
(g) Chancellor of the Exchequer: 28 June 2007 - 6 May 2010.

6. Between 6 May 2010 and 30 March 2015, | continued to serve as the Labour
Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West. In 2015, | was appointed as a life
peer and | took up my seat in the House of Lords on 10 December 2015 as Lord

Darling of Roulanish. | retired from the House of Lords on 28 July 2020.

The background to my involvement in the Horizon project

7. | have been asked to set out the background to my involvement in the Horizon

project.
The Labour Government's policies

8. The Labour Party was elected in May 1997 ona manifesto that included a pledge to
reform the welfare state. At that time social security benefits were administered and
paid by the Benefits Agency (‘the BA’) which was an executive agency of the
Department for Social Security (‘the DSS’). Part of the Government's welfare reform
agenda was transforming the BA from an organisation that simply paid out benefits

into one with the primary objective of getting those who could work into employment

Page 3 of 46
10.

11.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

(unemployment rates in the late 1990s were much higher than they are today). This
was ultimately achieved by streamlining and modernising benefits systems and
reducing benefits fraud, as well as by a Machinery of Government change in 2001
that merged the DSS with the employment functions of the Department for
Education and Employment to create the DWP as the department responsible for
both social security benefits and employment. At the same time the BA was merged

with the Employment Service to form Job Centre Plus.

A second key Government priority in 1997 was maintaining a post office network
that served the community. This had been a long-running problem for successive
Governments and one of the main difficulties was in securing footfall and therefore

post office business.

These two policies were connected because, at that time, most recipients of state
benefits collected their benefits from the Post Office using a paper payment book or
giro cheque and the BA reimbursed Post Office Counters Limited (‘POCL’) for the
costs of providing these benefits services. This income comprised a substantial

proportion of POCL’s overall revenue.

Two other policies of relevance at this time were the Government’s social banking
and ‘modern electronic government’ policies, the purpose of which was to make the
provision of Government services more efficient and also to tackle what was, and

remains, a real problem of people being excluded from the financial system.

The genesis of the Horizon project

The genesis of the Horizon project was in a compromise reached in 1993 aimed at
meeting the DSS’s aim of modernising benefits payments (and thereby reducing the
level of fraud which was a real problem) while ensuring footfall in post offices. The
means by which this was achieved was a major public finance initiative (‘PFI’) project
agreed between POCL, DSS and a private consortium, ICL Pathway, and
announced by the previous Government in May 1996. The objective of the project
was to provide POCL with an IT infrastructure to support the whole range of their
business, and to provide the BA with a modern means of paying benefits using a
plastic swipe-card (the Benefits Payment Card or ‘BPC’) which would reduce fraud,
improve customer service and provide proper accounting information. The BPC
could only be used in post offices thus securing footfall. This background is set out
in detail in a letter dated 12 August 1997 written to me by John Denham, who was
then the Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department’ of Social Security

(‘DSS’) [WITN0420_01/1, DWP00000095).

Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1997)

| first became aware of the Horizon project in my role as Chief Secretary to the
Treasury where | was responsible, amongst other things, for monitoring all
government expenditure. The purpose of John Denham’s letter of 12 August 1997
[WITN0420_01/1, DWP00000095] was to alert me to the fact that the Horizon
project was seriously behind its original timetable with equally serious

consequences for the business cases that had been agreed when the project had

Page 5 of 46

16.

17.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

been announced. He explained the DSS view that there was an attractive case for
paying benefits directly into bank accounts by Automatic Credit Transfer (‘ACT’) but
that this had been opposed in the past on the basis that compulsory ACT would

have a serious effect on the post office network, particularly in rural communities.

Mr Denham stated his view that, if the commitment to the Horizon project had not
already been made, we should (at the very least) question whether it was sensible
to sustain an expensive and outmoded pattern of payment as a means of delivering
a hidden subsidy to the Post Office. He also noted that payment by ACT cost
substantially less than other payments and that it was unlikely that card payments
over post office counters would continue to be the best means of payment into the

next century. These were views that | shared.

Mr Denham explained that the BA, POCL and ICL Pathway had agreed that there
should be an independent review of the project reporting in September and identified
potential alternative routes in the event that ICL were not able to develop an

acceptable plan for the way forward and deliver against it.

| replied to John Denham on 29 August 1997 [WITN0420_01/2, CBO00000018]
noting that it was necessary to establish urgently whether the project could be
brought back on track and that it was sensible to undertake some contingency work
in the meantime in the event that it were to become necessary to terminate the

contract, looking in particular at the case for ACT.

In a reply dated 14 September 1997 [WITN0420_01/3, CBO00000013] John
Denham cautioned me against harbouring any hopes that the project could be

Page 6 of 46

19.

20.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

brought back on track given the emerging view that the completion date was likely

to be at least 18 months beyond the original contractual date.

A letter from Margaret Beckett, then the President of the Board of Trade, dated 17
October 1997 [WITN0420_01/4, DWP00000072] reflects the Government's general
policy towards the Post Office at that time. She noted POCL was the most politically
sensitive of the Post Office businesses and that its future viability looked increasingly
fragile. She cautioned that any precipitate changes to the level of payments for
services provided by the Post Office to Government agencies such as the BA or the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (‘DVLA’) risked seriously destabilising the

network.

In a letter to Margaret Beckett dated 3 March 1998 | noted that | was increasingly
concerned about the Horizon project and stated that officials should be asked to
prepare an agreed analysis of the options, including an assessment of whether the
project was technically viable and, if so, how quickly it could be completed and at
what cost to Government, as well as the direct and indirect costs: of cancellation

along with the costs of any other option [WITN0420_01/5, CBO000000017].

July 1998 (Secretary of State for the DSS)

On 27 July 1998, | was appointed as Secretary for State for the DSS. It was in this
role that | had to deal with the problems posed by the Horizon project but also as a
member of the Cabinet in supporting Government policy in relation to both benefits

reform and the Post Office (outlined above).

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

21. In my role as Secretary of State, | was committed to delivering the Government's
policy on welfare reform and, following my arrival in the department, it became clear
to me that fundamental reform was required across the board and in particular in
relation to the way in which benefits were being paid to approximately 15 million
people every week. In particular, | came to the view that the BPC was not the right
way to achieve the effective and long-term reform of benefits payments systems,

principally for three reasons.

22. First, | believed that the BPC was wrong in principle bécause it stigmatised benefits
recipients and created two classes in society: those whose wages were paid into
their bank accounts via ACT; and an underclass of people who had to receive their
income using a benefits card. By contrast, ACT was a way to tackle social exclusion
by ensuring that all benefits recipients had some form of banking facility and could
therefore receive their income in the same way as everyone else. | also considered
that it was wrong in principle to require people to go to the Post Office to receive

their benefits when there was a more convenient method of benefit payment

available.

23. Second, | did not believe that the BPC was the best and most cost-effective solution
for the payment of state benefits, particularly given that it was not intended for long
term use and the technology was likely to soon become outdated. A detailed
assessment of the advantages of payment by ACT as an alternative to the BPC is
contained in supporting papers to a DSS Memorandum dated 25 August 1998
[WITN0420_01/6, WITN04200107]. In summary, by moving straight to ACT it was
estimated that the DSS would save £400m per year and the banks had been

24,

25.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

delivering ACT for years so it had a proven track record of working. In those
circumstances | did not consider the BPC to be a good investment of public funds
and | believed that there were better ways to manage the loss of income to POCL

that would result from the adoption of ACT as the means of the payment of benefits.

Third, by July 1998 the project was thoroughly stalled. In November 1997, ICL had
been placed in breach of contract by the public sector parties for failure to meet a
key operational milestone and the DSS/BA had issued a notice of ‘cure’ which was

due to expire on 12 August 1998 and was unlikely to be met.

An interdepartmental working group had been established which had convened an
Independent Panel of Experts (‘the Treasury Panel’), chaired by Adrian Montague,
to conduct an independent review into the Horizon project. The Treasury Panel
issued its report in July 1998 [WITN0420_01/7, POL00028094] and concluded that
the project was technically viable but the cost of the delay to the project was £180
million, over half of which fell to the Government sponsors; the BA was estimated to
be losing £15 million per month of fraud and administrative savings lost through the
delay in-migrating to the new system. The report identified a number of problems in
the progress of the project and noted that the programme appeared from the start
to have had two distinct sponsor visions and no clear owner. The report also noted
that the relationships between the parties were characterised by a low level of
confidence in various aspects of the eventual solution and in each other. This
reflected the ultimately incompatible objectives of the sponsors whereby the BA
wanted to move to ACT as soon as possible and POCL wanted to retain benefits
payments via the Post Office to maintain footfall.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

26. The Report proposed six options (summarised on internal page 22) as follows:

(a) Option 1: restructuring the full Horizon project;

(b) Option 2: partially restructuring the project by removing the BPC;

(c) Option 3: extending the current programme;

(d) Option 4: continuing the current programme;

(e) Option 5: partial termination (removal of the BPC);

(f) Option 6: complete termination of the project.

27. My view on reading the report was that a huge project where there was fundamental
disagreement between the two sponsor departments was doomed. For the reasons
stated, | concluded that DSS should withdraw from the project and proceed to ACT
and that Government should find a different way to make up for the loss in income

to POCL.

The problems faced by the Horizon project between July and December 1998

28. | have been asked to explain the problems faced by the Horizon project between

July and December 1998.

29. The period between July and December 1998, and indeed January to May 1999
(addressed below), was dominated by the decision as to whether or not to retain the

BPC as an element of the Horizon Project.

Page 10 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

30. By September 1998, ICL had missed the 12 August contractual deadline and the
view of Ministers was that ICL was in breach of contract [WITN0420_01/8,
BEIS0000284]; a claim that was disputed by ICL [WITN0420_01/9, BEIS00000283].
On 15 September 1998, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Byers, wrote
to ICL to inform them that Ministers had decided to allow a period of one month for
discussion between the parties to see whether satisfactory commercial terms could
be agreed for continuing the project and that a special advisor would be appointed

to work with the parties towards finding a solution [WITN0420_01/8, BEIS0000284].

31. Graham Corbett was appointed as the independent advisor and, on 18 October
1998, reported that the parties had been unable to reach agreement as to a
commercial basis for proceeding, but progress had been made in the development
of a framework for a way forward (‘the Corbett Framework’) [WITN0420_01/10,
POL00028098]. His proposal was a version of the Treasury Panel’s Option 1 under
which Horizon would be developed with the BPC and front-end banking facilities in
tandem. The aim was that benefits would be paid via the BPC for an initial period
while the Post Office’s banking facilities (including a banking ‘smartcard’) were put
in place, and then the DSS could move to payment via ACT using the Post Office’s
automated systems. All parties, including the DSS, agreed to consider this option in

good faith.

32. Commercial negotiations based on the Corbett Framework continued into
December. The issues between the parties related to where the burden of the
commercial risk should lie, the balance of expenditure between the public and
private sector, and acceptance testing (considered further below).

Page 11 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

33. By early December 1998, there was an increasing focus within Government
discussions on other options for Horizon, including cancellation of the project. This
is reflected in a POCL Briefing Paper dated 7 December 1998 [WITN0420_01/11, _
POL00028634] prepared following a request by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury

for officials to prepare an ‘exit strategy’ from Horizon.

34. On 9 December 1998, ICL put forward new proposals (still based on the Corbett
Framework) [WITN0420_01/12, POL00028329]. Ministers considered the proposals
at a meeting which took place later the same day but reach no agreement in relation

to them [WITN0420_01/13, BEIS0000418}.

35. On approximately 21 December 1998, Stephen Byers put forward a further proposal
aimed at reaching a compromise in relation to the ICL proposal. This proposal is
referred to in a draft Department of Trade and Industry (‘DTI’) letter
[WITN0420_01/14, BEISO00395] but the papers | have been provided with do not

include the original letter/memorandum from Stephen Byers.

36.1 responded on 22 December 1998 with a further proposed solution
[WITN0420_01/15, CBO00000038]. My proposal was that the Horizon project
should be renegotiated within the existing contracts to proceed with a Government
Smart Card but without the added complication of the BPC, while also proceeding
with the automation of the Post Office (which would include building a capacity to
provide banking facilities in post offices and other services of potential interest to

Government).

WITN04200100

The views of Government departments

37. | have been asked whether there was agreement between the Government
departments as to the future of Horizon and, if not, what their respective positions

were.

38. During this period there was common ground between Ministers as to the
Government's overall policy objectives, in particular the importance of maintaining
a post office network responsive to the needs of the communities it served; the
welfare reform agenda; and the need to act in the best interests of British business,
including by promoting foreign investment in the UK. However, there was no
consensus across Government as a whole as to how these objectives were to be
aligned in the context of the Horizon project. It was this issue that dominated

discussions from July 1998 until a decision was taken in May 1999.

The DSS

39. As | have explained above, by July 1998 | was firmly of the view that the Horizon
project had stalled, ICL were in breach of contract, and the BPC was the wrong way
to reform benefits payments. That remained my view throughout the period with

which this Rule 9 request is.concerned.

40. A DSS Submission dated 17 August 1998 [WITN0420_01/16, WITN04200101]
noted that, following a Ministerial meeting on 30 July 1998, there was a ‘mounting

consensus’ between myself, Stephen Byers and the No.10 Policy Unit (but not the

Page 13 of 46
41.

42.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

DTI or POCL Management) against the Treasury Panel’s ‘Option 1’ (proceeding with

the full Horizon project).

On 30 July 1998, | issued the first of two ministerial directions to Peter Mathison, the
Accounting Officer of the BA, to allow work on the BPC to continue. Under the civil
service rules, an Accounting Officer is directly answerable to Parliament for public
spending and must seek a Ministerial direction for financial expenditure that does
not meet all of the following four tests: (a) regularity; (b) propriety; (c) value for
money; and (d) feasibility. In summary, Peter Mathison’s view was that a direction
was required if he was to proceed with the project rather than pursuing a more cost-
effective means of delivering benefits by cancelling the BPC and moving to ACT.
Further background to the ministerial directions | issued is contained in a submission
to me from Peter Mathison dated 28 June 1999 [WITN0420_01/17, DWP00000018]

and a DTI submission dated 8 September 1998 [WITN0420_01/18, BEISO000127].

The DSS view of the Treasury Panel proposals was set out in a submission dated
17 August 1998 [WITN0420_01/16, WITN04200101]. In summary, the DSS could
live with any of the Treasury proposals except Option 1 (continuing with the BPC)
and considered that the other options should be assessed against the following
goals: (a) ensuring that people who wished to use the Post Office could do so; (b)
protecting the future of the Post Office network; and (c) mitigating the risk to the
future of ICL (and therefore British business interests in general). The DSS view was
that Option 2 (proceeding with Horizon without the BPC) was the best way to protect

those interests and mitigate the risks of terminating the contract.

Page 14 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITNO04200100

43. My view was also that Option 2 was the best option. A note of a meeting that | had
with DSS officials on 18 August 1998 [WITN0420_01/19, WITN04200102] records
my view that the DSS had the right to terminate the BPC aspects of the contracts
because of ICL’s failure to deliver (this was possible because ICL had contracted
separately with the BA and POCL for the Horizon and BPC elements of the project).
| therefore considered that the DSS should proceed to paying benefits by ACT as a
contingency. The basis for my view as to breach of contract is explained in an
undated DSS paper [WITN0420_01/20, WITN04200103]: As noted, ICL did not

accept that it was in breach of contract.

44, In September 1998, | agreed to consider any contractual proposals made pursuant
to the Corbett Framework (proceeding with Horizon with the BPC) in good faith.
However, as | made clear in discussions with my Ministerial colleagues, | remained

highly sceptical as to whether this approach was a good use of public funds.

45. On 15 September 1998, | issued a further ministerial direction to Peter Mathison to

allow consideration to be given to the Corbett Framework proposals.

46. In November 1998, ICL made a proposal based on the Corbett Framework. A
Horizon ‘Progress Report’ dated around 16 November 1998 noted the DSS/BA view
that ICL’s revised Option 1 (Horizon with BPC for a short period while the Post Office
implemented banking facilities) would result in further delays to the Horizon project
such that the BPC would only be in use for a very short period of time before ACT

was introduced. The DSS/BA also considered that the BPC element of the project

Page 15 of 46

48.

49.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

would distract POCL from introducing banking services as quickly as possible

[WITN0420_01/21, WITN04200104].

ICL’s November proposal was rejected by Ministers and, as noted above, ICL put
forward a further proposal in December 1998. | set out my views on the December
proposal in a letter to Stephen Byers dated 11 December 1998 [WITN0420_01/22,
BEIS0000417]. My view of the proposal itself was that further assurance was
needed in relation to commercial risk (Fujitsu had offered to £600 million in ‘support’
for the project but my view was that this should be in the form of legally enforceable
guarantees), the balance of expenditure was still skewed too heavily in favour of
ICL, and ICL’s acceptance testing proposals remained unacceptable (| address this

in more detail below).

| also made clear my ongoing position that the case for proceeding with the BPC
was weak. As noted in my letter, by December 1998 the project timetable had
slipped again and that, in agreeing to consider Option 1 under the Corbett
Framework, the DSS were in effect foregoing £800 million in savings in the welfare
administration bill that it was thought could otherwise have been achieved over the

next 10 years.

The draft letter of 22 December 2022 proposing an alternative option of proceeding
without the BPC, stated my view that the BPC had no life or market value after the
contract with ICL came to an end and was a bespoke and complex system which
could contribute to the risks of continuing with the project given ICL’s continuing

failure to deliver. By contrast; ICL had (| understood) already successfully delivered

Page 16 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

banking facilities to other customers, and a Post Office banking facility would be
relatively cheap, simple to develop and carried a potential wider market value than
the BPC. The draft letter also reflected my view that the BPC was not a good use of
taxpayers’ money because it amounted to a disguised subsidy to the Post Office
over which the Government had little control (i.e. despite the subsidy post offices in
rural or deprived urban areas that the Government wanted to be supported were still

closing).

50. The letter also noted Peter Mathison’s view that a further ministerial direction would
be required to go forward with ICL’s December 1998 proposal. It is not uncommon
for senior officials to caution that they may need a direction in order to remain within
the accounting rules referred to above. Mr Mathison was clearly concerned that to
continue without a direction would fall outside of the civil service rules on
expenditure. In addition, | was concerned that it would not be possible to justify the
project when DSS expenditure was scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee
and the Social Security Select Committee, the latter having written to me in

December 1998 proposing an inquiry into the Horizon project.
The DTI

51. Whilst | had a good understanding of the position of the DTI at the time, what follows
is largely based on the documentation that | have seen in preparing for this
statement. It accords with my recollection but former DTI Ministers would be best

placed to answer specific questions in relation to DTI policy in 1998.

Page 17 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

52. Between July and December 1998, the Secretary of State for the DT! was Peter
Mandelson. The DTI’s view on the future of Horizon was framed by its role as the
department responsible for postal services and a POCL shareholder. A DTI
submission dated 8 September 1998 contains a useful summary of the key factors

of importance to the DT! [WITN0420_01/18, BEIS0000127].

53. First, the DTI believed that the Horizon project was essential to the maintenance of
a nationwide network of post offices and that, without it, POCL would require a heavy
subsidy to avoid a collapse of the post office network. The DTI also considered the
BPC to be an essential element of the project. This was because POCL were reliant
on income from the BA for administering benefits payments and, while the DTI
recognised that a move to ACT was inevitable, the department believed that the
BPC was a necessary interim step to retain footfall in post offices and allow POCL
time to adjust to a future without BA income. In particular, it was thought that POCL
could put in place automated services that would help post offices to retain

customers once a full move to ACT was made.

54. Second, the DTI was concerned that cancelling the project, or removing the BPC
element of it, would cause sub-postmasters to lose confidence in the future viability
of their businesses which could cause post offices to close or depress the sale value
of post office businesses (on which sub-postmasters often relied to fund their
retirements). There was also concern that, in light of public statements made by DT!

ministers, sub-postmasters would feel betrayed if the BPC was cancelled.

Page 18 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITNO04200100

55. Third, the DTI believed that Horizon without the BPC was unworkable in practice,
could not be negotiated with ICL (because ICL would not agree to it), and that
adopting this course would result in prolonged and damaging litigation. The DTI also
believed that cancelling the contract with ICL would damage the UK’s relationship
with Fujitsu (ICL’s parent company) with serious implications for the UK’s investment

relationship with Japan and the credibility of the overall PFI project.

56. Some of these views were reflected in a submission dated 30 July 1998 addressing
the Treasury Panel’s proposals [WITN0420_01/23, BEISO000141]. The DTI did not
consider ‘Option 2’ (Horizon without the BPC) to be commercially realistic because
the départment did not believe that ICL would agree to proceed on this basis unless
they were compensated for their development costs and lost revenue stream which
would mean the government would have to pay for the BPC whether or not they
used it. The DTI also argued that removing the BPC would result in POCL losing
revenue from the BA as well as a loss in footfall, and that POCL would .be more
likely to keep benefits customers if there was a migration to ACT via the payment ,
card rather than a straight move to ACT. The DTI favoured Option 1 (restructuring

the project to go forwards with the BPC).

57. The DTI’s view of ICL’s November proposal (Horizon with BPC for a short period
while the Post Office implemented banking facilities) is recorded in the Horizon
Progress Report dated November 1998 [WITN0420_01/21, WITN04200104]. Both
the DTI and POCL were of the view that ICL had moved significantly in its
negotiating position and showed signs of being prepared to move further. They
believed that, with more time, an acceptable position could be negotiated.

Page 19 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

58. The DTI’s view of ICL’s December 1998 offer was set out in a letter from Peter
Mandelson to Stephen Byers dated 10 December 1998 [WITN0420_01/13,
BE!S0000418]. In the letter, Peter Mandelson stated his view that the choice was
between proceeding with Horizon and the BPC (on the basis of ICL’s December
1998 proposal) or ‘a step into the unknown’. He considered the best outcome for the
Horizon project was a fully automated Post Office that would be capable of handling
the BPC as well as front-end banking facilities. which would promote the
Government’s social banking and ‘modern electronic government’ policies. Not
accepting ICL’s offer would delay the modernisation of POCL, risked the loss of
POCL customers and undermining the confidence of sub-postmasters with
consequent risks of network closures and ‘political fallout’. He also voiced concerns
that the UK’s relationship with Fujitsu and the credibility of PFI would be damaged.
Although the cost of the project had increased, he believed that proceeding with it
made more commercial sense than terminating it. The DTI position was consistent
of that of the Post Office Board who were in favour of proceeding on the basis of the

ICL offer [WITN0420_01/12POL00028329].

59. In a letter dated 14 December 1998, lan McCartney, Minister of State at the DTI, set
out the DTI’s position disagreeing with the points made in my letter of 11 December
1998 and making the case for continuing with Horizon on the basis of the ICL

proposals [WITN0420_01/24, BEIS0000400].

60. The DTI view of my proposal of 22 December 1998 to Stephen Byers is reflected in
DT! submissions: of the same date [WITN0420_01/25, _BEIS0000394;
WITN0420_01/26, BEISO000396; and WITN0420_01/14, BEISO000395] and a

Page 20 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITNO04200100

letter from lan McCartney to the Prime Minister dated 23 December 1998
[WITN0420_01/27, CBO00000037]. The view of DT! officials was that my proposal
was a version of the Treasury Panel’s ‘Option 2’ which the DTI continued to view as
commercially unworkable, primarily because they did not believe that ICL would
agree to it. The DTI also disagreed with the DSS analysis as to the costs/benefits of

the various options.

HM Treasury

61. The role of HM Treasury (‘HMT’) in the Horizon negotiations was focussed on
managing the Government's expenditure in relation to the project: HMT also led a
Horizon Working Group which was responsible for overseeing the project and its
work included convening the Treasury Panel that reported in July 1998, and
appointing Graham Corbett as the independent advisor to the contractual
negotiations. The Chief Secretary took forward the negotiation process in November
and December 1998, including by seeking to obtain consensus in relation to a final

proposal to be put to the Prime Minister.

62. A DTI submission dated 8 September 1998 [WITN0420_01/18, BEIS000127]
records the view of Stephen Byers that, if HMG were effectively subsidising POCL
by using the less efficient BPC rather than ACT, then the justification for continuing
the project would need to be that it provided the best means of sustaining the
network of post offices. He asked for further work to be done to assist in this analysis

[WITN0420_01/18, BEISO00127].

Page 21 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

63. By December 1998, the Treasury was focussed on bringing the Horizon negotiations
to a close. On 8 December 1998, Stephen Byers convened a briefing for Ministers
by the public sector parties and asked that the presentations be focussed on the
fallback options if the project were to be cancelled. He also asked officials to prepare
an exit strategy [WITN0420_01/28, BEISO000101 and WITN0420_01/11,
POL00028634]. A DSS submission of the same date noted that Stephen Byers’
personal view was that the Horizon programme was the wrong decision in the first
place and he considered that the DSS alternative (moving straight to ACT using
POCL banking facilities) was a ‘doable’ solution. However, the same submission
noted that Mr Byers view remained that he would prefer to find a way to continuing

with the Horizon project if at all possible [WITN0420_01/29, DWP00000015].

64.-A DSS submission dated 16 December 1998 noted that, following an ‘informal steer’
from the Prime Minister, Mr Byers was looking to a solution which re-affirmed
commitment to the project and to ICL while seeking to engage with ICL to find an
alternative which better met the Government's objectives. The submission
described this approach as “Option 2, but re-packaged to give prominence to a re-

commitment to ICL/Fujitsu” [WITN0420_01/30, WITN04200105].
The No 10 Policy Unit

65. The No 10 Policy Unit madé a number of recommendations to the Prime Minister in

relation to the Horizon project.

66. A DSS submission dated 17 August 1998 [WITN0420_01/16, WITN04200101]

noted that the No 10 Policy Unit were exploring variants on a cancellation option

Page 22 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

and that their ‘emerging view’ was that the main advantage to the Horizon project
was to support the Post Office network which could be done as well if not better in
other ways. The No 10 Policy Unit was said to be interested in exploring the potential
links with wider government objectives to promote universal banking and social

inclusion and its IT/Electronic Government objectives.

67. A DTI submission dated 8 September 1998 [WITN0420_01/18, BEIS0000127]
summarised the conclusions of a joint HMT/No 10 Policy Unit paper which
recommended the continuation of the Horizon Project subject to the following
conditions: (a) ICL committed to suitable terms within one month; (b) DSS were
given a firm date on which they could replace the BPC with ACT; (c) the Post Office
strengthened its management of POCL and explored partnerships with the private
sector; (d) a strategy was prepared for more transparent funding for POCL; and (e)
a.strategy was prepared for the migration from the BPC to a multifunctional
smartcard. The Policy Unit’s view on Option 2 (Horizon without the BPC) was said
to be that it was difficult to assess whether the solution was commercially viable or

made sense in technical terms.

The technical integrity and robustness of Horizon

68. | have been asked what | understood about the technical integrity and robustness

of Horizon at this time.

69. As will be clear from the above, throughout this period the primary focus of
Ministerial discussions was on what shape the contract with ICL should take and,

critically, whether or not the BPC should be part of it. In my view, the issue did not

Page 23 of 46
70.

71.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

turn on whether it was technically possible to deliver the BPC but rather whether the

BPC was the right mechanism to reform benefits payments.

That is not to say that technical issues played no part in our discussions. As noted,
by March 1998 as Chief Secretary | had reached the view that it was necessary to
receive advice on, amongst other things, whether the project was technically viable
[WITN0420_01/5, CBO00000017] and the Interdepartmental group had
commissioned the Treasury Panel review pursuant to Terms of Reference that
included consideration of “whether the project can deliver a fully functioning system
which meets the project specification and integrates fully with BA and POCL
computer systems” [WITN0420_01/7, POLO0028094]. The Treasury Panel
concluded that the programme as originally conceived was “technically viable” and,
although there was some risk around “scaleability and robustness’ these risks were
being well managed by ICL. The Panel also noted that “the basic infrastructure is
very robust for the future and, in the main, industry standard products have been

used” [WITN0420_01/7, POL00028094].

On the basis of the Treasury Panel's conclusions | was satisfied that ICL was
capable of delivering the project in technical terms although, owing to their
performance up until that point, | had some doubts as to whether they could do so
in accordance with the Government's timescales. | was also aware during this period
that work was ongoing at official level in relation to the BPC, including in relation to
its technical requirements. | note, by way of example, the reference in the July 1998
Pathway Monthly Progress Report [WITN0420_01/31, FUJ00058175] to the BA’s
targets with respect to technical issues such as transaction reconciliation errors.

Page 24 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

72. Had the BPC element of the project proceeded it would have been necessary for
there to have been clear evidence the system worked in practice before it was used
to deliver benefits to thousands of people. For this reason, | was concerned to
ensure that appropriate provision was made in the contractual arrangements for

comprehensive testing of the BPC in a ‘live’ environment.

Interdepartmental discussions

73. | have been asked to what extent were the inter-departmental discussions about the
future of Horizon influenced, at this stage, by the financial consequences of
terminating the project, wider concerns about foreign investment in the UK economy,

and issues concerning the technical integrity and robustness of the system.

74. As noted, termination was one of a number of options considered by the
Government in relation to the future of the Horizon project. Given the scale of the
project, and the level of public expenditure involved, the financial implications of
each option were an important aspect of the decision-making and in ensuring that
the project represented overall value for money. For this reason, the financial
consequences of terminating the project were considered very carefully. This is
reflected in a number of the contemporaneous documents, including a DSS
submission dated 17 August 1998 [WITN0420_01/16, WITN04200101] and the
Horizon working group report dated 14 December 1998 [WITN0420_01/28,
BEIS0000101]. Similarly, a note of a meeting between myself and DSS officials on

18 August 1998 records my view that, while | was in no doubt that | wanted to get

Page 25 of 46
75.

76.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

out of the contract, | needed a clear statement of the costs involved

[WITN0420_01/32, WITN04200106).

Ultimately the financial costs of termination were one factor in the decision-making
process, which were weighed against the financial costs of the other options, and
the other factors relevant to the decision (welfare reform, the need to maintain the

Post Office network etc), in order to reach the right decision.

As to wider concerns about foreign investment, this was also an important
consideration, particularly for the DTI. The DTI’s concerns are reflected in a number
of the contemporaneous documents throughout this period which pointed to the risk
that termination would cause ICL to fail, prevent Fujitsu from floating ICL on the
stock-market and damage the UK’s reputation as an investment partner for
Japan/Japanese companies and globally. These risks were also being emphasised
by Fujitsu in meetings with senior officials, including DTI Ministers and HM
Ambassador in Tokyo. There were also concerns about the impact on the UK
economy should the project fail, including potential job losses at ICL and damage to
the PFI initiative by deterring other private sector partners from entering into large
public/private IT projects in’ the future [WITNO420_01/23, BEIS0000141;
WITN0420_01/18, BEIS0000127; WITN0420_01/28, BEIS0000101;
WITN0420_01/24, BEIS0000400; WITNO0420_01/14, BEIS0000395;
WITN0420_01/33, | BEISO000336; WITN0420_01/34, BEIS0000337; and

WITN0420_01/21, WITN04200104].

Page 26 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

77.Asa member of the Government, | took these concerns seriously but | did not
consider them determinative. My overriding consideration was. to reach the right
decision for the Government as a whole in relation to Horizon, particularly in
circumstances where ICL was in breach of contract for failure to deliver its part of

the contractual arrangements.

78. | have addressed the relevance of the technical integrity and robustness of the

system above.

Acceptance testing

79. | have been asked to explain what | understood ICL’s proposals to be, at this stage,
in relation to acceptance testing of the Horizon system and whether | considered the

proposals to be acceptable.

80. As noted in the Treasury Panel’s report, one of the problems facing the Horizon
project in July 1998 was that the ‘Acceptance Plan’ (i.e. the process whereby the
system would be signed off as meeting its technical specifications) had not yet been
agreed [WITN0420_01/7, POL00028094]. The matter had not been settled by
October 1998 when Graham Corbett completed his report [WITN0420_01/10,

POL00028098].

81. My understanding of ICL’s November 1998 proposal was reflected in a draft letter
dated 10 November 1998 [WITN0420_01/35, DWP00000376] in which | noted that
ICL were asking for acceptance on the basis of laboratory testing of the systems as

opposed to a live trial. This was the approach followed during a trial of the National

Page 27 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

Insurance Recording System (NIRS2) project where the system was fully accepted
in a test environment but did not work in the field. | noted that the BPC system would
affect approximately 15 million people, many of whom were dependent on timely
and accurate payment of their benefits for their livelihoods, and | was not prepared

to take the risk that the system would not work in practice.

82. A Horizon Progress report dated approximately 16 November 1998
[WITN0420_01/21, WITN04200104] also noted that ICL was proposing a high
threshold for the number of ‘allowable faults’ that would be permitted which neither

the BA nor POCL could agree to.
The December 1998 proposal

83. My view of ICL’s revised December offer was that there had been no material
change in relation to acceptance testing. This is set out in a letter to the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury dated 11 December 1998 [WITN0420_01/22,

BEIS0000417}.
84. The letter stated:

“On the specific conditions that the proposals seem to involve, | could not
agree to the proposed approach to “acceptance testing”. ICL persist in
asking for acceptance on the basis of a laboratory test of the systems as
opposed to live trial - particularly important when for our customers it is the
service that is the crucial end product. In fact, the approach being suggested

by ICL is almost exactly that followed under the NIRS2 project, where the

Page 28 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

system was fully accepted in a test environment, but did not work in the field.
1 am not prepared to sign up to another NIRS2 experience! In any event,
when we are talking about a system which is affecting around 15 million
people, many of whom are dependent on timely and accurate payment of
their benefits for their livelihoods, the political risks are huge if the system is
not tested properly beforehand to make sure it works. This is a risk | am not

prepared to take”

85. The DTI argued that the proposals were not confined to laboratory tests because
there would be live trials at 300 Post Offices [WITN0420_01/24, BEISO000400],
however my view was that this was insufficient given the overall number of post
offices (in a Parliamentary debate on 13 January 1999, the number of post offices
was given as 18,000 [WITN0420_01/36, DWP00000084)). It has to be appreciated
that a missed payment, or a payment that was wrong even by a relatively small
amount, has the potential to have a big impact on someone on a low income and
there was a very real risk that a mistake of this nature could cause real hardship

which is why we were concerned about it.

86. As will be clear from the above, | did not consider the ICL proposals on acceptance

testing to be acceptable.

ICL Pathway’s December 1998 proposals

87. | have been asked how | responded to ICL’s December 1998 proposals. | have

answered this question above.

Page 29 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

January to May 1999

Problems facing Horizon

88. | have been asked to explain the problems faced by the Horizon project between

January and May 1999.

89. The problems experienced in July to December 1998 (explained above) persisted
into 1999, although by January 1999 the need to make a decision had become
urgent. There had also been changes to the Ministerial appointments in two of the
departments involved in the Horizon decision-making: on 23 December 1998
Stephen Byers had replaced Peter Mandelson as Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, and Alan Milburn had replaced Stephen Byers as Chief Secretary to the

Treasury.

90. The urgency of the need for a decision was reflected in a draft letter from Stephen
Byers to the Prime Minister written in mid-January [WITN0420_01/37,
POL00028606] which noted that the failure to reach a decision was already
damaging the UK’s relationship with Fujitsu and there was a risk that the negative
perception would spread to the wider Japanese investor community. The draft letter
also referred to a forthcoming Fujitsu board meeting on 22 January 1999 and
expressed Stephen Byers’ concern that, if no decision had been made by that date,

Fujitsu would instruct ICL to terminate the contract and sue for damages.

Page 30 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

The views of Government departments

91.1 have been asked whether there was agreement between Government
departments as to the future of Horizon during this period. As | will explain in the
paragraphs that follow, and based on the papers that | have seen, by May 1999

agreement had been reached.

92. In January 1999, the DTI remained of the view that proceeding with Horizon without
the BPC was unlikely to be negotiable with ICL and was not the best way to achieve
the early introduction of a smart card and the early adoption of the Horizon
infrastructure. The DTI believed that a Post Office smart card would be more
marketable if it began life as the BPC because of the customer base that this would
ensure. These views were expressed in the draft letter to the Prime Minister written

in mid-January 1999 [WITN0420_01/38, BEIS0000167].

93. However, at around the same time, Alan Milburn asked the Second Permanent
Secretary at the Treasury, Steve Robson, to look for a way forward for the Horizon
project which met Ministers’ objectives and which did not include the BPC. An HMT
submission dated 1 February 1999 noted that Steve Robson had been discussing a
potential option with ICL that would involve a direct move to paying benefits by ACT
into new Post Office bank accounts accessible at Post Offices via a smartcard
[WITN0420_01/39, HMT00000015]. This option is referred to as ‘Option 2A’ in the
documents and is explained in detail in an HMT note [WITN0420_01/40,

HMT00000011].

Page 31 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITNO04200100

94. As noted in an HMT letter dated 11 February 1999, both Stephen Byers and | agreed
to give the proposal further consideration [WITN0420_01/41, HMT00000017] and
on 24 February 1999 Alun Milburn wrote to the Prime Minister to inform him that
Stephen Byers and | had confirmed in writing our support in principle for this option

[WITN0420_01/42, HMT00000014).

95. The case for proceeding with Horizon without the BPC is set out in Alun Milburn’s
minute ‘to the Prime Minister dated 24 February 1999 [WITN0420_01/42,
HMT00000014]. In particular, it was considered that payment by ACT into post office
bank accounts would meet the DSS objective of using the most efficient means
available for payment of benefits (ACT) while maintaining footfall in post offices and
giving the Post Office a customer base to whom to market other smartcard services.
\It would also promote the Government's objectives for the delivery of modern
government services and combating financial exclusion by providing simple bank
accounts to all benefits recipients. Financial analysis in an Annex suggested that
the net present value (‘NPV’) for Option 1 (Horizon with the BPC) was better than

Option 2A (Horizon without BPC) but noted that the modelling was uncertain.

96. In a letter dated 1 March 1999, the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary
stated that, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's slight concern about the NPV
calculations and the greater risks of Option 2A, he considered the option could offer
significant benefits, including by providing the Post Office with a platform for the
provision of electronic Government services, something to which he attached
considerable importance. The Prime Minister therefore agreed that the Government

should confirm to ICL in principle that we were keen to pursue the new approach

Page 32 of 46
97.

98.

99.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

and asked that the Post Office be given a clear message that the Government
wanted them to work seriously on the new approach [WITN0420_01/43,
BEIS0000375]. On 8 March 1999, a letter was sent to ICL confirming that the Prime
Minister had agreed that negotiations should proceed in relation to Option 2A

[WITN0420_01/40, HMT00000011:;).

By April 1998, ICL had formally withdrawn its December offer which meant there
was no longer an option that involved the Horizon system with the BPC. In any
event, by this stage the Treasury had concluded in a draft report that the
relationships within the project were not so dysfunctional that Option A should be

abandoned [WITN0420_01/44, DWP00000027].

The DSS view of Option 2A (now being referred to as ‘Option B1’) is recorded in a
submission dated 8 April 1999 [WITN0420_01/45, DWP00000016]. The DSS
strongly supported this option subject to reassurances as to the “handling of risk”,
incentives to ensure a timely move to ACT and provision to ensure that the
DSS/benefits recipients were not vulnerable should ICL fail to deliver. Put simply,
the DSS was concerned about the migration to payment by ACT and the need to
ensure that this was not done in a way that would adversely affect the millions or

people who received social security benefits.

A Treasury submission dated 5 May 1999 [WITN0420_01/46, HMT00000022}

outlined the options under consideration at this stage:

(a) ‘Option B1’ (Horizon without the BPC but with POCL banking services);

Page 33 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

(b) ‘Option B3’ which had been worked up by the Treasury following a
proposal that | had made at a Ministerial meeting. Under this proposal,
POCL would buy ‘the automation platform from ICL and then move
straight to a network banking strategy without either the BPC or the

POCL bank; and
(c) Option C which was termination of the contract.

100. The submission noted that the DTI were likely to press for Option B1 on the basis
that it could be justified in public expenditure terms and would deliver modern
government services. The Treasury view was that Option B1 had a negative NPV
and that the value for money analysis steered in favour of Option B3 or Option C
which had similar NPVs. A detailed analysis of the financial considerations is
contained in a draft Treasury Report prepared in April 1999 [WITN0420_01/47,

DWP00000019].

101. More detail on these options was set out in a letter from Alan Milburn to the Prime
Minister on 10 May 1999 [WITNO420_01/48, HMT00000024j. The letter noted that
Stephen Byers and Charlie Falconer (who was then a Minister of State in the
Cabinet Office) preferred Option B1 because it offered the most security in footfall
in the short term, would put the Post Office in the best position to secure electronic
government business and would keep ICL/Fujitsu on board. The Post Office also
preferred Option B1 and wanted termination over Option B3, although the letter

noted that this may have been a negotiating tactic

Page 34 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

102. Ina letter from the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary dated 11 May 1999
[WITN0420_01/49, CBO00000022_002] the Prime Minister indicated that any
solution should meet three key objectives: (a) conflict with the Post Office and the
Sub-Postmasters lobby should be avoided; (b) ICL’s whole future should not be put
at risk; and (c) the Government should have a fully defensible position before the
Public Accounts Committee. The HMT submission described the negotiations
between the Government and ICL on a version of Option B3 which resulted in an
agreement in principle that POCL would buy the basic Horizon platform, the BPC
would be abandoned and the BA would move to ACT between 2003 and 2005. The
POCL and ICL would then have three months to negotiate detailed contracts and, if
agreement could not be reached, POCL would pay ICL £150million in full and final

settlement of their disputes.

103. The DSS considered this to be a very good outcome as recorded in a submission

dated 20 May 1999 [WITN0420_01/17, DWP00000018].
Technical integrity and robustness

104. | have been asked to explain what | understood about the technical integrity and

robustness of Horizon at this time.

105. As noted, the Treasury Panel had concluded in July 1998 that the project was
technically viable. This issue was revisited in the draft Treasury Report dated April
4999 which stated that ‘it was probably still the case” that the project was technically
viable but noted that, since the Treasury Panel report, there had been further

problems with testing and ICL had already missed the first milestone in the timetable

Page 35 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

agreed in the course of the Corbett negotiations. The draft Report also stated that
the BA had pointed to faults that had emerged in the latest testing of the Model
Office, POCL had deferred the final run of testing by two months to allow ICL to fix
major faults and the BA were not yet satisfied that all the problems had been
identified (although this was contested by POCL and ICL) [WITN0420_01/44,

DwpP00000027].

106. Further details in relation to the faults identified during the testing is contained in a
DSS submission dated 15 April 1999 [WITN0420_01/47, DWP00000019] which
noted POCL’s view that the targeted tests had identified and dealt with all known
faults. The BA was of the view that a further run of testing was required because
unidentified faults could put benefits payments to 60,000 Child Benefit customers at
risk, put the live trial at risk and/or create a situation where the project had to be

terminated because of failures of the software during the live trial.

107. The problems identified in these documents reinforced my belief that the contract
should be made as simple as possible and that it was right for the project to proceed
without the BPC although, as explained above, my objection to the BPC was

primarily one of principle.
Interdepartmental discussions

108. | have been asked to explain to what extent inter-departmental discussions about
the future of Horizon were influenced at this stage by the financial consequences of
terminating the project, wider concerns about foreign investment in the UK, and
issues about the technical integrity of the system.

Page 36 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

109. The influence of the first two of these factors had not changed since the period
between July-December 1998 that | have addressed above, except that by early
1999 the attitude to the cost of termination had softened in light of the comparably
high cost of the other options under consideration. This is reflected in the Treasury
submission dated 5 May 1999 [WITN0420_01/46, -HMT00000022] and the draft

Treasury Report dated April 1999 [WITN0420_01/44, DWP00000027].
"110. | have addressed the technical integrity of the system above.
The decision to cancel the BPC

111. | have been asked to explain the reasons why the DSS cancelled the BPC and to
what extent issues concerning the technical integrity and robustness of Horizon

influenced this decision. | have addressed both of these issues above.

Involvement with Horizon following the cancellation of the BPC

112. | have been asked what the nature of my involvement in the Horizon project was
after the cancellation of the BPC. From the papers that | have seen | do not believe
| had any further involvement with Horizon during my term as Secretary of State for
the DSS but without having seen all of the contemporaneous records from this
period | cannot be sure. For example, | am fairly certain that following the
cancellation of the BPC | would have been provided with advice with respect to the

introduction of ACT but | have not seen any papers covering that period.

113. | have been asked what | understood the concerns of the Benefits Agency to be in

relation to acceptance testing of the Order Book Control Service (‘OBCS’) and how

Page 37 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITNO04200100

these issues were resolved. The OBCS was an anti-fraud measure within Horizon.
| note the references in a DTI submission dated 1 July 1999 [WITN0420_01/50,
BEIS0000250], and the minutes of the Post Office Board Meeting of 19/20 July 1999
[WITN0420_01/51, POL00038846], to a disagreement between the BA and POCL
about how acceptance testing should operate in relation to the OBCS
[WITN0420_01/51, POL00038846]. These documents suggest that the BA wanted
to have its own acceptance process and POCL had proposed a compromise

whereby they would share the results of their acceptance testing with the BA.

114. | have also been asked at what point | ceased to become involved in matters
relating to the Horizon system, what my understanding of the technical integrity and
robustness of the system was at that stage, and whether | had any concerns about
the Horizon system after my period in office as Secretary of State for the DSS. As
noted above, between 5 May 2006 and 28. June 2007 | was Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry. None of the papers that | have been provided with cover this
period. | would be happy to assist the Inquiry with further information if it is required
but, if | am to do so, | would need to see the relevant contemporaneous

documentation.

The Communication Workers Union _and_the National Federation of Sub-

postmasters

115. | have been asked what | understood the position of the Communication Workers
Union (‘CWU’), and the National Federation of Sub-postmasters (‘NFSP’), to be in

relation to Horizon. The NFSP’s position was set out in the correspondence from

Page 38 of 46
WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

the General Secretary between August and November 1998. The Federation
believed that the BPC was an essential part of the Horizon project and that, without
it, the survival of thousands of sub post offices would be put at risk along with the
stability, and future survival, of the wider network. The NFSP also strongly supported
the Government's proposals for a single Government account and believed that the
Post Office and Horizon could play a key role in this agenda [WITN0420_01/52,
NFSP00000425; WITN0420_01/53, NFSP00000250; WITN0420_01/54,
NFSP00000437; and WITN0420_01/55, NFSP00000368]. My recollection is that
the CWU took a similar view but | cannot see any reference to this in the

documentation that | have been provided with.

116. | have been asked to what extent, if at all, representations from the CWU and/or
the NFSP influenced government policy on the future of the Horizon project. As
noted above, maintaining a post office network was an important government policy
which is why | was keen for POCL to have an automated system that would allow
anyone to use the Post Office as a matter of choice. As | have explained, | had real
doubts about whether it was right to compel people to use the Post Office which was
one of my core objections to the BPC. The views of both the CWU and the NFSB
weighed heavily with ministers, particularly with the DT! who had primary
responsibility for the Post Office. However, we ultimately had to make a decision
that met all of the government's policy. objectives and one of the problems with BPC
had always been that it amounted to a hidden subsidy to the Post Office in that it
involved procuring a product that the BA did not really need for the commercial

benefit of POCL.

WITNO04200100
WITN04200100

Scrutiny of technical issues

117. | have been asked whether | feel that | was properly informed of issues concerning
the technical integrity and robustness of Horizon during the period of my involvement
and whether | feel that Government effectively scrutinised the technical integrity and

robustness of Horizon during its negotiations with ICL about the future of the project.

118. As | have explained, between July 1998 and May 1999 Ministers were primarily
concerned with how to move Horizon forward and, in particular, whether to retain
the BPC. DSS Ministers were kept informed about technical issues that had
occurred during the laboratory testing of the BPC but these problems did not
necessarily mean the system lacked technical integrity or that the problems
identified during the testing phase could not ultimately be resolved. As | have
explained, had the BPC proceeded my view was that it would have required
extensive ‘live’ testing in the field before it could be accepted and rolled out to
benefits customers, but it never reached that stage because the Government
decided that the payment card should be cancelled. | believe that the level of
Government scrutiny of the technical integrity and robustness of Horizon during the

negotiations, was appropriate given that the product was still being tested.

Any other matters

119. |am asked whether there are any other matters that | think will assist the Chair. In
this statement | have sought to address all the questions asked of me but | remain

willing to address further matters if the Inquiry has additional questions. As noted, if

Page 40 of 46

WITN04200100

the Inquiry would like me to address any later periods in which | held office then |

would need sight of the relevant contemporaneous material in order to do so.

Statement of Truth

| believe the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
