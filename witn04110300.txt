POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

THIRD WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS

1, MR JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. As noted in my first witness statement dated 4 August 2022, | am currently
employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) as a Team Leader within the
Software Support Centre for the Horizon IT System (the “SSC”), a position |

have held since 2010.

2. This third witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Requests provided to
Fujitsu on 16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023 (together, the “Requests”), to the
extent | have or had direct knowledge of such matters. This third witness
statement is intended to supplement the information provided in my second

witness statement dated 30 August 2023 (“Second Witness Statement”).

3. The nature and potential significance of the matters set out in this statement
came to light on 6 December 2023, and there is an ongoing operational

investigation with which | am assisting. In order to bring this matter to the

Page 1 of 11

WITNO04110300

attention of the Inquiry as soon as possible, this statement was drafted with
assistance from Morrison Foerster, the recognised legal representatives for
Fujitsu in the Inquiry, in a limited timeframe. It may be necessary to further
supplement the information provided in this statement, as my knowledge and

understanding of the issues develop.

4. Where | have referred to documents to assist my preparation of responses to

the Requests, the URNs of the relevant documents are set out in this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. In the Requests, the Inquiry asked Fujitsu for confirmation of whether it was
aware of any cases where an ARQ log was provided to Post Office Limited
(“POL”) or Royal Mail for court or disciplinary proceedings or an investigation
in relation to an SPM, manager or assistant that was, or may be, unreliable. In
paragraph 7 of my Second Witness Statement, | stated that | was not in a
position to respond to the Inquiry’s questions surrounding the reliability of the
audit archive or the ARQ data provided to POL over time because, for security
reasons, the SSC was and continues to be segregated from the audit function.
Further, the SSC has no direct access to (i) the audit data held in data centres,
(ii) the audit tools, or (iii) which files, logs messagestore information etc. are

collected for audit. Neither has the SSC ever supported the audit platform.

6. While this remains the case, since providing my Second Witness Statement |
have become aware of an incident whereby ARQ data which was recently
provided to POL for the Apex Corner branch (with FAD code 097005) (“Apex
Corner’) did not contain a complete record of the transactions that took place

in that branch (the “Apex Corner Incident”).

7. The circumstances which gave rise to the Apex Corner Incident require
specialist knowledge of the operation of the system and, in particular, the
lifecycle of transactions from the counter to the audit archive. Given my role in
the SSC, | am working with other technical and operational staff within Fujitsu
to investigate the causes of the Apex Corner Incident and to understand as far

as possible the nature and extent of its impact.

8. My knowledge of the Apex Corner Incident as at the date of this third witness

statement is set out below.

LIFECYCLE OF A TRANSACTION IN LEGACY HORIZON

9. Under Legacy Horizon, messages (including transaction messages) were
written to the Riposte message store on the local counter disk. They were then
replicated locally to other counters within the branch or, in single counter
branches (such as Apex Corner), to internal removeable mirror disks. Legacy
Horizon was primarily an offline system, so the messages would be sent to the
Correspondence Servers periodically or immediately depending upon the
network configuration. Every branch was assigned to one of four ‘Clusters’, and
this controlled which Correspondence Server messages from that branch
replicated to. There were 16 Correspondence Servers, and each one only
contained messages for a single Cluster. Once in the Correspondence Servers,
the Audit Harvester program would copy all messages from the
Correspondence Server (i.e. a single Cluster) to a series of flat text files labelled
by Data Center, Cluster and date. For ease, these are referred to in this

statement as “TMS Cluster Files” but this is not a term | would use day to day.

WITNO04110300

Depending on the number of messages in each Correspondence Server, there

may be more than one TMS Cluster File for each day.

10. From conversations | had during the course of the weeks commencing 4 and
11 December 2023 with members of the audit team, including Gerald Barnes, |
understand that the TMs Cluster Files would be stored in the audit archive
according to the date they were securely copied and accepted (“sealed”) by the
audit archive. For the reasons | state in paragraph 5 above, this process is

outside my area of knowledge.

THE APEX CORNER INCIDENT

11. On 3 November 2023, | was informed by Morrison Foerster and members of
Fujitsu’s legal team that Peters & Peters Solicitors LLP (“Peters & Peters”) had
raised some questions regarding some transactions that took place at Apex

Corner in March/April 2008.

12. | was shown the following documents, which | understand were provided to

Morrison Foerster by Peters & Peters:

a. aspreadsheet containing an extract from the messagestore for Apex Corner
for the period 1 January 2008 to 31 October 2008 (FUJ00234830). | have
since been made aware by Morrison Foerster that this spreadsheet was a
compilation of ARQ data that was provided by Fujitsu on 4 September 2023,
in response to an ARQ Request issued by POL on 11 August 2023 (the

“September 2023 ARQ data”) (FUJ00234843).

b. a document titled “Sathyan — KSO6” (FUJ00234827) which appears to be a

girocheque report dated 10 April 2008 (the “April 2008 girocheque

WITNO04110300
WITNO04110300

report”). | was informed that the first 13 transactions listed in this report
were missing from the September 2023 ARQ data (the “13 Missing

Girocheque Transactions’).

In paragraph 22 of my Second Witness Statement, | explained the individual
components of transaction IDs, including the counter position where the
relevant transaction took place. The 13 Missing Girocheque Transactions each
contain a counter position which is stated to be “11”. It was usual practice for
the SSC to use ‘virtual’ counter numbers when recovering transactions to
ensure that the Session and Transaction identifiers remained unique. It was my
view that the use of counter position “11”, when there had been very few
branches with more than 10 counters, indicated that these transactions

appeared to have been ones which were manually reinserted by the SSC.

While | was able to identify the 13 Missing Girocheque Transactions as ones
which had likely been reinserted, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 4 and
12 above it was not clear to me why they did not appear in the September 2023

ARQ data.

Based on a review of operational records for the relevant period, | now

understand that:

a. The counter in use at Apex Corner suffered a network failure on 13 March
2008 and was non-polling until a replacement counter base unit was

installed on 20 March 2008 (FUJ00234847; FUJ00234850).

b. For the period that Apex Corner was non-polling, transaction messages

were stored locally on the counter disk and mirror disk but were not

Page 5 of 11
WITNO04110300
WITNO04110300

replicated to the Correspondence Server. When the counter was replaced,
the mirror disk should have been removed from the original counter and
swapped to the replacement counter. If this was done, transactions stored
on this mirror disk would replicate to the new counter disk and the
Correspondence Server when the replacement counter was connected to

the Horizon network, and the branch records would be brought up to date.

. However, when the base unit was replaced, the engineer failed to swap the
mirror disk. This resulted in just under 8,000 messages dating from the
period the branch was non-polling (i.e. 13 to 20 March 2008) being
‘marooned’ on the mirror disk and therefore never entered into the counter
or Data Center (FUJ00234852). Of these messages, 1,964 related to

transactions (the “Marooned Transactions”) (FUJ00234850).

. The mirror disk was physically delivered to the SSC on 28 March 2008
(FUJ00234848) so that the Marooned Transactions could be recovered and
manually inserted to the Correspondence Server. This was the only way the
Marooned Transactions could be recovered and branch records brought up
to date. Once the counter was replaced and recovered to an operational
state from the messages held in the Data Centre, it would have started to
reuse the unique Counter message numbers (NUM) and potentially the
Session and Transaction identifiers of the Marooned Transactions, for new
transactions. Therefore, the mirror disk could not be swapped to the
replacement counter once that counter was operational. The original
counter, with the mirror disk and a PMMC card, would need to be sent to

the SSC in order to extract the Marooned Transactions. From these, the

SSC would modify the unique identifiers in order to enable them to be re-
inserted into the Correspondence Server successfully, which would allow
them to replicate down to the branch. This process would correct the branch
accounts, however any recovered APS transactions would fail to be
harvested because they have a digital signature and modification of the
transaction attributes would cause the APS Harvester to reject them. These
transactions would be sent manually to POL using the BIMS process
(FUJ00234853) for onward transmission to AP Clients — this would delay
the customer payments reaching the AP Clients, but would not affect branch

accounts.

e. The Marooned Transactions were “Discussed with PM” and reinserted by

the SSC on 4 April 2008 (FUJ00234852; FUJ00234850).

As | mention in paragraph 13 above, when transactions were recovered in this
way, the SSC typically used a virtual branch counter number in the Riposte
message attributes to avoid conflict with newly entered transactions re-using
the same unique attributes. For Apex Corner, the SSC incremented the real
counter node number in the Counter, Session and Transaction identifiers
(counter 1) by 10 (to counter 11). The original message number, Session and
Transaction identifiers for the recovered transactions would have been re-used
by the replacement counter when it was connected to the Horizon network, as
it would have followed sequentially from the last transaction copied to the

Correspondence Server by the original counter. Other than this, transactions

which were reinserted retained their original attributes, including the date they

took place in the branch.

17. The Marooned Transactions (including the 13 Missing Girocheque
Transactions) were inserted to the Correspondence Server on 4 April 2008 and

were harvested into the TMS Cluster Files for that date.

ARQ EXTRACTION PROCESS

18. | My understanding of the process for extracting ARQ data is primarily based on
conversations | have had recently with other members of the team investigating
the Apex Corner ARQ Incident, such as Gerald Barnes. In particular, |
understand from conversations during the week commencing 4 December

2023 that:

a. the Fast ARQ process for extracting one calendar month of ARQ data, which
has been in place since the transition from Legacy Horizon to HNG-X in
2010, does not always account for transactions that are sealed to the audit
archive more than a few days after the end of the calendar month during
which the transactions took place. Consequently, the Marooned
Transactions (which were sealed on 4 April 2008) were not retrieved by the

process that was run when extracting the ARQ data for March 2008.

b. the Fast ARQ process filters transactions that were sealed within each
calendar month by the ‘start date’ of the transaction (i.e. the date the
transaction took place in the branch). As the Marooned Transactions had a
start date of 13-20 March 2008, they were not retrieved by the process that

was run when extracting the ARQ data for April 2008.

WITNO04110300
WITNO04110300

| now understand it is for these reasons that the 13 Missing Girocheque

Transactions were not included in the September 2023 ARQ data.

In general, a delay between (i) the date a transaction was carried out, and (ii)
the date it was sealed to the Audit Archive could be caused by a number of
things, such as counter hardware problems (as was the case at Apex Corner)
or network connectivity problems. If these delays extended beyond two or three
days into the next calendar month, it is possible that they would not be identified
in ARQ returns that are prepared following the Fast ARQ process that has been
in place since 2010. The Apex Corner Incident is the only such incident | am

aware of, but it is possible that the reliability of other historic ARQs is affected.

As | mention above, | am currently working with relevant technical and
operational staff at Fujitsu to understand the nature and extent of the impact of
the Apex Corner Incident. The focus of our investigations to date has been on
transactions that took place under Legacy Horizon, as this is the system that
was in operation at Apex Corner in March and April 2008. There has been only
one instance of a transaction requiring a correction by the SSC under HNG-X.
| have checked the attributes of this transaction, and it has an insert date equal
to the transaction start date. Further, the HNG-X system, as an online system,
does not have the potential for delays in the same way that Legacy Horizon did,
as a predominantly offline system. | do not have any knowledge of the audit
process under HNG-X, but these are relevant considerations in the
investigation that is being undertaken into whether the Apex Corner Incident

may also affect HNG-X transactions.
