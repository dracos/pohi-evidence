Subject: RE: Issues with a Slow ARQ
Hi Jason,

Duplicates are OK for Horizon — sometimes multiple copies of the data were stored.
There is a tool in c:\Program Files\AuditExtractorClient called AEAdmin.exe.

If you run that and supply a password that I will instant message you then it has a facility to close ARQs that
cannot normally be closed. It is only to be used in extreme cases since it does no checking.

Regards,
Gerald Barnes

Subject: Issues with a Slow ARQ

Hi Gerald/Alan,
Hope your well.
Need your assistance please if you don’t mind.....

Ive run some Slow ARQ’s recently as the original Fast ARQ’s returned no data and we were aware that the particular FAD had
data on a different cluster. When I run the slow ARQ’s they all returned data ok. However, ive a couple of issues:-

¢ Most of the ARQ’s run (Six) have returned duplicate data (as shown in the summary tabs of the excel files)

© When I originally first run the slow ARQ’s, the AE client crashed and I now have 3 ARQ’s that I cannot close, they seem
to be stuck and are saying that they Cannot be closed as Sealing is in progress. (They have been like this for over a
week now)

I'd be very grateful if you can advise on these two issues.

Many Thanks,
