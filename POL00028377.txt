Subject: FW: CAPs and Cards Programme Board questions

The questions below have come from Vince Gaskell today in response to the CAPs Board Report which
we sent to them. Dave Miller will be asked for a detailed update on these on Thursday when he
attends the Board meeting. Could you provide this at the HMT meeting tomorrow(Wed. am)?

Dara,
(Janet and Bob - FYI)

Below is the list of questions that Dave Miller may be asked by Vince Gaskell at the CAPS and Cards
Programme Board (on Thursday?/Friday?).

We need to provide the answers for Dave so he can be prepared so I suggest that this is passed to the
attendees of the HMT meeting tomorrow for that very purpose.

a Issue No 7 (RED): All Acceptance Specs to have been signed off by Mid-November.
wher: JM.

What is the latest information on this? How many Acc Specs remain ‘to be signed off? When do we
think they will be complete?

2) Issue No 3 (RED): Inability to achieve satisfactory cash account balancing. Owner: SR/JW.
What is the impact on future testing phases? There is concern at CAPS that re-scoping the testing
phases may mean de-scoping - how can we reassure them?

3) Issue No 5:(AMBER): Three key areas of functionality (Ref Data, TIP, BES) which cross delivery
boundaries at a Programme level are insufficiently well proven to have confidence that further
significant work will not be required as the result of MOR3 and E2E phase 2. Owner: SR/JW
What is the latest update on progress with this issue?

4) Issue No 9 (GREEN): POCL have expressed dissatisfaction with an aspect of the BES fallback
recovery process. As it is now too late to change Pathway design thismust be considered to be release
threatening. Owner: JM

What has happened to enable this issue to be closed? The statement “This is no longer a Programme
issue" is not enough!

For information: Issue 10 (GREEN/Closed): BA are unable to confirm the policy for the declaration to be
made when CAPS contingency payments are collected by the customer, consequently there is not an
agreed NR2 process. This is likely to be a Seals of Approval issue. Owner: JM

Although this is closed on our register, Vince will probably update DM on this as it was escalated to the
CAPS Programme Executive Team for resolution.

Anthony Waddington is the CAPS PMO representative who is trying to co-ordinate the answers. I'm not
too sure why he needs to co-ordinate the answers if Vince is going to ask the questions, however, I
would like the answers so that I can update the risk register.

regards, Sue .
