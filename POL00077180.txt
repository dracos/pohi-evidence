Hi All,

Below is a table that lists the MPs with a high-profile case.

POL-0073743
POLO0077180
POL00077180

Mark Davies and Angela VDB have already met Stephen Mosley so they may want to do so again by way of an update. I
suggest that when James A has sent his invite out (David please let us know when this happens) we sent a follow-up
email (already drafted) and for the MPs below we add in a line about wanting to arrange a meeting with them? I will
then follow-up with a call to the office. I suggest the meeting should include someone from Public Affairs (Jane or I) and
the Belinda, David, Angela (depending on complexity of the case).

In some of these case we are not likely to meet with the MP e.g. George O but at least we would have made the offer.
Please see suggested email and names of MPs below.

Thanks

Sophie

SUBJECT: Post Office Update: Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme

DEAR XX MP,

As you may be aware the Post Office has established a scheme to help resolve the concerns raised by some sub
postmasters regarding the Post Office’s Horizon computer system. The scheme is being overseen by a Working Group,
with an independent Chair (Sir Anthony Hooper, a former Appeal Court Judge) comprising representatives from Post
Office, Second Sight and JFSA.

You will have received an invite from James Arbuthnot’s to a meeting on the 24" March and an offer to meet with the
Post Office individually to discuss the scheme. Please do let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to
meet with us (either before or afier the 24" March) — we'd be more than happy to do so.
