Rod,

Office Limited & Fujitsu Services_ 28 March ....docx

Updated to cover the NDA.

Many thanks

Dear Chris,

Please find attached a final version of the NDA for signature.

Thank you for providing the Report last week. We have reviewed it carefully and added a number of questions/requests
for clarification as comments — please see attached. I'd be grateful if Fujitsu were able to address each of these
comments and produce an updated version of the Report. It would be very helpful for us to have that this week — please
do let me know if you do not think this will be possible.

As noted in my email of 17 March, Deloitte are engaged with us on a related piece of work - examining the key controls
that protect the integrity of non-counter transaction data. They have been asked to provide answers to the following

questions:

1

2.

Are there any gaps in the controls around non-counter initiated transactions that could call into question the
integrity of the data generated in relation to these transactions?

if there are gaps:

a. Could they be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts (or could they mean that errors in Horizon
would not be revealed and those errors could then be the cause of discrepancies in branch accounts); and
b. What is the risk of those gaps (or resulting discrepancies) materialising?

In order to be able to provide answers to these questions, Deloitte have proposed performing the following procedures:

1.

a workshop to verify Deloitte's understanding of data flows and validate the existence and completeness of

controls over the current reconciliation process, including how Transaction Acknowledgments are utilised;

2.

3.

reviewing and testing the key reconciliation controls between key data sources within the data flow as
highlighted within the table below; and
an analytics pilot to assess feasibility and then perform reconciliation between raw data files received by PODG

and the interpretation of these non-counter transactions into the BRDB transaction files.

Naturally, these will require some input from Fujitsu. I'd be grateful if you would let me know who Deloitte should
contact to progress the matter.

Kind regards,

Summarise Control Wording

1 External transactions sent via PODG such that the External Transaction files that are currently sent from
Ingenico (PAYSTATION) and Wincor Nixdorf (POST&GO) are routed to the Branch Database as well as
sending the data to the Credence system. There is a reconciliation between Credence & BRDB.

2 For each Transaction Acknowledgement generated, a new transaction pair is created for POLSAP. The
transaction delivered to POLSAP will have a Reference number that matches the reference number used in
the Transaction Acknowledgement record generation. This allows POLSAP to match with the Transaction
Acknowledgement once the TA has been accepted by the Postmaster.

30 AP Client File Reconciliation

APSS2222.ksh will reconcile the data in the files that it delivered to a Client with the data in the files that
Credence delivered to a Client.

31 TPS to AP Reconciliation

TPSC227 writes APS transaction data to a formatted file that will later be used by the APS host program
APSC2051 to reconcile data from TPS with that from APS.
