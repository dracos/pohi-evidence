Line Manager's Comments: Following my meeting with Robert, I found that he is a motivated member of the security team. He has taken
over some difficult cases from Raymond. One case is fairly intricate and has taken to bring to fruition. None of Raymond's cases were
reported to the PF, so Robert is under pressure to register them with the PF, (on-line) and progress them to the point of prosecution. He is
doing very well processing the stagnant cases and the fruits of his labour will show in the new year, although PF cases take ages to
prosecute, once it's handed over to the PF. Robert also has good ideas and is very motivated. Robert took the opportunity to liaise with the
PF and establish whether the PO Fraud Strand can assist them with a different type of report, etc. He is awaiting a date to meet with the PF.
It is also clear that he has a good working relationship with his local CM, Brian Trotter. Robert has at least double the amount of cases, due
to volume of cases raised in Scotland and the size of Scotland. Robert is the only investigator in Scotland .This has placed him under some
pressure but he is coping well. Robert has such a good relationship with the CM's and other PO staff, these cases find their way to him,
once detected. I will get the rest of the team to also take on more workload in the Scottish region, so that Robert is not overloaded. Robert
does not wish to study a MsC course at present, rather allowing the younger staff members to take up studies. However, he is eager to
attend internal courses and or short courses. His positive ,ready to go-problem solved' attitude is refreshing. Although Robert has indicated
that he has been through a learning curve, it appears that he has come out on the other side of the curve as a shining example to his fellow
investigators.

fragmented. I contacted our Senior Security Programme Manager and POCA Service Delivery Manager to
discuss how to manage communications prior to a further POCA case. I formatted an email and this was
delivered to all relevant sections informing them of their role and who relevant internal and external enquiries
should be dealt with or forwarded to.
2 Cases transferred. For the same cases I have had untangled existing documentation then assess what was
required to submit a comprehensive case to the PF.

3 Cases transferred. I considered after progression to PF I had advised them although colleague was main
witness I would be the point of contact. This prevented case failures which would result in waste of prosecution
costs and jeopardising any potential recoveries.
4 Offender/PF report. I considered time was being wasted creating an offender report and a PF report for
Scottish cases. I created a report that incorporated both. The report was written in the PF format with the
preamble at the top and included the relevant information for POL to make a decision. All POL information was
highlighted in red and in a different font. Once it was decided for prosecution the preamble and information
highlighted in red was deleted, leaving the report read for submission to the PF. Now when a case is
authorised for prosecution it can be submitted to the PF within an hour, instead of time being spent writing a
further report.

one for PF taking up valuable time. I compiled a merged report for both and submitted it to Line Management
