Please find attached the first draft of the LOR. It's still very much a working draft with a lot of gaps / open questions
but it's pretty well advanced. It's not been proof read yet so please ignore typos.

See you Wednesday.

Rodric — sorry I've got a meeting from 11-1 tomorrow in Soton which pretty much kills any chance of me getting to
London tomorrow.

We can do any time Wednesday to suit you or we could do Friday?

Thanks. Could I come to your office tomorrow? I have all of Wednesday blocked off but doing it tomorrow would
make my life much easier....

Rodric
We will get you a draft LOR this afternoon. Heads up - its long, 60+ pages.

Is the plan to still go through this together on Wednesday at our offices? If so, you will probably need the best part of a
full day tomorrow to review the draft.

The draft is also going to Tony today to review certain sections — mainly the bits of the legal relationship between POL
and SPMR. We'll give him a full draft to review at a later date.
