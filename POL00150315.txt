CORE SPEECH -— 1072 words

[Paragraphs 1 — 23, c. 8 minutes]

Introduction

1.1 congratulate the Rt. Hon. Member for North
East Hampshire on securing this debate on the
Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme
relating to Post Office Ltd’s Horizon accounting

software.

2.He has set out his concerns on this matter, and I
know how passionately he cares about this
subject. I remember well the statement that I
made in the House in July 2013, and the

important foundations that were committed to at
POL00150315
POL00150315

that time, which led to the creation of the

Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme.

3. The Rt. Hon member has clearly laid out his
perception of the failings of the Complaint
Review and Mediation Scheme, which was
established last August, and is overseen by the

independent Working Group.

4.I have listened carefully to his concerns, and
those expressed by other honourable members
present here today, and will spend just a few

moments reflecting on those.

Background
POL00150315
POL00150315

5.To do this properly, it is useful to establish and

agree some key facts.

6. First, there must be a degree of proportionality in
this debate. The system processes 6 million
transactions every working day across a Post
Office network in excess of 11,500 branches.
Nearly 500,000 users have used Horizon since it
was introduced in 2000, serving millions upon

millions of customers.

7.Let us be clear, only a very small minority of,
mainly former, subpostmasters and Post Office
employees have made complaints about the
system. Whilst every individual case matters

tremendously, these do represent pretty isolated
POL00150315
POL00150315

incidents.

. That brings me to my second point. Ensuring the
integrity of the system is of paramount and
overriding importance. That is why in 2012, the
Post Office commissioned an independent firm of
forensic accountants — Second Sight — to

examine the Horizon system.

. Second Sight published their report in July 2013.
It pulled no punches, but we must always bear in
mind during this debate one overriding fact that
was Clearly written into their independent report.
It said “We have so far found no evidence of a
system wide (systemic) problems with the

Horizon software”. This fact has not changed to
POL00150315
POL00150315

this day despite significant comprehensive

investigation through the cases in the Scheme.

10. However, Post Office acknowledged that the
report raised questions about the training and
support offered to some subpostmasters and

made plain its determination to address them.

11. This leads to my third point. Following the
publication of the independent Second Sight
report in July 2013, I made a statement before
Parliament that the Post Office was deliver three
initiatives in response to that report:

a. A Working Group would be created to review
cases;

b. This would be independently chaired; and
POL00150315
POL00150315

c. The Post Office would create a branch user

forum to create a feedback loop for users.

12. At this point it is very important to clearly state
for the record that the Government plays no role
in the operation of the Post Office. And that the
Working Group was established entirely
separately of Government to ensure its

independence.

13. It is also important to clarify the establishment
of the Working Group. The Post Office was
involved in designing and setting up the Working
Group, but as an equal partner alongside the
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance and, Second

Sight. The Rt. Hon. Member for North East
POL00150315
POL00150315

Hampshire acknowledged at the time that the
mechanism would lead to the process being fair,

thorough and independent.

14. The Working Group has an independent chair.
Sir Anthony Hooper whose name was suggested

by the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance who

publicly welcomed his appointment. As a former

Court of Appeal judge, Sir Anthony Hooper is
well equipped with the skills necessary to chair
this group as acknowledged by JFSA at the time
of his appointment and I welcome the role he has

played to date.

15. Since the Scheme began considering cases, I

understand that the Post Office has completed its
POL00150315
POL00150315

thorough and detailed investigations in virtually
all cases. Second Sight is also working hard to

produce its reviews of the cases.

16. With the jointly designed Scheme now
operating and making recommendations based
on the evidence presented about whether to
recommend cases for mediation; it is regrettable
that the Rt. Hon. Member has felt that he must
now withdraw his support for the Scheme that he

was so closely involved in creating.

17. Finally it is worth making the point that the
findings of each case must remain confidential.
This is a core aspect of the process. The

Scheme requires applicants and Post Office to
POL00150315
POL00150315

keep details of their cases confidential and the
detail of mediations are confidential and
undertaken in line with the European Code of
Conduct for Mediators (to which the external
mediation provider CDER is required to comply

to maintain its accreditation).

18. These cases often involve very personal and
sensitive information which participants would not
want disclosed publicly, and could seriously
damage the confidence of others in continuing to

participate in the scheme if that were the case.

19. Whilst it is therefore easy to accuse the Post

Office of being secretive, this is a fundamental

part of the process which everyone has agreed to

10
POL00150315
POL00150315

respect. And in any event the cases and
evidence of necessity include a significant
amount of sensitive personal information which

cannot be disclosed and debated publicly.

JFSA instigating legal action

20. It is also deeply concerning that I have learned
that the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance has
recently engaged a legal firm with a view to

considering legal options.

21. The success of the Scheme rests on the
commitment of all the involved parties to act in
good faith. This includes the Post Office, but

equally applies to the Justice for Subpostmasters

11
POL00150315
POL00150315

Alliance. The actions of recent weeks have
caused significant damage to the Scheme and it

will remain to be seen if this can be recovered.

OPTIONAL PIECE

22. [It must not be forgotten that this Scheme was
established to provide a route for former and
existing subpostmasters to have their cases
considered through an independent Scheme.
The actions of the Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance does nothing but cause uncertainty and

delay, and does not serve the applicants well.

12
POL00150315
POL00150315

23. The Government has not been involved in the
design of the Scheme, or in the independent
Working Group. But I would maintain that all the
parties that are involved are obliged to work
together under the processes that were jointly
agreed, to bring the investigations into the
applicants’ cases to resolution as quickly as

possible.]

90% CASES NOT MEDIATED ACCUSATION —

107 words

[Paragraphs 24 — 27, c. less than 1 minute]

24. I have heard the Rt. Hon. Member for North
East Hampshire described the Post Office as

‘plocking’ 90% of applicants from the scheme or

mediation.

25. Sir Anthony Hooper, the independent Chair of
the Mediation scheme, has provided me with an
update on progress of cases in the Scheme, and
I have placed his letter in the library for Hon

Members to see.

26. Of the 24 cases recommended for mediation

by the working group, Post Office has only

14
POL00150315
POL00150315

declined to mediate on 2. So the reality is
somewhat different to that reported by the Rt Hon

Member.

27. Around a dozen cases have also been

resolved as part of the Scheme but before the

mediation itself has taken place.

15
POL00150315
POL00150315

NOT MEDIATING ALL CASES — 423 words

[Paragraphs 28 — 37, c. 4 minutes]

28. I must remind the Rt. Hon. Member that the
Government was not involved in the design of
the Scheme. This was the responsibility of the
Post Office, the Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance and the Rt. Hon. Member himself who

welcomed the Scheme.

29. Post Office has assured me that every case is
fully investigated and the decision on whether to
mediate is made on the basis of the facts and
findings of the investigations. Each complaint is

considered on a case by case basis. But Post

16
POL00150315
POL00150315

Office must base its decision on substance and
facts.

30. As regards criminal cases, it is important to
note two things; first that neither the Government
nor the Working Group can intervene in the legal
process to appeal past convictions. Second a
conviction cannot be overturned by mediation,
that is a matter which can only be dealt with by
judicial authorities, as was made abundantly

clear in the setting up of the Scheme.

31. Post Office is, however, under an absolute
duty to immediately disclose to a defendant
and/or his/her legal representatives any
information which might undermine its own case

or support that of the defendant.

17
POL00150315
POL00150315

32. The mediation scheme was not established to
overturn criminal convictions. Where an
applicant has been convicted in a court of law,
but believes their conviction to be unsafe, they
should appeal that conviction through the

relevant judicial routes.

33. I am not involved in the Scheme and not
familiar with the cases but it is difficult to
envisage what mediation could achieve where it
has found nothing in the course of its re-
investigation which casts doubt on the safety of
the conviction. An applicant would have the
reports of their cases from the Scheme and be
able to consider whether they felt they contained

evidence to support an appeal.

18
POL00150315
POL00150315

34. There have also been allegations made that
Post Office pressured subpostmasters in to

pleading guilty to lesser offences.

35. Post Office only brings a prosecution when it
meets the tests set out in the Code for Crown
Prosecutors. This means that the prosecution
has to be supported by sufficient evidence and
has to be assessed as being in the public

interest.

36. Before pleading guilty to any offence, a
subpostmaster has the opportunity to scrutinise
the evidence upon which Post Office proposes
to rely and of course he/she also has the

opportunity to take legal advice.

19
POL00150315
POL00150315

37. I would re-iterate that if a sub-postmaster
should feel that their conviction is unsafe, they

can appeal through the relevant judicial routes.

SCOPE OF THE SCHEME (INC TRAINING) — 282

words

[Paragraphs 38 — 46, c. 2 minute]

38. I note that in correspondence with Post Office’s
Chief Executive, which has been made public,
the Rt Hon Member for NE Hampshire
questioned what the mediation scheme now

encompasses.

39. The Scheme’s overall objective is to try to
achieve the mutual and final resolution of
individual Applicants’ concerns about Horizon
and related issues. I recall well that the concerns
advanced by honourable friends which resulted
in the appointment of Second Sight, was about

the Horizon system.

21
POL00150315
POL00150315

40. This encompasses, as recorded in Second

Sight’s interim report, the following:

41. “...Horizon relates to the entire application.
This encompasses the software, both bespoke
and software packages, the computer hardware
and communications equipment installed in
Branch and the central data centres. It includes
the software used to control and monitor the
systems. In addition, ...... testing and training

systems are also referred to as Horizon”

42. The scheme was therefore set up with a very
specific and defined purpose, but which was
sufficiently wide to encompass more than just the

software.

22
43. I would remind everyone that nothing prevents
subpostmasters from raising a wider grievance
with Post Office at any time through any other

business-as-usual channels.

44. With regard to training specifically, which has
been a source of complaint for some, this is

within the remit of the scheme.

45. However, it must be remembered that those
subpostmasters who have expressed complaints
represent a tiny proportion of the hundreds of
thousands of users who have successfully used

the system.

23

POL00150315
POL00150315
POL00150315
POL00150315

46. The Post Office has informed me that it
provides a comprehensive training package
including both classroom and on-site training. If
Subpostmasters feel they need additional
training and support, then subpostmasters can

ask for it.

CONCLUDING REMARKS - 214 words

[Paragraphs 47 — 51, c. 2 minutes]

47. Having revisited the facts around the
background to the Scheme, how it was designed
and established, and how it operates, I will now

draw some conclusions.

48. Following a detailed independent report into
the Horizon system and related issues, a
Working Group with representatives from the
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance was
established in line with the three initiatives
Government announced at the time.

49. After more than two-and-a-half years of
detailed forensic analysis, there remains no

evidence of system wide problems with Horizon.

25
POL00150315
POL00150315

50. Whilst some Hon Members may not be
satisfied with some of the scheme’s findings
(which remain confidential) or outcomes to date, I
would encourage them to continue to support
and co-operate with the process as the best way
of determining the extent to which the complaints

of the members of the scheme are valid or not.

51. In all of this, I think it is incumbent on all
Members to keep an open mind and act on the
basis of fact. I am confident Post Office is, and
will continue to, discharge its responsibilities in
this matter fairly. We must be careful to ensure
that the strong feelings which characterise this
issue do not cause unwarranted damage to what

is a vital institution at the heart of our

26
POL00150315
POL00150315

communities.

NETWORK TRANSFORMATION — 70 words

[c. 1 minute]

Network Transformation

Alongside the plans to modernise and improve the
Crown network, Post Office Ltd is delivering its
Network Transformation Programme, which is

providing funding for all branches by 2018.

Nationally, over 4,500 subpostmasters have
voluntarily signed up to convert, and over 3,500
branches have now converted and are open and
operating. Under Network Transformation,
branches are improved, and there are nearly
always much longer opening hours bringing

significant benefits for customers.

GOVERNMENT COMMITMENTS — 230 words

[c. 2 minutes]

Government commitments

In 2010, we set out our commitments to the Post
Office network in our policy statement, “Securing
the Post Office network in the digital age”. I am
proud to stand here three years later and say we
are delivering on those commitments, and will

continue to deliver.

We said:

= There will be no programme of post office
closures under this Government. There isn’t,

and there won't be.

29
POL00150315
POL00150315

= We have committed to provide nearly £2 billion
for the Post Office to modernise the network.
We are providing that funding, and the Post

Office is modernising.

= We want to see the Post Office become a
genuine Front Office for Government. The
company has won every contract it has bid for
in the last three years, including the vital DVLA
front office contract. Yesterday we announced
a Post Office would provide the Post Office

Card Account through to 2022.

= We said we would support the expansion of

accessible and affordable personal financial

services available through the Post Office. We

30
POL00150315
POL00150315

are doing so, and Post Offices financial
services offerings are going from strength to

strength

We said we would create the opportunity for a
mutually owned Post Office. We have held a
public consultation, the company has through
engagement with its stakeholders agreed its
public benefit purpose, and the company
continues to make progress against the

mutualisation milestones that it has published.
