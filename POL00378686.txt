Subject: Re: Horizon
Shane, thank you.

All, FYI. There is continuous legal and audit work in respect of this and it can be subject to FOI. We are confident in
Horizon and we are supported by the NFSP.

Therefore, if you have any queries please telephone Susan or me.

financial irregularities. One of them received a prison sentence. We have pointed all of this out in a clear, factual way so
