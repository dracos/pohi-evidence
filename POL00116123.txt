Subject: Re: Briefing Alasdair

Hi Alice, I'm sorry if there's a misunderstanding. That was what I tried to explain when I called you: if Susan and Simon Baker had
left the business, then we couldn't effectively do Richard's review. I heard you say that you had the same thought. I felt we should
stand him down, as the context is now different. (That was why I called you - no other reason. Just to make sure we were on the
same page.)

Istill feel very strongly that we should do the LL review. As I'm sure you do too. And as the individuals who would have had the
sensitivities will have moved on, then I would like the business to do it - we all of us know what needs to be said. We did a good
review in the case of Rainbow. We can for this.

My follow-up note to you this am said I have a way through, which Martin is drafting. Why don't we speak on Monday, I'll get
Theresa to check diaries. Martin will try to get the revised TOR/brief to us by mid-morning.

An after-thought is that we could ask Richard if he would be prepared to challenge and review our LL paper and we arrange a half-
day session with him to do that, before we prepare a final report for the ARC/Board. We will always benefit from an external and
independent perspective. I will ask Martin to add this in.

If it helps, we could speak this pm. Let me know.

Paula

> Hi,

> When we spoke on Wed, we hadn't concluded what we should do re the lessons learned review, other than asking Martin E to
rewrite much narrower TOR. The options we discussed were to discuss revised TOR with the lawyers and then either proceed now or
wait till SS were off the scene.

> You also (on the phone later, I think) commented that it would be v difficult to do the review given changes in personnel.

> The decision to stand RH down completely was a surprise - I hadn't got to that conclusion. (I'm not saying it isn't right - just want
to understand.)

> Could you please share your reasoning on that with me?

> Thanks

his bill and expenses so far; and I shall order a case of wine to send to his home afterwards.

>I won't mention the Chair role as I'd like to meet one or two first having read the spec and the cvs. If we then don't find the right
person, I would go to Richard. I think it would be unfair to him to bring him in at this stage when the field is still open, with the
possibility of not giving him the job! (I have had a good recommendation from someone who knows and has worked with Hooper, so
certainly worth seeing him.)

>> Great minds..... Was thinking the same.

>> [haven't done anything about Alasdair. I imagine he is either back or about to be back - ARC next week. I'd be grateful if you
would brief him before you communicate with the Board.

>> Let me know if you would like a word tomorrow.

>> All the best

>> Alice, you'll see I've sent a note to Richard, suggesting that I meet him briefly next week. I want to look at the chairman cvs and
spec. (If Alasdair is back, it would be good to get his take.)

>

>> Have you briefed Alasdair or made a mental note to do so? If not, I think that is something I should do before I send a note
advising the Board, and certainly before the ARC.

>

>> T expect to speak to Susan on Monday - tell you more when we next speak.
