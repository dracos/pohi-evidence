I attach a further copy of the very preliminary briefing for next Tuesday's
Horizon meeting which I circulated earlier this evening to you only. This
version also incorporates my earlier progress report, together with its Appendix
F, which recipients who did not recieve it last time may find helpful.

David Sibbick.
