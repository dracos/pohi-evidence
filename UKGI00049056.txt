HMBU I High Level Preliminary Observations

Strategic Direction —
Lack of overarching strategy or articulation of success criteria for HMU (and the individual workstreams)
Organisational Structure and Resource —
© Absence of a leadership team (previous current model akin to a single general and troops). We need senior
managers leading, directing, and managing in the different workstreams.
© There are capability gaps (technical, behavioural, ie board reporting, governance, lack of “feeling ownership/
accountability”, lack of “delivery” focus, inability to plan and forecast, etc.)
o Query on the right level of resources. Over 28 BA/PM? 4 in Finance?
o Low morale
Deliverables and Accountabilities —
© Lack of clearly articulated deliverables with supporting actions which are updated and reported from the workstream
level,
o Lack of RACI
o New governance needs to be embedded
Project Management & Signature Processes
© Lack of centralised “one stop shop” data repository of programme management documentation - constant bespoke
reporting driving time and cost
© Lack of clearly articulated signature processes (forums/meetings, resulting in too many meetings with too many
people, which is not understood by those within HMBU and or its stakeholders
Planning and Forecasting —
© Poor forward planning of activity and budget forecasting (e.g putting in a token amount in the budget and then having
to justify the uplift and rationale when the previous budget had little rationale or knowingly reducing the budget to a
“palatable level” knowing that it will cost more).
Complex ways of working although principally driven by project drivers and stakeholders (ie shareholder involvement,
independent panel, spilt roles) but which results in more work and cost.

Programme outcomes and success criteria

The purpose of the HM Business Unit is to provide a dedicate resource to resolve the historical horizon /
GLO issues.

mainoy wun sseuIsng siepeW JeOUOISIH 9 GEL

The remit of the HMBU programme includes:

- Managing the overturning of previous criminal convictions via the Courts

- Managing compensation (liability and quantum) processes arising from malicious prosecution, breach of good faith
claims connected with historical horizon and GLO issues

- Managing the Historical Shortfall Scheme including Stamps Scheme (shortfall claims for HNGX and before and
ancillary claims but not all GLO non-conformance)

- Supporting the IDG and Inquiry Programmes

It does not manage ongoing conformance with the Group Litigation obligations.

- GE/ Board are asked to note/discuss:

Q In order for the HSS to be successful it requires the scheme to fairly resolve historical shortfall claims within a reasonable
period (shorter than a litigation timetable). The scheme needs to provide appropriate and fair compensation through a fair
rocess recognising the context and circumstances of the historic nature of these issues. The elements are:

HMBU I Org Chart questions... draft

Operations
+ What's the terms of the 8 x secondees under Jacki Adams (Ops) ?

Legal
+ 3x legal secondees (Nicola Bimey, Becky Lea and Elizabeth Court) are from a panel firm. What's the terms?

Portfolio

+ Does Ops Remediation and Ops Imp Phase 2 report into Graham Hemmingway (Portfolio Lead) with a dotted line into Jacqueline
Adams (Ops)? Does this need to be shown on the org charts?

+ There are two people (1 x FTE and 1 x contractor) who appear twice under Ops Remediation and Ops Imp Phase 2. Assume they are
supporting both ‘projects’ split 50/50? Do they need to be listed just once on the org chart?

+ Monika Chmeilis listed on SF as Team Support to Jacqueline Adams (Ops), but she also appears as PT (?) under Kevin Hutchinson in
Portfolio. Need to confirm where this resource should sit?

+ Should FTE be shown as reporting into contractors, or SPO?

Finance
+ Does Chris Manamiey (FD) report directly into Declan?
+ Does Graham Watson (Programme Accountant) report into Graham (Portfolio Lead) as per Simon White's document or Chris (FD)?

IT
+ Structure is as per capability / accountability matrix provided by Simon White, but there is some resource missing as per SF. Should
this be updated with the latest per everyone under Simon Oldnall from SF / Headcount data. What should the IT structure be aligned
to?
+ Capability matrix from Simon White listed 17 vacancies. Should these be included on the org chart?
