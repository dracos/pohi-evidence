Dated: 8 May 2024

POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF THOMAS MATHEW BEEZER

|, THOMAS MATHEW BEEZER, will say as follows.

INTRODUCTION

1. | am a Partner in the firm of Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP (WBD). A brief
summary of my qualifications and career history is given in my first witness
statement dated 13 June 2023. This second witness statement is made to
assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the Inquiry) with the matters set out
in the Rule 9 Request made of me dated 25 March 2024 (the Request). The
Request principally concerns the (limited) role | played in Bates & O'rs v. Post
Office Limited (the GLO Proceedings), and in particular the application made
by Post Office Limited (POL) for the Managing Judge in the GLO Proceedings,
Mr Justice Fraser (as he then was), to recuse himself (the recusal

application).

2. The Request that | have received from the Inquiry relates to matters that took
place between 2012 and 2019. Given the passage of time, and my limited role
in the GLO Proceedings generally, | have an incomplete recollection of all of
the issues covered by the Request although it is right to state that | do have
some independent memory of certain relevant events from March and April
2019 as | go on to set out below. In order to provide as full a response as |
am now able, and to assist the Inquiry to the greatest possible extent, | have
refreshed my memory by reading the documents the Inquiry has referred me
to as well as carrying out further searches of those parts of WBD's files relating
to this case where I had some involvement, albeit limited. | have not reviewed
the entirety of WBD's files relating to the GLO Proceedings or the recusal
application, nor have | re-read every email relating to this matter that | was
sent or copied into. That would not have been practicable as there are a very
large number of documents in those files. Where my answers to the Request
are based upon my review of documents, as opposed to my recollection, |
have made that clear. Similarly, where | refer to material which was not sent
to me by the Inquiry with the Request but which | have identified from my
review of WBD's files, | identify that material and provide a copy of it together

with this statement.

3. | wish to state at the outset that | have great sympathy for the subpostmasters
affected by what | now know to be very significant issues with the Horizon
system. Whilst | believed that the recusal application was properly made
based upon the information and advice received from Leading Counsel at the

time, | can well see that making the application added to the complexity and

challenges faced by the Claimants in the GLO Proceedings. | am sorry for

that, and wish to apologise to each and every Claimant for my role in that.

| AM ASKED TO DESCRIBE TO WHAT EXTENT, IF AT ALL, | WAS INVOLVED
WITH, OR HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF, WBD’S WORK IN ADVISING OR
REPRESENTING POL IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING
MATTERS: THE SECOND SIGHT INVESTIGATION AND PREPARATION OF THE
INTERIM REPORT IN 2012/13; THE INITIAL COMPLAINT REVIEW AND
MEDIATION SCHEME AND ITS WORKING GROUP IN 2013/15; OR THE REVIEW

OF PAST CONVICTIONS OF SPMS.

4. Although | was aware at a general level that WBD was involved in advising
and/or representing POL in or in connection with at least some of these

matters:

4.1. the Second Sight investigation and preparation of the Interim Report in

2012/13,

4.2 the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme and its Working

Group in 2013/15; and

4.3 the review of past convictions of SPMs,

I had no material involvement in any of that work.

5. | had a high-level awareness that these matters were ongoing in the team
through day-to-day interactions with people within WBD who were engaged

on those matters, but I did not have specific or detailed information on any of

Page 3 of 56
WITNO09510200
WITNO9510200

DocuSign Envelope ID: BD29241A-F110-41AD-B1F4-2912498CFEF8

those topics as far as | can now recall. Where | did have any involvement in
or knowledge of these matters, that was from a resourcing or team

management perspective and I do not recall other substantive involvement.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO DESCRIBE TO WHAT EXTENT, IF AT ALL, | WAS
INVOLVED IN WBD’S WORK IN ADVISING AND REPRESENTING POL IN THE
GLO PROCEEDINGS PRIOR TO MY INSTRUCTION IN RESPECT OF THE

RECUSAL APPLICATION.

6. | was not involved (save in relation to some discrete team and business
management issues) in WBD's work in advising or representing POL in the
GLO Proceedings prior to me assisting the WBD GLO team in respect of the
recusal application in early March 2019. | stepped in to assist an extremely
busy team on a temporary basis at a time when it was necessary for extra

senior resource to become involved, as | go on to describe below.

7. Similar to the position in relation to the other matters | refer to above, prior to
early March 2019 | did have high-level awareness of the GLO Proceedings
through day-to-day interactions with people within WBD who were engaged in
that important matter, but | did not have detailed information on the GLO
Proceedings as far as | can now recall. From my review of relevant parts of
WBD's files | can see that Andrew Parsons did send on to me (at around the
time it was received by WBD, in 2016) the Claimants' Letter of Claim in the
GLO Proceedings. | do not recall that and | presume that I was sent that letter
for information purposes and to let me know that it had been received as that
would impact resourcing in the WBD team. From the WBD files, it does not

appear that | replied to Andrew Parsons, which supports my assumption that |

was sent the letter for information only.

8. | had a degree of awareness of the demands that the GLO Proceedings were
making upon colleagues at WBD and would speak regularly to colleagues
about how things were going, but | was not involved in the substantive

proceedings in an advisory capacity before March 2019.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO EXPLAIN THE BACKGROUND TO AND PROCESS
BY WHICH | BECAME INSTRUCTED TO ADVISE POL ON THE RECUSAL
APPLICATION AND / OR APPLYING FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL THE

ORDERS MADE IN THE COMMON ISSUES TRIAL.

9. The team within WBD working on the GLO Proceedings was, in early 2019,
extremely busy. The Common Issues Trial (CiT) had taken place between 7
November 2018 and 6 December 2018, preparations were underway for the
then imminent Horizon Issues Trial (HiT) and the draft CiT Judgment was
teleased to WBD and its GLO Counsel team (which was led by David
Cavender KC in respect of the CiT) on 8 March 2019. As part of the case
management regime decided in the GLO Proceedings the HiT was scheduled
to commence on 11 March 2019. | understood from the WBD GLO team that
the draft CiT Judgment was very unfavourable to POL; that the WBD team and
POL were dismayed by the outcome; and that there was talk of a possible
urgent appeal. | also understood from the WBD GLO team that because of
the proximity of the start of the HiT (which was then 3 days from receipt of the
draft CiT Judgment, those 3 days including a weekend), if there was to be any

Page 5 of 56
WITNO09510200
WITNO9510200

DocuSign Envelope ID: BD29241A-F110-41AD-B1F4-2912498CFEF8

appeal of the CiT Judgment, additional senior (i.e. partner-led) support would
be necessary, as the WBD GLO team were also preparing for the HiT,
alongside considering the draft CiT Judgment and any next steps that may

flow from that.

10. Given the significance of the GLO Proceedings to POL, which was an
important client of WBD, it was obvious to me that any additional steps WBD
could take to support POL in a moment of particularly intensive work should
be offered. As a senior partner in the litigation practice | was well placed to
help. | therefore offered to assist with the logistical elements of any appeal,
such as lining up Counsel, procedure, supervising junior lawyers already on
the WBD GLO team and client interfacing on the topic of the possible

appeal/recusal.

11. Whilst | was keen to assist both the WBD GLO team and POL, it was known
to the WBD GLO team and to POL that | had no detailed knowledge of the
GLO Proceedings as | had not been involved in them to any material degree
previously. This can be seen in communications to which the Inquiry has
referred me; for example, | say to Jane MacLeod (then the General Counsel

at POL) in an email of 17 March 2019 [POL00022969] that:

"In my speaking to Andy [Parsons] today (he calls me after | send e
mails on this...) he reminds me of how much | don’t know about this

matter."

12. My capacity to advise substantively (by which | mean on the underlying factual
and other matters covered by the draft CiT Judgment) was limited, as POL

were aware, notwithstanding my desire to assist as best | then could.

13. The process by which | became familiar with the materials | needed to
understand (subject always to the point | made in my 17 March 2019 email
referred to above) involved reviewing documents that included the draft CiT
Judgment,’ David Cavender KC's note of 10 March 2019? (see below) and a
summary by Andrew Parsons of the CiT Judgment. The WBD files
demonstrate that | was sent these documents on Monday 11 March 2019%, i.e.
the day the HiT started. | am fairly certain that | would also have had
discussions with members of the WBD GLO team to gain a background. My
level of familiarity with the issues in play in, and the relevant considerations to
take into account regarding, what became the recusal application increased
given the intensity of this period but, as | say below, | saw my role as primarily
being to provide co-ordination, organisation and a senior point of contact for

POL in this particularly demanding period.

14. The concept of a recusal application first came up, so far as | am aware from
reviewing the WBD files, from David Cavender KC in his email of 9 March 2019

to Andrew Parsons (to which | was not copied). That email states:

1 WBON0001733.
2 WBONO000209.
3 WBON0001464. Please note that this document is incorrectly dated 9 March 2018; it should in fact
have been dated 9 March 2019.

"Indeed | am beginning to form the view that seeking the Judge's
recusal is something that we need to actively consider. | am drafting a
Note too (as requested) dealing with the appeal on a high level. As part
of that | have been collating some of the Judges comments and findings
and the gross procedural irregularity here. If we are right about all of
those points - then how could a reasonable independent observer think
that such a Judge could fairly adjudicate in the future on a dispute
between the parties i.e. trial 3 and beyond ? | recognise its extreme -
and being so directly involved makes it difficult to be objective - but what
we have been served up with is frankly so shockingly bad that we must
at least consider it. | deal with this point — in brief in my Note which you

will get tomorrow.

15. That advice note referred to by David Cavender KC was the note I refer to
above produced on 10 March 2019.° As | explain above, | believe that | first
saw that note on 11 March 2019 when the WBD files show that Andrew
Parsons forwarded a copy of it to me.’ | see from the WBD files that the note
had been sent to Jane MacLeod and others at POL by Andrew Parsons on 10
March 2019.8 David Cavender KC warns that recusal is "...certainly a
dramatic option of last resort' — see paragraph 19 of that note and it also raises

the possibility of "instructing separate Counsel to consider the point on recusal

— as having been so closely involved in this it is difficult to be truly objective."

— see paragraph 23 of that note.°

16. David Cavender KC's note of 10 March 2019'° contains analysis about the
possibility of an appeal over certain CiT findings. | believe that | became
involved in both the prospective appeal and the recusal matter as they were
linked concepts (as a function of the then proposed (by David Cavender KC)
“procedural unfairness" ground of appeal), were both pressing (and became
urgent), and my involvement became useful (and in practice necessary) at that
time due to the very significant demands on the resources of the WBD GLO

team given the then imminent commencement of the HiT on 11 March 2019.

17. It is also worth stating that | do recall Jane MacLeod saying to me, early on in
my involvement on the recusal/appeal work stream, that she and the Board of
POL wanted independent advice on the issues of recusal (on which | had no
prior experience, a fact known to Jane MacLeod from our early interactions on
the issue. | believe that she had no prior experience of a recusal application
either) and appeal. | can see from my handwritten note of 12 March 2019"!
that the concept of independent advice was raised by Jane MacLeod from the
outset of my involvement (and, indeed, it can be seen that David Cavender KC
raised the concept of independent advice in his note of 10 March 2019," as I

set out above).

18. | understood from Jane MacLeod that POL did not want to rely solely upon the
advice of David Cavender KC or the advice of WBD on the appeal and recusal
issues. The CiT had not gone in POL's favour, and WBD and David Cavender
KC were closely connected to that. Hence, Jane MacLeod explained to me,
the Board of POL wanted a different Counsel team and, it transpired, further
law firms (first Norton Rose Fulbright and later Herbert Smith Freehills (HSF))

to provide additional independent advice as | detail below.

19. My role was, as I| understood it, to facilitate POL in getting further advice from
a new and independent Counsel team whilst the WBD GLO team were
occupied with the HiT, before it was adjourned. | was not involved in POL

instructing the further law firms that POL retained for additional advice.

20. I can see from my review of WBD's files that, and my own recollection supports
this, | was intensively involved in work associated with the recusal application
during March 2019 but that my role assisting the WBD GLO team had
decreased by around early April 2019 and the WBD GLO team, with much
more detailed knowledge of matters than | had, picked up running the
procedure of the recusal and the leave to appeal applications, the HiT having

by then been adjourned.

21. | had less involvement in the matter in later April and May 2019 although I did
attend a POL meeting on 9 May 2019 with David Cavender KC concerning the
scope of any appeal. | believe that | was at that particular meeting as Andrew
Parsons was initially not able to attend, and | was there primarily as a courtesy
to Counsel and POL. Following a change to the start time of the meeting,

Andrew Parsons was able to dial-in to the meeting by telephone and David
Cavender KC and | attended in person. | also provided some limited support
to Andrew Parsons and the wider WBD GLO team in managing the
relationship with Post Office's then new General Counsel, Ben Foat, at this

difficult time for the client.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO DESCRIBE THE WRITTEN OR ORAL
INSTRUCTIONS | GAVE TO COUNSEL TO ADVISE ON THE RECUSAL
APPLICATION, INCLUDING LORD NEUBERGER AND LORD GRABINER.

INCLUDING SETTING OUT THE DOCUMENTS | PROVIDED TO THEM.

22. The instruction of Lord Neuberger and, later, Lord Grabiner was primarily done
via WBD sending bundles of documents with associated questions to be
addressed by Counsel and by David Cavender KC briefing them (either
remotely (as Lord Neuberger was out of the country at the time) or face to face,
in the case of Lord Grabiner as each Leading Counsel was from the same
Chambers). There were multiple briefing sessions, | believe. The briefings
were a Counsel to Counsel process. Given the speed within which POL
wanted an independent view from very senior Counsel, that was the most
expeditious way to get firstly Lord Neuberger, and then Lord Grabiner, up to

speed.

23. In terms of documentation, | believe that David Cavender KC supplied to each
of Lord Neuberger and Lord Grabiner a note dated 13 March 2019 which he
had prepared in conjunction with Gideon Cohen (Junior Counsel instructed by
WBD on behalf of POL) setting out the background to the (at that time) possible

recusal application.’7 On 12 March 2019 Amy Prime, of WBD, sent a bundle
of 79 enclosures to Lord Neuberger and Lord Grabiner's clerk.4 In addition,
the note of the Board call of 18 March 2019'S records that Lord Grabiner had
seen Lord Neuberger's advice note dated 14 March 2019, David Cavender

KC's and Gideon Cohen's note dated 13 March 2019 and the CiT Judgment.

COMMUNICATIONS | HAD CONCERNING THE RECUSAL APPLICATION OR THE
APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL (INCLUDING PROSPECTS OF
SUCCESS OR STRATEGY) WITH COUNSEL, MEMBERS OF POL’S LEGAL
DEPARTMENT, DIRECTORS OF POL OR UKGI / GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

CHRONOLOGICALLY.

chambers (One Essex Court, Blackstone Chambers and Brick Court
Chambers) with regard to (i) instructing a senior KC to advise on the merits of
making a recusal application and (ii) their availability to undertake the
advocacy of such an application if made."® POL ultimately instructed Lord
Neuberger to advise on the merits of the recusal application and Lord Grabiner

making a recusal application’® and (ii) David Cavender KC's note he had
prepared for Lord Neuberger on the background to the possible recusal

application.'® Lord Neuberger's advice note stated:

a) "19. For all the reasons set out above | consider that there are
reasonable ground for [POL] to bring an application to recuse the Judge
in these proceedings. Furthermore, if it is [POL's] intention to bring an
appeal on the basis of the "unfairness issues" (as | understand to be
the case) — and on that appeal will ask the Court of Appeal to return the
case to a different Judge, then the [POL] has little option but to seek to

get the Judge to recuse himself at this stage.

b)

c) 25. Assuming (which seems very likely from what | have heard)
the Judge refuses to recuse himself or to adjourn the current trial,
consideration should perhaps be given to appealing that decision
urgently (a) to ensure it cannot be said that [POL] has waived its right,

(b) to bring this matter to the attention of the Court of Appeal in the hope

that they might expedite the application for permission to appeal. Peter
Smith J's refusal on a Friday to recuse himself was reversed by the
Court of Appeal the following Monday in Howell v Lees Millais [2007]

calls on 14 March 2019. One of those calls was with Jane MacLeod and David

outline above), sent it to Jane MacLeod.”° Substantial input on that draft note
was obtained from Andrew Parsons”‘ and, later, from David Cavender KC.?5

David Cavender KC added the following comments to the recusal paper:

"... [Mr Cavender’s recommendation is] that it is difficult to see how the
litigation can be proceeded to a sensible (and fair) conclusion before
this Judge. He has behaved (and is apparently continuing to behave
to the current Horizon issues trial) in a manner which can only fairly be
described as biased against Post Office. It is almost as though he is a
party and has his own position — as opposed to being a neutral tribunal
overseeing a adversarial process. That bias is reasonably obvious in
the manner that he has behaved and the findings that he has made.
But the issues of law he has determined can be overturned and the
irrelevant findings of fact likely quashed the current position can be

rectified by the Court of Appeal.

But in the current Horizon trial and the forthcoming trial (dealing with
breach of contract issues) in November 2019, Judge will also be
required to make findings of fact and give his view on competing expert
evidence. Such findings are much more difficult to attack as it will
involve showing that such findings were not open to the Judge on the
evidence — which is close to having to show perversity. This is

extremely difficult, and in practice the Court of Appeal do not generally

overturn findings of fact. So there is an opportunity to do something
about this Judicial behaviour now which will not arise again. There
must be a real risk that unless this opportunity is taken this Judge is
only going to get worse — as he gets emboldened by his earlier findings,
and Post Office will be stuck in an unfair trial process and can expect

adverse and draconian findings going forward.

Furthermore, the appeal that is planned against the CIT judgment
involves (1) an appeal against the legal findings (2) an appeal on the
basis of procedural unfaimess. The procedural unfairness part of the
appeal would be on the basis that the Judge made findings of fact he
should not have done — and then fed those findings of fact into the legal
issues he has determining- which he also should not have done. Given
the nature of the second part of the appeal it would be inevitable that
the party making that allegation would then ask the Court of Appeal to
return the case to a different Judge - given that behaviour. However,
if that party has not mounted a recusal application — there is very little
the Court of Appeal can do but return it to the Judge- a Judge whose
legal findings would (hopefully) have been significantly reversed and
his behaviour (hopefully) been criticised by the Court of Appeal —
perhaps in trenchant terms. How he would behave in that scenario is

at best uncertain.

Therefore, Mr.Cavender's view is that it is difficult to see a realistic

alternative and so a recusal application should be made."6

along with a comparison against the previous draft | had sent to her.2” Jane
MacLeod responded asking for a call to discuss and stating that POL's Board
were "highly nervous" of the strategy so we "need to be very clear on both why
doing it is the best course of action, and what our prospects of success are"?®

prospects of a recusal application, Lord Grabiner stated that:

". there are strong arguments in favour of an application for recusal,

- it was his strong view that a recusal application was the right course

of action, and

- there is a "serious prospect of success", and
- and that this Judge had done "an unbelievable nonsense and

demonstrated apparent bias."43

conference with POL's Board (I assume that must have been by telephone as
Lord Neuberger was overseas at that time). | cannot recall if | attended that
conference but Jane MacLeod emailed me afterwards stating that Lord
Neuberger had confirmed that he thought POL had “a good case on recusal”.“
Jane MacLeod stated that there was to be a further Board call on 20 March
2019 and asked whether Lord Grabiner would be able to attend in person.
Jane MacLeod also asked for "a pro forma model of what the various
outcomes could be — that is, what is the financial impact such that taking a
step like recusal is 'worth it and set out various factors that should be taken

40. Also on 20 March 2019, | received an email from Jane MacLeod asking
"whether an approach along the following lines (as an alternative to recusal)

would be possible procedurally:

"1. inform the judge that the company is appealing on the law and unfair

procedure

2. ask the judge to stop the Horizon trial until the outcome of the appeal
is determined on the grounds that if the unfairness claim is upheld it

would also put the fairness of the Horizon trial at risk

3. If the judge refuses 2, seek and order from a higher court to the
same effect and ask the judge at least to stop the Horizon trial until such

an order can be obtained (or not)

If the remedy in 3 is sought but isn’t obtained we will at least have tested
the relevance and implications of unfairness issues on the second trial.
And effectively a higher court will have told us that any unfairness in the
first trial would not impact the Horizon trial (obviously contrary to POL’s

view).

If the remedy in 3 doesn’t exist in law then recusal would be an
alternative at that point. It seems to me the judge’s refusal to agree to
2 would support a recusal application as he would be unwilling to accept
that if unfairness took place in the first trial the nature of it would
necessarily affect the conduct and fairness of the Horizon trial - a view

which logically suggests bias as it is absurd."

Could we please test this with the Counsel team? It may have the
outcome that the judge is asked to recuse himself, but not necessarily.
And seems to assume that we could get an appeal quite quickly, which
must be uncertain. I’m also not sure that the logic in 2. holds up, and
3 means arguing procedural unfairness without (necessarily) arguing

mis-application of the law etc."°>

made "would make matters (even worse)".© | forwarded David Cavender KC's

for that question but that my view was that there was no middle ground.®® |

43. As described in more detail below, at 11:45am on 20 March 2019, Lord
Grabiner and | attended (by telephone) the first part of POL's Board Meeting.
| took a handwritten note®' which | later used to update my typed note of the
conference on 18 March 2019.°? My notes record that during the conference

Lord Grabiner advised:

"...the Judge had behaved quite improperly and it was now right to ask
him to stand down... it is apparent that this Judge has concluded views
on matters and as there are further trials to come, then those concluded
views would be a significant issue for Post Office unless this Judge is

asked to recuse himself.

...the apparent concluded views of this Judge are so strong that there
is no other way to deal with the issue than recusal. If Post Office does
not take such a step, yet later goes to the Court of Appeal on matters
of law from the CIT, the Court of Appeal will be left wondering why such

a step (i.e. recusal) was not taken.

.. his firm view was that Post Office has no option but to seek the

recusal of this Judge... whilst guarantees cannot be provided, Post

Office does have a strong case for recusal... his strong
recommendation to the Post Office Board was to seek a recusal. The
sequencing of the trials, ordered by this Judge, compounds the issue
that Post Office faces as this Judge would be looking at the same
witnesses and issues in later trials — hence there is no other real option

but to seek recusal.

... if the Judge refuses to recuse himself then Post Office must ask the
Court of Appeal, and if that fails too then this Judge will remain in place
for Horizon and later trials... this Judge has already formed a view of
Post Office and so a failed recusal application is unlikely to make a
difference to outcomes when compared to plausible outcomes from a

situation where no recusal application is made.

... Lord Neuberger agreed with the advice on recusal that Post Office
was receiving and... there were few, if any, more respected QCs and

ex-Judges in this country."

44. Later that afternoon, | spoke to Jane MacLeod on the telephone and she
confirmed the instructions from POL's Board were to make the recusal
application. | relayed POL's instructions to the Counsel team® and Lord

Grabiner responded stating "/ really don't think [POL] had any choice".

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO DESCRIBE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
DECISION MAKING AT POL IN RESPECT OF THE RECUSAL APPLICATION AND

THE APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL.

54, From my review of the material parts of the WBD files, | can see that | mainly
interacted with Jane MacLeod at POL in relation to the recusal application and
the application for permission to appeal. As far as | am aware, decisions over
day-to-day procedural matters sat with Jane MacLeod as General Counsel at
POL, and then later with Ben Foat after he took over that position. However,
| understood that ultimately the decision on whether to proceed with the
recusal and/or permission to appeal matters was one for the Board of POL.
For example, the email chain sent to me by the Inquiry [POL00022969] shows
that Jane MacLeod clearly saw recusal and appeal decisions as matters
reserved to the Board of POL. A further confirmation of that position can be
seen in the following extract from an email to me from Jane MacLeod of 18

March 2019:

"Many thanks for your help in sorting out DNQC attendance at the call.
He was very balanced in his approach, but confirmed that he thinks we
have a good case on recusal. The Board asked a number of questions
and my sense was that they were ‘calmed’ by his discussion. However

they haven't yet made a decision. There is a further board call on
Wednesday at 12.30 and they have requested whether Lord Grabiner
would be available in person at the time — ideally at FD if that’s
possible? Having said that they recognise that he will almost certainly

say the same things as DNQC".88

55. As described above in this statement, Lord Grabiner and I dialled into a POL
Board Meeting on 20 March 2019 as Lord Grabiner was unable to attend POL
in person due to preexisting diary commitments. At that meeting, Lord
Grabiner gave advice, the Board of POL asked Lord Grabiner questions and |
took a handwritten note (being my role, as | understood it - see Jane
MacLeod's email to me of 20 March 2019 which made that plain),®° which |
later used to update my typed note of the conference on 18 March 2019. |
did not give any advice in that call. As | refer to above, by that time |
understood that POL had instructed an additional law firm to provide
independent advice on the recusal issue. That resulted in, | believe, two
partners from Norton Rose Fulbright being with the POL Board in person on
20 March 2019. Lord Grabiner and | dialled out of that Board Meeting after a
short time, and | presume (although | do not know) that the POL Board went
on to discuss the recusal application and took a decision having had, at least,

THE REQUEST ASKS THAT | SET OUT WHAT | BELIEVED THE STRATEGY OR
PURPOSE WAS IN MAKING THE RECUSAL APPLICATION OR THE
APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL. TO WHAT EXTENT, IF AT ALL,
WAS INCREASING THE CLAIMANTS’ COSTS OR DELAYING THE HORIZON
ISSUES TRIAL TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PURSUE

EITHER APPLICATION?

57. From my review of the material parts of the WBD files, it appears to me that
the strategy or purpose of POL in making the recusal and appeal applications

were:

57.1 To obtain a legally correct CiT Judgment: Based on advice from
Lord Neuberger and Lord Grabiner, it was felt necessary to POL to
obtain a correct application of the law (as it saw it at that point in time)
to the matters in the CiT and to properly manage POL's possible

downside in damages (given the duties the Directors owed to POL).

57.2 To be best placed to manage the trials that were then yet to come:
The potential impact of the CiT Judgment and of the Managing Judge's
findings in the CiT on the trials that were then yet to come (in the
sequence of trials ordered as part of the case management in the GLO

Proceedings) was a strategic factor to POL.

57.3 SPM contract management: The difficulty of seeking to manage POL
contracts with subpostmasters under the 'new' post-CiT regime (with

the implied terms that had been found to exist in the CiT) was seen as

an important strategic consideration. For example, see the email from

Jane MacLeod dated 18 March 2019.9”

57.4 The best interests of POL: | understood from Jane MacLeod that the
POL Board was concerned to act in the best interests of POL and meet

its fiduciary obligations — see Jane MacLeod email of 16 March 2019.%

57.5 Settlement: | believe that there was some focus on how the CiT could
impact POL's ability to settle the GLO Proceedings — see email from

Jane MacLeod of 18 March 2019.99

58. On the issue of the Claimants' costs, consideration was given to this topic by
the legal team although | do not know what weight was attached to this
particular factor by POL in its decision-making. Both David Cavender KC and
Lord Neuberger did advise POL that the Court of Appeal could be asked to
rewrite the CiT Judgment’ to correct the law such that a re-trial of the CiT,
and the attendant costs could be avoided. Further, | see from my review of
the material parts of the WBD files that | cautioned a number of times that if
the recusal/leave applications resulted in an adjournment of the HiT then there
would be costs consequences. For example, see my email of 14 March 2019

where | state:

“please note that in any scenario where HIT is adjourned then there will
be possible increased costs consequences for Claimants that POL

could bear if it is ultimately unsuccessful".1°

59. | do not recall extensive discussions about "delay" to the HiT but | am sure that
delay in itself was not a motive for making the application, but that inevitably

there was risk that the recusal application would cause delay to the HiT.

60. On 18 March 2019 | stated to POL that: "In the absence of a recusal
application and successful appeal the negotiating position of Post Office
seems weak. It is necessary to appreciate that the Claimants are backed by
litigation funders who will sense victory from the CIT Judgment. In the
absence of risk to the Claimants case (or important elements of it) the
funders are likely to insist on recovering the maximum fee they are
contractually able to extract from the Claimants and this will erode the "pot"
available to the Claimants and thereby drive any settlement number required

from Post Office up" [WBON0001784].

61. In essence, the purpose of the recusal and appeal applications was to seek to
correct the perceived legal missteps in the CiT Judgment and to seek a
position where the case was remitted back to a different Judge not tied to

comments made in the CiT.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO SET OUT MY FULL RECOLLECTION OF WHAT

WAS SAID AT THE CONFERENCE WITH LORD GRABINER ON 18 MARCH 2019.

62. After the time that has passed since March 2019, my best recollection is
represented by both the note of the conference that | prepared (and that Jane
MacLeod commented on)'°? and by my contemporaneous hand written
notes.'°> In addition, Jane MacLeod sent to me, by PDF, her note of that
meeting'® to assist me in the preparation of the more formal note of the

conference that | was to prepare.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME WHY | SOUGHT "TO MAKE THE NOTE A MORE
“NORMAL" NOTE OF A CON™ (SEE POL00022883)? TO WHAT EXTENT, IF AT
ALL, WAS THE CONTENT OR GIST OF THE NOTE DIFFERENT TO WHAT WAS
ACTUALLY DISCUSSED? SETTING OUT ANY SUCH DIFFERENCES.

63. | was aware that the note [POL00022883] was to be submitted to the POL
Board members for their consideration. It therefore had to be an ordered and
coherent recitation of the advice Lord Grabiner had provided in conference on
18 March 2019. In my experience, the note of any conference with any
Counsel is not a verbatim note of a discussion, and nor is it meant or
understood to be. It is not a transcript nor described as such. Such a
conference note is (in my view) meant to be an accurate summary of the

discussion and the advice given in that particular conference. It is also worth

stating that my handwritten notes’ are not a verbatim record of the
conference. They are simply my notes and my attempt at capturing the advice
given by Lord Grabiner including particular points or phrases, whilst still

participating in the conference itself.

64. The note that was produced [POL00022883] does not differ in any material
way from what was discussed at the conference of 18 March 2019, save that
certain of the more robust comments made by Lord Grabiner were not set out
verbatim, given that | was aware that the note was to go to the Board of POL.
So a phrase such as "stand up be counted" (see my handwritten notes)'”” did
not seem to be appropriate in the finalised version to be submitted to the Board
of POL. In that more formal note, comment is made about Lord Grabiner's
perception of the scope of the Board's duty to POL, so the strength of the views
| understood Lord Grabiner to be conveying is recorded. | believe that Jane
MacLeod (who had participated in the conference and had heard the advice
given by Lord Grabiner) would have understood the above when | stated | was

producing "a more "normal" note of a con”.

THE REQUEST ASKS IN SO FAR AS NOT DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO SET OUT MY
VIEW ON WHAT MATTERS POL’S LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES AND WBD'S LAY
CLIENT APPEARED TO CONSIDER IMPORTANT WHEN DETERMINING ITS
STRATEGY IN THE BATES LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE DECISIONS ON (A)
WHETHER TO APPEAL THE ORDER MADE IN BATES & O’RS V. POST OFFICE
LIMITED JUDGMENT (NO. 3) “COMMON ISSUES" [2019] EWHC 606 (QB) AND
(B) WHETHER TO ISSUE AN APPLICATION TO SEEK THE RECUSAL OF
FRASER J (AS HE THEN WAS)? DESCRIBE ANY DIVERGENCE OF VIEWS

BETWEEN LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES AND / OR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.

65. | mainly interacted with Jane MacLeod during the period | was substantively
involved in the matter (being 11 March 2019 through to early April 2019). |
can pass a view on what | consider were matters that she believed to be
important, but I do not believe that | interacted directly with the "Lay Client’ (by
which I understand the Inquiry to mean the decision-makers at POL, i.e. POL's
Board) in a substantive way so | cannot comment in that regard. From my
review of the material parts of the WBD files, it appears to me that POL (by
which | mean Jane MacLeod) considered the following issues important in
addition to the points that | already detail in my answer at paragraphs 57.1 to

57.5 of this statement:

65.1 Lord Neuberger's view on the approach of the Judiciary to recusal
and contractual interpretation: It was important to POL that Lord
Neuberger be retained to give a view due to him being the then recent

ex-President Of The Supreme Court and his views on practice,

Page 37 of 56
WITNO09510200
WITNO9510200

DocuSign Envelope ID: BD29241A-F110-41AD-B1F4-2912498CFEF8

procedure and likely Judicial approach — see my email to Jane
MacLeod of 12 March 201918 and see Jane MacLeod's email of 12

March 2019 which states:

"My initial reaction was that we should appoint Lord Grabiner - | have
briefed him in a previous life in a contested hearing against the FCA

and won, and he is available should we need him to appear.

However this morning my thinking is more along the lines of whether
Lord Neuberger might be better given his insight into the thinking of the
Court of Appeal judges and their approach to current trends of

contractual interpretation.”°°

65.2 PR concerns: PR was a concern to POL. POL did not want to be seen
as arrogant — see Jane MacLeod's email of 16 March 2019.119 POL
wanted the "tone" of legal documents setting out its position to be

restrained.'""

65.3 Alternatives to recusal: The POL Board was concerned to understand
if there were any alternatives to recusal, in terms of the strategy to be
deployed — see email from Jane MacLeod of 20 March 20191"? and also
note the questions posed of Lord Grabiner at the POL Board meeting

(to which Lord Grabiner and | dialled in) of 20 March 2019.13

65.4 The connection between "procedural unfairness" and recusal:
Jane MacLeod did query how closely tied the recusal and appeal issues
were. There was discussion over the "procedural unfairness" ground
and how the recusal application 'had' to be made for that ground to live
as a credible ground of appeal — see email from Jane MacLeod of 17

March 2019.1'4

65.5 Alignment of views in the new Counsel team: POL was keen to
understand if Lord Neuberger and Lord Grabiner had aligned views on

the merits (they did).

THE INQUIRY ASKS ME ABOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY “DIVERGENCE OF
VIEWS BETWEEN LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES AND/OR MEMBERS OF THE
[POL] BOARD".

66. From my review of the material parts of the WBD files | can see a reference to
what could be seen as a divergence of views in an e mail chain of 16 March
2019.15 It appears from that e mail chain that | was aware of differing views
existing within the POL Board, but | either never had any detail on that topic
(such as who thought what) given my limited contact with Board members of

POL or now cannot recall any specifics.

THE REQUEST ASKS ME TO SET OUT IN DETAIL MY REFLECTIONS

REGARDING: (A) THE ADVICE THAT | GAVE TO POL AND (B) MY

INVOLVEMENT IN THIS MATTER. WITH HINDSIGHT, WOULD | HAVE DONE

ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY?

67. It is important to repeat the apology | have made above.

68. In terms of my involvement, | considered that:

68.1 The function of the legal team (particularly Counsel) was to set out
clearly the legal principles involved in making an application for recusal

and whether there was a sound basis for doing so.

68.2 For the reasons set out in this statement | was involved more as a
conduit for that advice to be given to POL rather than providing the
advice or offering an opinion, acknowledging that | did provide my views

on occasion, as | have identified above.

69. The decision as to whether the recusal application should be made rested

ultimately with POL.

70. Given the narrow scope of my role and my limited knowledge on relevant
matters, as | set out in this statement, and given the robust advice that POL
received from two of the most senior and respected Counsel in the country, |
find it hard to envisage what | would have done differently (at the time) on the
recusal application that | was temporarily involved in. Had the advice received
from the new Counsel team been less strong, then | can see that different
courses of action may have presented themselves, but given the nature of the
advice received, the steps that POL took appeared, at the time, to be proper

and legally sustainable positions to adopt. If | am permitted to speak from a

position of hindsight, then | regret that the recusal application was made,
because | can well see — knowing what | now know about the very serious
issues affecting the Horizon system — that it added to the complexity and

challenges faced by the Claimants in the GLO Proceedings.

THE REQUEST ASKS WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER MATTERS THAT |

WISH TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CHAIR OF THE INQUIRY?

71. There are no other matters that | wish to bring to the attention of the Chair of
the Inquiry.
Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
