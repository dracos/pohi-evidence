Hi Belinda,

My understanding is that this is Chris A’s project and that Lesley was leading on the IT issues.

I know that Chris was negotiating with Deloittes on costs.

Regards

Julie

Subject: Deloitte invoices

Chris/Lesley

I have been asked to authorise invoices for Deloitte amounting to £241,200. I have no information relating to the actual
costs agreed with Deloitte so I am unable to do so at this stage. The last information I recall was where a ‘capped’ figure
of £50k was discussed. Although I am aware that Deloitte were subsequently asked to undertake further work I cannot
find any agreement in relation to costs.

Additionally, I had understood that this work, although arising from the Linklaters advice, was BAU activity as it has wider
application than simply the Scheme. In order that these invoices can be processed could you please let me know whether
payment of these invoices should come from the ‘Sparrow’ budget or from IT’s BAU (or some other) budget. If the latter,
Lesley, would you please be able to advise where I can send the invoices for payment?

Either way, would either of you be able to advise whether the amount invoiced is consistent with the amount agreed with
Deloitte.

Best wishes

Belinda
