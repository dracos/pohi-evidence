<TranType: Meaning
01 Balance Enquiry — Mag Stripe
03 Cash Withdrawal — Mag Stripe
04 Cash Withdrawal with Balance — Mag Stripe
06 Change PIN - Mag Stripe
61 Balance Enquiry — Chip and PIN
62 Cash Deposit — Chip and PIN
63 Cash Withdrawal — Chip and PIN
64 Cash Withdrawal with Balance — Chip and PIN
65 Cash Withdraw Limit — Chip and PIN

In all cases where the Response was “Authorised OK” (152 transactions), the
Transaction was either a Balance Enquiry or Change of PIN (Transaction Types 01, 06
or 61), where no Cash is expected to have changed hands.

Response Codes 03, 04, 06 and 08, indicate that the Financial Institution has decline
the Transaction, and so no Cash should change hands.

Response Codes 23 and 26 indicate an unusual Response from the Financial
Institution and again no Cash should change hands.

Finally, Response Code 32 indicates that Horizon’s Central system has received no
response from the Financial Institution within a timeout period, and so no Cash should
change hands,

All these are perfectly normal occurrences and should result in clear instructions being
passed to the Counter Clerk to ensure that no Cash should change hands.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate
because of the improper use of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief
at all material times the computer was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which
it was not operating properly, or was out of operation was not such as to effect the
information held on it. | hold a responsible position in relation to the working of the
computer.
