Fujitsu TfSNow Reference Number xxxx xxxxx

Which relates to your team:

3 Definitions
3.1. Standard Complaint

Acomplaint is a formal notification by a branch that they are dissatisfied with the Service, or the
Customer Experience provided by Fujitsu. Complaints can be raised against any aspect of any Service,
and can include complaints about:

e Incident Management — speed of resolution and customer experience — timeliness of updates,
management of expectation.

e Technology — central infrastructure and application performance.

The majority of standard complaints are logged via the POL IT Digital Service Desk, who are responsible
for managing the complaint and where appropriate providing feedback to the branch. Not all complaints
require feedback, as branches can log complaints for information only; however, any complaint which
requires investigation must be passed to the MAC team for Fujitsu to provide a formal response.
Branches can log complaints during normal working hours, but the review, validation, investigation and
response by Fujitsu will only take place between Monday to Friday 08:00 — 17:00.

The standard complaints process is detailed under section 4.1.

3.2. High Profile Complaints

Some complaints are categorised as High Profile Complaints (HPC), which indicates that senior
management within POL are aware of the allegations and will be copied on the completed investigation.
AHPC can be logged through several methods for example, MP escalation or POL Senior Management
escalation. High Profile Complaints are managed by POL, by the appropriate Service Manager, who is
responsible for compiling the formal response. Not all HPC require investigation by Fujitsu, however
when applicable, the response must be turned around within 8 working hours.

The High Profile Complaints process is detailed under section 4.1.2

3.3. Management Information Definitions
3.3.1 Complaint Logging

The definitions below categorise the complaint when it is passed to Fujitsu and is provided by the POL IT
Digital Service Desk team when the complaint is emailed to the MAC team.

3.3.1.1. Duplicate Complaint

Branches sometimes will contact POL on multiple occasions regarding the same complaint. POL will
forward the complaint to the MAC team and the MAC team will manage the first instance that the
complaint was raised and reject the other complaints referring to the original.

3.3.2. Complaint Closure

Once a complaint passed for investigation has been reviewed by the SDM, it is classified as either
Justified or Not Justified for the purposes of Fujitsu's monthly reporting, before return to the POL IT
Digital Service Desk.

3.3.2.1 Justified Complaint

Acomplaint is classified as Justified if following the investigation Fujitsu agrees that the branch had
cause to complain and that the Service provided was unacceptable.

3.3.2.2 Unjustified Complaint

Acomplaint is classified as Not Justified if following the investigation Fujitsu has evidence to demonstrate
that the service provided to the branch was of an acceptable standard, although areas for improvement
may exist.
