Penny,

If you no longer have the ability to load messages into Riposte, then no you can't.

If they were within the last year (or within a year of a branch closing) then they are still available on the live
system and can be extracted easily - but would not have had all your normal audit checks made on them.

I don’t think we can provide branch trading statements now, can we?
This would be for litigation purposes

Penny,

I have a case at Court and our Barrister has queried the quality of the Branch Trading Statements (photocopies)
that are part of the evidence. The problem is that the actual BTs are of very poor quality.

I was wondering if there is a way that BTs can be reproduced months after they were originally produced?
