Dear Mandy,

I refer to our telephone conversation this morning.

lI attach the first draft statement of Catherine Oglesby for your comment and approval. Iam
also sending this email to Counsel for comment. Once Julian and I have your feedback, we will

email it to Catherine Oglesby to approve.

The exhibit is really bulky and would be too big to attach to this email, so I propose to send the
exhibit minus the Cash Accounts to you by a separate pdf email.

Julian and I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
