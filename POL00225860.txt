Post Office Account User Access Procedure

Fe)
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

The User Access Process details how access is to be gained to both physical and technical assets within
the PO Account and Fujitsu supporting functions and is managed by a central point - the CSPOA
Security Operations Team.

It sets out how access to these assets shall be created, managed and removed and reports and monitors
these requirements. The CSPOA Security Operations Team controls the access to systems and any
asset dedicated to PO Account and receives reports from other functions within Fujitsu who provide a
shared service to the account.

This process does not cover the PO Account engineer's access as this is covered in
SVM/SEC/PRO/0002 Horizon Online Security Pass Procedure.

1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the controls that PO Account has to meet to manage user access to its
assets, based on its contractual requirements in particular those shown below from Schedule A4
Legislation Policies and Standards.

4.1.2 “Fujitsu Services shall be compliant with ISO 27001.”

4.1.4 “Fujitsu Services shall adhere to the relevant parts of the CCD entitled “Community
Information Security Policy for Horizon” (CISP) (SVM/SEC/POL/0005) and co-operate with Post
Office to assist Post Office in complying with this standard and requirement.

4.1.5 “The confidentiality, integrity, validity, and completeness of data shall be maintained
throughout all storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of Service Failure
and recovery from Service Failure.”

Appendix A Section 5.1 refers to the control sections required for user management in ISO 27001.
Section 5.2 explains ISO 27002 user management requirements used as the basis of PO Ltd’s CISP
requirements and also refers to Fujitsu Corporate Procedures that are required to follow Fujitsu's
Business Management System (BMS).

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

User System Access

1.2 Pre-requisites for allocation and removal of Access

Prior to access being requested for PO Account specific assets Fujitsu HR processes for joiners and
movers onto the account, including processes for RIO or ERIC where shared services are used, shall be
followed.

For shared services Line Mangers will apply for resources via a RIO or Eric according to the Fujitsu
corporate procedures as detailed on Cafevik at http://toolset1 fs. fujitsu.com/InternalRequests.asp.

Once employment is confirmed the Line Manager will initiate the relevant security clearance process that
is carried out by Fujitsu Group Security. The forms requesting security clearance can be found via
Cafevik http://www.cafevik.fs.fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=106. These forms will ensure that the
individual has the required Fujitsu Services basic checks and the PO Account specific Credit Check and
Criminal Record check completed.

Once the individual is accepted into the role and the relevant clearance level granted the Line Manager
can then apply for support system accesses to be set-up and for Fujitsu Facilities management to
provide physical access to relevant locations for the role.

If the individual fails clearance then HR and the Line Manager will be notified and the circumstances
discussed with the PO Account CISO and Security Operations Manager to agree how to proceed.

In addition, if an individual moves away from PO Account or leaves Fujitsu then the Fujitsu HR
processes are to be invoked by the individual's Line Manager and the CSPOA Security Operations Team
notified of this to ensure revocation of their access from all PO Account specific assets.

For those individuals who are leaving Fujitsu Services completely then the Line Manager must follow HR
policies and procedures for a termination. These are found on the Cafevik at
http://www.cafevik. fs. fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=152.

1.3 CSPOA User Registry

The User Access Process on the PO Account is based on the creation and control of a registry of all
personne! who work on the account.

This register is controlled by the CSPOA Security Operations Team, and is maintained and updated on a
regular basis in line with requests being submitted and tracks all personnel working on the account, the
system access they have been given and any security clearance level that they have been granted.

It will also aid any Audit that may be required, by providing the details of personnel and access levels
granted.

The user registry holds the information about each individual who has been granted access and the
systems that they have been granted access to. In addition it contains details of the authoriser, approver
and dates that this access was granted last reviewed and revoked. Details of the fields held within this
registry are shown in Appendix B.

5 Appendix A
5.1 18027001

ISO 27001 has two clear sections, the clauses which are detailed in Sections 4-8 and those which are
guidelines as to best practices in Annexes 5-15, usually referred to with an A preceding them.

In the ISO 27001 framework the controls that we are required to meet fall into the following generic
areas, People, Infrastructure, Applications, Control, Operations and Management Review and
Monitoring and are detailed in full on the Security Operations SharePoint.

5.2 Security Requirements

This section defines the policies for controlling access to the PO Account IT systems in compliance with
the Post Office CISP.

BS/ISO IEC 20002, “A Code of Practice for Information Security Management,” is primarily concerned
with management and operational controls, but also sets out a number of technical security controls.
BS/ISO IEC 20002 is used as the basis of PO Account Security Policy and Procedures to define the
controls used throughout PO Account

Fujitsu Services shall operate a quality management system, which complies with BS EN ISO
9001:2008.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of directive, preventive, detective, corrective,
and recovery controls that are used to manage hardware, software, operations, data, media, network
equipment, support systems, physical areas, and personnel. They involve both manual procedures as
well as technical controls on the IT system.

Documents defining the Corporate Fujitsu (UK & Ireland) related policies, processes and procedures that
are used take precedence over any PO Account documentation, are held on CafeVik at:

o Group property and Facilities management
