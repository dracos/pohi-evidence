RE: notes from today's phone meeting *re-issued*

*updated/reissued as missed Rod from the Attendees list*

Notes from Second Sight / Post Office meeting 1% March 2013

Attendees: Susan Crichton, Simon Baker, Ian Henderson, Ron Warmington, Rod Ismay

Not present: Angela Van-Den-Bogerd, Alwen Lyons,

Items Discussed:

Update on number of cases: 28 MP submitted cases. 60 JFSA inquires of which 20 may result in cases or spot reviews.
2. Spot reviews: Three have been passed to POL for comment.

there will be 30 spot reviews in total.
3. Ian had phone meeting with James Arbuthnot yesterday to talk about the meeting on the 25"

aooo

e.
f

James Arbuthnot is expecting about 6 MPs at that meeting
They are looking to 2 Sight to reassure them that POL isn’t pushing/influencing the investigators
James Arbuthnot is now recommending inviting Alice and Senior members of Post Office

POL may get some more the end of next week. Best guess is that

The PR aspect will be important. Some MPs will be fighting their own PR corner. The Post Office PR team will need to be

ready to respond to outcome of the meeting.
Confirmed ground rules that we shouldn't discuss individual cases or individual names

Theme: started with a large bundle of complaints, these have been distilled into half a dozen areas to investigate.
Defense not yet on its feet to no opportunity yet to respond to the allegations.

4. Ian noted that he has now received CD3 and the first data files for the spot review
5. Action: Ian to e-mail Simon the general issues that the investigation will be focusing on.
6. Action: Simon to set up a meeting with Alwen, Alana, Mark Davies, Susan, Ron, Ian to discuss PR
