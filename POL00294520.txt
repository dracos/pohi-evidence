ROYAL MAIL GROUP (POST OFFICE LTD) — CASE REVIEW

R. v Katherine Jane McQue

Kendall Magistrates Court and Carlisle Crown Court

Offence and Case history

1. On 28" February 2011 at Carlisle Crown Court, this defendant pleaded guilty,
on a basis, to one count of Fraud, contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006.
On 10" May 2011 she was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for

two years with a 150 hour unpaid work requirement.

2. Ms McQue first appeared at Kendall Magistrates Court on the 13” October
2009. The case was adjourned to 27" October 2009 and the matter was further
adjourned to 22" December 2009 for committal on which date it was

committed to Carlisle Crown Court.

3. The PCMH was listed on the 2" February 2010 on which date the defendant

pleaded not guilty and the case was warned for trial on 19" April 2010.

4. A defence statement was served in manuscript form which disputed theft or any
dishonest representations on the Horizon system with intent to make a gain for
herself or cause POL a loss. She admitted making such representations to
cover the losses. These losses were due to errors on the Horizon system, her

incompetence and that of her staff.

5. On the 19" April 2010 the trial was adjourned for the defence to instruct an
expert. The trial was refixed for 31% August 2010.

6. This fixture was broken on the 27" July 2010 as the defence had not received
their expert report. After this date there was a hiatus in proceedings as the
defence sought further disclosure for their expert. The case appeared in court

on the 16" November 2010 and was fixed for trial on the 28" February 2011.

7. The experts were asked to liaise before the trial date. The Defence were using
an expert called Charles McLachlan and POL used Gareth Jenkins from
Fujitsu. There is evidence that the experts discussed the Falkirk bug but the
tenor of the letters is that none of the other bugs referred to in the Second
Sight Interim Report was discussed — although it may be that these had not

come to light by this date.

8. On the day of the trial, 28 February 2011 the defendant pleaded guilty to
count 2 (Fraud). The Crown insisted that the basis of plea stipulate that there

was nothing wrong with the Horizon system.

Prosecution case

9. The defendant, Katherine Jane McQue was during the relevant period,
22/10/2005 — 08/06/2009, a sub postmaster at Rinkfield Sub Post Office.

10. On 8" June 2009 an audit took place at Rinkfield Sub Post Office.

11. On the date of the audit the auditor found a total shortage of £24,911.96 made

up as follows:

e £26,792.84 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures

e £166.42 (-) identified as a difference in stock figures

e £161.47 (-) identified as a difference in postage stamp figures

e £42.75 (-) identified as a difference in foreign currency figures

e £923.55 (+) Postage credit owed by customers — paid back by
customers during the audit

e £30.00 (-) Suspense account entry without evidence on hand —

redeemed at audit
£1,357.97 (+) Discrepancy as per office snapshot

12. A transactional correction in favour of the branch was due to be issued

reducing the audit shortage by £814.97.

13. Ms McQue, in her interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police

and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 18"

June 2009 said that:

She had produced false accounts since August 2008

She had not taken any money

She had experienced substantial losses at the branch and falsified the
accounts by inflating the cash to hide the discrepancy.

They did not share passwords at the branch but did have a communal
fictitious ID and password ANY0O1 which they used when they
received a number of items to be posted.

She balanced the cash and stock each week

The branch started having losses about 12 months before the audit. She
could not make them good and inflated the cash on hand to enable her
to have more time to make good the losses.

She knew of the £26k cash figure but not of the shortages in stock,

postage and bureau.

Defence case

14. In interview the defendant denies taking POL money but admits that she

inflated the cash figure to cover the discrepancies that had occurred over 12

months

15. The defendant served a defence statement which denied taking any POL money

and questioned the Horizon system. Two defence expert witnesses were

commissioned to investigate this case

16. The guilty plea was entered on the day of the trial.

Discussion

17. In reviewing this case I have only seen the prosecution correspondence file and
have not seen the full case papers. I have not seen the original statements nor
the interviews or other exhibits and rely upon the officer’s report. I have seen
both of the defence expert reports. This in my view is sufficient for the

purposes of this review.

18. This case was dealt with by way of a guilty plea at the eleventh hour on the day
of trial. Until that time the matter looked like an effective trial. The defendant
pleaded guilty to Fraud effectively on the basis of her admissions in interview.
She conceded that she had concealed the deficit to avoid her contractual
obligation to repay the amount of the deficit. The Crown effectively conceded
that they could not show that she had taken the money and the Judge in
sentencing said that the defendant had not benefited from the fraud (Slightly
odd as she had benefited by the time that her fraud had bought her!)

19. The insistence of the Crown that the defendant give Horizon a clean bill of
health in her basis of plea was somewhat unattractive and may be something

that will embarrass us in due course.

20. In this case there was a direct attack on the figures produced from the audit, a
direct challenge to Horizon and a firm assertion that she was not properly
trained and did not understand the system. These are all issues dealt with in the
Second Sight Interim Report and it is my view that had we been possessed of
that report during the course of this case we would have made the defence

aware of its contents.

2

. This is a case where POL fielded Gareth Jenkins as their expert. There have
been worries about his independence as a witness as he is an employee of

Fujitsu. There is a suspicion that Gareth Jenkins knew of the bugs highlighted
POL00294520
POL00294520

by the Second Sight Interim Report and did not bring them to the attention of
POL until after that Report was published in July 2013. There is a document in
POL’s possession known as “The Helen Rose Report” which may give some

weight to that suggestion.

22. This defendant may well be hard put to found an appeal against either
conviction or sentence in this case as she admitted submitting false figures in
interview and the sentence is hardly manifestly excessive for this type of case.
Nonetheless where a defendant pleads guilty as late in the day as this one,
there is always a concern that the plea was tendered in a spirit of pragmatism
rather than an acceptance of guilt and such a plea might not have been tendered
in this case had the defence had material upon which they could have mounted
an attack on the Prosecution’s figures. It is my view that we should disclose the
Second Sight Interim Report and the Helen Rose Report to those who were
acting for Ms McQue in order that they can consider and advise upon her

options.

Conclusion

23. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we would have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the
Second Sight Interim Report during the trial process. We would also have
served the Helen Rose Report in light of the extensive involvement of Gareth
Jenkins in this case. His conversations with the defence expert may well have
been important in the defendant’s final decision to plead guilty. It is my view
that we are still under a duty to make those instructed by Ms McQue aware of

the contents of both Reports and they should be written to accordingly.
