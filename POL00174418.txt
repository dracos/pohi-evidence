Hi Mark,
More than happy to have a coffee/tea on Friday morning, say 11 am if this fits your schedule?

Hi Elena

Thanks for this. It's certainly the case that in the cases referred to us there has been no evidence at all of Horizon
being the reason for any losses in branch. Indeed losses have been clearly the result of individual action.

Happy to discuss of course. I am not around on Thursday so maybe on Friday morning?

Best wishes
Mark

Hi Mark,

The programme last evening was indeed damaging and I think highlights again the questions about
Horizon systems and if it is true there were bugs within the system?

I know our external auditor raised a couple of years some issues regarding the change management
process for Horizon.

Would you have time for a 15 min chat this week at any point (less tomorrow as I am not in the office)?

Hello

As you know, the BBC Panorama programme broadcast some very
damaging and unsubstantiated allegations about the business last
night.

We are today assessing next steps, and specifically including whether
Mark Davies we will take any action through legal or other avenues.

Communications &
Corporate Affairs My judgement is that the programme did not produce anything we

Director were unfamiliar with, but was very one-sided. .

It is welcome, however, that the issue has not so far been picked up
widely by other media.

Please do let me know direct a
you or anyone in your team has questions or comments about the

programme. It will have come across as emotive and shocking to those
unfamiliar with the issue. There is much more to it, unreported by the
BBC, but any colleague with any question shouldn't hesitate to raise it.

T hope this is helpful.
