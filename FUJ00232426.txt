Introduction

The efficient provision of information to the CA and ICL Pathway staff is vital
to the MIS component of the ICL Pathway solution. Appropriate scheduling of
reports minimises the impact on the main data warehouse.

The following process details how the report scheduling system is
maintained. This is in terms of both the production and timing of reports. The
distribution of reports is considered to be a factor of the scheduling

Scope

This process covers scheduled reports produced to meet the requirements of
MIS. In addition it will cover the production of Ad-Hoc queries.

Customer Service Information Analyst

To receive and assess requests for scheduling
and report changes and to implement those
changes if required.

Schedule or Report changes are initiated by a
Schedule Change Request / Report Change
Request Form (Appendix 1). Receipt of the
document is logged on the Schedule Request
Log by the IA who gives _ it a unique
reference. For Schedule Change Request
Forms an impact assessment is performed and
recommendations produced. The Scheduling
Change Request is updated accordingly. The
Requestor and IA/ IC then review the impact.
If they deem the change to be no longer
worthwhile then they cancel the request,
updating the Schedule Request Log to show
the termination of the request. If it is found that
the change falls within the parameters of the
ICL Pathway Change Control Procedure then a
CP will be raised. The System Request Log
and Schedule Change Request are then
updated to show that the case is being
escalated to full Change Proposal. Otherwise
the Schedule List is amended accordingly by
the IA.

4.2 Ad-Hoc Query Process
Process Owner: Information Analyst
Process Objective: To provide a process which allows queries to

be created quickly but in a controlled manner
at the request of individuals. Requests for Ad-
Hoc reports should come from a single point of
contact within PDA, BA or POCL.

Process Rationale: On receipt of an Ah-hoc Query Request Form
the IA updates the Schedule Request Log. This
log gives an element of control to the requests
that will be received. If an ad-hoc report is
requested on a regular basis, or it takes and
inordinate amount of time to run, the process
will be exercised to the full. In such cases, the
report requestor would be asked to confirm the
frequency at which the report is required,
thereby ensuring it gets added to the list of
‘regular’ reports if required. In the event that a
query is estimated to take longer than an hour
to run, the IA would inform the requestor that
the report would be delayed, if the requestor
still wishes to receive the information it is
provided to him. On completion of the request,
the Schedule Request log is updated to show
that the appropriate action has been taken.

4.3 Report Production Process
Process Owner: Information Analyst
Process Objective: To outline the controls placed on the
production of reports.
Process Rationale: The Schedule list controls the production of

reports and is maintained by the IA. The list
directs the execution of reports and the output
is distributed electronically to the relevant
locations. In the event that a report does not
arrive as expected then the recipient will inform
the IA who will rectify the situation as per
Report Non-Receipt Process (Section 4.4).

Ad-hoc reports are not placed on the schedule
list. These queries are run as appropriate so
as to minimise the impact on the system while
at the same time providing the requestor with
a speedy response. Non Receipt of ad-hoc
queries is dealt with by the Report Non-Receipt
Process.

To provide a controlled environment in which
thereceipt of reports can be processed and
remedial action implemented.

On being informed that a report has not been
received the IA completes the relevant sections
of the Report Problems Log. The IA then
checks whether the Report was run. If it was
not run he arranges for it to be run and
distributed as per the distribution list. If the
request has been run it is re-sent to the
individual reporting non-receipt.

If the report cannot be re-run by the IA, a call is
made by the IA to the Horizon Helpdesk and 3%
line support are tasked, as required, to solve
the problem and the report is re-sent. The
exact cause of all problems is investigated and
documented on the Report Problems Log.
Remedial action is determined and
implemented.
