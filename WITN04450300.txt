POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

THIRD WITNESS STATEMENT OF STEPHEN BRADSHAW

I, STEPHEN BRADSHAW, will say as follows;

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

following my oral testimony on 11 January 2024.
Witness statement for criminal prosecution

2. Iwas questioned at length about POLO0120723, a witness statement signed
by me and dated 20 November 2012. During my testimony I provided that this

‘statement was not drafted by me, although I did sign it.

3. Having reflected on this witness statement, my recollection is that it this was
essentially a template. These templates were standardised and were akin to

Position statements or corporate statements.

4. As I provided in my testimony I am not an IT expert and so would not have
been qualified to give a statement or evidence on the reliability of Horizon,

rather I was adopting the corporate position. I had no reason to believe that

the advice I was receiving from the lawyers who were engaged to do this work

for the Post Office were wrong. I was in no position to challenge the advice
and so I did my job and signed the statement. Given my position in the

organisation I wasn't able to question the advice that Horizon was accurate.

ARQ Data

5. Another witness was asked by counsel for Mhari McDougal, Mr Henry, about

my role in interviews.’ In particular it was suggested that I had responsibility

for assessing requests for ARQ data, and that I was the gatekeeper for ARQ

requests. Mr Henry questioned me during the hearing of my evidence but he

didn't put this allegation about me to me. If he had put this allegation to me I
would have been able to explain that I was not any sort of ‘gatekeeper’ of
ARQ data. I was able to request ARQ data through the usual channel, which
was the casework team, just like everyone else. I didn't have any special

responsibility for assessing ARQ data requests and I was surprised to see it

suggested that I was some sort of gatekeeper. I can't remember any occasion

on which I requested ARQ data directly from Fujitsu. I never had any kind of

gatekeeper role.

6. ! was also asked questions about Rita Threlfall. It was claimed that I put her in
a small parcel lift. This is incorrect. I would never do something like that. Ms
Threlfall was placed in a lift specially designated for wheelchair access. I have
attached photos to this statement. The fourth photo shows that this lift is
approved for up to 5 people. It is not a parcel lift. It is an ordinary lift for
people. Please see WITN04450301, WITN04450302, WITN04450303, and
WITN04450304.

My position in the organisation

7. Ihave been surprised at some of the comments about my former role when
reading through closing statements from counsel. I want the Inquiry to
understand what my role in the Post Office was. As an investigation manager
(as I was at the time) I wasn't involved in managing other people. It was the
investigation that I was managing. This was a role that many people in the
organisation carried out — when I started in this role there would have been
around 40 other people with the same title. From my perspective I was at the
bottom rung of the organisation. I had no special role or input at any higher
level, and have been surprised to see my name used in the same breath as
much more senior people in the organisation.
