Dear Gareth

You may remember me from my days working as Jack Straw's SPAD. I hope you are well.

I've noticed today that you've signed an EDM on the Post Office and our Horizon system. I'd like to ask you to meet with me to
discuss these issues if you are able to please? There is a huge amount of misinformation, not least in the Panorama programme, and

now reflected in the EDM.

Ican send you more details (and will send you our rebuttal to Panorama) but I really would be grateful for a quick chat or call on this
issue.

Best wishes

Mark
