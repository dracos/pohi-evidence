BUSINESS CASE & SUMMARY OF WORK:

Business Case:

The audit system stores data for either 7 years or 18 months depending on its type. In recent
years, the Post Office have asked to keep the data longer, beyond the standard. Currently it is
set at 4 years.

As a result, no data is purged each evening however in October 2018 the data will start to be
purged. The Post Office have requested that the data is kept an additional 2 years.

Summary of Work:
A configuration file exists which defines how long data should be kept beyond the standard.

The configuration will be changed to cater for the additional 2 years.

RELATED WORK PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
(the “WORK PACKAGE”)

The configuration will have the relevant item increased from the current 35040 hours to 52560
hours. This increases the value from 4 to 6 years. This configuration exists on the two audit
servers PARC201 and PARC202

RELATED WORK PACKAGE OUTPUTS:

Retention of audit records, that would previously have been deleted

RELATED WORK PACKAGE ELEMENT(S) (IF ANY): N/A
(the “WORK PACKAGE ELEMENT”)

RELATED CCN NUMBER (IF ANY) and TYPE (e.g. Support/Maintenance Costs,
CCD Update, Contract Amendment):
None

IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE:
Exact dates for progression of this change to be agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services upon approval of this CT and supply of a valid Purchase Order.

This will be based on Fujitsu Service’s current understanding of the business requirement, the
overall forward schedule (including, but not limited to, Horizon Data Centre Refresh, Test
Rigs, etc.) and already approved and scheduled work which may be in progress or due to

PAYMENT PLAN/TERMS OF PAYMENT:

The resourcing man days to support each activity under this CT will be charged on an ‘actuals’
Time and Materials basis and with the Other Charges will be invoiced monthly in arrears (e.g.
usage). Timesheets will be provided to support invoicing of the man-days. Payment by Post
Office is due within 30 days of receipt of invoice.

This CT has been impacted based on an activity estimate. This CT comprises three elements:

- ASM Development Capacity Resources -funded and reported under the ASM
arrangement in accordance with the provisions in CCN1639 and CCN1642.

- ASM Capability Wrap Resources - funded and reported under CT2612b.

- Resources - funded on a Time and Materials basis by this CT.
Note - The availability of the ASM Development Capacity Resources and ASM Capability
Wrap Resources are managed through the Demand Planning Forum. Depending on the
priorities set, the availability of the capacity to deliver this CT may change and additional
T&M resources may be required.

There are some instances where the actual effort required to deliver this CT will exceed the
estimate and as soon as Fujitsu Services become aware it will liaise with the Post Office CT
owner to highlight the predicted over spend and will raise a further CT to cover this once
agreement has been authorised.

For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts estimated in respect of individual activities defined in
“Gross Price’ (above) may be exceeded, providing the total estimate in ‘Gross Price’ is not
exceeded.

Notwithstanding any rates listed in these CTs, charges will be invoiced at the rates applicable in
the Financial Year in which the service is provided.

All sums payable under these Commercial Terms are stated exclusive of VAT.

OTHER:

There is no Programme Governance Charge added by this CT as it is assumed it will be
covered by CT2578 “Formalisation of the Fixed Price Programme Governance Charges
for the period Ist July 2018 until 30th September 2018”. If that is not approved or
upon expiry of CT2578, and where no further commercial agreement is reached
recovering the Programme Governance charges, then additional charges may apply to
this CT, and will be progressed through the Change Control procedure.

This CT2616a replaces CT2616 which was submitted on 2" August 2018 and which is
hereby withdrawn by the submission of this CT2616a.
