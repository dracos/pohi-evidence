Hello Jonny,

Apologies for the delay.

Thoughts on the summary are as follows (apart from the key point you already recognise upfront that
you have by definition collapsed certain matters / removed some detail that is present in the overall report:

2.1 — Ok, maybe worth calling out in 2.1.3 that this is a theoretical risk and outside of ‘processes’

2.4-this is true, but the main segregation of duties point we are making is around access to fake a digital
signature, rather than access to audit logs. If you can’t fake a digital signature then for counter initiated
transactions you are unable to disguise the fact you have tampered with the data even if you edit audit logs etc.

2.5 —as per previous comment.

3.3 —in 3.3.4 would change to testing controls more generally (one way of testing controls is walking through the
processes)

3.4 — We did do some limited review of source code if you refer to the agreed procedures list.

4.1.1 — BRDB is ‘hosted on a’ central server, rather than is the central server

4.1.5 — should read ‘in the branch database’ rather than ‘Branch Data’.

4.2.1 —JSN is different to the digital signature. Digital Signature is a unique ‘hash’ applied to each message that can
be checked to ensure accuracy and validity of the message. The JSN I believe signed by the digital signature and is

used to support completeness. Plus if it is edited the digital signature will no longer match the message (I believe).

4.2.2 (b) — I think they are delivered via interface files from the remote locations which have header and footer
records etc to check completeness. I don’t think they can be used to verify data integrity beyond completeness,
which as we've highlighted previously means they are more vulnerable than counter generated transactions.

4.4.2 — ok, maybe reference that controls above in place in new Horizon?

5.1—Doesn’t this contradict what you state elsewhere around global users and database superusers

WBD_000342.000001
WBONO0000472
WBON0000472

6.1 — You are accurate with the number is 26 from what we have observed during our testing.

6.3.1&3 — Need to be careful to understand the difference between JSNs, digital signatures, and digital seals as
explained in the report.

6.3.6 — We only have verbal representation they cannot amend activity logs. Also due to the MDS message digest
having being ‘cracked’ the digital seals are not necessarily reliable (but these are not the digital signature as per
previous point).

6.5.1 — Not sure what you are getting at here? We have not looked at the interface routines at remote points in the
dataflow to the counter infrastructure.

6.6.1 —As articulated earlier we haven't really affirmed either way whether they can amend activity / audit logs (FJ
attest they can’t however)

6.7 — This is probably true but as articulated earlier the SOD issue is more around access to the keys which would
allow you to hide the fact you have edited the digital signature. I think what you may actually be referring to here is

looking at whether any super users have been logged deleting transactions etc, such work likely requiring controls
support to verify

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Andy,

On 1) It is fairly standard for audit logs to be editable. It is a common problem with audit logs as a
concept that it becomes very hard to segregate them from the ‘God’ users, although on the most
secure systems it can be achieved. Like the other data, the window of opportunity would be limited as
Audit Logs are ‘hoovered up’ by the event management system and transferred to the audit store on a
fairly timely basis (at which point they would become uneditable), just like everything else. As part of
our work Fujitsu have implied the logs are segregated from the superusers, and so we could potentially
look to test this if deemed of sufficient value?

On 2) I would imagine theoretically, but if limited to the branch database alone they would likely need
to collude with other individuals such as other post masters as to actually extract money would in all
likelihood require access to other systems. Finance system, Payments gateway etc.

On 3) We have identified the list of accounts which could (rather than has) breached SoD at the
database level, but just trying to confirm with Fujitsu at the OS level as well. When we have the
complete list and have vetted with Fujitsu, we will include within the report as an Appendix. In the
interest of early clarity its more than 2 users.

Lewis, Mark

A few (hopefully) quick questions.

In relation to Super-users, as I understand it, BRDB access is recorded in a separate audit log. TI

WBONO0000472
WBON0000472

he problem is that

there are two super-users who can also access this audit log and could, theoretically, therefore change the BRDB and
then change the log to cover their tracks. Perhaps a silly question by me but (i) why is the audit log editable at all and
why is it not just read only and (ii) is there an audit of the audit log, that would should show someone has changed the

audit log?

Do you know whether it would be possible for a super-user to change the BRDB in such a way that they could

financially benefit? Eg. redirect payments to another account?

Do you have the names of the super-users at FJ who have broken the segregation of duties protocol?
