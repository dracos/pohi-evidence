I would be pleased if you would accept a request to come to a meeting with myself, Oliver
Letwin, Mike Wood, and Andrew Bridgen to discuss progress on the mediation process. I am
not alone in becoming increasingly worried about the tone that is emerging from
proceedings and’I am beginning to fear its disintegration. I would like to discuss this with
you as soon as possible.

The following times suit me. Might you be able to make one of them? I am very keen to
meet as soon as possible.

5 pm Monday 27 October

5 pm Monday 3 November
5pm Monday 10 November
6pm Monday 17 November

If none of these suit, please would your office call mine to discuss times that might be
available? I shall ask Janet to call your office next week to check.

Also, might you let me have an answer to my letter of 4 September 2014 to you please
about meeting with my colleague Jim Hood MP and myself? I did write to remind you about
this a month ago but am yet to have a response. *

Den fame,

Thank you for your letter of 17 September regarding the concerns Alan has expressed about how
the Working Group meetings are proceeding and attendance at those meetings. For your
information, Post Office General Counsel is the lead PO representative at the meeting and from
time to time takes along members of his team who are involved in the case work, as do Second
Sight.

As you note, the Working Group is independent, and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene
as its proceedings, including who attends, are matters for the Group and the Chair. It is of course
open to Alan to raise any concerns relating to Working Group meetings with the Chair.

Yoursesincerely,

GRO

Paula Vennells
& Chief Executive
