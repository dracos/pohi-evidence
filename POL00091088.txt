Hi Dave

Ineed some advice on this please.

There are a raft of emails with this below but the gist of it is is that John Scott tasked me with being the contact point for the MP cases
and I initially liaised with Simon Baker and formally put in a Change Request for a quote for the retrieval of the 7 years of data for the
offices concerned and for Fujitsu to run a workshop with the external auditor which I did and heard nothing else after that.

From the email string I now appear to be out of the loop as I understand (from Penny) that a workshop has taken place and that POL
have been told by Fujitsu that they need to be more specific around what information they require. The latest requests are for Helpdesk
calls, again relating to the MP cases and have been asked for directly to Fujitsu and Penny has pushed back and said that it has to
come through the Security Team via me. The request has arrived in the POS box and states that they were to be retrieved by cop
yesterday or today at the latest. I have already spoken to Nigel Allen and explained that this is not possible.

T now need to speak to Simon Baker because the helpdesk calls data needs to form part of the overall request that has to go to Fujitsu.
My question is, should I explain all this to John Scott before I speak to Simon? I am conscious that there are a number of people
jumping all over this and I do not want to be seen as the stumbling block.

Happy to discuss but have lost my voice so was easier to put down in email

Regards

Jane

I've sent the details on to the team and will catch Jane when she is out of her meeting so what action has already taken
place as this all be in hand all ready.

There is a bigger piece of work ongoing at present which Jane is involved with, hopefully this is already in the mix and
not an isolated case that we're not aware of and comes back to bite.

Mark
I would be grateful if you could give this priority please.

This information is required by Second Sight, the forensic accountants who are looking at the Horizon challenge cases
brought to them by MP's. Ideally, I need this information by close of business today or if not, then first thing tomorrow.

Chris Bhandari, with whom I am working with on this task has previously spoken to Jane Owen, so please refer to her for
any clarification.

Many thanks
