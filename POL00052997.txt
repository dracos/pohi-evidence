URGENT
Investigation Team Post Office Limited

c.c. Lisa Allen

POST OFFICE LIMITED v SUZANNE LESLEY PALMER
BASILDON CROWN COURT.

TRIAL = W/L WIC 22"° JANUARY 2007

CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0619

I have received a letter from the Defence Solicitors with regard to disclosure of
any Post Office accounting records that show Mrs Palmer did periodically repay
the Post Office large sums of money representing scratchcard receipts. They
inform me that Prosecution Counsel gave an indication on the 8'" December 2006
at Court and we asked the Investigation Officer and his understanding was that
such records did exist. However no such records have been disclosed. Could
you please look into this and let me have your response urgently.

They have also said that they requested information regarding product numbers
106 and 162 and product number 1 in the last row of the table LJ8/12. They said
they have received answers to some of these questions, the answers still do not
explain what product number 1 in the last row of the table LJ8/12 refers to. Can
you please clarify this as a matter of urgency.

I have also been contacted by Iris McQuillan of TRM and I am enclosing her E-
Mail with regard to the information sought by the Defence. Perhaps you could
also look into this and then give me a telephone call to discuss.
