Introduction

Notebooks

fotebooks are an essential element in a Security Manager's
“toolkit”. They are numbered individually and are issued to all
Security Managers performing investigation duties.

A notebook can, because of the nature of the information recorded
in it, be produced if required by the Security Managers in Court of
Law. It is essential that all Notebooks are completed with a degree
of uniform professionalism across the whole of the Security
Profession.

This module looks at the guidelines laid down for making Notebook
entries and the rules relating to collusion when taking notes and
‘making entries in the Notebook. When you have completed this,
‘workbook you will have gained both a greater confidence in your
note-taking abilities, and in referring to the notes you have made.

After completing this workbook you will be able to:

+ explain the guidelines on making a Notebook entry;
+ complete Notebook entries in an evidentially correct manner;

+ explain the rules relating to coll

in note taking.
Section 1: Notebook Entry ~ Gu

ACTIVITY

This section looks at the guidelines you need to follow when making
entries in your Notebook, and explores some of the do's and don'ts of
note taking,

urpose of your Notebook

Your Notebook can be used to record a number of things:

+ observations;
+ a conversation between a Security Manager and a suspect;

“+ factual details such as the preparation of an investigation,
the movements of evidence, and a Jot more,

In fact an entire investigation can be cartied out without the use of
anything more than a Notebook — provided the guidelines for making
the notes are followed, and all matters are covered in great detail.

Entries in Notebooks can be produced in Court to assist an Officer in
his/her recollection. Permission of the Court must always be sought
before this is done.

Before we look at the guidelines relating to effective Notebook
entries please try the following activity:

‘Think of an act that you have carried out recently; making a cup of
tea or coffee for example, Make some notes on the following page to
describe what you did.

We will look at this later, but it is important that you undertake this
activity now to give yourself something to compare with when you
complete a later activity.

Complicated observations conducted simultaneously by a number

of Security Managers can be entered into observation logs.
Shorter or more straightforward observations can, however, be
put into your Notebook.

You should try, as always, to be as detailed as circumstances permit
and include descriptions of obstructions to your view of the subject,
lity and lighting details. Should any of these change during the
‘course of your observations then this too should be noted — against

the relevant time, Some Security Managers prefer to draw a vertical
margin line for time entries when using their Notebooks for
observations.

This must include those present and any conversations/admissions/
denials. Any arrest details should also be entered. If the suspect is,

cautioned, the time and date must be noted, together with an entry
stating that the suspect understood the caution given (or not, as the

‘case may be). ‘

Including any breaks in the interview where the tape machine cannot

record conversation.

Including persons present, property found and anything said or seen,

The actual words used must be recorded.

Section 2: Collusion

Notebooks

This section looks very briefly at the subject of collusion, We explore
what Security Managers must do to ensure that evidence is gathered
in the right way, and that instances where they do work together are
recorded correctly in their Notebooks.

Security Managers working together

‘When two or more Security Managers are present, or take part in the
same incident/interview/observation, there is no objection to those
‘Managers consulting each other when preparing their notes. In order
for this to be a possibility, the Security Managers must have been in
the same location at the same time.

Entries in notebooks

‘When such a consultation takes place, a note to this effect must be
added to the Notebook entry, and the Security Managers should
initial the date and time of the entries in each other's Notebooks.

Ifthe same event has been observed, then there may only be a
requirement for one Security Manager to make an entry in their
Notebook. The second Security Manager will need to countersign this
‘entry as true and accurate. This can only be done where both Security
Managers were together at all times for the duration of the event.

An example of a Security Manager’s Notebook, with the entry signed
by a second Manager, can be found on the following page.

‘You can see that the entry has been signed by
G Clark at 07.07 on 17 March 2000, to
confirm that the entry made by M Phelan is
an accurate record of her own observations,

As both Security Managers were present at
the same time, and observed the same
activities, there would be no need for G Clark
to make an entry in her own Notebook.

Section 2: Collusion

@ Study

‘You may recall the real-life trial of ex-Coronation Street character,
Len Fairclough.

‘The case against him was considerably weakened when two
Notebook entries were submitted by Police Officers. Each entry
contained 84 words, of which 82 were identical. The two officers
commented as follows:

+L was responsible for my own words, I always am.”

+ “It was one of life's coincidences.”

‘may be that their observations were identical, but doubt was
‘caused by their unwillingness to state that they had colluded in their
note making.

‘Therefore, we can see that there is nothing wrong with collusion
‘over Notebook entries provided all parties observed or experienced
the same events, and that the collusion is not hidden or underhand in
any way.

Security Managers David Jones, Mike Peters and Laura Scoles are
present at the search of a suspect's personal locker. As David
searches the locker, with Laura observing, he finds a number of items
of opened mail

When presented with the evidence, the suspect, Peter Johnson, states
that he has never seen the items before and does not know how they
got there,

Later in the day, David and Laura get together to ensure their
Notebooks are up to date

The two Security Managers should have first made an

Q6. Why do you think, if produced as evidence, these two

Be

7.

Notebooks may cause doubt in the minds of a potential jury?
They may cause doubt because the words are almost
identical, and there has been no mention of the fact
that the two Officers had met to discuss the case when
preparing their notes.

Do you think both David and Laura needed to make entries in
their Notebooks, given that they were both present at the same
‘time and location when the items were found?

No, they did not both need to make entries. It would
have been acceptable for just one of thems to make the
‘entry and for the other to countersign it as true and
accurate (as you have already seen on page 15).

Do you think it was appropriate for David and Laura to meet,
and discuss their notes? Give a reason for your answer.

Yes, there is no reason why they should not meet and
discuss the case provided they were both present at the
same time and location and experienced the same
things. As already stated in the answer to Q6, what is
wrong is for them to not acknowledge in their Notebook
entries that they have met,
