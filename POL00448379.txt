Hi Martin / Pete

Please can you call me tomorrow morning before 1 1am ideally to discuss the attached letter.

Iam extremely disappointed after everything this PM has been through, we have put this communication out
without informing her.

This is unacceptable and she is fuming as it was shown to her by a customer.
The number of issues this PM has been through shows we still have a very long was to go as a business. We

need to ask some serious questions about our organisation and our people, are we really changing the culture
within our organisation? Are we trying to be postmaster centric?

Regards

Saf Ismail
