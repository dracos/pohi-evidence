You have probably seen this already but I draw it to your attention just in case.

I don’t understand the full implications, but note under the heading ‘Impact’ it says:

The branch has appeared to have balanced, whereas in fact they could have a loss or a gain.

Our accounting systems will be out of sync with what is recorded at the branch.

If widely known could cause a loss of confidence in the Horizon system by branches.

Potential impact upon ongoing legal cases where branches are disputing the integrity of Horizon data
It could provide branches ammunition to blame Horizon for future discrepancies.

Ron, does this impact on the case we did yesterday, M106?

Kim
