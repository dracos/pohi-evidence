Jim,

I can now confirm that authority has now been given for POL to pay Mrs Wolstenholme £20,000.00
(3 months remuneration plus interest) as advocated in your E-Mail of 17.03.2004. The balance of
£25,034.04, being held as a shortage in the former sub postmaster's Late Account, will now be written
off locally.

Please proceed accordingly.
