Hello Rodric
I trust you had a good weekend.

I am not sure if this was discussed with the lawyers however we think that it might be prudent to advise your general
liability Insurers QBE of this.

For no other reason than if anyone should submit a claim for stress, this could be seen as an “injury to a third party” and
thus could be a claim under your Public Liability policy

It is fairly remote but by advising QBE, then they will at least not be able to decline indemnification to PO through non-
disclosure or late notification.

We would of course reiterate to QBE that no claims are envisaged.
I would be grateful for your thoughts/Instructions please
Kind regards

Hi Roderic,

Many thanks for this.

As you correctly point out, we are not the current brokers, but I am more than happy to pass this over to them for you.
Before I do, I just need to check that you are happy that we notify this to them as a potential claim rather than just for
information.

Sorry if it seems a bit of an odd question,

Kind regards

Richard

Mark, Richard,

Please find attached a note from our solicitors outlining the risks presented by the recent investigation into the
“Horizon” IT system used in Post Office branches. Can you please share this with our insurers so that they are aware of
the circumstances which could potentially give rise to claims against the policies we have with them, preserving so far as

possible the legal privilege attaching to the note.

I note that you are not our brokers for our D&O insurance. Can you please let us know how we should provide this
information to that broker if you are not able to do it for us.

Thank you for your assistance, Rodric
