                     POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




             FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GERALD BARNES




I, MR GERALD BARNES, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

  1.    I am currently employed by Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu") as a Software

        Developer, a position I have held since 1998.


  2.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

        (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Requests provided to

        Fujitsu on 16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023 (together, the "Requests"), to the

        extent I have or had direct knowledge of such matters. I was assisted in

        preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, who represent Fujitsu in the

        Inquiry.


  3.    Many of the topics set out in the Requests relate to events that occurred

        between 5 and 15 years ago. In the limited time available, I have set out my

        best recollection of these events in this statement, which relate to my work

        in Fujitsu's audit team and the processes relating to audit queries (also

        known as Audit Retrieval Queries or "ARQs"). I have tried to remember the

                                                                                 WI TN09870100




      detail of relevant events to the best of my ability, however, there are areas

      where my recollection is unclear or limited.


 4.   Where I have referred to documents to assist my preparation of responses

      to the Requests, the URNs of the relevant documents are set out in this

      statement.


PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

 5.   I joined Fujitsu's Post Office Account team ("Post Office Account") as a

      developer in June 1998 or thereabouts. My very first job was to look after a

      database of reports produced by Post Office clerks. After that, I became

      involved in supporting the Electronic Point of Sale Service ("EPOSS")

      software for transacting at the counter and balancing, as well as looking after

      related reports.


 6.   I became interested in balancing and took an evening class in bookkeeping

      attaining 'OCR Accounting 2 Pass' and `Pitman Accounting Level 3 Pass'

      accreditations. I remember writing a component called `Operation Launch' to

      facilitate the use of debit and credit cards which was being introduced in the

      earlier version of the Horizon system (known as "Legacy Horizon"). I also

      remember writing the migration software that enabled a counter to transition

      from using Escher's Riposte software platform to the new system (known as

      "HNGx" or "Horizon Online"). Because of this piece of work, I believe I was

      the last member of the EPOSS Riposte team, which was a large team during

      the time of Legacy Horizon.


 7.   In 2009 or thereabouts, whilst supporting the migration software for the

      remaining counters to transition to HNGx, I also started looking at the audit


                                  Page 2 of 26
                                                                                      WI TN09870100
                                                                                    WI TN09870100




        system in HNGx, which was a completely new area for me. It was around

        this time that I then joined the audit team. I recall that there was already an

        audit system in Legacy Horizon for Riposte that I knew little about then.

        When I joined the team, this audit system was being rewritten as part of the

        transition to HNGx. For this reason, I have limited experience and knowledge

        regarding the systems and processes relating to audit and ARQs in relation

        to Legacy Horizon.


  8.    In 2012, I wrote much of the migration software to move all the audited data

        files from Legacy Horizon's audit archive (Centera) to Fujitsu's audit archive

        for HNGx (Eternus). Centera and Eternus are specialist computers designed

        for long term storage of files and store each file in multiple locations in case

        of a fault in one location. Centera was provided by a third-party company,

        while Eternus was an in-house solution.


  9.    In 2020, there was a large transfer of jobs and many of the technical

        functions of the Post Office Account were moved to teams in India, and I was

        the only one left in the audit team in the UK.


  10.   In recent years, I have been involved in moving the audit system into the

        AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud and gained "AWS Certified Security â€”

        Specialty" accreditation.


THE AUDIT QUERY PROCESS AND THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

The ARQ Spreadsheet

  11.   In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked a number of questions in relation to

        an "ARQ Spreadsheet" (LCAS0001383, pages 17 and 18), which I

        understand to be filtered ARQ data for the Marine Drive Post Office that was


                                     Page 3 of 26

                                                                               WI TN09870100




      provided to Mr Lee Castleton by way of disclosure in the civil proceedings

      commenced by Post Office Limited ("POL") against Mr Castleton (POL v

      Castleton). I have been made aware that the ARQ Spreadsheet forms part

      of a larger document. However, for the avoidance of doubt, in preparing this

      statement, I understand that the Inquiry requires me to consider only

      pages 17 and 18 of LCAS0001383 and does not require me to consider the

      remaining pages of the document.


12.   The ARQ Spreadsheet appears to have been prepared before I joined the

      audit team in around 2009, and I was not involved in responding to any ARQs

      that POL sent to Fujitsu in relation to POL v Castleton. Before I joined, the

      audit team generated these types of spreadsheets using `RQuery'

      ("RQuery"), which was an Escher tool supplied specifically for the purposes

      of querying a regenerated message store that contained messages in

      Riposte Attribute Grammar format. The ARQ Spreadsheet would have been

      generated by RQuery.


13.   As I mention above at paragraph 7, when I joined the audit team, Fujitsu was

      changing from using Escher's Riposte software to Fujitsu's own bespoke

      software, HNGx. Following this change, the audit team moved from using

      RQuery to perform ARQs to 'XQilla' ("XQilla"), which is an open-source

      software program that queries files conforming to Extensible Markup

      Language ("XML") standards. The audit team also wrote a program known

      as the `Query Manager service' which converts files using Riposte Attribute

      Grammar to XML so that the files could be queried. The audit team continues




                                 Page 4 of 26
                                                                                     WITNO9870100
                                                                                   WI TN09870100




      to use XQilla (run from the Query Manager service) to run audit queries

      today.


14.   When I joined the audit team in around 2009, I recall that the developed

      software, (which included the Query Manager service and changes to the

      audit extractor client) was starting to be prepared for release. For this reason,

      I did not use RQuery nor am I familiar with the audit query processes that

      were used to produce the ARQ Spreadsheet. I am, however, familiar with

      XQilla and the audit query processes that have been used by the audit team

      since approximately 2009.


15.   At the time, my understanding was that Fujitsu wanted to change the

      software from RQuery to XQilla (i) because HNGx, which was replacing

      Legacy Horizon, did not use Escher's Riposte software and produced XML

      output files, and (ii) to stop paying licensing fees to Escher. RQuery was

      designed to query Riposte message stores, which were no longer going to

      be used with HNGx. The Query Manager service, which was a key new

      component of HNGx, parsed the Transaction Management Service ("TMS")

      and Branch Database (BRDB) files and then queried them with XQilla. The

      audit retrieval processes relating to the period following the change to XQilla

      are described in the "Audit Extraction Client User Manual" (see, for example,

      FUJ00158710), the "Audit Data Retrieval High Level Design" (see, for

      example, FUJ00123758), and the "Audit Data Collection & Storage High

      Level Design" (see, for example, FUJO0123759).

                                                                                         WI TN09870100




The audit query process

  16.   In relation to HNGx, the process of generating a spreadsheet of transactions

        (similar to the ARQ Spreadsheet) is as follows:


        a. Files to be audited are placed on many 'shares' across the estate. A

            share is a folder of a computer that is accessible by another computer.


        b. `Gatherers' on the audit server bring the files into the audit server, where

            they are stored on a special long term storage device (known as an audit

            archive â€” Centera to begin with, which was later replaced by Eternus)

            and indexed using a Structured Query Language ("SQL") database on

            the audit server. A checksum of the file is also stored too (a checksum

            is effectively a unique numerical identifier that is allocated to a file).


        c. A special tool on audit workstations can then be used to display stored

            files and retrieve them. As these stored files are retrieved, their

            checksum is checked. Some of the stored files are files of transactions,

            and extra software is available to generate spreadsheets of transactions.


  17.   While I am not familiar with RQuery, I have reviewed the "Audit Data

        Retrieval High Level Design" relating to Legacy Horizon (FUJ00117508), and

        the process used to generate spreadsheets such as the ARQ Spreadsheet

        would have included the following steps:


        a. the     file    of     Riposte      transactions      was      imported       by

            'NWB TMS Generate.exe';


        b. this program in turn called 'AgentLoadAuditData.exe' to generate a

            Riposte message store; and


                                     Page 6 of 26

                                                                               WI TN09870100




         c. RQuery was then used to process the message store and produce the

            spreadsheet.


THE HEADINGS USED IN THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

18.   In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked for an explanation of the various

      headings in the ARQ Spreadsheet. For the reasons I explain above at

      paragraph 14, I did not personally use RQuery to produce spreadsheets in

      relation to audit queries. Having reviewed the ARQ Spreadsheet, however,

      there appear to be similarities in the headings used in the spreadsheets that

      were generated using RQuery and XQilla. I have also reviewed the following

      documents to assist my understanding of the headings listed in the ARQ

      Spreadsheet:


         a. "High Level Design Specification for Track and Trace (T&T) Agents"

            version 4.0 DE/HLD/015 dated 27 August 2008 (FUJ00171843);


         b. "High Level Design Specification for Agents for NBX, the NBE

            Replacement" version 2.0 NB/HLD/017 dated 13 March 2006

            (FUJ00171845);


         c. "Management of the Prosecution Support Service for Audit Record

            Queries" NB/PRO/003 dated 20 November 2007 (FUJO0122457);


         d. "TPS Agents for B13: High Level Design" (AD/DES/041) version 7.0

            dated 9 August 2005 (FUJ00090934);


         e. "EPOSS Attribute Grammar Catalogue" EP/DES/002 version 6.0 dated

            12 December 1997 (FUJ00079219);

                                                                                  WI TN09870100




         f. "Riposte Attribute Gramme Catalogue â€” Messages" version 0.1

            EP/LLD/019 dated 19 July 1999 (FUJ00171846); and


         g. "OBCS Counter Component Design Report" OBIDES/0004 version 2.0

            dated 15 December 1997 (FUJ00171847).


19.   I set out below my understanding of the various headings in the ARQ

      Spreadsheet. While I have tried to explain these headings based on my

      experience with XQilla and the documents noted above at paragraph 18, there

      are certain headings that I am unable to explain in detail. In addition to this,

      where I can, I have explained my understanding of what the numeric values in

      the ARQ Spreadsheet mean, which were entered into the message store.


         a. The first heading 'Groupid' is a six-digit code identifying the collection

            point, in other words, corresponding to a particular Post Office branch. I

            understand that the Groupid in the ARQ Spreadsheet relates to the

            Marine Drive Post Office. The heading 'Id' denotes the number of the

            counter used in a Post Office branch.


         b. The headings 'Date' and 'Time' relate to the date and start time of a

            given transaction. The heading 'User' records the ID of the Horizon

            system user logged in.


         c. The heading 'SU' relates to the stock unit reference. My understanding

            is that there are stock units that the Horizon system user can attach to,

            and each transaction made by the user records this stock unit. Post

            Offices are required to check stock in the branch every month for each

                                                                              WITNO9870100
                                                                            WI TN09870100




   stock unit used before going into a new balance period or cash account

   period. This process is often called `rolling over'.


d. The headings 'EPOSSTransaction.T' and 'EPOSSTransaction.Ti' relate

   to the event description and event result respectively.


e. The heading `Sessionld' is a unique identifier for all transactions within

   a customer session. I understand a session contains all the transactions

   that a Post Office branch carries out before settling. It appears that all

   Sessionlds are prefixed with "44-" which identifies the Horizon system,

   followed by the Groupld and Id as described above. The following

   number relates to the last message committed to the message store

   before the start of the customer session. The final number is a

   uniqueness factor, starting at 1.


f. The heading `Txnld' is a unique identifier for all messages within a

   customer transaction using a similar algorithm as the Sessionld. I

   understand that the final number in a Txnld advances one at a time for

   each transaction in the session.


g. The heading `Mode' is populated with 'Sc' which stands for 'Serve

   Customer' which is the most common mode of using the Horizon system

   but there are others, for example, RV for a reversal of a transaction.


h. The heading 'ProductNo' is the product reference number. Each product

   has a different product number, for example, first class stamps and

   second class stamps each have different product numbers.




                            Page 9 of 26

                                                                          WI TN09870100




i.   The heading 'Qty' records the quantity of products, a positive value

     meaning stock unit leaving the Post Office branch. The heading

     'SaleValue' records the monetary value of a transaction, and similarly, a

     positive value means leaving stock unit.


j.   The heading 'EntryMethod' records the way in which the data is

     captured:


        i. 0 = barcode,


        ii. 1 = manual,


        iii. 2 = magnetic card,


        iv. 3 = smart card, and


        v. 4 = smart key.


k. Relatedly, the heading 'State' records the method of manually keyed

     entries (where, for example, 4 means encash and 5 means non-

     barcode).


I.   The heading 'IOP_Ident' is the `Instrument of Payment' number.


m. The heading 'Result' is the result of the order book transaction where:


        I. 1=0K,


        ii. 2 = IMPOUND,


        iii. 3 = UNREAD (i.e., unreadable), and


        iv. 4 = INVALID.

20.     The heading `Foreignlndicator' indicates whether an Order Book Control

        Service (OBCS) payment was made at a local Post Office or foreign outlet

        where 0 means local and 1 means foreign. The foreign indicator defaults to 0

        for all manually keyed entries. In practice, what I understand by this is if

        someone normally collects their benefit payment from a particular Post Office,

        this would be described as local. However, if they collect the payment from

        another Post Office, that would be foreign.


THE RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY OF THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

  21.     In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked whether the data that is presented in

          the ARQ Spreadsheet has been reliably and accurately parsed from the

          original raw form to the way in which it is presented on the ARQ Spreadsheet.

          In relation to audit, I would understand `original raw data' to mean the files of

          transactions on the audit archive.


  22.     One way to test whether the data that is presented in the ARQ Spreadsheet,

          which appears to relate to 2 February 2004, has been reliably and accurately

          parsed from the original raw data, would be to generate a new spreadsheet

          with different software that was not used to produce the ARQ Spreadsheet

          (i.e., XQilla) and compare its results with the ARQ Spreadsheet. Since I have

          joined the audit team, it is a very common practice to rerun ARQs after any

          release likely to affect ARQs and check that the spreadsheets generated

          before and after the release provide the same results. Such checks are

          performed in all environments â€” development, live system testing (LST),

          and live.

  23.     Unfortunately, however, I understand that the message store and audit trail

          data relating to the Marine Drive Post Office branch for 2 February 2004 is

          no longer available. Without this data, it is difficult to test and confirm whether

          the data was reliably and accurately parsed onto the ARQ Spreadsheet.


EXPECTED REPORTING IN LOG FILES WHILST HORIZON IS OFFLINE

24.     In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked what the expected reporting in the log

        files should be when transactions have taken place whilst the system was

        offline. I am taking log files to mean TMS files put on shares for the audit system

        to gather. I am aware of the processes in place in relation to the audit servers

        going offline following the implementation of HNGx, however, I am not able to

        provide information on the processes that are in place where other parts of

        Horizon (e.g., the harvester agents) go offline. For the reasons I explain above

        at paragraph 7, I am not aware of the processes that were in place in relation

        to the audit servers going offline during Legacy Horizon. However, having

        reviewed the "Audit Data Retrieval High Level Design" relating to Legacy

        Horizon (FUJ00117508), it would appear the audit system operated in a similar

        way during Legacy Horizon.


25.     The processes relating to the audit servers going offline in relation to HNGx are

        as follows:


           a. There are two audit servers that gather files from shares and delete them

               a configurable time later. If either audit server is offline, that audit server

               is not able to gather files from the shares it monitors. The "Archive Server

               Configuration Information and Operations Notice" lists all shares that




                                        Page 12 of 26
                                                                                        WI TN09870100
                                                                                      WI TN09870100




            have been audited and a description of what files are in those shares

            (see, for example, FUJ00089176).


        b. While the audit server is offline, extra files may be added to the shares.

            When the audit server comes back online, it will gather the files and save

            them to Centera (which was later replaced by Eternus, as I explain in

            paragraphs 8 and 16 of this statement).


        c. Similarly, in the evening, files are copied from one server to the other

            using a process called robocopying', (short for robust copying), which is

            a more resilient process of copying that is more suitable for batch

            (unattended) operations. No files get missed out; they are just

            robocopied late. The audit team advise that all audit shares should have

            sufficient capacity to cope with the audit server being offline for five days.


        d. When the audit team performs audit retrievals, it allows extra days in the

            ARQ date range to allow for files gathered late. The spreadsheets

            generated as a result of the query (e.g., the ARQ Spreadsheet) would

            not indicate whether any files were gathered late. The Query Manager

            service is the current system that checks that there are no missing

            transactions (each transaction is numbered incrementally) before it

            generates the spreadsheet.


ISSUES AND INCIDENTS RELATING TO ARQS

  26.   In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked me to confirm whether I am aware of

        any incidents where an audit log (whether ARQ log, a log produced by

        RQuery or XQuilla, detail from the ARQ interface or equivalent) has been

        provided to POL or Royal Mail for court or disciplinary proceedings or in an


                                    Page 13 of 26
                                                                                   WITNO9870100
                                                                                 WI TN09870100




      investigation relating to a postmaster, manager or assistant that was, or may

      be, unreliable. I understand `ARQ log' to refer to the data that was provided

      by Fujitsu to POL in response to ARQ requests which sought data from the

      audit servers.


27.   During my time at Fujitsu, I was not personally involved in responding to

      ARQs that were submitted by POL to Fujitsu in relation to investigations,

      court proceedings, or disciplinary proceedings against postmasters,

      managers or assistants. I was, however, involved in two issues that were

      identified that could affect the accuracy of ARQ data: (i) an issue relating to

      the `CABSProcess' that could cause potentially incorrect data to be

      presented to the audit system, which was recorded in Peak PC0152376, and

      (ii) issues relating to `duplicate transactions' being presented to the audit

      system.


28.   I am aware the CABSProcess issue may have affected the accuracy of the

      data that was transferred from the message store to the audit archive. I am

      also aware that the duplicate transactions issue did cause inaccurate

      reporting of duplicate transactions in audit logs (i.e., the spreadsheets

      produced as part of the ARQ process). The CABSProcess and duplicate

      transactions issues could have resulted in unreliable audit logs being

      provided to POL or Royal Mail for a particular branch. However, I am not

      aware of any incidents where Fujitsu provided POL or Royal Mail an audit

      log for an investigation, court proceeding or disciplinary proceeding against

      a postmaster, manager or assistant, that was or may have been unreliable,

      including in relation to the CABSProcess and duplicate transactions issues.

                                                                                 WI TN09870100




Peak PC0152376

  29.   Peak PC0152376 (FUJ00154684) concerned an incident that was reported

        in December 2007 relating to a feature in the CABSProcess (which ran at

        7.00pm every evening) that sometimes caused other components to fail

        silently. Basically, after a particular fix, the CABSProcess wrote its

        transactions atomically, which meant it created a lock on the message store

        for a period.


  30.   The CABSProcess issue was unrelated to auditâ€”while the files of

        transactions that the audit system stored were not complete, this did not

        mean that the audit system was not properly recording what happened at the

        counter.


  31.   The fact that the failure was silent was really bad error handling. Good

        programing practices would be to abort (i.e., for the code to stop running)

        with a clear error message. It is better to produce no results than incorrect

        results, and good error handling should be coded from the start. However,

        my understanding is that in Peak PC0152376, an error was written to the

        audit log and then processing continued, so although the operator at the Post

        Office branch would not know anything had gone wrong, a detailed analysis

        of the audit log after the event would have revealed the problem.


  32.   I cannot recall the specific incident and the fix that was applied. I have

        reviewed        Peaks   PC0152376     (FUJ00154684)      and    PC0164429

        (FUJ00155366) (which was the Peak that the fix was attached to). It appears

        that I proposed a solution to the issue, and it was initially deemed

        unnecessary. The fix was later applied on or around 25 September 2008,



                                   Page 15 of 26
                                                                                    WI TN09870100
                                                                                  WI TN09870100




      and I was involved in applying the fix (FUJ00155266). Following the fix, I was

      involved in undertaking manual checks of event logs in January 2009 (see

      FUJ00154836 and FUJ00155402). I can recall performing manual checks of

      event logs, which I often did as part of my work on the audit team. However,

      I cannot now recall being aware at the time that any specific checks related

      to the CABSProcess issue.


33.   The CABSProcess issue highlighted a problem that could easily be caused

      by another system process at any time of day. In retrospect, error handling

      should have been tightened generally. For example, when I wrote the

      software to migrate from Legacy Horizon to HNGx, I kept this in mind. The

      postmaster pressed the migration button which appeared on migration day

      and if anything went wrong the postmaster got a message displayed saying

      something to the effect of: "An error has occurred please contact the help

      desk". The program then stopped further processing and detailed evidence

      was recorded that would enable the help desk to identify the issue (possibly

      after escalating the issue to me). In my opinion, this sort of error handling is

      the safest. When something goes wrong everyone knows about it

      immediately and nothing is committed â€” in this case, the Post Office branch

      would not be migrated and needed to continue using Legacy Horizon a bit

      longer. The problem could then be analysed and if necessary, the code could

      be fixed and a new release produced with the problem eliminated. Then the

      postmaster could press the migration button on a later chosen day.

                                                                                      WI TN09870100




Duplicate transactions

  34.   The duplicate transactions issue concerned duplicate transaction messages

        not being reported as part of the ARQ process. As a result of this issue,

        multiple instances of one transaction could appear on a spreadsheet

        generated as part of the ARQ process, and it would not be clear that they

        were the same transaction. An example of a Peak relating to the duplicate

        transactions issue is Peak PCO205805 (FUJ00171848) opened on

        27 October 2010.


  35.   The issue is not a fault in the audit software as suchâ€”the issue was that

        duplicate transaction messages were being generated. In my experience,

        this usually occurred because TMS files sometimes had more than one copy

        of a transaction in different files, and it was a bug in the harvester that caused

        this.


  36.   As recorded in Peak PCO205805 (FUJ00171848), the issue affected 'Fast

        ARQs', which refers to a software tool that replaced 'Slow ARQs'. I recall the

        differences between Fast and Slow ARQs being as follows:


         a. Slow ARQs: The user performing the audit query would supply a Post

                Office branch code (known as a "FAD") to the relevant software and set

            off a query to retrieve the files. Once the files were retrieved, the user

            would cause them to be filtered for the FAD, at which point duplicates

                and missing transactions were shown on the screen. The user would

                then select a query to be run. The spreadsheets generated as a result

            of the Slow ARQ process would show duplicate transaction messages

                and missing transactions. Peaks PCO205353 (FUJ00171892) opened



                                      Page 17 of 26
                                                                               WI TN09870100
                                                                             WI TN09870100




          on 14 October 2010 and PCO207787 (FUJ00171894) opened on

          18 January 2011 indicate that this correctly working functionality for

          HNGx was not completely in place initially but was implemented soon

          after.


      b. Fast ARQs: Fast ARQs automated the Slow ARQ process in a one-step

          operation. Fast ARQs did not initially display duplicate transaction

          messages and missing transactions during the processing of the audit

          query. As a result of Peaks PCO205353 (FUJ00171892) and

          PCO207787 (FUJ00171894), the spreadsheet generated was modified

          to show the correct missing transactions and duplicates. In the final

          design of Fast ARQs, that has been running for many years, missing

          transactions (gaps in the message run) cause the Fast ARQ to fail with

          an error report. Duplicates, however, do not cause the spreadsheet

          generation to fail, the duplicates are just reported in the resulting

          spreadsheet. This is because whenever duplicates were checked they

          were always exactly that â€” duplicates in every respect, including the

          message numbers. Hence, duplicates were not considered an error, but

          it needed to be clear that there were transactions listed twice in the

          spreadsheets.


37.   According to Peak PCO205353 (FUJ00171892), the issue was fixed in or

      around November 2010. As a result of the fix, duplicate messages were

      reported in the spreadsheets generated as part of the ARQ process. In

      addition, duplicate messages were logged in the generated log files.

Potential further incidents

38.   Further to the matters outlined above, I have been pointed to a number of

      additional Peaks in which I am referenced. Below I have listed the Peaks that

      I consider may have had an impact on the audit log:


       a. Peaks PCO152828 (FUJ00155211) and PCO153009 (FUJ00155224):

          The latter of these Peaks is a clone of the former, each recording a

          Horizon stock unit rollover issue that I investigated in January 2008. This

          incident appears to have indicated deficiencies in the rollover error

          handling process and highlighted a risk that this could affect the figures

          presented by audit.


       b. Peaks PCO225071 (FUJ00173057) and PCO225656 (FUJ00172286):

          The latter of these Peaks is a clone of the former, each of which were

          opened on or around 16 April 2013. By way of background, the SQL

          database on the audit server is shut down each evening so that a backup

          of the system can be taken. It is necessary for the Query Manager

          service, which needs the SQL audit server to function, to cope with this

          backup process. A code issue in relation to the backup process was

          identified and a fix was tested and subsequently deployed in or around

          November 2014. All ARQ spreadsheets generated when this issue might

          have occurred were checked to determine whether they were affected

          (I note, however, that many of the ARQ spreadsheets produced would

          have been run outside of the period when SQL server was in shutdown

          in any event).

        c. Peak PCO272681 (FUJ00173183): This Peak was opened on 1 August

            2018 and relates to a Slow ARQ which was run during the SQL audit

            server evening shut down. The Peak records me noting that a release is

            required to improve error handing, although those working on the

            prosecutions had not complained about this issue. My view is that this

            issue is unlikely to have had financial implications.


        d. Peak PCO276698 (FUJ00173185): This Peak was opened on

            12 February 2019 and relates to failed ARQ queries which, when rerun,

            were then successful. It appears that this was an intermittent issue which

            did not occur consistently. My view is that this issue is unlikely to have

            had financial implications.


INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ARQ LOGS

  39.   In the Requests, the Inquiry has asked me to confirm whether in my view

        (i) the ARQ logs that were provided by ICL/Fujitsu to POL or Royal Mail in

        respect of court proceedings involving issues relating to transactions from

        Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online were sufficient to enable a postmaster,

        manager or assistant to understand whether the system was operating

        correctly, and (ii) the sources of information from which the ARQ logs

        obtained were sufficient.


 40.    The ARQ logs (e.g., the ARQ Spreadsheet) do not provide enough

        information to enable a postmaster, manager or assistant to understand

        whether there is an issue with the Horizon system. The ARQ log is a report

        of transactions as presented to the audit system and it does not contain

        information based on checks for problems with the Horizon system. The

                                                                                     WI TN09870100




      primary way of checking for systems issues (that I am aware of) involved

      checking all the event logs from the counter in Legacy Horizon, and the

      `Branch Access Layer' (BAL) in HNGx. While preparing this statement, I have

      come to understand that the Software Support Centre ("SSC") can

      comprehensively check all system logs if asked to.


41.   When I joined the audit team, events from the event log were checked

      manually for suspicious looking events. Soon after I joined, this process

      started to become automated in stages so that all aspects of the process

      were eventually automated. In this regard, all events relevant to the time

      period requested in the relevant ARQ request were extracted automatically

      as part of the ARQ process. Each event was then checked against the

      signatures of those known to be benign from previous investigations. These

      benign events were then eliminated. If the relevant toggle button on the audit

      software was `switched on', those events that were not eliminated were

      reported in a separate spreadsheet of events, which would be provided to

      the SSC to conduct additional checks. If the relevant toggle button was

      `switched off', the audit software would not automatically generate a separate

      spreadsheet of events, but the SSC could still be asked to conduct additional

      checks in support of the ARQ log (I have raised concerns about the

      `switching off' of this facility as routine, and the matter is being reconsidered).

      I do not recall what the SSC's additional checks involved, as the audit team

      was not involved in this part of the process. While preparing this statement,

      I have remembered, however, that the checking of the separate

      spreadsheets of events by the SSC stopped in about 2020.

42.   By way of example, a spreadsheet of events (FUJ00176752) was produced

      by this process in relation to a Peak (PCO263160) (FUJ00176751). In this

      case, it appears the SSC reviewed the events and concluded all were

      benign.


43.   1 recall that, in some instances, the SSC would provide feedback on the event

      checking process by raising Peaks and sending them through to the audit

      team. We would then look to enhance the filters applied when excluding

      certain patterns of events from the spreadsheets that the SSC would

      consider. This feedback would generally be to exclude event patterns that

      the SSC had previously identified as being benign.


44.   I have been pointed to a number of Peaks in which I am referenced in this

      regard. Outlined below are those Peaks that I consider to be relevant to the

      event log checking process described above:


      a. Peak PCO260335 (FUJ00173091): This Peak was first raised on 7 July

          2017, and relates to issues with the format of the event files processed

          by the audit team to produce the spreadsheets of events to be checked

          by the SSC. These issues were fixed on or around 19 July 2017.


      b. Peaks PCO280466 (FUJ00173193) and PCO280793 (FUJ00173184):

          The latter of these Peaks is a clone of the former, both of which relate to

          the event files used by the audit team to check for suspicious events

          being gathered late in respect of an ARQ data extraction. This incident

          occurred in or around October 2019. The audit team noticed the issue

          because it checks that events are present at the beginning and end of

          the query run for each ARQ. However, there is an unlikely possibility that


                                 Page 22 of 26

                                                                                   WI TN09870100




              event files the middle of the requested time period would be gathered

              late, as opposed to those at the beginning or end of the period, and that

              would escape notice. A more sophisticated checking system was

              developed because of this whereby it was checked that events were

              present for every day of the query. This Peak was closed on 10 March

              2020.


          c. Peak PCO261282 (FUJ00173153): This Peak was opened in August

              2017, reporting an issue regarding event logs being filled with security

              events. A fix was tested and then rolled out in or around October 2017.


  45.     1 am not fully familiar with the processes that produced the sources of

          information from which the ARQ logs for Legacy Horizon and HNGx were

          obtained and whether they were sufficient. However, in relation to XQilla, I

          do know that each message has a message number and the current XQilla-

          based audit software checks that there are no gaps or duplicates in the

          message number sequence.


Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
