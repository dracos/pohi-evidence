Hugh

We have spoken. In my view POL should deal with each investigation and prosecution on merit.If and when Horizon
issue is raised by the defence. we assess the merits and take a considered view. Invite the defence to make an
application to the judge to adjourn or stay. we would not oppose the application .This would be Judges decision. This
would absolve POL from any subsequent criticism of delay etc. I also forwards email from Martin Smith of Cartwright
Kings with his Views.

Jarnail,

Thanks for your e-mail.

1. If applications were made to adjourn all existing cases until after the report becomes available,
this would result in a "nightmare" situation. The fact that applications had been made would send
out the wrong message and it would be assumed by many that POL had found and was trying to
resolve a problem with the Horizon system. Whilst it could be made known that no problems had
been found by POL, it is unlikely that defendants would believe such a statement. I would expect
there to be numerous applications for disclosure and extra hearings (and extra cost).

2. Ina significant number of cases, admissions are made in interview and no issues are raised
with regard to the integrity of the Horizon system. POL would be open to criticism if the
prosecution of these cases should be delayed. Similarly there could also be adverse judicial
comment if the prosecutions in cases in which no admissions have been made were delayed.

3. The best approach in my view is to treat each case individually. The prosecution can
commence in the usual way and upon receipt of the Defece Case Statement, any challenge to the
integrity of the Horizon system can be considered. Of course the first time we may get to know of a
"challenge" may be in the DCS. If a "real" issue is raised, the case could be adjourned until after the
report becomes available. The defence could apply for the adj and we would not object. If,
however, the challenge raised in the DCS is flawed, has no basis or foundation, or relevance and is
clearly just an attempt to frustrate the prosecution, the case can continue in the usual way.

Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions or wish to discuss any aspects of this

further,

Kind regards,

Martin.
