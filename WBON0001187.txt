Rod,

As discussed on our call earlier, there are some outstanding questions from the CCRC on transaction logs on which
we need FJ's input.

Please can we put the questions highlighted below to FJ?

I have included some context below as it may help FJ to show how the CCRC arrived at the questions.

As discussed, we have parked the KEL queries to see if the CCRC still need these to be answered once they
have read POL's Group Action Defence. I note that para 50(4) in the Defence does not cover any of the detail
requested by the CCRC (how is it searchable/retention policy etc.) but it may be that on understanding a little
more about what the KEL is (ie. it is not a record of software coding errors/bugs), the CCRC are less
interested in that line of questioning.

Thanks,

Paul

By way of some context, further to a call between Shirley Hailstones and Rodric Williams from POL
and Amanda Pearce of the CCRC on 9 January, Shirley asked FJ the following questions:

(a) Sometimes ‘Session Id’ and ‘Txnid’ columns don’t appear to be sequential: what is the reason
for this?

(b) In this example of a session ID: 44-167427-1-1318040-2 - what does the 44 at the start & the 2 at
the end refer to? I’m assuming the 44 is maybe something to do with UK phone line? But I don’t know
what the 2 is for?

Farzin Farbali from FJ responded on 11 and 12 January:-

The explanation provided for Session Ids not being sequential (in Farzin’s 11 January email) is
that “session ids are also allocated to logon and logoff events but these events do not appear on the file
which lists the transaction details”.

The explanation provided for Transaction Ids not being sequential (in Farzin’s 12 January
email) is that “there is no requirement for these to be in sequence so they can go: 4,2,3,7 ete. The
missing sequence numbers are a result of transactions being added to a session and then removed so
only the Transaction Ids used in the completed session are shown”.
