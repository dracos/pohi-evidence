1. Apologies for absence, Chair’s welcome and introduction, minutes
from last meeting, declarations of interest

1.1.PO’S welcomed the Board, noting Lord Carter's apology. The minutes
of July’s meeting were discussed. The recruitment of the new IE
Director, Ken McCallum (KMC), who will join the Board, was
confirmed. CA suggested that the composition of the Board should be
evaluated to ensure compliance with the Combined Code.

1.2.Board actions were discussed, with AO providing an oral update about
GIB governance, noting that the GIB CRO provides an independent
check on investments at the moment. [action] Once governance
matters have been agreed with the GIB ARC and incoming CEO, AO
will submit_a paper to the Board. (Update included in CEO report).

1.3.SL explained that he was due to meet Lord Browne at the end of
September. Other actions were noted pending their discussion later in

5.1.SL presented the Royal Mail (RM) paper, noting the need to focus on
the company’s revised business plan and Chairman. SL noted that
the revised business plan was supported by higher than expected
revenues, but was not as ambitious with regard to modernisation.

5.2.SL noted that the figures are undergoing rigorous scrutiny, and ShEx
will be keen to ensure the business plan appropriately challenges and
stretches the company. [action] The Board requested an update
detailing the findings of this scrutiny process. (See CEO update, also
RL to attend November Board).

5.3.SL noted that the RM Board preference has been for a full IPO as the
only acceptable option. SL explained that this was not a view held by
ShEx, and that officials were working on a range of disposal scenarios,
including where a disposal is not possible. Under such circumstances
it was noted that the continuing modernisation would be a priority.
UKGI00016715
UKGI00016715

5.4. TW was interested to understand the role of ShEx should there be a
full disposal. SL noted that ShEx would retain a shareholder role as
long as the Government was a shareholder. This role would cease
once all shares had been disposed. However, Government would
remain involved in the sector as a result of postal regulation.

5.5. Changing the focus of the discussion, PO’S noted that it was apparent
that Donald Bryden (DB) had not notified Smiths of his Sage
appointment, and that given DB’s recent illness there is pressing need
to resolve the concerns expressed by the ShEx Board in July.

5.6.SL described the range of issues thrown up by DB’s current position.
The Board was of the view, both, that he should be asked to drop a
Chair role as soon as possible, and that a replacement for David
Currie should be appointed with a view to be able to fill in as Chair
should that ever prove necessary. [action] SL to brief the Board
following discussion with DB. (Completed, see CEO update).

5.7. [action] The Board also requested that an external review (possibly by
Barclays) to assess the skills of the Board and to identify any skills
gaps, which would be common practice as a company prepares for a
transaction. (Update on progress to be given at November Board).

5.8.SL thanked the Board for a helpful discussion

Chief Executive’s Report - ShEx Board 21 November 2012 (12)20

Board action: To note

This paper updates the Board on current key areas of work in ShEx. There are
separate papers updating the Board on the Information Economy, Industry Bank
developments, and an update on the PDG Assets.

1 General

11 The meeting with Lord Browne happened on 6th November and there was
predictably a lot of common ground. In particular Lord Browne was
concerned about the levels of intrusive oversight from the centre of
Government over partner organisations, particularly around pay and
recruitment, the quality of management information and the varied quality of
departmental Boards. He felt that there was merit in creating a super network
of selected lead departmental NEDs, ShEx company chairs and partner
organisation chairs that would be able over a period of time exert some
influence over Whitehall to create a more functional environment. He was
also very receptive to a ShEx coming to the next meeting of the lead NEDs —
as long as there was no presentation

2 Other Government Departments

2.1 Against the background of:
= Aperceived need for greater commercial skill and experience in Whitehall;
* Ashrinking Civil Service with more sharing of resources; and
= A realisation that recruitment to specialised commercial roles is difficult.

2.2 Both DfT and DCLG have approached ShEx to house their commercial
activities, in the former case already existing, and in the latter yet to be
formed. The scope and the funding of these activities is not yet clear and
meetings are in the diary to discuss initial ideas. Neither approach has been
fully discussed with BIS colleagues to date, but in the main they are to be
welcomed as an indication of ShEx’s reputation and recognition of its
capabilities.

on regulating end-to-end — engagement at senior level continues. The
Chairman’s position has been resolved satisfactorily and ShEx is involved in
the appointment of two new NEDs for the Board.

Half year results showed:

= Revenues of £4,337m, £54m (1%) ahead of budget (£139m ahead on
PY);

= Operating profit of £264m, £89m (51%) ahead of budget (£120m up on
PY);

= PBIT after modernisation but before other exceptionals of £144m, £75m
(109%) ahead of budget (£132m ahead on PY); and

* Operating cashflow of £248m, £168m (210%) ahead of budget (£176m up
on PY).

3.1 However this outperformance remains largely driven by higher volumes
(especially parcels) rather than better cost control; overall modernisation
efficiencies at delivery office level seem to be slipping behind plan.

Regulation

3.2 On regulation, Ofcom has issued helpful but uncategorical guidance on when

and how it will intervene on end-to-end. It does not in itself provide enough
assurance to us and investors on how it will deal with the "live" TNT case,
particularly given Ofcom's nervousness to act whilst they assess RM to be
"underperforming" on productivity. We continue to put appropriate pressure
on both RM and Ofcom.

3.6

In the context of strong performance we, and the company, are gearing up to
be in a position to make initial decisions on a target sale strategy early next
year, based on Christmas trading and initial investor feedback. Our priority
remains to keep maximum flexibility until we are fully confident on our ability
to execute successfully a preferred sale option (and timing).

We are currently undertaking a detailed evaluation of options, primarily IPO
and private equity, with the additional possibility of a pre-IPO investment
designed to derisk a subsequent full IPO.

A key component of this preparation is RM's appointment of specialist,
independent IPO advisors STJ and their selection of a loose group of major
investment banks to provide additional, coordinated investor engagement in
testing, refining and shaping the investor proposition and equity story; early
investor engagement will allow more informed judgements on the real level of
investor appetite for an IPO. An initial round of investor meetings is
scheduled for early December, jointly set up by UBS and Barclays. A
subsequent more detailed round by the fuller bank group is anticipated for
February next year on the back of RM's Christmas trading. We have been
clear to the Company and STJ that this exploratory phase does not create
any syndicate and that if HMG chooses to pursue an IPO, we will run our own
process to appoint any specialist IPO advisers and, in due course, the
bookrunners.

The Chairman's position has been resolved satisfactorily and ShEx is
involved in the appointment of two new NEDs for the Board.

UKGI00016715

Board actions:

= Note that the project team is developing both short-term and long-
term wholesale funding options to deploy the £1bn of new funding,
with all options requiring state aid approval being classified as long-
term

= Note that the team would like to establish a preferred short-term
option by early 2013, to start deployment of some funds in financial
year 2013/14

Summary

The Business Bank will both put in place new larger scale Government
support for the provision of finance to small and midsize companies
through new wholesale funding intervention, and strengthen existing
Government business finance interventions and support and advice
programmes.

ShEx are leading on the development of new wholesale funding
interventions using £1bn of new funding. The project team is
considering short term options, where funds can be deployed in
2013/14, and longer term options. The short term options under
consideration are simple co-investment models, similar to the existing
Business Finance Partnership, where private sector firms can bid for
Government funds to be co-invested on a pari passu basis. Longer term
options under consideration include a SME loan aggregator structure,
which would aim to kick-start the SME securitisation market; guarantee
schemes for SME finance providers; and wider market access measures
such as options involving retail bond markets, private placement
markets and improving the availability of SME credit data.

Work is underway to appoint an Advisory Board for the design phase of
the overall Business Bank; and the ShEx team is looking into options
for hiring an interim product / management team for the new wholesale
funding intervention.

17
UKGI00016715
UKGI00016715

Background

1. Ministers have agreed that the Business Bank will:

= Put in place new, larger scale Government support for the provision of
finance to small and midsize companies so that businesses are able to
access funding that better match their needs, but also able to access
funding from a wider range of providers;

= Strengthen existing Government business finance interventions so they
address specific finance issues faced by businesses in a more
coordinated and streamlined way; and

* Strengthen existing Government support and advice for high growth
potential businesses so that they are better marketed, easier to access
and more joined up.

2. As currently envisaged, the Business Bank will be a free-standing institution
accountable to ministers, but with substantial independent decision-making
powers to design, deliver and close schemes, based on its knowledge of the
market. It would have its own balance sheet and autonomy to recycle returns on
investments into new programmes.

3. At this stage, we believe the Business Bank could have two divisions, a
wholesale arm and a customer-facing arm, and those could be separate entities.
The wholesale arm would house the Government's business finance
interventions that use banks or other intermediaries to get money to businesses
(including both newly created and existing interventions). In order to bring private
sector capital into the market, it would have the ability to enter into joint ventures
with other financial service providers. The customer-facing division could be a
new one-stop shop for high growth UK firms, offering seamless advice and
access to all the Government's business support services (including finance)
aimed at growth.

4. In addition to the existing business finance schemes, £1bn of new capital has
been made available for the business bank. ShEx are leading on developing
options for deploying this £1bn of new committed funding and are working closely
with other BIS policy teams.

5. Officials are designing interventions to allow all or majority of this money to be
deployed in financial years 2013/14 and 2014/15. This money would be focused
on:

= Increasing the quantum of long term debt available for UK SMEs (to allow
firms to plan for longer term investments by increasing the amount of 5-
10year dated loans in the market);

= Increasing the quantum of growth or so-called mezzanine capital (debt
that is structured in such a way repayments are weighted toward the end
of a loan, so that repayment is possible when a firm hits its growth
targets); and

= Stimulating the provision of certain sorts of working capital — for example,
ensuring small firms in long supply chains get access to finance.

18
UKGI00016715
UKGI00016715

Short term options

6. For the short term options, we recommend that some money is made available by
launching a competition asking for bids from private sector investors who would
be willing to invest their own money alongside government funds (such as the
existing banks, challenger banks, non-banks funds or the £2.5 Business Growth
Fund set up by the banks in response to the Merlin agreement). This is the same
approach the existing Business Finance Partnership has taken to date. This
approach would allow Ministers to determine which parts of the market should be
served, whilst relying on private sector expertise to make investment decisions.
We would envisage £300 to £500m being used via this type of route in 2013 /
2014.

7. Such an intervention would be compliant with EU state aid rules, meaning it could
be implemented next financial year. More highly leveraged approaches using
government guarantees will require state aid approval, and so longer term design
options will developed in parallel with this short-term plan.

Longer term options

8. Arrange of options are being considered:

= Creation of a private sector aggregation vehicle (aggregate a large
number of SME loans and finance them through the corporate bond
markets);

= Putin place a Government guarantee for tranches of business loans,
working alongside a partner with relevant distribution capabilities; and

= Stimulate new markets such as retail bonds to finance SMEs or other debt
issuance by medium-sized or small firm

IRRELEVANT

= In order to get the vehicle off the Government's balance sheet, achieve
equity leverage and make the state aid approvals process easier, we
would need to find private sector investors willing to invest on a pari passu
basis with Government; there are other requirements set by the ONS that
may mean the vehicle would be classed as public sector, depending on
who has control and who is taking the risks.

19
Finance providers would need to be able to obtain capital relief on the
tranches sold in order for them to want to participate; this may in effect
imply a Government guarantee required for the mezzanine piece in order
to attract investors. For the finance providers, the value of the capital relief
would have to be higher than the guarantee fee, which may be difficult to
achieve in state aid terms, and particularly given the lack of comparators
for pricing.

The aggregation platform should be attractive for challenger banks as well
in order to support competition in the SME lending markets. Whilst some
of them may have more modern IT systems and may be able to cope
better with data requirements, any large fixed costs required to prepare
participation might put them off.

In order to ensure additionality, there would need to be some sort of
mechanism ensuring that the banks invest any freed up capital into more
SME lending.

Chair/Co Process/Remuneration Issues
Alice Perkins Chair appointment took many weeks in summer 2011 after it left BIS for the centre and Alice Perkins was ready to
(Post Office Ltd) walk away from it, if it wasn't settled by the end of July (which it was).

A number of very able and suitable NED candidates turned down appointments as they did not think POL could
offer sufficiently high remuneration to attract the quality of the people we needed to deliver our challenging agenda.

Recent recruitments to the Executive team have ended in the selection of people who are stepping up to this level,
rather than joining POL with this level of experience under their belt - a direct result of POL salary levels.

Donald Brydon
(Royal Mail)

Voiced a general complaint that the current approach is cumbersome and ineffective so need to progress to simplify
and RM welcome smooth processes for the recruitment and ongoing remuneration.

Noted that quantum of remuneration meant that his first choice of operations director refused the role.

ExCo continues to regularly review its resourcing needs, and
to use a model that breaks down activity per staff member per
Grade reflecting spare capacity.

In addition to regular slots at ExCo, senior managers have
also been provided with dedicated resourcing sessions to
allow time for more strategic thinking on resourcing needs.

Activity on work streams and projects is often reviewed and
prioritised as part of the discussions on resourcing. With the
extended ExCo due to begin in the New Year there should be
scope to review the ShEx Landscape (which sets out projects
and portfolio businesses by Group) on a quarterly basis.

Agreement reached with HR on FTA contract expiry. At the
expiry of a contract ExCo will consider whether the individual
should be made permanent, whether the contract should be
extended to ensure business continuity or whether the
individual should be released. Permanency and extensions
will require HR agreement. About 12 are due to expire in
2013 when this new process will be put to the test.
