Pat
I've just had a quick word with Tony and suggested that we should route these requests as much as we can via the BAU
channel which would be to your team form NBSC.

Taking Kevin's, point I would hope that we do not get a great number as it should not be “offered” but can you pick up and
maintain the request list within your team please? I'd like to understand the nature/reason background as you would
normally when anything is escalated from NBSC. As we always say a physical audit at branch counts how many beans
are there at that time, it doesn’t do anything else and certainly doesn't test the system which is what I believed the
independent review was about. Let's see how it develops..

I would look to pick up early next week with Kevin and Alana to decide how we deal with any which still remain as a
request for an audit, as the impact may now be an external PR one caused by lack of understanding of the difference
between a systems audit and a branch audit?

Hope this makes sense?
Regards

Cray

Please can we be absolutely clear that we should make no reference to the option of the audit unless it is specifically
requested. I am sure that all calls will be seeking clarification about the statement and we don't want to cause
unnecessary work and process.

Thanks

Kevin

We have had a handful of calls at this time asking about the press release in general. Kendra has
forwarded Richard Weavers response to the NBSC to use if necessary.

I will take no further action until advised otherwise, as I have just spoken to Craig Tuttle and he wasn’t
aware he had any action at this time. He has advised he will speak to Alana asap.

Let me know if you need me to progress this further.
Regards,

Tony

Craig, Kevin and I have been trying to get hold of you to discuss this but your phone is constantly
engaged. Can you give one of us a call please.

This script is ok. Can someone let me know what the nature of the calls are coming in, I was told that we
hadn't had any. Thanks all

Tony. Can you give me a ring as I have no knowledge of a process for either recording or taking action
where a branch requests involvement so not sure what you are asking. The field teams undertake risk
based audits or special requests which has nothing to do with Horizon. Other than speaking very briefly
to Rod Ismay as he walked past in Old St early this week I have not been a part of this? Regards. Craig

All

The NBSC has requested information regarding the “HNG Audit” Press Release, so I have drafted the
following and if you are happy with it I will send onto NBSC.

Craig I will ask the NBSC to categorise the calls in a certain way and will provide you with a weekly report
of branches for the next 2 months ( or however long you require it for.) I could do with understanding
what you will do with any branches that request an audit and I will incorporate that into the
communications.

I will need a quick turnaround as we are already starting to receive calls and while this is minimal at the
moment I would expect this to increase rapidly as more branches become aware. NBSC is currently

advising there is no further information available at this time.

As Discussed if we get any enquiries from Branches regarding the recent press release from Past Office
regarding the independent audit of the Horizon System please use the following quote:

The Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its branch
accounting processes.

“Over the past 10 years, many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out with
transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different sub-postmasters.”

However, some branches may request to be involved in this exercise advise them we will forward their
details onto the relevant department, but at this time you have no further details.

POL-0111648
POL00106194
POL00106194

If they do request this then please record the post masters full name and daytime contact number, as
well as the branch code and postcode within the resolution box. There are no guarantees that they wilf
be part of this exercise, but we will keep their details on record.

in the brief description record: “HNG AUDIT REQUESTED”
And categorise using the following.

Cail Type: Horizon On Line

Client: Security HNG

Activity: Audit issue
Sub Act: Audit Enquiry

Advise the branch, if their details are taken forward they will be contacted directly from the retevant
team and no further information will be available from the NBSC regarding this matter.

Tony
