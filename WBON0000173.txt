Thanks Johann, that is helpful.

I recall discussing this previously with Rod, is it correct that all audit reports pre-2011 are in Royal Mail's possession
and not yours?

Kind regards,

Lucy

Hi Lucy,

Apologies for the late reply, but I was on leave yesterday.

Ernst & Young were the external auditors for Post Office and RMG going back about 30 years. Therefore, it
would have been Ernst & Young who audited Horizon pre 2011. Hope this helps.

Best regards,

Johann

Hi Johann,

I hope you are well.

I have a question for you as part of the Post Office Group Litigation.

Do you know who audited Horizon prior to Ernst & Young (i.e. pre-2011)?

If you could come back to me ASAP today that would be great.

Kind regards,

Lucy
