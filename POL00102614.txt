Tim

As you are aware, we have arranged for you to meet Jonathan Swift QC at 3 pm on Tuesday (in Finsbury Dials). The
purpose of the meeting is to agree the scope of your investigation such that you can then report this back to Baroness
Neville-Rolfe; to agree the nature of any enquiry that will be undertaken (review of materials, people you should
interview), and also the nature of any report that is to be produced.

We have had a series of discussions with Jonathan over the last 10 days during which he has asked us various questions
designed to assist in determining the scope of the investigations which Post Office has undertaken to date, and
therefore whether there are any obvious areas where there is potentially more to do. These questions (in bold) and our
responses are attached, together with a chronology of events which has also been provided to Jonathan.

In finalising his advice to you, Jonathan will want to understand whether, in your meeting with the Minister (which pre-
dated her letter to you of 10 September 2015), she gave you any other guidance or expressed any requests which we
should also take into account when finalising the scope.

Please let me know if you would like further background ahead of the meeting on Tuesday.

Kind regards,

Jane
