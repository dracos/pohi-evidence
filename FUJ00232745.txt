Paul,

There are NO CBIF candidates to put forward this week. I am increasingly of the view that as HDR has now been clearly
defined, candidates for CBIF are in fact HDR candidates now and CBIF is perhaps becoming defunct as a forum. I will

monitor for a little longer before suggesting we retire CBIF.
I attach the updated weekly HDR report. Yellow highlights show what has changed from last week.
Changes:

¢ 1HDR entry has been removed as agreed at HDR last week (PCO289332)
@ 1new HDR experience entry added titled “CBB-6156 - RDM.canTrade() is flawed”

e@ Update added for the Help Screen Freezing defect investigation
¢ 3 PBS defects closed and 3 more added
*¢ 8 Deferred defects closed and 5 added

Unchanged
© 6 other entries

I will need POL Problem references for the 2 marked as TBC in column C during the meeting on Monday please.

Have a great weekend.
