Symptoms

When a quantity greater than I is entered for a Smartpost transaction, the Quantity is not reset to 1 when
the clerk moves on to the settlement screen.<br><br>If the transaction is settled to Fast Cash / Fast
Cheque or Debit Card, this doesn't matter, but some clerks habitually uses the Cash (F2) button to enter
the cash presented by the customer, then give the customer change as indicated by the new stack total.
<br><br>If this is done, the cash amount entered is multiplied by the Qty and hence the new stack total is
wrong. <br><br>For example, <br>Enter smartpost, weight 50g <br>Set Qty to 2 <br>Choose 2nd class,
End <br>Choice of labels or stamps - either has the same effect <br>Then have a Smartpost screen still
showing, Qty is 2 but no-entried. Stack contains 2nd class, qty 2, total 42p, TAKE 42p <br>Press TAKE.
<br>Customer hands over £1. Press Cash (F2), 1.00 <br>Cash £1 x 2 added to stack, £1.58 due to
customer. <br><br>Another problem can be if, after the multiple postage labels, further transactions are
done in the same session. For example, if they print two labels and then (in the same session) sell a book
of stamps, two books of stamps will be added to the stack

Problem

The Quantity field wassn't being reset to I when the Settlement screen was displayed after Smartpost.<br>
<br>18-Nov-2005: Fixed by a Mails script change, released as a ref data update. Quantity is now reset to 1
after printing labels or selling stamps.<br><br>28-Nov-2005: the fix has been undone in the next set of

Mails changes. PC0129791 with development.<br><br>08-Dec-2005: Fix reapplied via ref data.

Fix applied, which should be effective at all sites as long as they are not non-polling since before 8-Dec,
and as long as Cleardesk has run overnight since then.<br><br>If the problem does appear to have come
back again, warn users to reset Quantity to 1 if doing further transactions after multiple Smartpost
transactions, or if entering cash and allowing the system to calculate the change. Pass call to EDSC for
further investigation.
