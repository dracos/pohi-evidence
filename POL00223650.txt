Two points from me. Can we please change:

1. Fourth para, final sentence to: “The Post Office will also continue to seek to make an independent review
available to Applicants where this has not already been provided.” (We may not be able to actually deliver
the independent review once SS are terminated); and

2. Fifth para, final sentence to: “Having now completed its reinvestigation of each of the cases, Post Office has
found no reason to conclude that any original prosecution was unsafe.” (We should avoid talking about
appeals which have not yet been made)
