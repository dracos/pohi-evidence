2004 there was an apparent shortfall in the account of Marine Drive Post Office of
£25,758.75. The Defendant avers-hewever that the final audit, following which he

Upon his suspension, at around 14.00 hrs, the Claimant arranged for a temporary sub-
postmaster to temporarily take over the Defendant's duties, who did so on 23 March
2004 by signing the P242 stock/cash account. In the premises, and without prejudice

losses sustained after around 14.00 hrs on 23 March 2004 (including the-pleaded loss
of £176 in relation to National Lottery game sales on 24 March 2004) are not

attributable to the Defendant.

and that the Defendant did not sien off on the Cash Account (Final) for week 51.

daily balance snapshot documents created by the Defendant during the course of his
tenure as sub-postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office,-aad which were removed from
the post office on the Defendant’s suspension, that the apparent shortfalls are in fact
nothing more than accounting errors arising from the operation of the Horizon |

his assistant.
