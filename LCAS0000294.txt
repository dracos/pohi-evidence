                         2004 there was an apparent shortfall in the account of Marine Drive Post Office of
                         £25,758.75. The Defendant avers eeweve* that the final audit, following which he
                         was suspended by the Claimant, took place on 23 March 2004. at which the bove
                         balance was produced by_the Claimant's audit staff as a final figure before hand over,
                         Upon his suspension, at around 14.00 hrs, the Claimant arranged for a temporary sub-
                         postmaster to temporarily take over the Defendant's duties, who did so on 23 March
                         2004 by signing the P242 stoeklcash account. In the premises, and without prejudice
                         to the mere-ge erect denial matters set out at paragraph 4 7D below, any apparent
                         losses sustained after around 14.00 hrs on 23 March 2004 (including the                                           loss
                         of £176 in relation to National Lottery game sales on 24 March 2004) are not
                         attributable to the Defendant.

             3.         7t is further admitted that the Defendant produced weekly Ralance Lists and
                       personally produced, signed off on and submitted to the Claimant Cash Accounts
                       final as alle ed in paragraph 7, save that the first week in which such alle ed losses
                       occurred was in week 42 and was for f 1 103.88 . which the Defendant made good
                       and that the Defendant did not sign off on the Cash Account (Final) for week 51.


            4.         -Save as aforesaid 1?garagraph 7 of the Amended Particulars of Claim is denied. Such
                       alleged losses as the said weekly Balance Lists and Cash Accounts (Final) appeared
                       to show were illusory not real.


            5.         The Defendant repeatedly sought assistance from his managers within the Claimant
                       company during the period over which the apparent shortfall accumulated. No
                       assistance was forthcoming. The Defendant avers that any apparent shortfall is
                       entirely the product of problems with the Horizon computer and accounting system
                       used by the Claimant.


            6,         The Defendant further avers that,                                             he will be able
                       to demonstrate through a manual reconciliation of the figures contained within the
                       daily balance snapshot documents created by the Defendant during the course of his
                       tenure as sub-postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office,-and which were removed from
                       the post office on the Defendant's suspension, that the apparent shortfalls are in fact
                       nothing more than accounting errors arising from the operation of the Horizon
                       system.-The Defendant will-pined-- rther-ai4-mere#ally in this regard foflowing

                            7B             Paragraph 9 is admitted, save that the Defendant repeats his allegations in paragraphs
                                           3-6 above that the alleged deficiency was only apparent and not real and that
                                           accordingly it is denied that the Defendant owed the Claimant the sum alleged.

                                           Defendant's obligation to make it good is denied as set out_in paragraphs 3-6 above.


                            7D             No admissions are made asto the facts in paragraph 11, being matters that occurred
                                           after the Defendant's suspension, and the Claimant _is_put to proof of them but the
                                          Defendant's liability for them is denied. Having been suspended as set out in
                                          paragraph 2 above, the Defendant _had no way of transacting those matters and/or the
                                          Claimant's temporary sub-postmaster had already assumed responsibility for the

                                          denied as set out in paragraphs 3-6 above.


                           7G             Paragraph 14 is denied, whether pursuant to the taking of an account or an equitable
                                          duty to account, for breach of contract or pursuant thereto and the Claimant is put to
                                          Proof of such loss and damage as it may have.suffered as a result.
