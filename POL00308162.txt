Attachment: Copy of 311 Concurrence Report 20 11 14.xIsx

Andy,

Hurst Hill has appeared on the concurrence debt report for me to collect the outstanding settled central debt of
£1107.83. The Current Agents Debt Team comments on the attachment refer to the debt already having been
disputed and mentions that the Postmaster is in personal touch with Paula and Kevin. Before I contact the Postmaster
can you please supply me details of the dispute so that I can further understand the situation.

Sarah,

I understand that you are visiting the branch next week in connection with the recent Horizon off line issues and
therefore have copied you in on this e-mail to make you aware of the situation in case the Postmaster mentions it.

Regards

Keith
