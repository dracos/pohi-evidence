Subject: Horizon - Telegraph

All

I wanted to alert you to a follow up piece we expect to appear in the Telegraph tomorrow in relation to the Horizon
report.

This is likely to be a large feature. We have worked hard this week to present our case and developed our lines to
include an offer to meet with those who feel they have been badly treated.

I do expect, however, that this will be a critical piece.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Mark
