POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GEOFFREY IAN BUTTS

I, GEOFFREY IAN BUTTS, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Ijoined Fujitsu in July 2005 as an IT Programme Manager and had various roles
in Fujitsu over the 10-year period which I spent working for the company, leaving

in June 2015.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
‘Inquiry’) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 17 November
2022 (the ‘Request’), to the extent that I have or had direct knowledge of these
matters. The topics set out in the Request focus on the pilot and acceptance of

Horizon Next Generation (‘HNG-X’), as well as migration of Post Office branches

Page 1 of 39

WITNO03860100

to the new system. I have also been asked to discuss concerns raised by end
users (i.e. Sub-Postmasters) and the quality of any guidance or training provided

to Sub-Postmasters following the implementation of HNG-X.

3. Throughout this statement, I refer to documents that have been brought to my
attention by the Inquiry. These documents are referred to using references
WITN03860100_01/1 — WITN03860100_01/35 and are listed in the index

accompanying this statement.

BACKGROUND

4. I have listed my various roles in Fujitsu below:

a. July 2005 - November 2007 - Deployment Programme Manager,
South Central Strategic Health Authority. I was responsible for the
build, test and deployment of the Cerner Millennium Care Records
System (‘CRS’) and interfaces to 3" party systems into the NHS South
Central Strategic Health Authority, which was one of the Strategic Health
Authorities in the Southern Cluster of the NHS. Fujitsu partnered with the
Cerner Software company to build, test and deploy the Cerner
Millennium system to all the NHS Trusts in the Southern Cluster. I was
one of several Deployment Programme Managers (there was one
allocated to deliver the Cerner system to each of the Strategic Health
Authorities in the Southern Cluster). I managed 10 deployment propcts,

with a budget of £30m, leading a multi-disciplinary team of over 100 staff.

CRS projects were implemented in 2007 to over 5,000 users in

Page 2 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

Winchester, Milton Keynes and High Wycombe Hospitals. This required
complex stakeholder management with senior staff up to CEO level in
NHS Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities, Connecting for Health (the

central NHS body managing the programme) and Primary Care Trusts.

b. November 2007 to July 2008 Head of Service Change and Release,
NHS Account. I led the team which released software across build, test
and live environments for the CRS, Choose and Book, and PACS/RIS
Domains in the Southern Cluster. This included:

i. The planning, scheduling and implementation of all software
installation and build configuration changes for “greenfield” Go
Lives, software releases and upgrades, and emergency fixes
across environments for 40 deployment projects.

ii. Line management of 3 teams with a total of 90 staff, with full Profit
and Loss (‘P and L’) responsibility. I led an improvement
programme in conjunction with the third party software supplier to
improve technical tools for moving configuration and application
code resulting in ten-fold increases in copying speed. The role
came to an end when the programme was terminated by the NHS
and Fujitsu staff were re-allocated into other parts of the business

or released.

c. July 2008 to March 2009 - Customer Services - Head of Live
Service for Global Service Desk Application, Customer Services. I

led the implementation and operation of the CA Unicentre Service Desk

Page 3 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

application and processes across Fujitsu accounts worldwide. Accounts
included Royal Mail, Reuters, Electrolux, British American Tobacco and
the Financial Services Authority (as it then was) running on a shared live
service, with Desks based in UK, Lisbon, Costa Rica and Kuala Lumpur.
This was an internally facing role. I was offered this role when the Fujitsu
NHS Account was disbanded following the termination of the contract by

the NHS. After 8 months, I asked for another customer facing role.

. March 2009 to September 2010 - Delivery Programme Manager,
Post Office Account. I was asked to join the Programme team
responsible for the development, testing and rollout of the HNG-X
application across 11,400 Post Office branches. My role was focused on
the testing and subsequent deployment of the branch router devices to
every Post Office branch in the UK and the subsequent implementation
of the HNG-X software to each of the branches. I left the Post Office
account when the deployment of the application across the branch
estate was nearing completion. The programme had been running for

some time when I joined and was already significantly delayed.

. October 2010 to November 2011 — Deputy Programme Director (to
January 2011), then Global Programme Director, Shell Account
(until November 2011). I led a programme which deployed 3 regional
IT Service Desks (in Canada, Poland, and Malaysia), engineering
services and point of sale applications and back-office infrastructure to

over 3,000 fuel retail outlets in 15 countries. The project also included

Page 4 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

successfully transitioning the legacy UK service operation for 600 Shell

fuel retail sites into Fujitsu support on schedule in April 2011

November 2011 to April 2013 - Programme Delivery Director,
Astellas Account. Astellas is a global pharmaceuticals company. I was
responsible for the delivery of a portfolio of IT projects to the European
part of the Astellas organisation using Fujitsu delivery teams in the UK
and Germany, including datacentre infrastructure upgrades, and an MS-

exchange 2010 migration of 6,000 mailboxes across 27 countries.

. May 2013 - April 2014 — Delivery Executive, Astellas (and Gatwick
Airport/Xchanging from July 2013). Fujitsu introduced a new role
across its Account Portfolio — the Delivery Executive, which worked
alongside the Client Director on each major account. The responsibility
of this role was to oversee all large projects and IT Services ensuring
successful delivery to meet agreed revenue and profit targets (with P
and L responsibility), and to increase customer satisfaction with the
services provided. Having spent over 14 years in project and
programme management at this point, I decided that it would be a good
career move to gain experience in a wider role which brought service
management and project management together. I applied for the role on
the Astellas Account and was successful. The project and services
contract was a first generation datacentre and IT Services outsourcing
across 27 countries in Europe. The datacentre was run from Germany,
and the multi-lingual Service Desk was run from Lisbon, supporting over

4,500 users. I managed a team of 140 across the UK, Germany, Portugal

Page 5 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

and Netherlands. I was also responsible for maintaining good customer
relations with senior stakeholders up to and including the European

Chief Information Office.

In February 2014, Astellas awarded a wider Global IT Outsourcing
Contract to IBM which replaced the legacy European contract. As a
result, Fujitsu entered an exit process for the services which I had been
managing. I handed over to a Fujitsu Exit Manager to take up a new role

on the UK Border Force Account.

h. April 2014 to June 2015 - Delivery Executive, Home Office (Border
Force). I was responsible for the leadership and management of Project,
Service and Development teams supporting a level 5 national critical
infrastructure application. Our team was part of a large project which
successfully transitioned the above application into modern, resilient
datacentres by October 2014. I led a major service improvement

programme which completed in February 2015.

5. I left Fujitsu in June 2015 after being headhunted to join Computacenter as a
Service Director. I was promoted to lead the UK Transition team in May 2019

and remain in that role to date.

6. My Qualifications are listed below:
a. 2015: IACCM Fundamentals of Contract and Commercial Management,
b. 2008: Certificate in Coaching from Henley Management College;

c. 2008: National (APMG) Practitioner in Programme Management;

Page 6 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

d. 1999: Ph.D. in Biophysics — Institute of Cancer Research, University of
London (4 years full-time, 11 years writing up in my own time); and
e. 1984: B.Sc. (Honours), Upper Second in Physiology, University of

Leeds.

7. The qualifications set out at paragraphs 6(a) to (c) above, also reflect external

training I received for my roles at Fujitsu.

MIGRATION TO AN ONLINE VERSION OF THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

8. In order to prepare this section of my statement, I have been asked by the

Inquiry to consider documents WITN03860100_01/1 to WITN03860100_01/8.

9. When I joined the account in March 2009, the Programme Manager role I was
initially given was to oversee the datacentre migration to the new infrastructure
to run the new version of Horizon, HNG-X. This entailed running a small team
of Project Managers who were working with a number of technical staff to create
very detailed plans for the step-by-step technical migration process which had
to be validated and walked through many times. The process was to migrate
the legacy software onto the new hardware platform, before the new version of
the software would be implemented. It was not long after I joined the
programme that a new overall Programme Director, Alan D’Alvarez was
brought in. Mr D’Alvarez became my line manager and I reported to him directly.
Mr D’Alvarez re-organised the team, and my role was changed to be
responsible for the rollout of the HNG-X application to the 11,400 branches.

Vince Cochrane led the datacentre migration element.

WITNO03860100

10.1 was not made aware of legacy software issues when I joined the project.
Neither was I aware of issues that Sub-Postmasters had been highlighting with
the live service when I joined the project. All the major issues that were flagged
in the testing of the HNG-X application, and that were identified in the different
stages of the pilot migrations, were resolved before the main rollout, in

agreement with the Post Office project team.

Lines of Support

11.1 have been asked to comment on the contents of an “Operational Level
Agreement for 4" line support of HNGX” dating from 14 January 2010
(WITN03860100_01/3). In particular, Application Support in terms of Software
fixes to the Business Capabilities and SupportFacilities and using appropriately

trained operation staff.

12.This document is a description of fourth line support services. Application
Support here means using the most experienced and capable technical staff
who are called in to diagnose and propose fixes for any incidents that occur in
the business (either in Post Office branches or in the back end of the Post Office
operations) that cannot be resolved by the first to third line support teams.
Individuals at this level may have designed the original application and/or
written much of the code. This may also entail experts from supporting third
parties (e.g. Oracle). Any fixes would be developed with the Application

Development Team in Fujitsu.

Page 8 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

13.In relation to the expertise of the those working in fourth line support, I would
expect the staff operating in this area to be highly trained as application
developers and software designers, with formal accreditation from an industry
recognised body. I was not aware of the exact formal training and accreditation
process used within the Fujitsu Applications Development team but I’m sure
there would have been one in place given the complexity of the software. The
Solution Architecture and Application Development and Design teams for HNG-
X were in place long before I joined the project. I was not asked to assure
myself as to their technical competence and did not expect to. There were
Solution Architecture and Application Development team owners who would
have been tasked with ensuring that appropriately skilled resources were used

to fill the required roles.

14.In terms of training, I do not know who the named individual was who was
responsible for training across the Applications Development team within
Fujitsu. The Applications Business had teams across multiple sectors, and
there would have been some degree of standardisation across the teams —

with, for example, different levels of software developers.

15.With regards to the remaining lines of support, support staff are categorised in

terms of lines of support and can be described as follows:

a. First Line Support: This was the point of initial contact between an end

user (in this case Sub-Postmasters) and the IT Service Desk that took

initial feedback about the issue raised, analysed it against a knowledge

Page 9 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

base of known issues and, where possible, offered simple ways of fixing
the issue there and then. If it was not possible to fix the issue quickly
(i.e. directly and in the space of a few minutes, then the first line would
escalate to the second line support team. First line support agentswere
typically staff who initially picked up a user incident (either by phone or

on-line). They were not trained as software developers.

. Second Line Support: A team with more technical knowhow than the
first line support team who could undertake more in-depth
troubleshooting. They were not trained as application developers so
would not understand the application software code, but they did know
its functions and understand the IT environment in which it operated, for
example, any local end user device constraints. They were able to fix

more complex issues than the first line team.

. Third Line Support: The staff in this team would have been the
application developers who understood the code of the supported
application and were able to troubleshoot and diagnose issues with the
software. They could also propose, develop and implement software
fixes (subject to following an approved change control process) to

resolve issues.

. Fourth Line Support: These were the most senior
developers/designers with the greatest understanding of the application
end to end and who may have designed the application. They were
called in to resolve major incidents which the third line team either could

not resolve or were taking a long time to resolve.

Page 10 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

16.My understanding is that the term ‘Known Software Incidents’ in the context of
WITN03860100_01/3is simply referring to any software incidents which are

reported.

17.1 would expect there to have been logs of all reported incidents from Post Office
branches after they went live on HNG-X, each of which would be assessed and
categorised according to business impact. Many of these would not necessarily
require software fixes. All incidents raised via the Service Desk were formally
logged and tracked. During the testing of the application, there was detailed
reporting of defects found (using the Test reporting tool), which would have
included issues requiring software fixes. Again, these defects will have been
impact assessed for severity based on the business impact and prioritised with
actions identified to resolve. Not all defects necessarily required software fixes.
Prior to any Post Office branch going live on HNG-X, there were acceptance
criteria agreed between Fujitsu and the Post Office project team on the testing

threshold that had to be achieved, e.g. no open critical defects.

HNG-X Migration Incident

18.1 have been asked to recall an incident referred to inan email chain dating from
19 February 2010 to which I am copied (WITN03860100_01/8). This incident
occurred during the implementation of HNG-X to the next tranche of pilot sites.
I recall that the Medium Volume Pilot scheduled around 20-30 Post Office
branches per night (Mondays — Fridays) to be migrated over a 1-month period.
The technical team had noticed that there was an issue with one of the Post
Offices migrated the night before and made an operational change to correct it,

not realising there would be a knock-on impact on the next day’s planned

Page 11 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

migrations. It was frustrating for all concerned that none of the migrations
planned for 1 particular day worked — given that trainers were on site at the

branches and the branches had taken on additional staff to assist.

19. The previous night, 21 out of 22 branches had migrated successfully and the
reason for the single failure was, as stated in the email, diagnosed and
communicated to the Post Office. However, this failure of migrations happened
quite early in the start of the Medium Volume Pilot implementation. At this point,
the programme had suffered from long delays and Post Office was desperate
for some good news to demonstrate progress to the end user community,
hence the frustration from senior stakeholders at the Post Office like Mike

Young.

20.1 recall that additional communications were issued to the technical teams
monitoring the migrations requesting them not to implement operational fixes
for individual branches during migrations. I cannot remember exactly how
quickly the failed branch migrations were rescheduled, but they would have

been rescheduled within a matter of working days if possible.

High and Low Level Design Documentation

21.The Inquiry has referred me to the Low Level Design documents for the HNG-
X Support Network dating from 1 August 2010 and in which I am described as
having optional review (WITN03860100_01/7). A Low Level Design is created
after the High Level Design has been written. The High Level Design gives the

overall relationship between the various elements of the system to be

Page 12 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

implemented and their function. It will include elements such as highlevel
connectivity between regions and physical locations. The Low Level Design
provides far more granular detail on what is to be implemented, effectively
describing the full technical solution. It will include, for example, details of the
VLAN, network port numbering, and configuration settings. This document is
targeted at technical designers, implementers, and support engineers. As
programme manager, I did not have a role in designing the system (the solution
architecture and the application software for HNG-X) and did not therefore input

into this document.

HNG-X Solution Architecture
22.The Inquiry has pointed me to an HNG-X Solution Architecture Outline dated
2 August 2010 (WITN03860100_01/1), where my role is described as “HNG-X
Programme Manager” and I am said to have approval authority. The Inquiry

has asked what this involved.

23. By way of background. I was the lead for the rollout of the branch router devices
and the HNG-X_ Software to the branches. Document
WITN03860100_01/1formalised the Solution Architecture underpinning the
system. It is dated 2 August 2010, when the rollout of the HNG-X solution
across the branch network was almost complete. The document had to be
reviewed and approved by the mandated technical reviewers in order for me to

sign-off on it.

Page 13 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

24.By the time this document version was created, the project team had been
through a long period of development, testing and a protracted pilot before the
full deployment gathered momentum during the middle part of 2010. The
Development team had fixed a very large number of issues both prior to the
pilot and during the pilot, working closely with the Post Office team. This
included working with Oracle to resolve an issue in version 10 (I cannot
remember the precise Oracle version number -— it might have been v10.1a) of
the Oracle database management system which delayed the start of the full
rollout by a period of around 3 months. There was a sense of relief and
satisfaction by this stage from all sides that the project was visibly progressing.
Any progress from the low volume pilot to the medium pilot to the full
deployment was undertaken in a very transparent and collaborative manner
between Fujitsu and the Post Office teams. I did not have concerns about the
solution architecture, trusting that the appropriate technically skilled people
were involved in designing and building it, with governed approvals, and I had

confidence in the application development and support teams.

HNG-X Migration Strategy

25.The Inquiry has asked me to consider document WITN03860100_01/2, which
is the “HNG-X Migration Strategy -— Agreed Assumptions and Constraints”
dating from 19 November 2010. For version 1.3 of this document, I am listed as
the author. This relates to when I initially joined the programme- when my role
was to lead the datacentre migration. This document had long been in
existence and was continually being updated. I inherited it and oversaw

changes from a number of individuals. When my role changed to be the

Page 14 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

Programme Manager for the deployment of the HNG-X software to the
branches, Gareth Jenkins was deemed to be a more appropriate owner

because he was the senior technical lead on the programme.

26.1 have been asked by the Inquiry to comment on the “POA Customer Service
Major Incident Process” dating from 25 August 2010 WITN03860100_01/5.
This document was updated during the period of the full-scale rollout of HNG-
X across the branch estate. As the Deployment Programme Manager, it was
essential for me and other members of the management team to be made
aware of any major incident as quickly as possible. It is for this reason that
section 10.8 of this document requires the Head of Service Ops to inform me
(amongst others) within 10 minutes of the service incidents. During the full
rollout, there were several hundred branches scheduled to migrate every week
and therefore decisions had to be made quickly as to whether or not to halt
migrations if there was a major incident. The deployment, service and support

teams had to work in a joined up way.

27.My role in a major incident situation was to ensure that the deployment team
was aware of any major incident and to assess the impact of a major incident
on the forward schedule for branch migrations, initiating replanning of the
branch migration schedule if necessary, and to ensure that the right technical
teams were brought to bear to resolve the major incident, working closely with
the service management team. If branch migrations were impacted, I had to
communicate this with my customer opposite number in the Post Office, Will

Russell, and Mark Burley, his boss.

PILOT SCHEME FOR HNG-X

28.In order to prepare this section of my statement, the Inquiry has asked me to
consider documents the following documents, in relation to which I have been
asked a number of discrete questions: WITN03860100_01/9 to

WITNO03860100_01/17. I address these documents in turn below.

HNG-X Migration RAG Report
29. The first document which the Inquiry has asked me to consider is a spreadsheet
entitled “HNG-X Migration RAG Report” (WITN03860100_01/14). This
spreadsheet relates to issues raised and owned by me and contains 3 sets of
issues:
a. Issues that by agreement had to be fixed in the migrated HNG-X Post
Office estate;
b. Issues that had to be resolved before the next stage of rollout could
commence; and

c. HNG-X - Live branch issues.

30. This spreadsheet was used by the programme team to track issues and their
management to closure during the pilot. This was shared and reviewed with
the Post Office Programme Team so that there was an open view of what was

being done.

Page 16 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

31. Taking each part in turn:

a. Reference number HVP8 —

Release RO1.08 (Approach is to start HVP with
0107 code & in paralel pilot R.01.08 in 50 MVP
branches - missed opportuntty to pilot if delayed)

This was a concern that, if the timetable for deployment of the next
release of the branch software (R.01.08) was delayed, it could not be
included in the pilot. The timetable is described in the history and latest
position. I cannot remember what the actual dates for the deployment

of R.01.08 were.

b. K1_ and K2 — These related to timeouts or screen freezes which
effectively stopped end users from using the application in the migrated

pilot branches.

c. K3- This related to the number of interventions required by the Service
Desk or the Network team. K1, K2 and K3 issues were tracked on a

daily basis because of the impact on the branches.

d. K 5.1- Related to a procedure not being followed at 2 branches, which
resulted in an action to a) check that there was not a data integrity issue

and b) reinforce the correct procedures to be followed at the branch.

e. K6 — Related to the time taken for on-site engineers to fix a hardware
failure issue which was logged by the branch following migration. This
was raised for a specific branch in Clapham. In this particular case, the

engineer arrived on site within contractually agreed timeframe but was

Page 17 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

asked to swap the kit out of hours by the local Postmaster which meant

that Fujitsu had to rearrange the site visit 4 days later.

K13 — There was a concern raised about the ability of support teams to
support the branch estate (in terms of capacity). This was constantly
kept under review during the pilot and rollout. Many people worked

overtime and weekends to support the pilot and rollout over a long period

of time.

. RO2 — This was a request from Post Office to Fujitsu to increase the
number of branches which were migrated overnight on a Friday evening.
The rollout schedule was planned so that most branch migrations each
week happened on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday
evening. With all the delays to the application development there was
huge pressure from Post Office to make the deployment rollout to the
branches as rapid as possible. This had to be balanced against the
bandwidth limitations of the network connections to the branches and
the speed of download of the software to enable the branches to
complete their testing as quickly as possible the next day. Fujitsu did
look into ways of increasing the number of deployments which could
happen each day through tuning the download process (including
Fridays), but I cannot remember the details of what these improvements

were.

Page 18 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

32.The whole team was concerned about the timeouts and screen freezes
because this clearly would impact on the usability of the application. There was
a huge focus on addressing these issues in order for the higher volume pilots
to proceed. There were challenges for the programme team in getting enough
information from the branches during the pilot to diagnose the issues (many
were very good at reporting issues but others were not), and to separate issues
affecting one branch from those which affected multiple sites, if the reporting

from branches was inconsistent.

EMV Banking and Retail — Horizon — LINK Mapping

33.1 have been asked to comment on a document entitled “EMV Banking and
Retail — Horizon — LINK Mapping” dated 30 April 2010 (WITN03860100_01/9)
and the reasons for the changes made between version 3.2 and version 4.0.
This is a Post Office document where I am listed as having been issued the
document for information or as optional review. I assume that the document
was subject to regular review and that a number of updates were required to it
based on the implementation of the HNG-X application to the pilot sites which
needed to be agreed before the full rollout to the branches started. I was not

involved in writing it or reviewing it.

34. The associated documents referred to on page 5of WITN03860100_01/9relate
to Vocalink, which is a company that provides transaction switching, clearing
and settlement for the UK LINK Scheme which was implemented for Post
Office. So, it was essential that data from HMGX was mapped in accordance

with the Vocalink standards and with Post Office standards.

Page 19 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

Vocalink — HNG-X Technical Interface Specification

35.The Inquiry has then referred me to a document entitled “EMV Banking and
Retail: NBS — LINK Application Interface Specification” dated 5 May 2010
(WITN03860100_01/10). I have been asked to explain the ‘Vocalink - HNG-X
Technical Interface Specification’ referenced at section 1.7 on Page 7 of the
document. From the title, this appears to be the detailed description of the
interface between HNG-X and the Vocalink system for clearing and settling
financial transactions which would have enabled data to be exchanged between

the two systems.

HNG-X Branch Exception Handling Strategy - Agreed Assumptions and

Constraints

36.1 have been asked to comment on the “HNG-X Branch Exception Handling
Strategy -— Agreed Assumptions and Constraints” document dated 18
November 2010 (WITN03860100_01/11) and whether I had any concerns in
relation to its content. I do not recall having any concerns regarding the contents
of this document at the time. The only substantive change was the addition of
Section 8. On reflection, when looking at this document 13 years later, perhaps
the changes in Section 8 should have been integrated into the existing sections
of the document. More explanation of how this document fits in the overall

contract schedules and how it is to be used would perhaps be useful.

37.1 have also been asked to explain the aims of this document and its conclusion.

I believe this document explains key areas of exception handling at local

branches in the event of different types of component failure with the solution.

Page 20 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

This includes network failures, local hardware failures and _ central
infrastructure/application failures in HNG-X to inform discussions between Post
Office and Fujitsu in interpreting Service Level Agreement performance in the
service contract. The document includes tables comparing the expected
average faults per counter per year for different types of failure, and compares
the expected failure rates between the legacy Horizon application and HNG-X.
It is worth noting that some elements of the branch hardware dated back to the
original Horizon rollout. The new HNG-X application was designed to run on
this local branch hardware, which had a reputation for being reliable but was in
IT terms quite old. The age of the branch hardware was well known and
understood by Post Office and Fujitsu and the software was written to be
efficient so that it would run at an adequate speed on this local hardware. I do

not recall having any other concerns about the document.

RAG Report Communications

38. The Inquiry have also pointed me to two email chains dating from 2010 to which
lam a party (WITN0O3860100_01/12 and WITN03860100_01/17) and asked if
these documents relate to the RAG Report described above in this
statement. The issues being discussed in these documents relate to the
deployment of the HNG-X software to Post Office branches. There were 4
packages for software which had to be downloaded to the branch and then
unpacked and installed on to the branch servers. If the order of the package
download and deployment was changed from 1, 2, 3, 4, this could affect certain
types of branch counters meaning they used incorrect reference data from the

Rate Boards. These issues would have been raised on the RAG report.

WITNO03860100

39.In this instance, I wanted to wait before communicating this information to Post
Office, so that we could check if there was a workaround that could be applied
without another software change which could impact on the deployment rollout
schedule. I also wanted to confirm the timelines for the software fix and
understand the risks to the schedule and any support concerns with my peers,
including the leader of the Application Development team (Graham Allen)
before we spoke to the customer. Post Office always wanted options for issues,
not simply announcements of risks and/or delays. We were speaking with the

Post Office team every day, and this matter was discussed with them.

Migration Reports
40.My role in the migration was the Deployment Programme Manager, overseeing
the rollout of the branch router and HNG-X software to the Post Office

branches.

41. The purpose of migration reports was to ensure the right focus was brought to
bear on the key issues arising from the branch migration. The document
exhibited at WITN03860100_01/15is the latest summary of defects in the

Fujitsu Test application.

42.The Inquiry has asked me to address the reasoning and process by which I
would raise issues and what my involvement was in relation to the managemert
of those issues. I would raise issues by reviewing the statistics from the daily

rollouts, and receiving feedback based on incidents raised either directly with

Page 22 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

the implementation team or from incidents raised by Post Office staff on the
Service Desk. Such issues as above would be tracked through the different
tabs in the RAG spreadsheet (a further example of which is exhibited at
WITNO03860100_01/16) from cause of delays to issues encountered, with and
“owner” assigned to resolve the issue, a categorisation as to whether or not the
issue needed to be resolved for the rollout, and where the issue was located,

e.g. in the branches or centrally.

43.1 was leading the management and resolution of the issues arising from
Release 1 deployment, ensuring that the right priority and focus was brought to
fixing issues whilst trying to maintain where possible successful deployment

rates for the rollout.

DECISION TO ACCEPT AND ROLLOUT HORIZON ONLINE

44.To assist my preparation of this section of my statement, the Inquiry has pointed
me to the following documents: WITN03860100_01/09, WITN03860100_01/11
and WITN03860100_01/18 to WITN03860100_01/30. The Inquiry has then
asked me to consider a series of discrete questions in respect of these

documents. I address these questions in turn below.

45. The Inquiry also asked whether I know what the Saving Gateway account was,

but I do not.

Software Issues in the HNG-X Pilot

46. The main software issue that I recall being identified as one of the reasons for
aborting the roll out of Horizon online at several branches was the screen
freezing/performance issues at pilot branches. This was eventually diagnosed
as an issue with the Oracle version 10 relational database management
system, which required top level technicians (fourth line) from the U.S. in
Oracle’s development team to identify and develop an emergency fix for. It took
over 3 months for this issue to be resolved, during which time the pilot was
halted. Whilst the fix was being developed, Fujitsu had to implement a number
of interim manual technical support processes to monitor and prevent the

working memory used by the database being used up.

47. During the early pilot, all issues found were raised in the RAG Report described
above and exhibited at WITN03860100_01/14. As the pilot progressed to
larger numbers, the incident management process was used to track these,
although a summary of the critical issues was manually produced and reviewed

on a daily basis.

48.In this regard, the Inquiry has asked me to consider two documents:

a. The Service Description for the Central Network Service dated 21

January 2010 (WITN03860100_ 01/20): I do not recall having reviewed

this document but I’m sure I would have read it and had the opportunity
to give feedback on it. The timing of this version suggests it was the last

version before the start of the rollout. I cannot remember if later versions

Page 24 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

were produced but I would have expected this to be at least reviewed

and if necessary updated after the completion of the rollout.

b. The Service Description for the Branch Network Service dated 4 March

2010 (WITN03860100 01/21): I reviewed but did not write this

document. The goal in deploying the HNG-X software was to do this with
minimal business impact on day-to-day operations. I was not involved
in the Service management led discussions around operational service
performance during the rollout. It was recognised that at the point of
migration of branches to the new software platform there would have to
be some downtime but once the new application was running, the intent

was to have no further downtime once the migration had completed.

EMV Banking and Retail

49.1 have been referred to two documents which relate EMV Link Mapping and
EMV Banking and Retail (WITN03860100_01/9 and WITN03860100_01/22,
respectively). I do not recall these documents. From the history — it looks as

though they were subject to detailed feedback from Post Office prior to sign-off.

Application Interface Specification: Horizon to e-pay

50.1 have been referred to the Application Interface Specification for Horizon to e-
pay dated 24 August 2010 (WITN03860100_01/25) and asked whether
changes made to the document resulted from errors or bugs. I did not review
this document formally, although I would have read it The document version
histories are, however, detailed and indicate that this was updated to reflect

changes made for HNG-X, not as a result of errors or bugs.

WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

Service Desk Service Descriptions

51.Document WITN03860100_01/27is the Service Desk Service Description
dated 16 September 2010, which was originally designed for the original
Horizon application service. It is a description of the Fujitsu Service Desk
Service provided to Post Office. During all the pilots, there were additional
support arrangements to the standard Service Desk arrangements in place to
ensure that the issues were identified, triaged and resolved as quickly as

possible.

52.1 played no role in designing this system or in updating this document, which
represented an update for the new HNG-X application. A detailed incident
management system is standard good practice for major business applications
and systems. It is important that the customer and IT service provider
understand those processes so that escalations and governance are clear, and
that incidents can be reported on in a consistent and timely manner. By the
time I left the account, the lessons learned from the pilot stages and from the
large-scale migration of branches to the new application would have been used
to inform more changes into this document. I worked very closely with the
Fujitsu Service Management team (including Graham Welsh, Gaetan Van
Achte and others) to ensure that there was a controlled transition into business

as usual operations as the migrations progressed.

53.The Inquiry has also provided me with the Service Desk Service Description

dating from 20 August 2010 (WITN03860100_01/30). During the pilot and

rollout of HNG-X, Fujitsu had considerable extra provision for incident

Page 26 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

management because the programme team was in place, working with and
supporting the service management teams, above and beyond what is
documented in this document. This was because the programme was not in
“business as usual mode” until the rollout was completed. I cannot recall these
extra support measures in detail but I am reasonably confident that, for the pilot
migrations and the early stages of the mass rollout, the Development and other
technical teams (including the networking team) were working additional hours
to be available for the rapid triage and resolution of issues. The steps to be

followed in the normal operational world are described in detailin the document.

54.The Service Desk process was updated for HNGX but not re-written from
scratch. As with the subsequent version of this Service Description, I was not
involved in designing the system. I do not know what was changed in the

document for HNG-X.

CONCERNS RAISED BY END USERS

55.1 have been asked to refer to the documents exhibited at WITN03860100_01/31
(an email dated 9 June 2010 with subject line “All Open Calls excluding calls of
Type R (Release Notes)” to which I am not a party)and WITN03860100_01/32
(a spreadsheet matching that description)and explain some of the contents of

the documents.

Page 27 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

56.A level 2 Manager was the person owning that part of the HNG-X programme.
For example, Debbie Richardson was the senior Test Manager on HNG-X, I

was the deployment rollout lead.

57.Part of my role as the Deployment Programme Manager was to review any calb
that were raised after that they had been triaged to be in my responsible area,
and ensure that actions were taken to get to the root cause and either resolve

them or take preventive measure to stop them from happening again.

58. Calls relate to incidents which have been raised (by end users at the branches)
and which have not been diagnosed or resolved.I do not remember what Type
R Calls were or why they were excluded. The calls list is an extract from the

incident management system.

59.The information in the above documents was used to get an overview of the
number of open/closed incidents across different functional areas for
management purposes. Each open call was detailed. The Level 2 managers
were responsible for managing these numbers, the aim being to resolve as

many issues as safely and quickly as possible.

60. The process was that each functional area owned their own open calls and
managed their teams to resolve them, often in collaboration with other
supporting teams. The number of open and closed calls was tracked on a

regular basis (from memory at least weekly)

Page 28 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

61.Sub-postmasters reported issues to the HSH/NBSC during the pilot phases,
which concerned me and the programme very much because it meant that

there was business disruption.

62. There was one particular stage of the pilot, although I cannot remember how
many branches had been migrated to the new application (it might have been
around 30), where we made a decision jointly with the Post Office management
team, that rollout of the software to more branches would have to be delayed
until the root cause of screen freezes was identified and a fix found. This proved
very difficult to diagnose, and required fourth line Oracle support from the U.S.
following senior Fujitsu executive escalation. The root cause was an issue in
the buffer memory management of the Oracle version that was in use to
manage the HNG-X database. It required Oracle to fast track a fix which took
time to develop, test and implement. During the period whilst the deployment
was on hold (around 3 months), Fujitsu had to put in place a series of manual
checks and additional support processes to support the branches runningHNG-

X if they suffered screen freezes.

63.A small number of branch migrations failed because branches failed to follow
the pre-requisite preparation instructions prior to their migration, e.g. not leaving
devices on. There were also some occasional failures of equipment as a result
of the migration, and sometimes the branch router devices failed when
engineers tried to install them, which meant that the installation had to be re
planned. I have previously mentioned the bug whereby, if the software

packages were not downloaded in the correct order, the rate boards on certain

Page 29 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

types of counters used incorrect data. This was fixed by the application
development team by changing the delivery instructions for the software to

branches.

64. As noted above, Will Russell was my counterpart at Post office during this time,

and also Mark Burley, who was Mr Russell's boss.

QUALITY OF GUIDANCE OR TRAINING GIVEN TO END USERS (e.g. SPMs)
FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HORIZON ONLINE

65.1 was responsible for the rollout of the branch router and the deployment of the

software, not the end user training.

66.1 have been provided with URNs WITN03860100_01/33 to
WITN03860100_01/35, which include
a. an installation guide for on-site engineers installing a Rate Board; and

b. a Rate Board maintenance guide for on-site engineers in case of issues.

67.As an ‘optional reviewer’, I was sent these documents for informationonly. I do

not remember formally reviewing the documents, but I do remember reading

them out of interest.

68.In terms of ‘hands-on’ training, I understand there were model office setups in

Fujitsu where engineers were taken through installation and maintenance of

Page 30 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

different items of Post Office branch hardware. New engineers might also

shadow experienced engineers on site visits.

69.1 did not receive feedback from engineers directly, although members of my
team did. Unfortunately, this was not helpful because often the nature of this
feedback was emotive and highly anecdotal in nature, and because it was not
formally logged through the Service Desk it was very difficult to troubleshoot
and diagnose the root cause after the event. Fujitsu had to reiterate to the Post
Office management team on a number of occasions that the Post Office
branches had to follow the correct process to help get to an issue root cause
and resolution quickly. However, I can understand that if there were issues at
branches, then end users wanted to voice their views to the faces of the
programme, which was often the on-site engineers. The engineers did in some
instances raise incidents with the Service Desk on behalf of the branches, and
sometimes raised their own incidents, for example when they arrived on the
agreed planned date to install a branch router only to be told by the Sub-
Postmaster that they could not undertake the installation because they were

too busy. This meant a substantial effort was required to re-schedule visits.

70.During the branch router rollout, which had to be completed before software
deployment, there were problems with access to some branch sites, and some
of the branch routers failed and had to be replaced. During the pilots, the main

issues were screen freezes and network timeouts.

HORIZON LITIGATION

71.1 have been asked to set out my recollection of the following bugs, error or
defects as defined by Fraser J in Appendices 1 and 2 of Bates & Others v. Post
Office Limited [2019] EWHC 3408(QB): the receipts and payments mismatch
bug; the suspense account bug; the Dalmellington bug/branch outreach issue;
the remming in bug; the local suspense account issue; recovery issues;
withdrawn stock discrepancies; Bureau discrepancies; Post & Go / TA

discrepancies in POLSAP; bureau de change; and Lyca top-up.

72.I remember the headline names of the suspense account and remming in bugs.
I’m not sure now but am fairly confident that they occurred during the pilot and
were fixed. I do not remember any specific details about these bugs. I do know
that there was a highly transparent process during the piot and rollout of
sharing with the customer details of any bugs that were found, and the progress

to resolution was also shared.

73.1 am not aware of any other issues that arose at the time.

REFLECTIONS

74.Looking back, I don’t think there is anything I could have done differently.

Alongside a large number of other people in the team, I worked exceptionally

hard over many months to overcome a number of technical and logistical

challenges to implement a highly complex application across the UK Post Office

Page 32 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

estate. I called out any issues which occurred, we raised them with the
customer and there was a massive drive and determination to deliver to the
customer. I know that the customer team was frustrated by the delays ard this
frustration was compounded when more issues were found during the pilot.
However, piloting the system in a small number of branches was a sensible
approach given the complexity of the system, and it should not have been a
surprise that issues were found, in spite of the volume of testing (both by Fujitsu
and the Post Office) before deployment. The solution used cutting edge
technology (from the Oracle database to the use of Java for aspects of the

software development) and had to work over limited network bandwidth.

75.\f I had been involved from the beginning of the programme, I would have
wanted to ensure that the Testing Strategy was robust and made adequate
provision for end-to-end application testing, user acceptance testing,
performance load testing and service readiness testing. From what I heard
when I came into the programme, the original development and implementation
timescales that were set and agreed for HNG-X after pressure from the
customer and senior Fujitsu management were very optimistic. It was only after
a detailed replan in the spring of 2009 that more realistic dates emerged, which

in turn changed when the pilot had to be stopped.

76. The Inquiry has asked who I think is responsible for the Post Office scandal. I
find this a very difficult question to answer. The Horizon IT System is still in use
across the Post Office branch estate. Ultimately, the Post Office accepted the

results of User Acceptance Testing and gave permission for the HNG-X

Page 33 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

software to be deployed. It was also ultimately the Post Office’s decision to
prosecute Sub-Postmasters. I understand that there had been prosecutions of
Sub-Postmasters for fraud on the original Horizon application, before HNG-X
was rolled out. I was not involved in any of the cases that were pursued using
data from HNG-X and I do not know what the process was to validate individual
accusations of fraud. It is likely that decisions to prosecute were taken based
on technical interpretations of data record histories at branches. I don’t know if
these technical interpretations were assessed and compared against detailed
operational processes and best practices before coming to a decision to
prosecute, i.e. validated by “expert” sub-postmasters and/or financial process
consultants (e.g. forensic financial auditors). They should have been. As I have
mentioned before, HNG-X is a complex system, with many processes to follow.
It is quite possible that Sub-Postmasters and their staff may not in some cases
have understood the processes required to run the system correctly and
therefore made genuine errors in how they used the system which resulted in

financial record irregularities.

77. In terms of what the Post Office could have done differently, I don’t know if the
Post Office put enough resources into User Acceptance Testing or end user
training and adoption to ensure good compliance with endto-end business
processes. Perhaps more thorough sign-offs on user training would have
helped, and then follow-up reviews with branches, for example using or-line
tests for each area of the system to make sure that the staff really understood
how to use the system and how to run end of day and monthly reconciliation

processes would have helped.

Page 34 of 39
WITNO3860100
WITNO03860100

78.Perhaps adopting a different attitude towards the sub-postmasters would also
have helped. I detected that there was a culture in the central Post Office team
of not really trusting the branch managers and their staff— there was clearly a
divide between the full-time Post Office staff in the central teams (including the
staff running the 500 or so largest Post Office owned branches) and the more
independent sub-postmasters running small local branches. I heard (but did
not witness directly) that senior stakeholders at Post Office would often take
their frustrations out on both their own Programme team and on the Fujitsu
Client Director at the time. When issues arose, Post Office senior stakeholders
would often demand lots of information very quickly which sometimes got in the
way of our efforts to diagnose and resolve issues, I can appreciate senior
stakeholders may have been frustrated by the delays and under pressure from
Executives but, in the end, with complex technical programmes like this, the
core teams needed to be given time and space to resolve issues in a logical,

controlled way.

79. If there are accusations of fraud, then there should be a clear, transparent and
consistent process by which evidence is gathered, validated operationally and
shared with the defendants and reviewed before any decision is taken to

prosecute.

80. There are no other matters that I consider will assist the Chair.
