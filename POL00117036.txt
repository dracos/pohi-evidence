it provides, independence through second sight and independent mediator

should be faster as the workload is shared between SS and mediator

provides a professionally trained mediator which we think will help bring resolution
gets Second Sight out of the role of both mediator, judge and sub postmaster advocate
process can continue after the MPs cases are completed with little alteration

After the cases have been completed, final report will be produced by mediator.

Update to MPs in Oct. could involve mediator and SS can update what they found in the work, POL can talk
about mediation process, if we have put some cases through the process by then could

We would like to introduce a Monthly Oversight Board to govern this, is JA willing to chair?
