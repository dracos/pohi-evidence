Rodric,

Thank you for this.

Independently we have been drafting a short response with our views on the report which I attach. Unsurprisingly I
believe we have reached similar conclusions.

The document is for Post Office’s eyes only and as such we request the you keep it confidential. Should you wish to use
any of the content within a response to Second Sight or a public statement I request that you request our permission in
advance so that we can be aligned.

Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Mike

Michael,

Please find attached Post Office's draft reply to the Second Sight Part 2 Report (Part 2 Report).

I'd be grateful for your comments on the draft reply, in particular sections 5, 7, 11,12, 18, 19 and 20. The other sections
mainly concern Post Office procedure. Although all comments from Fujitsu are welcomed, if it would be quicker for you
to only address the key technical areas then I suggest focussing on the sections listed above.

The draft Reply has been prepared by Post Office's lawyers and in contemplation of litigation with Applicants to the
Scheme. It is subject to legal advice and litigation privilege. It is being shared with Fujitsu under common interest
privilege as we both have a common interest in responding accurately and fully to the Part 2 Report. The draft Reply
must be kept confidential by Fujitsu, not disclosed to any third party and only used for the purpose of responding to the
Part 2 Report. As such, I should be grateful if all emails on this matter could be headed "Strictly Private and Confidential
— Subject to Legal Privilege — Not for Wider Circulation".

I look forward to receiving your comments. Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards, Rodric
