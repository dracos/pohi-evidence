Dealing with Transaction Reversals

fa transaction has been entered and the customer session completed, and you subsequently find
you have made an error, you can correct the error by ‘reversing’ the transaction.

Depending on the transaction, you can reverse it in one of four ways:
* as an existing reversal

* a new reversal

* awansfer reversal

* an automated payment reversal.

Existing Reversal

An existing reversal can only be performed at the stock unit that carried out the original transaction,
and only within the same Cash Account Period.

All mansactions have a session number ~ this can be obtained from the transaction log.

There is now a Horizon ‘cut-off’. Once you are happy that a
report is correct you need to carry out a report ‘cut-off". This
totals the report and resets the figures in the Horizon System for
the next report to zero.

Any further transactions that you do after the report ‘cut-off’ will
appear on the next report.

Hf you do not ‘cut-off" after completing the report further
transactions will just be added onto it and both the ald and new
transactions will appear on the next report produced.

stem that you wish to start the day's business. You do this by
logging on. You will be required to enter your User Name and
Password. You will also be required to Log on after any time that
