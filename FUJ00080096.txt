2.2 The Service Desk Service also interfaces with the Change Management, Asset Management
and Configuration Management systems required to support the Branch Infrastructure and HNG-
X Central Infrastructure.

2.3 The Service Desk Service also acts as an initiator within the Problem Management process due
to its ability to monitor Incident trends against the severity received.

described in the Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Integration Service,
Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0010).

relating to the call types referred to in this Working Document.

4 _ End to End Incident Management

All incidents reported to the HSD are managed in accordance with the “POA Incident Management
Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). Calls are logged in the incident management system

4.1 Incident Logging

4.1.1. Receiving & Diagnosing a Call

HSD Agents will always ensure that they are always ready and able to take a service call, unless they
are doing call related work, when they must set their telephone to Desk Work or away from their desk on
a break, when they must set their telephone to Desk Work. The Agent should also ensure that their
headset is on their head ready for use BEFORE the call is answered to ensure there is no delay or
background noise before greeting the caller & that the call management system is up and running.

This will minimise the delay to a caller when the Agent is retrieving/recording the caller's details and thus
allow more time for the Agent to speak to the caller regarding the problem.

The moment an Agent receives an incoming telephone call, they will greet the customer with the
example shown below. All spoken words are marked in Italics and in “quotes”.

“Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, Horizon System Helpdesk, [AGENT NAME]
speaking”.

“May I take your Branch code please?”
Branch Code Validation Failure

If a Branch code cannot be given, the caller immediately fails validation. If the reason why the Branch
code cannot be provided is because the PO employee cannot remember, or does not know the Branch
code, the incident will be logged under ‘999999" as Other Queries, QU04 Caller fails initial verification,
Cause: CD3 Unauthorised caller, Repair R40: Service Refused, taking all the details of the caller. The
Agent must then politely decline the call directing the caller to the NBSC for example:

“Unfortunately without a branch code we are unable to assist further. You could contact
NBSC for further assistance.”

If the caller is not entitled to service from the HSD but was given the HSD number to use in terms of PO-
related business i.e., “my pension book has not arrived at the Post Office and the PM said to call you to
ask you for further information about it’, the Agent must take down the details of the caller, name and
number and details about who provided them with the HSD telephone number. Service to the caller must
then be politely declined for example:

“Unfortunately I cannot recall any information on our system regarding your details which
means I am unable to help you further ”

The call should be coded as Other Queries, QU04 Caller fails initial verification, Cause: CD3
Unauthorised caller, Repair R40: Service Refused.

Branch Code Validated

(a) For each call where the Branch code is provided, the Agent must verify the caller with the
information retrieved from the PowerHelp system. The Agent should confirm the following
with the caller:

e Site name (e.g. Post Office name)

e Telephone number
« Caller’s full name (recording it in the logged call)
¢ Position of the caller

NB: If the telephone number is different from the number listed in PowerHelp, the Agent
MUST ask the caller to confirm that the number is the MAIN telephone number for the Post
Office.

(b) If any of the above details given differ from that displayed in PowerHelp, ask the caller to
confirm the:

« Post code
e Postal address

Details of any changes should be escalated to a PSE and the PM should be advised to
inform the NBSC of the change.

c) If the caller cannot be verified from this information then the AGENT should log the call as
Other Queries, QU04 Caller fails initial verification, Cause: CD3 Agent caller, Repair R40:
Service Refused, on the Problem Management System.

The AGENT will then end the call politely, an example of which is shown below.

“Unfortunately I cannot recall any information on our system regarding your details so I am unable to help
you further. You may wish to contact the NBSC for assistance by dialling i
option 3.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Taking Information about the Problem

The Agent must establish the reason for the call from the customer; an example of how to obtain this
information might be to ask:

“Which part of the Horizon equipment may I help you with?”

Whilst noting the problem, the Agent must check the red telephone B in the cai Tracking Information
window if it is visible to make sure that there isn’t an incident already open for the caller's current
problem. If there is already an open incident, the Agent must open this call to add an update.

If the call(s) in the red telephone is not related or there is no red telephone, the Agent must record details
regarding the problem and enter it on the Call Management system by raising a new call.

Alerts & Trends

The Agent must look out for key words that may identify a trend whilst noting the problem. Key words
might be ‘usual problem’ or ‘it has happened again’. If Agent believes that there might be a recurring
problem they must check the site history by looking through the calls on the red and yellow telephones

B @ and note any associated closed call reference numbers in the incident log. The Agent will also
assign the PowerHelp incident record appropriate codes and a priority (See HSD Call Coding and
Routing Document, FS/PRO/HSD/002).

When entering a Branch code, the Agent should also pay attention to any “Alerts” a that may appear on
the Query Form. If there is an alert message, the Agent should follow the instructions in the alert text. If
the Agent is not clear on what action to take they should seek advice from a PSE. Should the Agent
believe that the problem being logged raises concerns about the efficient operation of the site (or the
Helpdesk) they should raise these concerns immediately with their PSE or Team Manager, who will, in
turn, immediately escalate to the IMT.

Ending the Call

Whether the incident is going to be closed or progressed, the Agent must always give the caller a unique
incident record number, taken from the PowerHelp system, to that problem when ending the voice call,
as follows:

“Your incident reference number is E-Oxxxxxxxx. Please always use this as a future
reference of this incident and if you require further information regarding this problem.”

(Closure being call is completed no further action is required and it has been agreed with the customer to close the
call)
Call Closure T. Agent will close the call within Powerhelp entering the relevant call information (cause, repair codes etc),
including details of what actions and SDU resolved the reported issue.

4.1.5 I Managing Customer Expectation

The HSD are responsible for updating the PM on Engineer arrival time and progess of long running calls. When a Hardware call is logged, the ETA for the engineer
arrival time should be given as when the SLA expires — where possible the desk should take into consideration the opening hours of the branch. The communication
to the branch should be an am or pm estimation.

For long running calls — hardware calls for which the SLA has expired or Comms calls, the branch should be contacted when a) there is a significant update OR b)
every couple of days. Branches should be called even if there is no update in order to reassure the branch that work is still continuing on the fault.

4.2 Master Incident

In the event that an incident is identified which could generate multiple calls to the HSD, a master
working call is raised and all calls will be logged against this master record. This record will then be used
to capture the progress of the incident.

This can occur as a result of:

e High Call Volumes: If HSD notice high call-volumes (benchmark of 15 calls waiting) the IMT will
investigate if there is a trend in calls and Incidence, using the Incident Management System. In
the event that a trend is identified, a working master call will be raised and sent to the relevant
SDU for investigation.

e SMC / SDU Identify Incident: SMC/SDUs will notify IMT in the event of an incident, who will
raise a working master call and assign to the relevant SDU for investigation. HSD will be
provided with the call reference number.

e Major Incident: If an MIR is required, IMT raise an A Priority Powerhelp call and reassign it to the
HSD IMT action group

Raising Master Incident

In the event that a master record is raised, IMT will gather as much information as possible regarding the
incident and log it all in the problem text. This will include information on what is down, how many sites
are affected, and who has been notified of the incident. Once the area of responsibility is identified, the
corresponding Service Delivery Manager will be contacted

The Service Delivery Manager will advise on actions to be taken.

Updating Master Incident

The Master Incident will continue to be checked and updated during the lifecycle of the incident and all
calls to the desk will be logged on this incident.

Closure of Master Incident

Once the incident has been resolved, the master record will be closed.

4.3 Communication of Business Impacting / Major Incident

The Service Delivery Manager will review the master record and identify if the incident is or is potentially
Business / Service Impacting. If these criteria are met, extended communication will take place as
detailed below.

4.3.1. Updates to POL Live Service Desk

Following review of the master record, the Service Delivery Manager will confirm if and when POL Live
Service Desks to be notified, in accordance with the Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001). IMT
are responsible for the communication to POL Live Service Desk and all updates must be checked in
advance with the Service Delivery Manager.

The frequency of verbal updates must be agreed with POL Live Service Desk and strictly adhered to; i.e.
if updates are agreed to be hourly, then a conversation must take place, even if there is no further
update.
