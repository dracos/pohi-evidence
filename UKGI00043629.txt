Subject: Fi ding for tomorrow

Attachments: 2020.11.18 HSS - Preliminary advice on quantum exposure - draft (002).pdf; Cover Paper Board 201117.docx; The
Post Office Historical Shortfall Scheme Business Case October 2020 Board.docx

I attach the papers that are going to Board for discussion tomorrow afternoon, as promised.

We have worked through all the comments, albeit in a bit of a rush, with some of the team attending the court
proceedings.

Most have been addressed, a couple we had specific reasons for not changing but in the most part I hope you will agree
that we have approached it with positive intent and open minds. If there is a miss, it may well be cock-up not
conspiracy...

I spoke to Tom earlier and we agreed that the wording of the financial sharing should sensibly be quite “soft” at this
stage, acknowledging the work to be done.

We have added quite a lot on value per claim etc. I have suggested it may be helpful for Alan and Tom to discuss before
the Board.

Much appreciated Al
