Nicky, Belinda
Please find attached the latest draft of the factfile.
This is nearly complete. The remaining points are:

«We have a few small points on which we are seeking clarification from various parts of the business. Claire is
chasing for this.

« We need to complete the cross-referencing / final proof reading.

«The document needs formatting / converting into POL house style. Given that this document may go public, it
is probably worth putting some effort into making this document look good.

Do you think this is now close enough to a final version to be circulated to the Programme Board for comments? I
think it will take us to at least middle of next week to bottom out the points above.

Kind regards
Andy
