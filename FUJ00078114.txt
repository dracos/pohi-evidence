Implementation Overview

The Horizon Counter systems are to be implemented in Post Offices, also
referred to as Outlets, across the United Kingdom. The implementation
strategy associates all the activities required to deliver the Horizon Counter
infrastructure as one implementation programme. This enables all parties
associated with the implementation to monitor any events accordingly.

The Horizon counter infrastructure is implemented across the country in four
implementation programmes each mapping to a number of Benefit Agency
Districts and Post Office Regions. These together with their relationships are
summarised below;

¢ Pathway Implementation Programmes (IP) split the rollout programme
across four regions namely;

1. IPi Scotland & Northern Ireland

2. IP2 North Wales, North West and North East
3. IP3 South Wales, South West and Midlands
4. IP4 South East and London.

¢ Post Office Counters Ltd divides the country in to 7 regions.
¢ The Benefits Agency divides the country in to 136 districts.
At release 1b only outlets in IP2 and IP3 are affected.

Each Outlet is implemented with one or more Horizon Counter systems
depending on the number of counter positions.

For illustration purposes the various configurations will be represented in this
document as one entity as shown in the diagram below.

The activities to deliver an operational system at each Post Office are controlled
through the Pathway Implementation Team, working with representatives of
the Programme Delivery Authority and Post Office Counters Ltd. and a number
of third party suppliers. The scope of these interfaces is described in Rollout
Stage Management Plan. (Ref. [1])

ICL Pathway provides the infrastructure through which the implementation

programme is achieved.

The implementation of the Counter system itself is dependant on a number of
related activities having first been completed before processing of Post Office
transactions can take place. These are summarised below;

Horizon counter system and its operation.

When the system is operational Post Office users are supported through the
Horizon System Help Desk.

2 About this document.

The implementation strategy has been developed resulting from a series of
workshops between PDA ICL Pathway and the third party suppliers, where all
aspects of the delivery mechanism have been discussed and agreed.

Rollout of the Horizon Counter system is dependant on a number of related
components provided as part of the Pathway solution being available. The
Horizon technical infrastructure is described in detail in the “Technical
Environment Description” (Ref. [2]).

Approval of the document provides the strategy with which the Horizon
counter infrastructure is implemented for release 1b.

Communication during the Rollout Programme.

This section documents the communication strategy that operates throughout
the implementation programme. The implementation programme, which is
also referred to as the rollout programme is associated with the all the activities
necessary to deliver a fully operational Counter environment to the 190 Outlets
for release 1b. To achieve this Post Office representatives together working
together with ICL Pathway plan organise and communicate the principles of
the implementation programme to Post Office counter staff and any third party
suppliers operating on behalf of ICL Pathway.

The lower level processes and working practices relating to communication is
documented in the Implementation Security Strategy document.

All parties operating to ICL Pathway involved with the implementation
programme will be identified at the Post Offices using a standard identity pass.
The exception to this rule is BT who will continue to use their own pass.

e All correspondence, telephone calls and visits to Post Office Outlets will
reference ICL Pathway.

e All personnel working in this environment will be security vetted to a
standard agreed with the Post Office.

¢ All representatives will be identifiable through the use of a common ICL
pathway identity card.

This is detailed further in the following sections.

Correspondence

Any written correspondence which is delivered to Outlets as part of the
implementation programme will be reviewed and agreed with PDA before
being dispatched.

Telephone Calls

All telephone calls to Post Office Outlets are scripted, such that the nature and
content of the call is agreed with PDA before any call is made.

Security vetting procedures

All personnel employed under the Horizon programme, who visit Outlets are
vetted to a standard agreed with POCL. To achieve this personal details are
passed to POCL in an agreed format.

¢ Specimen signature

Once security approval has been reached the information is passed to ICL
security where a ICL Pathway pass is produced. The ICL pass shows the
picture, signature and expirey date. The information is also passed to the Post
Office Help Line.

Access to any Post Office site requires that clearance is obtained through the
Post Office Help Line before access is allowed behind the counter.

Secure sites.

The rollout programme visits Outlets which are, by the very nature of the
business they undertake, governed by higher security vetting procedures than
the standard Outlets. (Ref. [3]).

Behaviour on site

All personnel who visit or represent the Horizon rollout programme Post Office
staff are expected to conduct and present themselves to the standards detailed
in Ref. [4].

Each Base Unit is built with a pre-configured disk of software. This is a
BASELINE set of software. The production and control of the BASELINE is
detailed in section 7.

4.1.1 Equipment packaging

The 5 Counter configurations are packaged prior to shipment to an Outlet. All
the equipment is functionally tested during this process. The hardware
configurations are created when equipment is packaged in sealed containers
known as Overshippers (see section 8).

The number and type of Overshippers for each Outlet is determined during the
Site Survey Process detailed in section 9 based on the following;

¢ Each Outlet is supplied with one gateway system.
¢ Multi position Outlets are also supplied with additional Counter systems.
¢ The type of gateway is determined by the office printer type.
e Where there is a requirement for a back office system, this is satisfied by
supplying an additional Counter system.
4.1.2 Positioning of equipment in Outlets

Counter equipment is installed in Outlet offices in a layout detailed in this
section. Outlets use a variety of schemes to number the counter positions, for
example;

* No requirement has currently been identified for this configuration. It is left here for completeness.

1. Counters are numbered 1-x left to right as viewed form the customer
side.

2. Counter positions are identified using letters of the alphabet ( as
viewed from the counter side).

To overcome this, the implementation strategy specifies the labelling of counter
positions for the rollout as follows;

¢ Counter positions are numbered o1 - xx, where x is the number of positions
from left to right as viewed from the counter side.

e A back office system is always the gateway server.
¢ Numbering of positions is as follows;

(i) gateway server is always position 01

(ii) Counter positions are numbered o2 - xx

(iii) Open plan positions are numbered after all counter positions have been
allocated.

The numbering of positions is required for the configuration of the Horizon
platform as detailed in section u.

The strategy is best explained using a series of examples.

Example1 Single counter position

In this example there is only one system installed and as such will always be
position number 1. This system is the gateway and affords the connection for
the office printer.

4.1.3. Physical equipment layout at the counter position.

The positioning of equipment on the counter position is limited, for standard
installations by the length of the equipment cabling and the physical layout of
the Outlet. Cabling is the physical wiring that interconnects the peripheral
equipment, i.e. the monitor, keyboard, counter printer and bar-code reader.

The table below provides the maximum distances at which the peripheral
equipment can be positioned from the Base Unit or power socket.

The rollout of the Horizon platform encounters numerous Outlets, each of
which may be physically different. There is no standard Counter layout or sizing
defined for a Post Office. The positioning of the physical equipment at counter
positions must satisfy the following;

4.2.1

Communications environment

The communication environment for the Horizon counter system is provided
through a Wide Area Network connection to the Pathway Campuses or via a
Local Area Network for internal outlet communications.

Wide Area Network Connections.

Each Outlet communicates with the Pathway Campuses through an ISDN
connection installed as part of the implementation process.

The ISDN service does not at present cover the entire United Kingdom. Where
ISDN is not available, the connection will be afforded using PSTN?. The
decision whether the communications connection is ISDN or PSTN is
determined once the order has been placed with BT by Energis. Outlets which
cannot be satisfied using PSTN are subject to review the PDA and this
document will be updated when all the options to satisfy PSTN are available.

ISDN connections delivered to Outlets are terminated using a Network
Termination Device (NTi - ISDN 2). This box is physically mounted in a
position as near to the gateway system as is practically possible. The location is
identified and labelled during the Site Survey process. The connector cable
between the ISDN 2 unit and the gateway position is installed as part of the Site
Preparation process (see section 9).

The connector cable is of sufficient length to prevent strain on the cable if
either the termination box or gateway server should either require servicing as
shown in the diagram below.

connector cable will bridge the physical distance between the Box and the
gateway server.

4.2.11 ISDN Connections.

Outlets whose connections are afforded using ISDN, are supplied with a NT6 or
NT 8 unit. The unit supports two outlets through which the physical
connection with the gateway system can be made. For the Horizon Outlets
connection is established through the left hand channel, as shown in the
diagram below.

NT6 Unit

The gateway system connects to the ISDN 2 using a pre-installed UTP cable .
The cable is terminated at each end with an RJ45 male connector.

The connection to the gateway system is afforded through the ISDN card.

The ISDN circuit is tested during the implementation programme as shown
below;

© On installation by the network supplier to ensure that the circuit is in a
operation state

¢ Two days before Horizon equipment installation by the communications
supplier Energis to ensure the circuit is still available.

¢ Before Horizon equipment installation starts by the installers using an ISDN
phone

¢ During the Horizon equipment acceptance process (see section 12).

The ISDN connection is labelled with a bar code sticker which identifies the
Outlet and indicating Pathway ownership during the Site Preparation process.

4.2.2 LAN Interconnections

In addition to the communication connection, multiple counter position offices
require further LAN cabling to allow the interconnection of the counter

systems. All cabling will be Cat 5 UTP.

4.2.2.1 Two Position Outlet

In a two Position Outlet the LAN connection is achieved using a cross over
cable. Where the distance between the two Positions exceeds 10m. the
interconnection is achieved using a cross over cable, RJ45 sockets and a flylead.

Peripheral environment

The peripheral environment is that used on the Horizon counter environment
for shared devices in the outlet. At release 1b this only applies to the Office
Printer.

Office Printer

Each outlet is equipped with either an Aq inkjet printer or an Aq Laser printer
which is used for the generation of reports in the Outlet. The type of printer for
each outlet is determined from information supplied by POCL. The printer
hardware is described in the Counter Hardware Design Specification ( Ref. [4])

The location of the Office Printer in the office is limited by the length of the
cable which connects the printer to the Base Unit.

The printer is shared by all the counter positions in the Outlet. To achieve this
all the Counter Systems are configured with details of which Base Unit the
printer is physically attached to. (See section 10).

Although the printer can be connected to any of the Horizon devices installed
in an Outlet, the configuration software needs to know about the actual
location. To achieve this the printer is always attached to the gateway server in
an outlet.

Each printer is supplied with the following consumables;
© One pack of Aq paper (500 sheets)
This is supplied and packaged as part of the Overshipper.

4.4 Existing systems environment

Existing systems are those environments currently operating in outlet
environments which are affected by the introduction of the Horizon counter
infrastructure. Systems may be affected as follows;

e Existing equipment and its functionality remains Category 1
in the outlet after Horizon installation, but may
require relocation.

e Existing equipment is removed and_ the Category 2
functionality migrated to the Horizon counter
infrastructure by ICL Pathway as part of the Horizon
installation.

¢ The functionality of the existing equipment is Category 3
migrated to the Horizon counter infrastructure and is
therefore redundant after Horizon installation. The
responsibility for removal of the existing equipment
is the responsibility of either POCL or the post
master.

Existing equipment environments currently identified are as follows. For each
the target category is also identified.

At release 1b the 190 outlets are of a nature where there is no requirement to
remove or incorporate existing equipment functionality as part of the Horizon
counter infrastructure. However during the implementation process situations
any be encountered which impede the implementation of the Horizon counter
infrastructure. These are discussed in the following sections.

4.4.1 Manual weigh scales

Manual weigh scales are existing equipment whose functionality is not
impacted by the installation of the Horizon counter infrastructure. To
accommodate the installation of the Horizon Counter equipment may require
that the manual weigh scales are moved. This is determined during the Site
Survey process (see section 9). The following applies;

¢ Manual weigh scales can be moved to an agreed location determined during
the Site Survey process

¢ The physical movement of the manual scales can be carried out, subject to
local agreement by either the post master or by the Site Preparation engineer

¢ Manual weigh scales may be relocated to the customer side of counters on
existing shelving, provided the following applies;

No additional counter modifications are required to accommodate the scales

Rollout Database

The Rollout database provides the Horizon implementation process with the
mechanism to control the rollout programme. The database acts as the central
system for all activities relating to the implementation programme. Information
is collated from a number of sources, validated and applied to the database. A
number of applications exist to input, manipulate and extract rollout
programme information.

The Rollout database receives information from a number of defined sources.
Relationships between activities is defined in the database such that when
information is applied an automatic series of generated events is created. All
the external links, communication routes, security and integrity of the data is
documented in the Access Control Policy ( Ref. [7])

Users are defined on the database and they provide updates and / or
information relating to activities assigned to them. As such Users can confirm
when activities are completed.

Failure to meet certain specified criteria results in alarms being raised.
This section summarises the following;

e Inputs to the database;

© Outputs from the database;

¢ Views of the database

For release 1b the rollout database will not be used as the main controlling
system for the preparation activities on the 190 outlets. The rollout database
however will be introduced during the life cycle of release 1b as follows;

¢ Parallel operation of the release 1b outlets, to test the various inputs, outputs
and operation of the database

e Preparation in readiness for the implementation of release 1c outlets

The manual processes used for release ib, through the use of EXCEL
spreadsheets and MS WORD documents will reflect the planned operation of
the rollout database as described in the following sections.

Inputs to the database.

Inputs are provided from four sources.

This mechanism is key to the management of the rollout programme. Key
activities are defined as events using the rules of the database. The timing of the
events is derived from the implementation schedule (see section 6) for which
Planned Date and Time are derived. As activities are completed inputs to the
database populate the Actual Date and Time. Associated with the event is a
Date Range by which the event must be completed by. Should the activity not
be completed within the specified date range of the Planned date then an alarm
is raised for which action must be taken.

Administration of the database includes User set up and their rights, Archive
facilities, Version control.

Amending data on the Rollout database.

The Rollout Database provides ICL Pathway, Suppliers and PDA with the ability
to monitor and perform the Horizon implementation activities. As such Users
may read the data through a number of predefined interfaces. Data, however,
can only be amended on the database through one of the following interfaces.

¢ Through use of a predefined interface. This interface only allows fields on the
database to be amended once verification has taken place.

e Through a Change Control process. this process is internal to the
implementation rollout. The Change Control mechanism allows Users of the
database to request changes through an accountable mechanism. This is
detailed further in section 6.

¢ Through the Pathway Administrator. This is a special user who has write
permissions through a controlled interface to amend fields on the database.
It is this user who will apply Change Controlled amendments to the
database.

¢ Through the Database Administrator. This user has the ability to amend,
maintain and repair the database through special database administration
tools.

Each user is controlled through an administration tool which governs the access
on the database. Users are restricted to update access on fields determined by
use of the administration tool.

Outlet Identifiers.

In order that each Outlet can be tracked during the rollout a unique identifier
in the rollout database is established. The identifier is derived from information
relating to its location, as identified below.

© The database reference for each Outlet is a unique key. The key is an
allocated number in the range 1-40,000 which is associated with individual
offices. This reference is an internal identifier which is only within the
database.

e An additional key is also associated with each Outlet based on the FAD code
( the Post Office identifier for Outlets). The rollout project will refer to this
code as the Post Office Code.

Post Office Code format.

The Post Office Code is used during the implementation programme is a
unique reference which relates to the Post Office Identifier and Outlet Type.
The format used is:

123456AAA,

The format of the code and its use is explained in the following example
Example - Outlet with FAD Code 123456 and 4 counter positions
The Pathway Post Office Code format for this Outlet is

123456001.

This is the Outlet identifier used in the rollout process. The identifier is
translated to a bar code and is installed during the Implementation
process. It is this code which is scanned by Exel during the Asset
information gathering phase.

12345600101 - 12345600104,

These codes are used during the Implementation process. The identifiers
are translated into bar code format and are installed on the Base Unit at
each Counter position. It is this code which is used during the
Configuration stage of the Implementation process. For each Outlet
sufficient codes are produced to allow for 24 nodes in the Outlet.

Details of the production of Bar Codes and their distribution is documented in
the Bar Code strategy ( Ref. [9]).

Physical connections.

The Rollout database is located at ICL Pathway site at Feltham. Each User
outlet is connected to the database using an ISDN connection from a PC
located within their own environment.

Two interfaces exist; online access and batch updates.

Online access provides Users of the rollout database with the ability to view
events on the database.

Batch updates provides the interface for data flow between those databases
specific to Suppliers used to control their own operation during the rollout
programme and the rollout database and is summarised in the diagram below;

Overview of the Implementation process.

The implementation of the Horizon Counter infrastructure is controlled by the
Pathway Implementation Team. This section provides an overview of how the
implementation programme is managed and covers the following topics.

e Structure of the Pathway Implementation Team
¢ Overview of the implementation process

¢ Management of “Drop Offs”

Structure of the Pathway Implementation Team.

The Pathway Implementation Team has been constructed to cover all aspects of
the Horizon Counter infrastructure rollout activities. This structure is defined
together with the Roles and Responsibilities in the “Rollout Stage Management
Plan” (Ref. [1]).

Overview of the implementation process

There are over 19,000 Outlets to be visited as part of the rollout of the Horizon
platform. To control an implementation programme of this size requires that
the Outlets are grouped together and implemented in controlled stages.

To facilitate this, Outlets are grouped in to four Pathway Implementation
Programme Regions. Within the IP Regions the Outlets are grouped in to
Implementation Units associated with the Benefit Agency Districts. So for the
rollout programme, Outlets are managed in Implementation Unit stages.

The delivery of a Horizon Counter system to an Outlet involves the inter-
working of a number of Organisations and teams under the control of the
Pathway Implementation Team. Each are responsible for a specific set of
activities which collectively result in the successfully implementation of the
counter system.

Organisations involved are;

e D2D - who are responsible for the testing and packaging of the Horizon
Counter equipment.

¢ Peritas - who are responsible for the delivery of training and awareness
events.

¢ Workplace Technologies Ltd - who are responsible for providing the
infrastructure within the Outlet to support the Horizon Counter equipment.

¢ PDA and POCL, who are responsible for managing the interface between ICL
Pathway and the implementation of the Horizon infrastructure for the Post
Office.

Preparation for release 1b

This section describes the implementation process and timescales for national
rollout. The programme is controlled through the rollout database.
Development of the interfaces for the database mean that for the first 190
outlets in release 1b, the programme will operate without the rollout database.
The implementation programme will therefore for this release be controlled
through the use of spreadsheets and manual reporting schemes replacing their
corresponding sections that are available through the rollout database.

To test the processes operate correctly some parallel operation of the rollout
database will occur with the manual processes.

Additionally the timescales mentioned in this section refer to the target
operational timescales for national rollout. These timescales are reduced for
release 1b to ensure that the programme runs to a target live schedule agreed
between PDA and ICL Pathway.

Implementation Programme

The implementation programme comprises four main groups of activities.

The Preparation activities are those necessary to prepare outlets ready
for the Horizon Counter equipment.

The Implementation activities are those relating to the physical
installation of the equipment.

The Post Implementation activities are those relating to the
migration and acceptance of the Horizon platform.

The Movement to Steady State Support are those activities which
result in the movement of the Horizon platform into Steady State
Support

This is summarised for an Outlet in the diagram below.

Post Implementation Activities

To successful manage the implementation activities in an Implementation Unit
requires that the number of Outlets and the time scales in which the activities
take place are monitored. For the Implementation of the Horizon platform the
workable Implementation Unit comprises 75 Outlets and operating over a
maximum of 5 working days. This has been calculated as follows;

Average number of Outlets implemented each week = 300
Number of IP’s = 4
Number of outlets per working week per IP = OB}

To prepare the environment and the User in readiness for the delivery of the
Horizon environment activities are planned relative to installation date, day o.
These activities may take place either on a specific working day relative to the
installation day or within a_ specific working week relative to the
implementation week.

Activities associated with a specific Outlet are tracked through the rollout
database (see section 5). Information is passed to and from the rollout database
during the implementation life cycle. The tracking of the activities occurs
through the generation of schedules reports and alarms which are targeted at
specific users.

Initial population of the rollout database.

For the rollout activities to be managed as Implementation Units, the rollout
database has to be initially populated with details of all the planned Outlets.
This is a one off initialisation activity which is carried out at the beginning of
the programme.

Post Office details which include the addresses, telephone numbers and the
number of counter positions is provided to Pathway by Post Office
representatives. This is applied to the rollout database from which an initial
High Level Design rollout schedule is produced. This schedule is used by all
parties involved in the implementation action as a planning tool.

Implementation Unit Schedules

The rollout of the Horizon Counter system is scheduled by grouping Outlets in
to Implementation Units. As each stage starts, schedules are extracted from the
database, for each IP region. These extracts are derived from the HLD rollout
scheduled dates.

These stages allow the practical management of the rollout programme.

¢ Version 0.1 is sent to all suppliers to review. Comments are co-ordinated by
Pathway for inclusion on the schedule. This version of the schedule is the
first Baseline 1.0, STATUS PLANNED and is produced at -110 days relative to
the first outlet implementation.

¢ Version 1.0 is used to control the rollout programme for the particular
Implementation Unit. The schedule of activities allows for some dates to be
negotiated with Outlets as to the most convenient time, providing the
activities occur within certain windows. Dates are set and confirmed during
the telephone call to arrange the Site Survey process at week -13. At this
point the schedule is baselined again as version 2.0, STATUS BASELINED
and is produced during -week 10 relative to the first outlet implementation.

Management of Change

During the implementation programme, changes will occur to planned
activities. Changes are controlled through the rollout change management
system, which is based on the standard ICL Pathway / POCL change
management system. As changes to dates in schedules, impact initially teams
involved in the rollout program, the circulation lists are limited to PDA, RLM’s,
ICL Pathway Implementation Team and suppliers. The change management
process also involves the establishment of a Change Review Board for the
implementation process.

6.2.10 Scheduling Priority of Outlets.

The rollout processes encounters many categories of Outlet types during the
implementation of the Horizon counter infrastructure. There are a number of
inter-relationships between these categories which dictates the order in which
Outlet types are implemented within an Implementation Unit. Activities in
Outlets are scheduled to meet the optimum time for the Outlet. For example
activities in the Outlet need to be avoided on the busiest days such as Thursday
mornings.

The rules detailed in this section of the document have been developed with
Post Office representatives as the optimum day and time for different types of
Outlets.

Outlets are categorised from POCL by Account type. The following table
provides details of these Account types.

e Account type - The Post Office Account Type of an Outlet.
e Abbrev - The Abbreviation of the Account Type

‘Scale Payment Sub Office Cash Account SPSOCA
‘Community Credit Stock Office COMMCSO

The following guidelines are to be used for determining when Site Survey, Site
Preparation and Installation activities can take place in Outlets.

¢ Activities should not take place in adjacent Outlets at the same time.
This allows Post Office customers to access services from a nearby Outlet

should any disruption occur at an outlet during the implementation
activities.

This information is available from the rollout database.

6.3. Outlets which fail to meet target dates

When Outlets are contacted to confirm the target Site Survey, Site Preparation
and Installation dates, circumstances may be encountered which do not allow
the target dates to be met. This may be for a number of reasons. The schedule
of activities has been produced to allow rescheduling of some events within
specific defined time scales. These are as follows;

e Site Survey activities
e Site Preparation activities
Site Install activities.

The times for these are arranged during the telephone call made during week 1
to the Outlets in the Implementation Unit. If contact is not made directly with
the Outlet at the first attempt, three further attempts are made before
escalation procedures are invoked.

For the Site Survey and Preparation activities rescheduling is allowed providing
the rearranged day occurs in the same working week. Where the date cannot be
rescheduled within this period, then escalation procedures are invoked.

For the Site Install activities WTL may establish during the phone call an
alternative date (providing this occurs within the same working week) which is
confirmed with Exel before agreement with the Post Master. Where the date
cannot be rescheduled within this period, then escalation procedures are
invoked.

In all cases the amended date is applied back through the rollout database.

In all situations where escalation procedures are invoked, the Outlet STATUS is
changed to SUSPEND.

6.4 Management of Drop Offs

Occasionally situations arise during the implementation life cycle at Outlets
which require the focus of the Implementation Team. Examples of these
conditions are;

e Outlets which have a STATUS of SUSPEND for over 24 hours.

e Alarms are raised from the rollout database for Outlets where activities have
failed to meet a planned date.

¢ An Outlet has been classified as category C (see section 4) and requires
Pathway approval continuing with the work.

e An Outlet is closed, for example by Post Office Auditors.

¢ Site Preparation work can not be carried out without a Landlords permission
which has not been obtained within the planned dates.

Each situation requires consideration based on its own merit.

To ensure these specific Outlets are managed with the correct visibility an
option is available within the rollout database to move the Outlet outside of the
default manageable unit of the Implementation Unit to be managed as a
Sundries item.

Reports relating to the Sundries schedule can either be produced on request by
nominated users of the database, or generated on a regular basis the frequency
of which is determined through the administration tool. The default values for
these reports is as specified in below.

Report User Frequency
Sundries Schedule Pathway Rollout Weekly
Manager
Sundries Outlet Pathway Rollout Ad - Hoc
Manager

The objectives of the rollout programme are to keep the number of Outlets
which are managed as sundries items down to a minimum. Where situations
occur that require an Outlet to be managed as a sundry the escalation routes
are described in section 6.5. Where the problem in the Outlet is due to
problems encountered during the Site Survey or Preparation activities then the
escalation route will involve transferring the Outlet to managed initially
through the WTL Sundries manager who interfaces will the ICL Pathway
Central management team and PDA to resolve the issue.

Interfaces and Escalation Routes.

Management of the rollout is dependant on the establishment of good
communication interfaces. When problems are encountered escalation routes
are required such that sufficient management focus is applied to the problem
area to determine the correct resolution.

To achieve this problems encountered during the rollout are managed through
the interfaces described below;

e ICL Pathway suppliers use one interface (known as the rollout help desk) to
register problems. The help desk is responsible for the escalation within the
ICL Pathway organisation.

¢ Each IP region is managed through ICL Pathway IP managers. IP Managers
interface directly with Post Office Regional Liaison Managers for each IP,
through verbal, schedule meetings and written correspondence. IP Managers
are responsible for the day to day operations of the rollout and initial
management of problems encountered during the rollout specific to their
area.

¢ Central management team, who are responsible for initial management of
schedules and for problem escalation.

Details of the escalation routes is documented in the lower level working
practices produced on the acceptance of this document.

7 Version Control of Horizon Hardware and Software

To ensure that the Horizon platform that is delivered to an Outlet is the same
as that which has been tested in the Test and Integration environment, both the
hardware and software is controlled.

The hardware and software release description is documented at each Release
through the Counter Systems Release Baseline definition document. The
document which is produced by the Verification Centre, is authorised by
Pathway Software Development manager and the Test & Integration manager.

This section describes the processes involved in establishing that control.

7.1 Software Baselines.

The Horizon Counter system is delivered to Outlets installed with a baseline
hard disk installed with a generic release of software. This section describes, at
high level, the processes involved in the production and management of
baseline disks.

The Base Unit hard disk is pre loaded before the system is packaged and
shipped with a Configuration Management controlled release of software. This
software is an approved version having passed the appropriate Pathway Quality
Control procedures. This control is applied to all aspects of software used on
the Pathway platform from the operating system through to the Horizon
Counter applications.

¢ The collective group of software is known as a software RELEASE. The term
RELEASE used in this section will refer to this group of CM controlled
software.

e The RELEASE of software once applied to a Base Unit disk is then known as a
BASELINE.

This BASELINE then becomes the MASTER copy and can then be used to build
“copies” of this disk which are created during the packaging of new Counter
Base Units.

A High Level overview of the processes used to control the generation of a
BASELINE is shown in the diagram below.

¢ The control and production of BASELINEs is carried out by the Verification

Centre.

¢ The copying of the BASELINE on to the Base Unit disks is carried out by

D2D.

7.1.1 Production of a BASELINE.

BASELINEs are produced by applying a RELEASE of software together with any
specific BASELINE software to a disk which becomes the MASTER copy.

BASELINE software is that which is required on a system to allow the initial

connection to the Auto Configuration server.

At release ib the Auto

Configuration server will not be used and therefore there is no specific
requirements to add any additional BASELINE software. An overview of the
processes is shown in the diagram below.

e The Verification Centre use the scripts to build the BASELINE disk.

e The BASELINE disk is then tested and validated using a set of pre-defined
test scripts. This set of tests ensures that the Counter environment operates
as expected.

Additionally the BASELINE is supplied to Pathway Test & Integration who
perform end to end testing of the BASELINE.

¢ On completion of the testing cycle the BASELINE is passed to CM for
control. The BASELINE is allocated a version number. This is different to the
RELEASE version number.

e A series of scripts are then created which are used by D2D during the
copying process. The script’s are tested and passed to CM for registration.

¢ The scripts and MASTER BASELINE together with the D2D build scripts are
used in the production cycle.

Creating a new BASELINE.

During the rollout programme it is expected that new RELEASEs of software
will be required in the Post Office network. These may be to introduce new
functionality or simply to fix problems experienced during live use. As such
there is a requirement to create a new BASELINE during the rollout

Hardware BASELINEs.

All hardware used in the Counter environment is controlled through the
modification status or revision levels associated with the hardware. These are
registered for each set of equipment comprising the Horizon environment with
Pathway Configuration Management.

Equipment manufacturers are required to notify ICL Pathway of all hardware
revision level changes. Processes are established by which these changes are
assessed for their impact before registration with CM and their introduction to
the rollout programme.

All changes to the manufacturing state of hardware are assessed by the
Verification Centre before the equipment is allowed to be implemented as part
of the rollout programme.

8 System Build & Configuration

This section provides details on how the equipment that comprise Horizon
configuration are built, tested and packaged ready for delivery to a specific
Outlet. A number of processes are involved to deliver this functionality.

1. Preparation activities
© Overshipper equipment contents are defined by ICL Pathway.
¢ Test routines are prepared and scripted by the Verification Centre

¢ Configuration scripts and parameters are prepared and scripted by the
Verification Centre.

2. Order activities
¢ Initial forecasts for Horizon equipment are provided to ICL Pathway by D2D.

© Confirmed orders for Horizon equipment are provided to ICL Pathway by
D2D.

e Equipment is delivered to D2D.

¢ Overshipper requirements for D2D.

3. Collection activities.

¢ Equipment is packaged in an Overshipper
e Equipment is collected from D2D by Exel

These are described in more detail in the following sections.

8.1 Overshipper contents.

The contents of each of the Overshippers, also known as the Bill of Materials,
are defined by ICL Pathway. The list comprises all the items that are required to
build a configuration in an Outlet. There are several versions of the
Overshipper contents which map to the 5 categories of Outlets defined in
section 4. This is required to cater for the different models of Touch Screen
monitor that are used in the implementation programme.

8.2 Equipment test routines.

All equipment is tested prior to packaging in the Overshipper. The test scripts
for each item is prepared by the Verification Centre. Where equipment items
have configuration switches, or where equipment has pre configuration menus

associated with them, these are checked to comply with the Configuration
Controlled requirements. Again these are scripted by the Verification Centre.

As each Base Unit is tested, the correct baseline software is applied to the disk,
which also includes the Baseline scripts and configuration items. The process is
scripted by the Verification Centre.

All scripts generated for the test routines are registered with ICL Pathway
Configuration Management. As changes or amendments are made, these are
controlled through the normal Change Management routines.

Initial forecasts for Horizon equipment

Initial forecasts for equipment comprising the Horizon counter system are
passed to equipment suppliers by ICL Pathway. In order that suppliers are
aware of the potential numbers of systems required to satisfy the rollout, initial
forecasts are obtained on a weekly basis. D2D supply the forecast figures based
on information from the rollout database. The rollout database figures are
converted to build figures which are submitted to ICL Pathway.

This consolidated information forecasts the number of Horizon systems based
on the number of counters, Back Office Systems and printer type supplied by
POCL. These figures are translated into Overshipper equipment contents by
ICL Pathway. It is these forecast figures which are provided to the equipment
suppliers at various triggered dates providing initial estimates of +/- 20% of the
target.

Confirmed orders for Horizon equipment

Confirmed figures are supplied by ICL Pathway to equipment suppliers such
that confirmed orders are placed. The figures are estimated to be within +/- 12%
of the target. These figures are determined by D2D to ICL Pathway based on the
Build figures determined from the rollout database.

The true number of systems is confirmed during the Site Survey process (see
section 9).

Equipment Delivery

The equipment items ordered using the process detailed above arrive at D2D.
The equipment is checked into the storage area and the confirmed numbers
supplied back to ICL Pathway. This equipment is used to build the target
Overshippers for delivery to Outlets.

8.6 Overshipper requirements and packaging

The requirements for Overshipper types is passed to D2D by ICL Pathway. The
rollout database figures supplied at this point are based on confirmed figures
supplied on the Rollout database after the Site Survey process and bear the true
requirement for the target Outlets.

The Overshipper types are derived from the rollout database figures of Number
of Counters, Back Office System Flag Printer type and Release number. The
report generated translates these figures to Overshipper types based on the
rules of the database. To assist with build process the report provides a
consolidation of all the Overshipper types required in Outlets whose target
installation date is 25 working days ahead. This information is extracted on a
working day basis.

As such D2D are presented with a requirement for a quantity of Overshipper
types as detailed in section 2 built to a specified Release number.

As the Overshippers are built in this release they are configured with
configuration information relating to the specific outlet and counter position.
This is applied during the build process using scripts provided by the
Verification Centre. Each Overshipper is then labelled with Bar-codes
indicating the Overshipper type, serial number of the Overshipper and the
Release Number, together with a label indicating the target office counter
position and number of Overshippers in the consignment.

Once the Overshippers are built they are moved to a buffer area ready for
collection a minimum of 10 days before Outlet installation.

8.6.1 Overshipper Release Number

All the Horizon equipment hardware and software is controlled through the
Configuration Management system and is controlled through the Release
Number. Scripts controlling the software builds is detailed in section 7. The
mechanisms for controlling the hardware builds passed to D2D is documented
in section 7.

8.7 Overshipper collection.

Exel are responsible for collecting Overshippers from D2D ready for the
Installation Process and may collect the Overshipper types for Outlets up to a
maximum of 5 days before installation.

As part of the collection process Exel supply Overshipper requirements
information on a quantity basis

Rollout database requirements.

The following activities are monitored through the rollout database and hence
for release ib manual report sheets, as part of the System Build and
Configuration process.

e Forecast numbers are passed to D2D for a weekly build schedule to be
produced

¢ Version number of the software is checked at -30 working days before
implementation

¢ Exel supply serial numbers of equipment to D2D who pass back through ICL
Pathway to the Steady State support services.

Equipment Spares.
The Exel installation engineers are equipped with sufficient spares to support
the rollout programme. The following conditions apply;

e Where a Base Unit is identified as faulty during the Implementation
activities all the equipment belonging to the Overshipper is exchanged with
a new Overshipper of the same type and Release state.

¢ Where another item of equipment fails during the Implementation activities
only the faulty piece is exchanged with a replacement item of the same type
and Release state.

The number of spare items is calculated at the start of the rollout programme.
These are based on figures provided by Exel and D2D to Pathway.

Consideration is made for the management of the following;

¢ Introduction of hardware and software baselines and the support of two
releases.

¢ Recovery and replacement of failed items on installation.
¢ Recycling of spare systems during the implementation period.

¢ The use of spare equipment and systems at the end of the implementation
rollout.

Escalation Routes

Problems encountered during the System Build and Configuration process are
reported through the Horizon System Help Desk. The Horizon System Help
Desk are responsible for assignment and ownership to these problems within
the ICL Pathway Implementation Team.

Site Survey & Preparation

This section provides details on how the Site Survey and site Preparation
functions are carried out. At all times these activities are scheduled and planned
to cause the minimum disruption possible to the operation of an Outlet.

Site Survey

The Site Survey function is the operation that is performed at each Outlet. Its
purpose is to gather enough information in a visit such that the Horizon
Counter infrastructure can be implemented.

The trigger for a Site Survey to take place starts from the dates planned on the
Rollout database. For release 1b the information is transferred via Exel
spreadsheets and an Access database to provide the information shown below;

¢ Post Office name and Address, Post Code & Telephone number

e Actual date for the Survey and the Planned Preparation and Installation
dates (See section 5).

¢ Outlet Account Type (See section 6).

¢ Number of Counters, as provided by POCL (this number requires
confirmation during the Site Survey process), whether a Back Office system
is required and the Printer type.

¢ Communication circuit type.
¢ Acode which indicates any existing equipment in the Outlet.

This information is used by WTL to establish initial contact using the name and
number supplied.

To allow the Horizon environment to be installed a number of preparation
activities must take place. The purpose of the site survey is to identify the
amount of work that is required and prepare a document which is used by
WTL, Energis ( using BT as a sub-contractor ) and Exel during the Site
Preparation and Installation phases. The Site Survey process also allows the
distribution and collection of User training information, used later on in the
implementation cycle.

Initial contact with the Outlet is by telephone call to arrange and schedule the
Site Survey date with the Office Manager. The date that is arranged is then
confirmed by letter. Accompanying the letter is a training letter which requests
information on the number and names of staff at the Outlet. This is collected
when the Site is visited as part of the survey.

The site survey identifies the following items.

e Details of the power distribution and how it is used.

e Where the additional power is required to support the Horizon
infrastructure. This is 6 electrical sockets at each counter position, together
with a further 6 sockets where a Back Office system is due to be installed.

¢ The location and capacity of the electrical distribution board box and
condition (where this is possible ) of the existing wiring is noted.

¢ The physical condition of the existing electrical wiring is noted.

e A location for the communications link is identified and marked. This point
is located as close as possible to the Horizon gateway server.

e The classification of an Outlet based on A B C as described in section 4 of
this document.

¢ The physical layout of the existing counter positions are noted including all
sizes relating the existing counter positions, door apertures, and access
points to the Outlet. This is agreed with the Office Manager.

¢ The proposed locations of the Horizon infrastructure at the counter
positions is noted. This includes the location of trunking, power supplies
and the LAN cabling.

¢ The physical preparation activities such as where holes are to be drilled in
the work area to locate remote cables is noted.

e Any other environmental restrictions, such as obstacles in the Outlet which
may prevent easy access to the counter position are noted.

¢ The authoritative signature in the Outlet to allow the work to go ahead.
¢ Confirmation of the Site Preparation and Installation date and times.
¢ Parking restrictions around the Outlet.

¢ The Office Manager is reminded that a mutually convenient time between
the WTL engineer and the Outlet Manager during which power can be
turned off during the Site Preparation activities will need to be agreed at the
time of the Site Preparation. This is to allow the connection of the new
electrical sockets which are required for the Horizon equipment.

Outlet Managers are also reminded that the loss of power during the Site
Preparation Process will initiate the requirements for the Post Office Outlet
recovery procedures that will need to be invoked.

In certain Outlets this set of activities may result in the replacement of the
existing distribution board. Connection of incoming electrical supply is the
responsibility of the local electricity company, however this is arranged
through WTL.

e Whether the Outlet may require any additional work such as draw
modifications or shelves to support the Horizon equipment. Where this

occurs, additional surveys may be required in order to determine the work
involved.

The rules for the positioning of the equipment, cabling layout are detailed in
the Implementation Strategy, i.e. this document.

The details collected at the Site Survey are documented in a Survey Pack. This
will eventually comprise a detailed description of the Outlet in the form of a
CAD drawing and a narrative. However in order that late changes identified
later in the process, such as cable re-routes, the CAD drawing is not produced
until after the Site Preparation activities. During the Site Survey process, a
dimensional sketch is made of the Outlet which is translated into a CAD
drawing after the Site Preparation activities.

The dimensional sketch and the narrative provide sufficient information to
allow the Site Preparation work to be carried out. The documents work on the
assumption that a different Site Preparation engineer can use the information
to carry out their tasks without having to refer back to the Site Survey engineer
to qualify any part of the preparation. Examples of the level of detail required is
summarised below.

¢ The dimensional sketch shows the positioning of the equipment with respect
to the counter positions and any of the existing equipment that remains. The
drawing labels the counter positions in accordance with the strategy detailed
in section 3 of this document. Details of the cable routes and the location of
any existing equipment remaining together with the position of any
proposed re-location.

¢ The narrative provides details of existing equipment to remain, Weigh scales,
the re-positioning of any equipment in the Outlet which has to occur on
installation, and any other restrictions agreed with the Post Master regarding
the installation.

On completion of the Site Preparation work the sketch is translated to a CAD
drawing with an accompanying narrative. Copies when completed are sent to
ICL Pathway and Exel’ for use later in the rollout programme. The documents
contain a high level of sensitive information. Documents are securely stored
and controlled at all stages of the implementation cycle.

All Site survey activities must be completed in one day with one visit.

In addition to the WTL site survey, Energis ( using BT as a subcontractor ) are
also required to establish the detail of any work required at an Outlet. Where
access to an Outlet is required as apart of their site survey, then this is arranged
by Energis to coincide with the day of the WTL visit.

Authoritative signature.

To allow any site preparation work to be carried out in an Outlet, the identified
work must be agreed at the time of the Site Survey. WTL obtain from each
Outlet an authoritative signature. The Outlet manager is made aware of this
requirement during the User awareness events. This person must satisfy the
following criteria;

e Where the Outlet is owned by the Outlet manager, as is the case with some
Sub Post Offices, then the authoritative signature is the owner of the
building.

¢ Where the Outlet is rented from a Landlord, then the authoritative signature
must seek the Landlords permission for the work to be carried out to act as
the authoritative signature.

For a majority of the Outlets visited under the rollout programme, details of
whether Landlords permission is required for the work being carried out may
not be determined until the Site Survey process. This, together with details on
Outlets located in listed buildings, is covered in the following sections.

Landlords Permission and Listed buildings.

Post Office Outlets are located at a variety of locations. These vary from those
buildings which are owned by the Outlet manager, to those located in large
shopping complexes or those located in buildings which are rented through a
Landlord. In addition to this some Outlets are located in Listed buildings and
therefore potentially require special permission before any installation work can
be carried out.

Listed buildings

The amount of physical work that can be carried out in Listed buildings is
controlled by planning regulations. Additional restrictions may be further
imposed through local conservation groups. In order that the impact on the
work required for the implementation of the Horizon platform is assessed
before the rollout occurs, WTL will contact the Heritage Societies for advise.

Where special permissions are required in Post Office Outlets located in Listed
buildings, this will be the responsibility of the Outlet Manager to obtain the
appropriate consents. WTL will assist in this process by acting where required
on behalf of the Subpostmaster.®

Outlets which fall in to this category are managed as Sundries Offices, which
require special attention.

9.1.2.2 Landlords permissions

9.2

Before any Site Preparation work can be carried out in some Outlets which are
not owned by the Post Master, Landlords permission may be required.

For those Outlets owned by the Post Office, or are part of the Post Office
Multiples scheme, Landlords permission will be sought at the beginning of the
rollout programme. To try and prevent any potential delays which this process
may identify for these Outlets, WTL will make the first contact with these
Landlords outlining the type of work involved to obtain permission. The list of
these Outlets is provided by Post Office representatives at the beginning of the
rollout programme.

For those Outlets which do not fall in to the above categories, the issue of
whether Landlords Permission is required is only determined at Site Survey
time. The following diagram is used to determine the appropriate action that is
required for Outlets which fall in to this category.

e ICL Pathway approval has been obtained for a Type C Outlet, where
appropriate.

¢ An authoritative signature has been obtained, for the work to go ahead.

e All the appropriate Landlords permissions and/or Listed building
permissions have been satisfied.

The Site Preparation activities are carried out by WTL and BT on the same
working day.

Site Preparation work conforms to all the current electrical and
telecommunications standards. As changes occur to these standards, they are
reflected in the rollout working practices through the Change Control
mechanism.

All the equipment, materials required for the Site Preparation activities are
provided by WTL in advance of the work being carried out.

The following sub sections summarises the activities that are carried out.

Physical counter position

The counter position environment is prepared, as identified at the Site Survey,
for the installation of the Horizon counter equipment. In summary this involves
some or all of the activities below;

¢ 6omm holes are drilled in the counter position to allow the equipment cables
to pass between the top and underside of the desk. Protective grommets are
fitted to these holes to prevent damage to any cables passing through them.

80mm holes are drilled in counter positions to allow the office printer cable
to be passed through, where this is required. Protective grommets are fitted
to these holes to prevent damage to any cables passing through them.

e Additional storage units such as shelves are installed to support the Horizon
equipment. These shelves may be installed to move any existing items from
the counter position creating the appropriate space for the installation of the
Horizon equipment.

e Additional equipment mounting units, such as monitor support arms are
installed.
Local Area Network and Data Cabling

In multi positioned Outlets, additional Local Area Network cabling is installed
as identified at the Site Survey. In summary this involves some or all of the
activities below;

¢ Intwo counter position Outlets a dual UTP RJ45 fly-lead is installed between
the two counter positions. The cable is installed in trunking between the two
positions as appropriate.

e In three or more counter position Outlets, one or more modular Hubs are
installed. These are located in an enclosed environment, through which the
appropriate cabling is returned. All cabling is retained in position using the
appropriate cabling ties and installed in trunking between positions as
appropriate.

¢ Sufficient inter counter position cabling is installed to allow the Horizon
equipment to be installed and moved on the counter position without
causing strain on the cables.

e Where two or more hubs are installed to support the counter positions in an
Outlet, the appropriate inter-Hub link cabling is installed.

¢ Cables are installed from the Hub to the counter position as described in
section 4 of this document.

All standard cabling is pre tested by the manufacturer. Cabling which is
installed and physically terminated in an Outlet is tested as part of the Site
Preparation activities.

For Outlets installed with ISDN a UTP cable is installed in the appropriate
trunking between the physical location of the ISDN box and the Horizon
gateway server.

Electrical installation work

All electrical work identified for the Horizon equipment will be installed where
appropriate. Where this is identified at Site Survey use of any existing wiring
infrastructure is made. All the new wiring and electrical sockets are returned to
the electrical distribution box at the Outlet and is separate from all other
electrical cabling infrastructure. Existing cabling runs are utilised where
possible for the installation of the new electrical wiring in Outlets. In summary
this involves some or all of the activities below;

¢ Installation of a minimum of 5 power sockets at each counter position to
support the Horizon infrastructure. Where appropriate these sockets will all
be co-located. In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to locate
individual sockets at various locations.

wiring infrastructure.

In circumstances which result in the distribution board being replaced, the
connection to the existing supply is carried out by the local electricity
company. This is arranged at Site Survey time to coincide where possible
with the Site Preparation activities.”°

To facilitate the additional power requirements in an Outlet it is necessary to
switch off the power. This may impact the business operation of some of the
Outlets. This activity is agreed with the Outlet Manager as to a convenient slot.

The existing electrical cabling is also tested at the time of installation of the new
cabling. If this cabling or the electrical safety of the Outlet is found to be
dangerous then there is duty of care requiring immediate notification to be
made to the post master and to the POCL. In situations where this is found, ICL
Pathway will be notified immediately. The appropriate escalation procedures as
detailed in section 9.5 of this document are then invoked.
