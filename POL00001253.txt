[This has already been investigated and fixed under PC0128264. The amended script was dropped into the 1

(the active group) on 17th Nov.

In 28th Nov the groups toggled and 111111112 be

came active. This group does not seem to have the fix in. I have replicated (F/3417/2

e will soon be another toggle (for the back to

lb) wether further action is needed to include the fix in the 1

should be avoided.

Have spoken to the PM and explained what is going on.
