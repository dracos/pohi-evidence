Subject: Fujitsu Witness Evidence - Issue Resolved

Paula,

When we met on Monday, you kindly offered to help us unlock the reluctance of a Fujitsu employee, Steve Parker,
from being a witness in the March 2019 Horizon Issues trial.

Fujitsu have been very supportive in trying to get Steve to give his evidence despite personal reasons for not wanting
to be a witness (his reluctance has nothing to do with the substance of his evidence). They did however need
something more to underscore to Steve just how important his evidence is to our case and, for that matter, to
Fujitsu’s reputation as a supplier of IT systems.

I am pleased to say that the prospect of your involvement seems to have done the trick.

Steve has now agreed to provide his evidence, and we will work with Fujitsu’s service and legal teams to finalise it. In
doing so, we are offering to Steve the full support of both Post Office and Fujitsu legal teams, and the same specialist
witness training we have given to all of our Post Office witnesses.

Thank you very much for your support in making this happen, which is greatly appreciated by the whole team.
Rod
