Pete,

Presumably, if data were available for 2010, the number of ‘hotfixes’ would include the “62 Branch Anomaly”
referenced in the Second Sight Report?

- Subject to Legal Privilege

Similarly, I presume the 2012 numbers include the “14 Branch anomaly”? and 2015 numbers include the “Forced Log

Off” anomaly (or would this be included in 2016 if the fix occurs in March 2016?)

Also, do you have a timescale in mind for when you think you will have managed to bottom out whether any of these

affected branch accounts?

We are still working on that other piece of work that we spoke about yesterday, but that should be with you in the

next hour or so.

Purely the data we had available. There is no formal definition of what goes into a hotfix it is a term to represent the
fact that this issue was deemed important enough to require a fix before the next maintenance or change release is
scheduled.

Thanks Pete, is there a particular reason we have gone back as far as 2011 and not, for example, 2010 and the
introduction of Horizon Online?

Also - is there a ‘formal” definition of a hot fix I can use —I know you have provided an explanation previously, but I
just wondered if there was a specific formulation of words I should use?

Have the data on the number of hotfixes:

2015 6
2014 1
2013 4
2012 3
2011 4

So far I do not have the detail to confirm the exact nature of the fixes so cannot confirm if they had any material effect
on branch account but will investigate further.

Are you able to do a quick search tomorrow morning please, to see if you are able to locate your original reply? I think
it is most likely to have been in an email to Mark Westbrook, Gareth James or Andrew Whitton.

Bill has pulled out the information relevant to answering the question asked. In a very concise brief answer, all of this
is covered through the sampling, document review and testing of the controls that Fujitsu has to meet for each of the
standards and audits it is subject to.

Hi Pete
Yes, we have, as it is part of the PCI overview and ISAE3402 and 1SO27001 audits and in each, a clear review of the
segregation of duties of the staff concerned takes place.

Each of the individual (SME’s) are audited against this as one of the criterion for the above audits:

e Architecture and Design of the Audit System - Gerald Barnes

e Security Operations team are only able to extract data only as part of a formal request from Post Office
(Operational Security Team) — Steve Godfrey

e User Management Requests and reviews — (Operational Security Team) — Steve Godfrey

e User Management implementation — (Windows Team for Active directory) — Michael Green

e User Management — (Integration of Windows AD with Unix authorisation PAM) Paul Stewart

e The Unix team in Belfast manage the Infrastructure of the audit servers (Paul Stewart)

e The Event management manage the way that event are automatically sent to the audit server from Tivoli
(John Bradley)

The best Technical overviews of how the system work comes in a diagram that John Bradley has regards events and
how they are moved to the audit server and the HLD documentation and verbal explanations given by Gerald Barnes.

Recent Audits have used the following documentation:

Technical:
e —DES/APP/HLD/0029 Audit Data Retrieval High Level Design
e = DEV/GEN/MAN/0015 Audit Extraction Client User Manual
@ ~— DEV/INF/ION/0001 Archive Server Configuration

- Subject to Legal Privilege
Pete,

Season’s greetings. Thank you for meeting with Jonathan Swift QC and Christopher Knight from 11KBW on Monday,
especially at this busy time of the year.

I understand that one of the matters raised during your meeting concerned the security setting on the Audit Store’s
physical hardware (Centera), which because it is not set at its maximum level, makes it theoretically possible for
administrators to delete data from the Store during the seven year retention period. Apparently, this could allow
suitably authorised privileged staff in Fujitsu to delete a sealed set of baskets and replace them with other sealed
baskets.

I also understand that this risk should be largely mitigated by the unique sequence numbers (JSN’s) recorded against
each basket transferred to the Audit Store, and the digital seals applied to protect them.

This then leaves a risk that someone with the requisite access rights to the ‘digital keys’ used in the sealing process
and admin access on the Audit Store could theoretically:
* Delete an audit store record (after extracting it to review the specific JSNs it contained);
* Recreate the transactional data that was originally within that Audit Store file to suit whatever purpose they
might have (using the JSNs in the original file they have subsequently deleted).
* Seal it using the correct key to generate a valid seal value.
* Reinsert it into the database (requiring the database of seal values to be altered as well to make this change
FUJ00238269
FUJ00238269

undetectable).
There would also be the added complexity that the transactions themselves (within a sealed Audit Store file) are also
digitally sealed via digital signature.

The outstanding question therefore was whether anyone had or has the requisite access rights to the Centera boxes
and rights to key management to be able to exploit this.

I understand this question was passed to Bill Membery around May 2014 for clarification (e.g. is this controlled by
having the requisite segregation of duties between key management and the Centera boxes?). Do you know if Bill
was able to do this?

Please let me know if this would be easier to discuss in the first instance.

Kind regards, Rodric
