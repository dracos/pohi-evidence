Dear Avene
Thank you for this. The meeting is confirmed, and James is looking forward to it.

The usual rigmarole applies — can Paula and her colleagues please call me on reaching reception at Portcullis House, on
extension! nd my colleague Susanne Charlett will come and collect them.

Many thanks
Yours ever,
Janet

Hi Avene
This is really good news. Thank you and please thank Paula for making this date.

James wondered whether she would have any objection if Alan Bates attended. Might you pass this to her and let me
know? James was keen that she hears what he has to say, as well as that of the other MPs.

I will forward a proposed agenda in due course.
Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Avene

Thank you for this. James is content to have a word but he would prefer to meet Paula face to face and wants
other MPs to join him, namely Oliver Letwin, Andrew Bridgen, and Mike Wood. So, a preliminary and brief
word tomorrow would work well but he does want a meeting subsequently.

Shall we say 3.30pm, Tuesday 28 November for a phone conversation for half an hour? And what number is
best to reach Paula on at that time, please?

James is being contacted by the media and will need to speak to them soon. He wants to speak to Paula before he talks

to them. Can you please fet Paula know this as a matter of urgency? In addition, we know that Ron from Second Sight is

Dear Janet,

Thanks for your email and vm yesterday. Paula is actually on leave this week so has not seen the letter yet. I will ensure
she sees it on her return on Monday. November is looking very congested at present, so I will need to speak to Paula to
see what we can shift in the diary to accommodate a meeting, so can you please leave it with me and Ill give you a call
once I have spoken to Paula on Monday.

Many thanks and we’ll speak next week.

opportunity to arrange. I must let you know that we are now receiving calls from numerous journalists about the
