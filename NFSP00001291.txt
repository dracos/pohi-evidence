Subject: National Savings Payment Advice
Dear Anita

Haltwhistle Post Office has this week suffered a £4000 shortage because a £2000 payment advice was recognised by the
Horizon on-line system as a £2000 deposit.

Could you confirm that the business has addressed this urgent issue and the problem will not be repeated. Could you also
reassure me that all payment advice transactions over this period will be investigated to ensure that no Subpostmaster has
suffered a shortage, no matter the value.

Best regards

Dave
