Definition

Aseries of tests to measure the performance characteristics and behaviour
of specific components of the solution under load to demonstrate their ability
to achieve defined performance requirements. For example, to test that a
particular web service is capable of supporting the relevant contractual peak
rate of transactions per second (the defined load).

Volume Testing

A series of tests to demonstrate that the whole solution is able to support a
typical daily workload. For example, to test that a peak weekday transaction
profile can be successfully harvested and that all scheduled batch

o VOLUME AND PERFORMANCE TEST REPORT - PHASE 2 “i
FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

The Volume and Performance High Level Test Plan [2] outlined a 2-phase approach using different test
environments:

>» Phase 1 on the VI (Live rig) in IRE11 prior to pilot.
> Phase 2 on the VOL rig in IRE19 post pilot
This is the Test Report for Volume and Performance testing only, as executed during Phase 2.

Phase 2 Test Cycles were periods of testing interspersed with rig build activity to introduce new Data
Centre and Counter releases.

This report provides a factual statement on the test status metrics at completion of Phase 2. The status of
particular Test Cases and any associated defects can be ascertained from the Quality Centre system.

2 Scope
This report is solely concerned with the Phase 2 Volume and Performance test activities and is not
reporting on the rig build activities that occurred before and during the period,.

The main objectives of Phase 2 Volume and Performance testing focussed on those test areas that must
be completed prior to full rollout. In essence, this concentrated on demonstrating performance
characteristics for a fully migrated branch estate at HNG-X with no Horizon elements. In addition, prior to
commencing the formal performance tests, HNG-X ‘calibration’ testing was performed so as to provide
comparison with the benchmark performance characteristics gathered in Phase 1 on the V&l rig. This
was to demonstrate that the VOL rig had live-like characteristics to support the validity of all testing
conducted during Phase 2.

The test outputs of Phase 2 testing supported:
o SVP (Small Volume Pilot)
o MVP (Medium Volume Pilot)
o —HVP (High Volume Pilot)
o AG4 (Acceptance Gateway 4)

HNG-X calibration test

3.1. Test Approach

There were 3 planned Cycles of test iteration for Phase 2, run out of IRE19 and BRAO1 within a
dedicated VOL test environment. SSC Workstations in Bracknell were used to connect to the Data Centre
and BRA01 platforms.

3.1.1 Cycle 1
Cycle 1 started on the Sth February 2010 and formally finished on 26th February 2010.

The original aim of Test Cycle 1 was to provide supporting evidence that from a performance perspective,
the HNGX Release 1 solution was capable of supporting Medium Volume Pilot (MVP) and High Volume
Pilot (HVP). Delays in starting Cycle 1 meant that the test outputs derived would only have real value in
informing Programme Management decision making concern HVP.

Test coverage during Cycle 1 was limited and a number of key issues were identified during the cycle.
Specific details of coverage and issues identified are documented in the separate Cycle 1 Test Report
(NB: This was an informal document that only reached draft status and is not registered in Dimensions. A
copy is available on request, though any important information of relevance is included in this report.).

Following review by the Test Management team, it was decided to curtail Cycle 1 in order to upgrade the
rig to Release 01.08.03.10A. The main reasons for curtailing the cycle was due the high number of
patches and fixes that had been applied to the Live estate and the difficulties of identifying performance
related hot fixes that had been applied to LST. The value being obtained from the test runs was
diminishing. In order to re-establish a clean and known position, the C1/C2 rig top up was brought
forward.

As a result of the solution issues identified by the key defects/peaks identified during cycle 1, the
conclusions drawn were:

. MVP would be able to proceed, albeit at reduced Branch numbers. This was because the
transaction level of the MVP branches would not exceed a transaction rate of 500 tps.

. HVP would be able to start as the solution would support up to 1500 Branches. However it
could not complete until fix resolutions to the key defects/peaks identified above had been
proven on VOL and LST and were available for release into the Live estate.

3.1.2 Cycle 2
Cycle 2 started on the 1t March 2010 and formally finished on 25" March 2010.

Following a live incident resulting in Red Alert status being raised, the attention of VOL testing was
switched to supporting the investigation and resolution of issues emanating from the Red Alert. In effect,
therefore, the planned VOL Cycle 2 testing was abandoned. No separate Cycle 2 Test Report was
produced.

3.1.3 Cycle3

Following conclusion of Red Alert testing, VOL Cycle 3 commenced on 18" June and formally finished on
28"" July.

In light of the abandonment of Cycle 2, the stress tests targeted for Cycle 3 were modified to demonstrate
conformance of contractual and design limit volumes as part of those tests, and a number of tests
previously completed successfully during Cycle 1 were also repeated in consideration of the significant
number of solution updates introduced since completion of Cycle 1.

A test review identified and prioritised the specific planned tests required to be completed to support
AG4. These were completed on 27" June 2010 to enable AG4 decision to start full live roll-out on 30!
June 2010.

Additional tests over and above those specified in the HLTP were also included in Cycle 3 following the
test review. These included

. 9 day soak test (running at Peak load for an extended number of days)
. test against Egenera recommended changes

. test against a single C-blade

. test with constrained DB Caching

. test with node failure and reintroduction of failed node during on-line day
. tests for various ORM configuration settings

Monitoring and measurement of Streams behaviour was also captured throughout Cycle 3 and Peak
clearance.

3.1.4 Peak Clearance Cycle

This Cycle focussed on specific testing of further Peak fix deliveries, and other additional tests requested
by Development and Capacity Management to help confirm understanding of system behaviour and
identify optimal performance settings. This Cycle also included regression testing of BRDB performance
following the introduction of new blade (v249) hardware.

3.4 Conclusion

A significant number of performance and capacity related issues have been identified and resolved
throughout VOL testing. Additional testing over and above that specified in the HLTP has also been
conducted to support further ‘tuning’ of performance characteristics. As at completion of Cycle 3, testing
has demonstrated ability of the solution to support full contractual and design limit workloads for each of
the service types under test. Stress testing has also identified the headroom capacity to support future
growth in business volumes.

Some Peaks remain open which would deliver further performance improvements. Whilst desirable, they
are not deemed critical to be able to support current live volumes.

5 Test Case Details

This section provides a more detailed view of each Test Case executed for each of the Test Groups
during Phase 2. For many of the tests, several iterations were run during the different test cycles
following application of fixes for defects raised, or other upgrades to system components (software and
hardware). The results shown in this section are for the latest iteration of each test case concerned.

However, for the main BRDB load tests, results are shown for execution of these tests against both old
and new blade hardware for comparison.

The results detailed are the ‘front-end’ view in terms of transaction rates, response times and error rates.
Performance metrics of the key system components were also gathered from analysis of Athene data for
each test. The detailed information and graphical view of Athene data is not shown in this report due to
the sheer volume of information. Instead, a simple summary statement of any key observations is made
where appropriate. Full Athene analysis is available for any given test on request.

5.1 Test Group XCAL — HNG-X Calibration Test

The objective of the ‘calibration’ test was to run a reduced basket mix of HNG-X transactions, but at
reasonable volumes, in order to capture performance metrics of the V&l rig using Metron Athene Data
gathered for the period of the test run. The same tests would then be performed on the VOL rig to help
understand any environment differences and how this could affect interpretation of performance results

The following sections detail the results of the calibration tests as performed on the VOL rig.

An initial test was performed for EPOSS transactions only, before later attempting a more representative
basket mix.

5.1.1. HNG-X Calibration - Simple EPOSS

This test comprised of simple EPOSS transactions (selling a stamp) only and the conditions under which
the test was run are the same as during Phase 1 on V&l as follows:

There were 16 OSR instances in total, with 2 OSRs running on each of servers BALOO1 —
BALOO08.

There were 4 BRDB nodes available.
The bandwidth was throttled to 256Kbps from the load generator to the ACE Blade.
All messages were compressed.

The 400 branches used in the test were spread across the fad hashes to generate an even load
across the 4 BRDB Nodes.

The incremental rate of transaction volumes during the run was as follows:
150 tps (across 150 branches) for 15 minutes, then increased to
200 tps (across 200 branches) for further 15 minutes, then increased to
300 tps (across 300 branches) for further 15 minutes, then increased to
400 tps (across 400 branches) until the end of the test.

Throughout this test run, transaction response times were good and similar to those witnessed during
Phase 1, with just 29 transaction failures out of a total of 1.6 million

5.1.2 HNG-X Calibration - Simple EPOSS for MVP

An additional Simple EPOSS test was also run at the request of the Performance Architect. This was not
previously run during Phase 1 on V&l, but was considered useful for gaining an indication of likely
performance during live medium pilot.

The environment conditions under which the test was conducted was the same as in section 4.1.1 with
incremental rate of transaction volumes as follows:

100 tps (across 275 branches) for 30 minutes, then increased to
300 tps (across 550 branches) for further 30 minutes, then increased to
650 tps (across 1000 branches) until the end of the test.

Again, throughout this test run, transaction response times were good apart from a brief ‘spike’ 1 hour 15
minutes into the run during which 165 transaction timeouts occurred out of a total of 1.9 million. This
demonstrates acceptable performance at a rate of 300tps expected during pilot, but a potential issue at
higher rates which will be further understood during the formal performance testing at peak rates.

5.1.3 HNG-X Calibration - Basket Mix

The following calibration tests were run under similar conditions as during Phase 1 as follows:
There were 16 OSR instances in total, with 2 OSRs running on each of servers BALOO1 —

BALOO8.
There were 4 BRDB nodes available.

The bandwidth was set to maximum between the load generator and the ACE Blade.

All messages were compressed.

All branches used in the test were spread across the fad hashes to generate an even load across

the 4 BRDB Nodes.

All banking transactions were submitted for agent hash value 1, meaning that only the capo_b,

al_b and link_b services were handling transaction load.

An outline of each iteration is shown in the following sections. In each table, the value shown for Txn/sec
is the total number of transaction records per second for each service type, including settlement
transaction (i.e. the number of transactions addressed to the BAL layer). The values shown for Auth/sec
is the number of actual requests that would be forwarded to each relevant Authorisation service. The end

column shows the median number of transactions per second successfully authorised for banking, debit
card and ETU services.

During each of the following tests, there was a gradual decline in successful authorisations for debit card,
with dropped connections between the OSR services and the DCS agent being observed (Peak Ref
PC0194218). Similar failures were also observed with connections to other banking services. Further
analysis of the DCS agent showed an issue with saturated CPU, with a single thread (NX_NQ_DCS/47)
running at 100% CPU. This is the same behaviour as was observed during similar tests for Phase 1. In
effect, therefore, this verified that the VOL rig was comparable to the V&l rig as a starting position and a
suitable environment against which to diagnose the issues observed and to enable Phase 2 testing.

5.5.1 PAF Stress Test

This test was covered by Test Group X10 (Track and Trace Stress test) as each transaction request for
that test required a PAF lookup to be performed. The test was performed against a single PAF Web
Server (as opposed to 2 servers which would share the load in live).

The objective of this test was to take the PAF service beyond Design Limits up to a rate at which either

a) the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum.
headroom capacity limit, or

b) anotional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would
demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute
breaking point

The target transaction rate for this test was 100tps and this was achieved with capacity to spare. The
PAF Web Server CPU peaked at 15% utilisation during the test.

Some of the business transactions are routed to additional online services. This applies to NBS, DCS,
ETU, DVLA, PAF and APOP,; it does not apply to EPOSS, APS and Settlement which just update the
Branch Database.

These online business services are subject to additional overall contracted volumes and design limits for
the combined total over any contractual period (this is less than the sum of all the services). These are

Batch Processing:

There were a number of issues encountered during the test run which caused the overall batch suite to
overrun. However, investigations confirmed that these issues were rig specific. Allowing for the
constraints of the test environment causing certain schedules to take a long time to complete (due to
compressing large files to a ‘dummy’ NAS share set-up on VOL), it was determined that the overnight
batch would complete in good time in the live environment before start of the next trading day. All of the
actual data processing schedules completed in good time.,

Asummary of processing times for some of the critical overnight batch processes is as follows:
Aggregation Schedules:

5.8.2 Debit Card & ETU Stress Test

The Debit Card Stress Test and ETU Stress Test were combined as a single run.

The objective of this test was to take the Debit Card and ETU service beyond Design Limits up to a rate

at which either

a)
headroom capacity limit, or

b)

the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum

a notional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would

demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute

breaking point

The target transaction rates for this test was 100tps for Debit Card and 20tps for ETU and this was

achieved with capacity to spare. The transaction rates were run at the contractual and design limit rates

on the way to achieving the end target rate.

These tests are covered by the combined Debit Card and ETU stress test. See section 5.8.2 for detailed
test results.

5.13 Test Group X10 — HNG-X T&T

5.13.1 HNG-X T&T Contracted / Design Limit Peak Hour / Peak 5
Minutes
These tests are covered by the T&T stress test. See section 5.13.2 below for detailed test results.

5.13.2 HNG-X T&T Stress Test
The objective of this test was to take the T&T service beyond Design Limits up to a rate at which either

a) the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum
headroom capacity limit, or

b) anotional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would
demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute
breaking point

Target rates for T&T are not specified in ARC/PER/ARC/0001 and the rates detailed in PA/PER/033 have
since been increased. The target rates below are as specified by Capacity Management Team.

TaT* spec'd spec'd 43 43 52 52 52 100 I 92.31%

HR% above is the sustained tps rate % increase over and above the Design Limit Peak 5 min rate

The transaction rates went through the contractual (43tps) and design limits (52tps) up to a maximum of
100 Track and Trace transactions per second. As part of the script, PAF lookups and settlements were
carried out as well; so taking into account all parts of the different transactions (XML) taking place, an
overall hit rate of 400tps was achieved which equates to 100 T&T transactions per second..

The target rates were achieved with excellent response times and no failures. The graph below shows
the overall transactions rates achieved and the response times.

The BDB to NPS feed kept up to date with the transaction load. The last batch of transactions was
passed to NPS at approximately 17:25. The non-online part of processing, by the TTEDGInt agents
running on the FLG platform, continued clearance of the backlog to complete update status by 19:17

The table below gives a view of transaction status in the NPS database at various points. It includes a
few snapshots over the last 20 minutes of the test to demonstrate the total transaction rate from the BDB
feed keeping up, and then continued snapshots until all processing by the FLG agents is completed.

5.14 Test Group X11 —- BAL & BRDB

Earlier iterations of BAL/BRDB testing at design limit transaction load identified a number of concerns
with regard to system utilisation and memory usage. Whilst the target transaction rates were achievable,
response times were sometimes erratic and performance characteristics of the BRDB were at
undesirable levels, which in turn had a knock-on effect at the BAL layer. A number or patches and
performance improvements were implemented, but upgrade of the pblades hosting the BRDB nodes to
v249 blades demonstrated a considerable improvement such that performance concerns have been
eliminated.

The transaction rates and response times shown in the following sections are those for the iteration
performed against all 4 BRDB nodes operating on the new v249 blades. However, to demonstrate the
significant improvement in system performance, graphs have been included to illustrate system metrics
gathered by Athene for comparative tests run against the old blades and against just node 1 on a new
v249 blade.

5.14.1. BAL & BRDB - Start of Day Profile

This test had a high transaction rate with ‘counter’ logins/logoffs occurring throughout the run. The
transaction types included EPOSS, Banking, Debit Card, E-TopUps, DVLA, PAF, Postal Orders, Bureau
and Postal Services. The scenario had a target rate of 1074 transactions per second on average which
equates to 498 settlements per second.

5.14.1.1_I BRDB Performance Characteristics

The following graphs taken from Athene data captured, show a comparison of selected system
performance characteristics for the following comparative test runs:

TestID 200 — with all 4 BRDB nodes on the original pblades (NB: ORM was OFF for this run so it is not
an entirely fair comparison, but does still serve to highlight the main differences)

TestID 230 - with only BRDB Node 1 on new v249 pblade, others on the original pblades
TestID 247 — the test reported above with all 4 BRDB nodes on new v249 pblades

In regards to test 247, there were no capacity constraints anywhere in the system and the results were as
expected. In comparing this test with TestID 200 and 230, the significant difference was the BDB memory
profile and CPU Utilisation. There is a lot more free memory available post-upgrade, thus alleviating
swapping on the nodes, and CPU utilisation is lower..

5.14.2 BAL & BRDB - Mid-Day Profile

This test subjected the BAL/BRDB layers to a very high load for over an hour. The transaction types
included EPOSS, Banking, Debit Card, E-TopUps, DVLA, PAF, Postal Orders, Bureau, Bill Payments
and Postal Services. The scenario had a target rate of 1393 transactions per second (average) which
equates to 829 settlements per second

The table below is a summary of the test; showing the response time (min/avg/max/90th percentile) for
each transaction and also the number of transactions which ‘passed & ‘failed’. The response times were
good and the number of failures were low; 25 logoffs failures which was due to a data issue with the user
details for those particular branches, and not a genuine issue. There were no other failures.

Test Status: Passed

Date of Final Run: 13'" August 2010 at 12:57 to 14:08

Build Release: 01.22.00 / OSRs at 01.23.01.00 (all 4 BRDB nodes on new v249 blades)
TestID: 248

5.14.2.1_I BRDB Performance Characteristics

The following graphs taken from Athene data captured, show a comparison of selected system
performance characteristics for the following comparative test runs:

TestID 183 - with all 4 BRDB nodes on the original pblades
TestID 231 — with only BRDB Node 1 on new v249 pblade, others on the original pblades
TestID 248 — the test reported above with all 4 BRDB nodes on new v249 pblades

In regards to test 248, there were no capacity constraints anywhere in the system and the results were as
expected. In comparing this test with TestID 183 and 231, the significant difference was the BDB memory
profile and CPU Utilisation. There is a lot more free memory available post-upgrade, thus alleviating
swapping on the nodes, and CPU utilisation is lower.

5.14.3 BAL & BRDB - End of Day Profile

Since version 0.1 of this report was issued, this test has been re-run following delivery of an informal fix
for PC0201529 (High CPU usage results when running Group Reports). To illustrate the significant
performance improvement delivered by this fix, the results shown below provide a comparison of TestID
254 (after the fix was applied) and TestID 249 (before the fix was applied).

This test was run after the data loading tasks were fully completed. The test includes the Group Reports.
with other single reports and with a background transaction load.

The reports component had a selection of ‘single’ reports and ‘group’ reports (see table below). It should
be noted that the ‘Reports’ in red below are not strictly reports but other end-of day activity.

The following multiplication factors apply to the group reports:
1 x 2700_CWMTX_RPT is equivalent to 8 single reports, and
1 x 3100_CDCUT_RPT is equivalent to 10 single reports

The test produced excellent results with good response times and throughput. Comparing with Testld 249
there was a significant improvement in every respect for both the reports and declarations as well as the

background transaction load.

The graphs below show the Total Transaction Rates for the test. Spikes of up to 1100/sec was achieved

for Testld 254 compared with 750/sec in Testld 249.

The graphs below show the transaction rates for the Reports and Declarations (cash/stamp/stock) and
demonstrate up to 160/sec at points in the test. Taking into account the multiplication factors of the Group
Reports then the overall rate is equivalent to up to 345tps for reports, and around 65tps for the
declarations. This compares with an equialent rate of 148-158tps for reports and 35-37tps for

The Improvement at the BAL layer has resulted in increased throughput and lower CPU Utilisation which
is excellent - a two-fold improvement. The knock-on effect of removing the bottleneck at the BAL layer is
that there is now additional load at the BDB layer. CPU Utilisation has gone up as a result of increased
packets/in and where we were previously seeing ~10% utilisation in TestID 249, we are now seeing just

under 50% in TestID 254. This is illustrated in the following section 5.14.3.1.

Test Status: Passed

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

The following graphs taken from Athene data captured, show a comparison of selected system
performance characteristics for the following comparative test runs:

TestID 212 - with all 4 BRDB nodes on the original pblades
TestID 232 — with only BRDB Node 1 on new v249 pblade, others on the original pblades
TestID 249 — the test reported above with all 4 BRDB nodes on new v249 pblades

In regards to test 249, there were no capacity constraints in relation to the BRDB and the results were as
expected. In comparing this test with TestID 212 and 232, the significant difference was the BDB memory
profile and CPU Utilisation. There is a lot more free memory available post-upgrade, thus alleviating
swapping on the nodes, and CPU utilisation is lower. During this test run, there was an outstanding issue
with high CPU Utilisation on the BAL servers for processing Group Reports (PC0201529)

TestID 254 — a repeat of TestID 249 after applying an informal fix for PCO0201529 to address the High
CPU utilisation at the BAL servers.

In regards to test 254, there were no capacity constraints in relation to the BRDB and the results were as.
expected. In comparing this test with TestID 249, the significant difference was the increase in
Packets/In, thus indicating that the bottleneck had previously been at the BAL layer. CPU utilisation also
increased in line with Packets/In

5.15 Test Group X12 — BAL & BRDB Stress Test

5.15.1 BAL & BRDB Stress Test

The objective of this test was to take the workload of the BAL and BRDB layers beyond Design Limits up
to a rate at which either

a) the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum.
headroom capacity limit, or

b) anotional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would
demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute
breaking point

This test gradually increased the load until all Loadrunner VUsers were running and was maintained for
30 minutes before ramping down. The ‘mid-day’ transaction mix was used for this test, which was run
with all 4 BRDB nodes on the new v249 blades.

The limiting factor in this test was the number of LoadRunner VUsers available. A higher throughput
could have been sustained had it been possible to generate a greater load on the system. However, the
throughput actually achieved is well above design limit and demonstrates significant headroom capacity

each transaction and also the number of transactions which ‘passed & ‘failed’. The response times were
good and the number of failures were low; 25 logoffs failures which was due to a data issue with the user
details for those particular branches, and not a genuine issue. There were no other failures.

5.16 Test Group X13 — Logon / Logoff

5.16.1 Logon / Logoff Contracted / Design Limit Peak 5 Minutes

The test target was to achieve 100 logons & Logoffs per second (i.e. giving 200 business operations per
second), which is the design limit target. Transaction rates were ramped up as follows:

50 login/logoff per second for 5-minutes.
60 login/logoff per second for 5-minutes
100 login/logoff per second until test stopped.

Each logon comprises 3 x XML requests and each logoff comprises 2 x XML requests so the total
hits/sec when running at full load was 500.

Due to limitations of the test tooling available, it was not possible to design a test that would do all logons
or all logoffs to test each individually. The above scenario was therefore considered to be a reasonable
compromise.

The test was run against only 3 active BRDB nodes and for longer than it needed to be, so as to give
added confidence that the rates could be sustained. The response times were acceptable and there were
only a very small number of failures..

5.16.2 Logon / Logoff Stress Test

The objective of this test was to take the user logon/logoff service beyond Design Limits up to a rate at
which either

a) the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum.
headroom capacity limit, or

b) a notional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would
demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute
breaking point

The ceiling target rate for the test was to attempt to reach 300 logons plus 300 logoffs per second for a
combined total 600tps. The actual rate sustainable before the response times increased and the
throughput struggled was 170 logons plus 170 logoffs per second.

Each logon comprises of 3 x XML requests and each logoff comprises of 2 x XML requests. The load was
increased steadily throughout the test but began to struggle at just below 900 hits/sec, The equivalent
combined 340tps sustained is well in excess of design limits. There were no failures.

5.16.3 Maximum Concurrent Sessions

The objective of this test is to have 30,000 counter positions logged onto the Data Centre.

Over a period of time, logon of 30,000 counter positions was attempted and there were 241 failures.
However, this test is somewhat irrelevant because having 30,000 counter positions logged in does not
mean there are 30,000 open sessions from the BALs to the BRDB. The maximum number of sessions
possible at any one time is 20 (the max osr connections parameter) multiplied by 16 (number of active
OSRs during the test) multiplied by 4 (BRDB nodes) which equals 1280 concurrent connections. This has

5.17.1 Reports Contracted / Design Limit Peak 5 Minutes

These tests are covered by the Reports stress test. See section 5.17.2 below for detailed test results.

5.17.2 Reports Stress Test

This test was run twice; firstly with ORM ON (TestID 198) and then repeated with ORM OFF (TestID
199).

The following report types were included in the test. These comprise of 2 or 3 XML requests.

Report Type Description
7800_CDCHL_RPT Counter Daily Cheque Listing
2100_BALSS_RPT Balance snapshot
2400_OFFSS_RPT Office snapshot
2800_CSH_DEC Cash Declaration
2900_STK_DEC Stock Declaration
3000_STP_DEC Stamp Declaration

For each report type, branches were logged on, the report repeated 10 times and branches then logged
off.

The transaction rate sustainable versus the contractual and design limit was as shown below. The peak
reporting period is relatively short each day, therefore values are only specified for the peak 5 Minutes

5.18 Test Group XCB — HNG-X Combined Banking

5.18.1 HNG-X Combined Banking Contracted / Design Limit Peak Hour
/ Peak 5 Minutes

These tests are covered by the Combined Banking stress test. See section 5.18.2 below for detailed test
results/:

5.18.2 HNG-X Combined Banking Stress Test
The objective of this test was to take the Banking service beyond Design Limits up to a rate at which
either

a) the service is no longer able to support the transaction load and thus identifying the maximum
headroom capacity limit, or

b) anotional transaction rate (as agreed with Capacity Management) such that, if achieved, it would
demonstrate sufficient headroom capacity for future growth without needing to find the absolute
breaking point

The ceiling target rates for the test were as follows.

Basket Hits/sec I Auth/sec

NB: design limit values for LINK are incorrectly stated in ARC/PER/ARC/0001. The numbers here are as
advised by Capacity Management and are derived from those specified in PA/PER/033

For CAPO, whilst a rate of 225tps was sustained (exceeding the Design Limit for Peak 5 minutes of
192tps), an actual per second peak of 260tps was achieved (exceeding the Design Limit for actual per
second peak of 250tps)..

Analysis of Athene Data showed no bottleneck in terms of the system performance characteristics of any
of the system components. Instead, the limitation was confined to the performance capability of the agent
code. However, each banking service type individually and combined exceeded the respective design

limits.

Lessons Learned

The usefulness of the VOL testing should not be underestimated. For example,. many examples
of “timing” issues were found during VOL testing that could not otherwise have been identified.

Original project plans did not make sufficient allowance for volume and performance testing. The
test cycles were ‘squeezed’ only for reality to bite later.

Expectations of performance testing was sometimes unrealistic; The team were often requested /
expected to run tests for other teams at ‘the drop of a hat’ without prior warning or planning. On
occasions the requests were not supportable as appropriate test data could not be prepared in
the time available.

During the early stages of testing in particular, development of counter changes invalidated the
prepared Loadrunner test scripts and rendered them unusable. This resulted in considerable re-
work having to re-capture the XML that forms the basis of the scripts. Later developments tended
to be backwards-compatible.

Whilst testing achieved the aim of understanding the performance profile of the solution, it is not
possible to truly replicate behaviour of a live estate due to the considerable variances in day to
day activity, the complexities of the solution, and the limitations of test tooling. Expectations in
this respect sometimes needed to be managed.

In some cases, the limitation of available Loadrunner VUser licenses constrained the amount of
load that system components could be subjected to.

8 Recommendations

o Consider upgrade of the pblade for BRS to v249:
The performance improvements demonstrated on the upgraded BRDB nodes suggests that an
upgrade of the BRSS would further improve Streams performance.

o Review ORM configuration settings for min / max servers:
Anumber of ORM configuration settings were exercised during the Red Alert testing phase with
settings of Low=7 and High=16 being selected for deployment into the Live estate. Once the
new hardware v249 blades were available, further ORM configuration testing was conducted
including with ORM switched off. The Technical Review group concluded that the optimal
configuration settings were Low=16 High=32. TestID:240-246 record the ORM test results.

During the tests above, ORM did not activate at all. The Technical Review group were unable to
identify a test which would “force ORM to invoke”. It is felt that there is a degree of risk in terms.
of not being able to observe the solution behaviour of ORM activating on the new hardware. It is
recommended that further reviews of the need for ORM are conducted with a decision to

(a) switch off ORM, or

(b) remain with the current settings, or

(c) change the settings to the optimal determined during TestID:240-246.

NB: Further to the above, the settings have now been changed in ‘live’ to settings of
low=16 and high =32. This was applied by MSC043J0277083 on 15'" September 2010.

o Review OSR min /max connection settings:
Tests have been conducted with various min / max connection settings up to 30 / 30. The optimal
settings should be considered in light of the test results observed.

NB: Further to the above, the min connection setting has now been changed in ‘live’ toa
value = 20. This was applied by MSC043J0277111 on 17" September 2010.

o Update Operations Support Guide for re-introducing a previously failed BRDB node during
the on-line day:
If a previously failed node is to be re-introduced during the on-line business day (the current
recommendation in the Operations Support Guide is to only reintroduce a node overnight), then
careful consideration needs to be made as to the potential impact on service. The amount of time
it will take for live service to recover from either a node failure or reintroduction of a node, will be
higher or lower depending on the transaction load at the time. Also, in terms of reintroducing the
node, recovery time will depend on how long the node has been down. This is because the
longer an oracle instance has been unavailable, the more time it will take to go through a re-
mastering exercise with the other nodes. This has an impact on the node performance and will in
turn impact the transaction load it can process. A FadHashRefresh on the BAL servers to pick up
the reintroduced node should not be performed until re-mastering activity on the BRDB nodes
has completed. The Operational Support Guide should be updated to note all relevant
considerations when re-introducing a node.

o Implement Egenera recommended configuration settings:
The Egenera recommended configuration settings aimed at preventing BDB node evictions (as
proven by Peak testing against PC0197725) should be applied to the Live estate at an
appropriate time during Release 2 timescales. The possible exception being the changes to CPU
affinity.

o Consider upgrade of all BAL servers to v216
The current BAL server estate is a mixture of v216 and v411 servers. Testing has demonstrated
that the v216 servers have double the processing capacity of the v411 servers. At peak

transaction volumes, as the 411's reach saturation, the amount of packets they take in stops
increasing. The 216's having double the power, can take in double the amount. This leads to an
in-balance of workload across the estate at peak volumes

Consider life without VOL

Future performance testing or modelling capability should be carefully considered, not only for
future releases but also in support of ‘live’ as full rollout continues to maturity.

9 Conclusions

A significant number of performance related issues have been identified and resolved throughout VOL
testing. Additional testing over and above that specified in the HLTP has also been conducted to support
further ‘tuning’ of performance characteristics. As at completion of Cycle 3, testing has demonstrated
ability of the solution to support full contractual and design limit workloads for each of the service types
under test. Stress testing has also identified the headroom capacity to support future growth in business
volumes.

Some Peaks remain open which would deliver further performance improvements. Whilst desirable, they
are not deemed critical to be able to support current live volumes.
