Strictly Private and Confidential ~ Subject to Legal Privilege

Hi Steve
Yes it does thanks.

However I’m far more concerned about the outstanding enquiry relating to the receipts & payments problem back in
2010 where we have two branches (113459 & 122946) who appeared on the initial list of branches but not on the list of
those resolved. We still have a large unexplained credit on one branch whilst we have recovered money from pay on
the other despite them recording a significant surplus at the time.

i need to be clear that there is no unresolved problem in case either branch appears in the ongoing Horizon integrity
review.

i know you have previously stated that a work plan was set up to do some further analysis on 122946 but POL requested
this not to proceed but | need to understand why they disappeared from the resolved spreadsheet.

Thanks

Subject: RE: Post Office Finance Service Centre enquiries.

Firstly please accept my apologies as I thought I'd sent this mail some weeks ago.

I think the question that Mr Winn and the Sub postmaster want answering is about the Paystation transactions
appearing on the Transaction Log on 20 August. The £500 discrepancy was mentioned on a TfS call from May
and Andy said that was not relevant.

So to answer the question about Paystation transactions

When Paystation data is received by Horizon, two things are done with it:

i. TA’s are created for each branch to accept when they next logon. When accepted, these will affect the branch
cash position and the branch should put in the Paystation cash in order to balance.

POL-0097599
POLO0098016
POL00098016

2. Individual transactions done on Paystation (the previous day) are inserted into the branch transaction table at
the data centre. The timestamp is the time the transaction was done on the Paystation. The first part of the
transaction ref is a high number (in this case 98) instead of the normal node number. The transactions are
settled to product 29494 Paystation +cash (long name Paystation +cash contra) ~ this does not affect the branch
cash holding.

This allows individual Paystation transactions to be included or summarised on various reports, and was
mentioned in an edition of Branch Focus.

So when they printed out the transaction log on 21" August, this included the Paystation transactions done on
the 20", which had been inserted into the branch transactions table on the evening of the 20",

| hope this covers your request, if there is anything | can assist with further please let me know

Hi Leighton,

I’ve just picked up a reply from an enquiry I made to Andy Winn in our Finance Service Centre (he has been on
leave) and disappointingly he has not yet heard anything from the contacts you suggested last month.

Can you escalate the enquiry on our behalf?

I would like to be copied in on replies sent to Andy — thanks.
