Final version attached.

This accords with my notes and is agreed. It has not been seen and agreed by AGQC but he will be in the depths of
Skeleton Arguments just now. So if our (yours & mine) recollection and sign off is sufficient, then the attached stands
as the record of the conference on the 18" and the call on the 20".

Kind regards

Tom

Tom

With apologies for the delay, please find attached the note of the telephone conversations with Lord Grabiner last
week. From the Board’s perspective they would like these as settled notes of the discussions — would you please
confirm that they now have this status?

Many thanks,

Jane
