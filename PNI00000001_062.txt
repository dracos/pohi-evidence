I checked the claims by taking each bundle of paid orders and calculating the totals of
the individual groups. I then checked my totals against the totals claimed by the
Subpostmaster. If the totals did not agree then I checked the individual paid orders
against the amounts recorded on list prepared at the Sub Post Office in order to

‘rota check’ of paid pension and allowance foils, despatched from the Clanabogan Sub
Post Office, for cash account weeks 26 to 30, periods ending 49/09/01 to 17/10/01, a

number of overclaims varying in value from £0.40 to £148.00 had been identified. The

results of the ‘rota check’ were summarised onto form 205A.The overclaims resulted
from values being claimed in add listings for which no pension or allowance foil existed.
Once aware of these discrepancies I arranged for pouches containing paid pension and

allowance foils despatched from the Clanabogan Post Office, to the Paid Order Unit

I have been employed by Post Office Ltd for a period of sixteen years . My current role

is that of auditor within the Post Office Ltd Security and Audit Team in Northern Ireland.
I have previous experience as a Horizon Field Support Officer and it is within my
working knowledge to explain the Horizon computer system installed in Clanabogan
Post Office and the payment of benefits through this system. The Horizon system is
basically a computerised accounting system with each counter position within the Post
Office having a computer terminal, a visual display unit, keyboard, barcode scanner and
printer. The system records all transactional data input by counter clerks during an
accounting period and provides daily and weekly records, enabling counter clerks to
produce a weekly balance of cash and stock on hand. All clerks are required to log onto
this system using their own unique password, which will appear on all Horizon
transaction logs and will thus identify which clerk conducted a particular transaction.
The hardware for the Horizon system is PC based and consists of the following

equipment: Processor - This is the ‘brain’ of the system. It receives information from

activity and has touch screen functionality. Keyboard - This can be used, as with the
touch - screen, to communicate with the processor. Bar-code Reader - The
reader/scanner is used to scan and read bar-codes on order books, and bar-coded
bills. Counter Receipt Printer - This is used to issue receipts to customers and to
produce some reports/summaries such as the weekly stop notice list for Pension &
Allowance payments, which as per instructions , must be printed at the close of
business every Wednesday. One copy is required for each counter serving position.
Office Printer - This is usually sited away from the counter wherever possible. It is used
to print reports such as Client Summaries, Cash Accounts and a variety of system
generated reports which may be produced daily or weekly. Each Post Office outlet has
a unique, 7 digit, Financial & Accounting Division (FAD) code which identifies an
individual Post Office outlet and is listed on all accounting documents i.e. Cash
Accounts, Client Summaries, Reporting Forms, Application Forms. Clanabogan Post
Office FAD code is 164714. This FAD code is also installed in the configuration of all
computers within an outlet and will appear on all paperwork/reports that are produced
by the system in that outlet. Post Office Ltd operates a system whereby all offices must
bring to account all of the transactions conducted over a period of a week as well as
declare the correct amount of cash and stock held at the close of business which
ultimately leads to the office ‘Balance’. This term is used throughout the Post Office

when referring to the weekly practice of declaring the state of the office accounts. The

accounting week for Post Office Ltd starts every Thursday morning at which time the
actual cash and stock physically held on site is known and forms part of the starting
figure used for accounting purposes for that week. Basically for every transaction
carried out by Clanabogan Post Office® branch the Post Office® receives either cash
or cheques from the customer and provides a service or product for it. Also the Post
Office® pays cash to a customer for which the Post Office® obtains some form of
‘paid voucher’ i.e. green giro cheque, bank cheque, pension & allowance foil etc, which
remains within the Post Office and is accounted for on the daily or weekly balance form.
The Horizon system keeps a running tally of all transactions conducted over the course
of the week and the operator is able to request various reports from the system at any
time to display the current state of the accounts, such as the cash on hand figure, or the
number of Pension & Allowance orders paid to date etc. These reports can be viewed
on the monitor or printed . On a Wednesday evening when the weekly office balance is
performed, the Horizon system is interrogated to provide a printout known as a ‘snap
shot’ which provides a summary of all of the transactions performed that week and
gives a breakdown of all of the cash and stock which should be on hand having taken
into account all sales and receipts through the system that accounting week. The
person who then carries out the task of balancing merely has to verify all of the cash
and stock on hand and input those figures into the Horizon system which should them
match the ‘snap shot’. A balance is reached when the figures for both the payments and
receipts are the same, any discrepancy in the two figures would result in the office

declaring a shortage or a surplus of cash in the accounts. Once the balance has been

completed, it is a requirement that two copies of the cash account are printed, these
cash accounts show summaries of all transactions conducted that week together with
the actual values of cash and stock to hand. Both copies of this cash account must be
signed by the Sub Postmaster as being a true record of the state of accounts of the
office, one copy is retained at the office and the second copy is forwarded to Post
Offices Ltd accounts section based in Chesterfield. All Post Office® transactional
information recorded on the Horizon system is transferred to ICL Fujitsu’s data retrieval
sites every day via Integrated System Digital Network (ISDN) lines. ICL Fujitsu are the
company who own and manage the Horizon system. Post Office Ltd pays Pension and
Allowances (P&A) on behalf of the Social Security Agency in Northern Ireland. Pension
and Allowances are also paid on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The Pension and
Allowances are issued to customers who are in receipt of various, typically long term,
benefits (e.g. Child Benefit, Retirement Pension, Tax Credits, Income Support,
Disability/Care Allowance) There is a manual stop notice system which directs the
Counter Clerk to stop, restrict, or recall the payment of order book based benefits when
deemed necessary by the data from the DHSS. Benefit books comprise of a cover and
contain a number of payment foils/orders. The cover shows the customer's/payee's
identity details and the Post Office® to which it has been allocated for payment. The
order book cover contains the following information: Customer/payee name and
address, Appointee or alternative details, if applicable, Nominated Post Office for
payment, Customer/payee reference number, A Common Payment Package (CPP)

Child Benefit Number or Family Credit temporary number, The serial number of the
order book, Additional order book indicator, where applicable. New order books are
usually posted to an office and are then marked in pencil with the date of receipt on the
front cover. If they are not picked up by the customer within two calendar months from
the date of receipt they are returned to the issuing authority. Stop notices are usually
mailed to the relevant office of payment; these come in the form of New, Recall,
Cancellation and Renewal notices. A local manual stop list is then amended accordingly
and communicated as necessary to any additional office staff. When a book is
presented at the counter for encashment the local stop list must be consulted to ensure
that the order book being presented is valid. The most common method of entry for
benefit foils to the Horizon System is using Product Look-up Numbers ( PLU no.). Each
type of benefit has a unique PLU no. which when in the customer service screen can be
keyed in to identify the benefit type. The amount is also keyed in, along with any milk
tokens (if applicable). The maximum number of foils that can be encashed from one
order book in any single transaction is thirteen. A daily Pension and Allowance
summary can be produced at any time during the current cash account period, which
will produce an adlist of all unsummarised dockets on hand for the particular stock unit
the user is attached to. This adlist is then used to compare foils on hand against the
data that has been keyed into the system. If there are any discrepancies the system
data must be changed to exactly reflect the details of the foils on hand and another
adlist printed and checked to ensure errors have been changed correctly. If the P&A

summary is correct or the errors have been corrected to reflect the foils on hand it may

then be cut off the system and the total of that adlist is then stored in the computer to
go towards the weekly balance. Any further P&A foils for the current cash account
period will be collated on a further adlist and the checking procedure carried out again
to ensure alll foils are verified as correct. At the end of the current cash account period,
all checked P&A adlists when totalled will agree with the overall total of Pension and
Allowance transactions on the Final Cash Account for the current cash account period.
All staff would have attended a training course prior to the installation of the Horizon
equipment in their office. They would also have been required to achieve the Minimum
Training Compliance by the end of the course and would not have been permitted to
operate the system until successfully attaining this. During the day of installation each
office would have had the support of a Horizon Field Support Officer (HFSO) to assist
with the changeover and assist with any teething problems. A full set of Horizon User
Guides are held at each Post Office outlet operating the Horizon system. If for any
reason either the whole office or an individual clerk is unable to use the Horizon system

due to a system failure, they are required to revert to manual operation procedures

stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true.

Tam employed as an Executive Officer, Grade I, by the Social Security Agency in the
Paid Order Unit (POU) at Lisahally, Londonderry. I have worked in the Unit for about
13 years. I am able to speak from experience and personal knowledge regarding the
Unit. The POU is a storage and retrieval facility for the Pension and Allowance
(P&A) foils, which are submitted by post offices in the United Kingdom at the end of
each accounting period. Exceptions are that foils which have group numbers 1 — 3
which are Ministry of Defence payments and group 8 which are Family Tax Credit _
payments are not received at this Unit. The foils are the instruments of payment for
various benefits payable in the UK that have been paid out to beneficiaries by post
offices. Every post office in the UK is required to submit by post their paid P&A
foils, P&A add-listings and P&A Office Summary forms to this Unit in a sealed pre-
addressed plastic pouch at the end of each accounting week. It is part of the duty of
certain members of staff to process the pouches on receipt. The pouch is first checked
prior to opening to make sure that it is not damaged. Upon receipt, the contents are
checked to make sure that a summary form is enclosed and that all of the foils are
banded together securely.

Continuation of statement of Sonia Cassidy

The foils and associated add listings and summaries are held in bundle approximately
12 inches long and in date order. There should also be enclosed, add listings or the
computer produced equivalent. If the summary and addlistings are not wrapped
around the foils when the pouches are opened they would then be secured with elastic
bands as above, There are seven accounting regions which are part of the Post Office
Limited (POL). The foils are stored on metal shelves firstly on a regional basis. They
are then broken down into Post Office Financial Accountant’s Department code order.
The Financial Accountant’s Department (FAD) code is unique to each office and
consists of seven digits. The contents of the P&A pouches, once secured together, are
passed for storage. A slip of card showing the Region letters in the top left hand
corner and date in the top right hand comer is secured by elastic bands to the front of
the bundle. The office FAD code is then hand-written on the slip for identification of
the bundle contents. They are filed in FAD code order and then in week number
order. The FAD code appears on the Summary forms (P2311 (b) MA) and should
also be recorded on the individual machine listings. The foils, add-listings and
Summary forms or equivalent are not separated at any stage between opening and
storage. A random check is made of a certain number of P&A foils each week. I can
say that the system of storage means that when access is needed to P&A foils of a
particular Post Office, a member of the Support Grade staff, whose duties include
storing and retrieving the bundles, goes to the relevant shelving section for the Post
Office Region, thence to the Post Office Account week and finally locates the relevant
bundle according to its FAD code number. They will retrieve any bundle requested by
an officer undertaking the case. Paid Order Unit regularly receives requests from Post

Office Limited, Chesterfield and Post Office Network Security to carry out checks on

the paid order foils received from certain Post Offices.

Witness Statement

Continuation statement of Sonia Cassidy

An Administrative Assistant (AA) will carry out the check, When an AA carries out a
check on Pension and Allowance foils, they use a calculator to add the totals of the
foils. On reaching a total they then check the add listing which has been submitted by
the Office that they are checking to ensure that the figures agree. If the totals do not
agree then the AA will reconcile each foil with the entry showing on the add listing.
If there is an error on the add listing, the AA makes an amendment in green ink.

The form P2311 (b) MA is a record, made by the Subpostmaster, of the total amounts
of each group shown on the add listings. The AA will check this document to ensure
that all of the totals have been correctly transferred from the add listings, and again
make any amendments in green ink if errors are found. When all calculations have
been completed and the amendments shown, the AA will record the errors that have
been made on minute paper and attach it to the P2311MA. Summary sheet. All
documentation relating to the Pension and Allowances are then passed to the
Administrative Officer (AO) who checks that the errors have been recorded correctly,
The AO then completes a schedule of the discrepancies for each cash account week.
This schedule is produced on a computer and is called a 205A. On completion of the
schedule, the file, with the schedules and the documentation is passed to the Executive

Officer II (EOI). The EOI will check the schedule to ensure that the discrepancies,

which are recorded on the schedule 205A, have been transferred correctly from the
minute paper attached to the form P2311MA. Summary sheet. The EOI] passes the
file back to the AO who dispatches the results of the checks, to the department
requesting the checks.

sw And then you're doing your payments and paying out your pensions
MM Yes
sw So if you can just talk me, and if you come towards the end of the week and you're doing your cash
account
MM That's Wednesday yeah
sw How do you go about preparing everything for your cash account
MM On the Wednesday?
e sw Yes
MM Well usually we try to, we're supposed to close at 12.30 but we don’t really get closed because in the
country community people keep coming, you're trying to do your audit now. Gary Groogan was in with
me on one of the days when I was trying to do my audit and he realised, you know, that people do still
keep coming and expect you to serve them or take stuff off them while you're doing it and you do that
because it’s expected of you, that's the way it’s always been and you try to audit and do everything. you
know put everything out to go through it at different stages on the computer and bring it all to a balance
now it doesn’t always balance first time as we all know. you might have to go through the stuff again and
check it all and re-do. you know some of it. but that’s normal procedure and you try to balance as close to
itas you can also we have an account with Camphill Community which they buy a lot of stamps. they past
alot of parcels to foreign countries em we put money down on their account for them for the stuff they get
out of the post office so we have to try and work between each week to what they have got, you know. out
in postage or stamps and try and, if you're short, that’s probably where itis. you go and look. it's probably
Where it is at the end or you've a mistake made and you have to go back and check it. which } always do.
but some weeks if I'm out, the next week it usually balances itself out, you know, its neither big amounts
@ here or there. 1 know it will balance itself out and I’m happy enough with thal. cos I'm the ones whose
doing it and I know if it’s a mistake made, I know I have made it and just a simple mistake and it will all
sot itself out the following week but that's the way I do to the best of my ability and J don’t do anything
wrong as far as I see, .
14.41 sw ‘So what about the computer system you've got, how long ago was the system
MM Twas trying to think, I suppose it’s 2 years or a year and a half. I'm not sure
sw ‘How did you find the changeover then? What system did you have before Horizon?
MM Just the books
sw Just manval
MM

@ CSOSA

Version 2.0 03/01

Manval yeah uh hur, this system is more helpful on the balances you know but if you're not wise to
computers as such you just have to take your time with it and go through it, one stage at a time. you could
touch the wrong icon, which you can do, you know, and you have to reverse and fix it again but J think I'm
doing good with it, I think I'm getting on with it very well, ] just don’t think it's the easiest thing, it might,

transactions in the post office at Clanabogan?

MM The main ones I would be doing would be pensions. giros

sw Pensions and the giros

sw So with the giro bank what happens with them in the evening whenever you're finished business

MM 1 (agreement) well there always all done up at the end of the day. you know. you get your print off and er.
you clip them all, you check them off first, tick them and you clip them all together then and leave them
aside for your postage you know. to 20 off

sw ‘And then you send them away every evening,

MM Well they're usually lified then the next day again. you know, that’s

sw And then the pensions and allowances

MM ‘Um hum, well they’re done up every day’ yes, at the end of the day too and you check them off and you
put them together ané they're going away on the Wednesday now. they're different.

sw So you do your balance on a

MM Wednesday, um hum

@ 16.54 sw What time do you do your balance on Wednesday”

MM We try to do it as carly, a bit before lunch time if we can. get it done as early as we can because in the
afternoon you do have a certain wee flow of people coming and going. for stuff and if you have most of the
stuff done earlier in the day you know, put through the computer. you can then do swipe cards and stuff
like that for them when they come in, other than that you have to do them up at the counter for them and
that makes double work you know, you have to come then and put them into the computer

sw Sorry what do you mean, when you say you have to do them on computer

MM We have a wee hand swipe one at the counter

sw Right

FT Right, this is a retail counter not the post office

MM ‘Aha, that’s the retail counter. so if you're in the middle of your balancing you can’t do your swipe card and
stuff for them

sw Right, I was getting confused with the counter and then you said the post office counter and the retail
counter

MM So if you have most ofthe stuff done up on the computer earlier in the morning part. then you can use the
computer to do swipe cards and stuff like that and get them out, power cards and electric cards, stuff they:
need

sw ‘So pensions, do you do the pension allowances on a daily basis?

MM Oh yeah, there always done up at the end of the day

sw ‘And whenever you complete them at the end of the day. what happens to the pensions?

MM You cut them off, you know, that's them cut off for that day and then you start the next day again

@ sw Ok

MM Right. then you do the same thing the next day and then it comes to Wednesday. that’s your day then that
you bring them all together you know you have them all in it and you check them off against your balance
snapshot

sw ‘And what happens, do they alway’s check off whenever you're checking your pensions?

MM Well to the best of my ability I do believe I check them off, yes. every day

sw Do you ever get where there's been a mistake

MM interrupts) oh you do yes

sw ‘And how do you correct that?

18.52 MM “There's times. there’s times on the computer, the one button at the top you know, where you have one
pension, right, if you touch that slightly at all or if you were in it some other icon right and you conve out
of it and that was a 2 or something like that there and you didn’t remember to flick it back to one, you
would have 2 pensions in for that or if you tipped the 4 button beside the 1 you'd have 14 but once you've

® checked offal the end of the day, you would pick up on big amounts and say you had 14 pensions at a big

amount, you would pick up on that you know and you would go in, you check the pensions you have
against it, you go in and fix it, that's

sw So how would you fix it?

MM Well thing is. go in and do my usual stuff, you know. take it back out again if I only want one and I've
got 14 in right, 1 go back in and I take 13 out and do a reversal

sw So you do a reversal? >

MM Aha

sw So that’s, you would get them all....for the week

MM Yes

sw Where are they kept, once you've done up the pension bundle and you've checked

MM

(interrupts) well, we've got wee boxes sitting there on top of the counter, there’s wee boxes on the counter

and 1 keep swipe cards in one and pensions in the other and all the other wee odds and ends in the third one

sw So once you've your pensions checked you wrap an Ad list around them and that particular bundle has
been checked and has the Ad List around them but you're saying you keep that in the box with the, where's
that kept?

MM All in the box. just like the way 1 done that there

sw Just exactly like that, wrapped around it and paper-clipped or depending on the size an elastic hand

MM If it’s big I keep an elastic band around it

sw ‘And they"re kept in a tin on the counter in the post office

MM Yes

sw ‘And at the end of the evening what happens to the tin?

MM All goes in the safe, that’s what ! do putin, the money and put all in there into the front of the sate, usually
my wee boxes or else, f you know'] have room in the safe sometimes you have extra stamps you just lift
your bundles out and sift them into the box, you know the box we had the pension books in

21.14 sw Um hum

MM That's

sw And then theyre kept there and you bring the tin out then every day

MM Every morning has to be brought out

sw And then atthe end of the week you do your summary and do you check them again to make sure the
bundles are the same as what the summary or

MM Wel. usually all as I say. done in elastic band or something and wrapped around but they'll never be taken
back out of them bundles again, I've no need to, you know, I believe once to have them checked they're
right and there should be no problem with them, then when I do my balance on them on Wednesday b take
the bottom figure, that figure from the very bottom

sw This one here

MM Aha, out of each bundle 1 add and I match it up with the Printer and that ! believe I have done the right
thing there

sw Ok so that’s the pensions and now the giros, you cover all transactions do you in the post office

MM 4, well, there the main ones, you know, the pensions. gros, you do a bit of postage. parcels and stuff like
that, as I say

sw So back to whenever you do your balance on Wednesday. the cash account and depending, if the balance is
showing over, how do you deal with the over....saying it’s a certain amount over

MM Um hum

sw ‘What do you do with the money?

MM. Lusually go back into it again and check all over again cos Sometimes you can have a mis-count in your
‘ash. ean have a mis-count in some part of i. you know stamps or something lke that. just 20 back in and

check the basic things. if it’s a small amount, which I know in my own heart I'm the one that’s doing the
ost office and if it's a small amount it’s somewhere in between the post office and the account that I have
for Camphill And I'm happy enough with that, you know. 1 know it’s there and usually then the next
week, you know, it’s back up again. it’s there because I have put the money back in. what was owed to it
know it was either in that Camphill account or if some reason it had money ...which I often do I would set
money aside for something you know out of the post office and just not saying I do but if} did on one
occasion that would be it, you know. { would know to check everything again and have it there for it

sw Would the same apply if you were shart

MM Ont

23,52 sw What would happen if the account was short?

MM Like last night it was short you know, now today 1 would be just giving everything a wee brief check again
‘and I would've put my money’ back again, you know, II would've put the money in for that today: and 1
would've known that had to be done once you've seen the papers all sitting there, I take them down and
ut them all in their envelopes and then ! would've had that sorted by the time I opened the post office
today

sw Ok so have you. do you ever go on holiday, who covers the post office for you?

MM ‘laughs) no. na

sw You don’t have any holidays. when was the last time you were on holiday Lo

MM we

ll this time fast year was the first holiday 1 would say J had in 6/7 years and er. just because it’s a family
business, I'm a widow Woman and I just have well J have a son that helps me out sometimes you know in
the shop there. he does a bit of mail and stuff like that, basically } do the rest myself with a wee part time

) girl
sw

So there’s no one else really: that em. could get the cash account or do the post office?

MM Definitely not, like I've no hiccups about that because I know I do it myself and } know like I haven't done
anything wrong as such, I know that if there's any-wee mistake, it’s not, it’s not no mistake done on
purpose.

sw Right. um, we've discussed the pensions and you've explained to me Mrs McKelvey your operating
Procedures on how you put the pensions through the Horizon system and then also how you would check
them as well
MM Yes
sw To make sure they were correct before they were sent away’
MM That's right
sw And you've explained that if you find any errors that you make the reversal to get the correct figure now to
make you aware also that there's a paid order unit in Lisahally That's in Londonderry

sw And that’s where your pensions go every week
MM Aha
sw ‘And what happens with the paid order unit is that they have a rota for checking every post office and do a
random check to check that weeks’ pension that has been received
MM Right
26.18 sw ‘Now what they actually do is they have the figures that post offices have claimed in their cash account for
that particular week that they're checking, they then count each individual foil and check every foit has
been sent from that post office to make sure it tallies up with the figures that have been claimed in the cash
account
MM Yeah
sw ‘Now the paid order unit in Lisahally has been checking Clanabogan Post Office and week 26 on 19"
September and they have discovered an error
MM Right
sw So that’s the reason then, they checked the weeks and then another 4 weeks and that's how the
investigation team got involved with the enquiries for
MM Your right
sw For the post office, what I'm going to show Mrs McKelvey now is a pension and allowance schedule for
Clanabogan post office FAD code 164/714 and the date was yesterday, 3° April and just be careful of this
(noise just point out to you, week 50 which was the 6" march, week ending 6! March you're office had
claimed £13.628.70 in the cash account for that week. now for the actual pension and allowances received
it was £13.417.55, so there was a variation of £211.15
MM Right
sw Now it was myself that checked that particular week and whenever I check the week it identified tha
group 7 there was 3 foils at £93.95 claimed and
MM Itshould've been
sw Only 2 foils received
MM Right (sigh)
sw Right, now also reference 2 on the pension schedule show's a group 72 foils at £117.20 claimed but one
foil at £117.20 received
MM Right, aha
sw So those 2 amounts together come to £211.15
MM Right
sw ‘Now whenever I check those foils I also check to look to see if your office, if the cash account was over or
short that particular week, that particular week your office cash account was showing a gain of £14.05

MM Yes
sw Now by rights. for the post office accounts, if these errors were genuine of the £211.15 your office
accounts should have been showing, what way
29.48 MM Shon

sw No, if you had a mistake with your pensions of £211.15 what would you cash account be showing. what
should it show?

MM W'll be short, it'll be over. sory, because there’s extras in

@ sw ‘Yes, no, you have claimed. whats actually happened is that the more money claimed than what has been
} received yes, so you'd be over. isn’t that right and that week your office was showing £14.05 of a gain

MM don’t know and you're saying these are all ones I've made mistakes in

sw Well what has actually, I've checked it, this is the reason I'm here to ask you the questions, as you can see.
we've checked the pensions. you've explained to me your checking procedure and that you double checked
them and whenever you find errors you do the reversal to make the error correct

MM Yes

sw And then you send them off and then your balances have been ok but whenever I look at that particular
week there's 2 mistakes, now as I say. if they had been genuine, you agree that your office should have
been showing an overage Of around£211 but it wasn’t

MM Itwasn't no

sw So if we go back to the week before that, week 49, 27" February and your office was £9.46 of a gain. that
was the cash accounts. your pension allowances that you claimed was for £18,725.93

MM Aha

eS sw However when I checked that particular week of pensions and allowances claimed I found a variation. a
3 discrepancy of £94.90. now again it was the same type of pattern where a foil is missing and it’s @ group 11
this time and there was 2 foils at £94.90 claimed and however only one foil was received Can you explain
that Mrs McKelvey to me : .

MM ‘Well I'm sorry but I honestly believe I done it to the best of my ability, I checked it and believed I had
done right you know, if I'd noticed an error I would've changed it as I told you, there's times } have
noticed errors yes and I have changed them, I have no problem with it, definitely did not do anything

sw Can you explain to me how it could’ ve happened vs

MM I don’t understand all this, touched the wrong icon is about all I"ve done there

SA She’s given an explanation to the best of her ability, she has carried out her duties, I don’t think there's,
there isn't much merit in going on, week by week and prolonging the interview. I think Mrs McKelvey has
co-operated fully and given an account of her accounting procedures em

2.53 MM Yes
sw Now just before the tape ended we ‘ere discussing the pension and allowance Schedule and the procedure
on how the details have been put on the Schedule, how they've been discovered, the variations in the
Pensions and allowances claimed by Clanabogan Post Office and what Lisahally, the paid order unit had
discovered whenever they had Completed the checking of week 26 to week 30. We also discussed the
Pension allowances which I myself checked in Belfast of week 43, 46 and also week 47 to Week 50 and I
asked you Mrs McKelvey if you could explain how the variations had happened as you had stated on the
‘ape previously that you were responsible for the pensions and allowances leaving the office, it was only
Yourself, and the cash accounts for those ‘weeks have not reflected the variations that have been discovered
in the pensions for instance in week 26 there was a variation of £506,3} discovered by the paid order unit
in Lisahaley however, the post office SCcounts had only shown £35.71 overgain and we discussed how this
Could happen and you said you were not aware,
MM That's right
sw Of anything that hag, may have made these errors or these variations em take place and I pointed out to
You that there was particular group numbers in the pensions that reflected on the Pension allowance
Schedule mainly of group 7 at the value of £148 on different occasions. These Particular foils were missing
and also ina group 13 a particular value again was missing
SA ] Ok we're going over old ground here
sw “JUSt 10 g0 over that just to remind Mrs McKelvey
SA We don't need reminding why were here if we can just move onto the issues that YOU are wishing to
Giscuss inthe second interview please
sw Fair enough
Fr There's a couple Of issues 1, I felt were televant, one is we've B0l a record ftom the schedule that we're
Se looking at, the Clanabogan schedule ‘hich we have sight of if these amount to errors then they should, by
3 What you've stated
MM. Aha
Fr Reflect in the ultimate office balance, the weekly balance, if you've Overclaimed by hitting the wrong key
and You've missed it when you've been checking the pensions, that increase because you haven't paid out
the extra £95 or whatever it may be, You're accepting that that will show a Surplus in your weekly cash
Sscount, now that hasn't happened, if we look at the schedule em, again, during the later weeks where
week 50 £21 Ivariation and £14.05 8gein, how can you explain this from, You know how you operate your
Aecount, how can you explain why there isn’t a Corresponding discrepancy in your weekly balance?
6.40 MM Tknow what you're saying, ¥¢S; that there should be a + Shortage there
FT A surplus
MM A surplus there I don't know, I'm just saying I do have that account for Camp Hill and! know there's

fT Can you explain how this account for Camp Hill actually works
Well, there's a lot of foreign people in Camp Hill, they look after handicap People em, they come with
Parcels going to Russia, Germany, various Places in the world, they never have Money of their own as
‘uch, this is for the community that now what they post and what stamps they
‘would get and various things, phone cards or ‘Whatever they want, you know, that would ail be put down in
their account
Tr Where is this account actually held?
MM 1S Kept in the shop you see because they buy their stuff through the Shop too and the stuff that they buy
Bots all down in the one account, you ‘understand me, s0 there's always X amount of money owed by them
cach Week for the post office
Fr Right
MM Sol know if there's a surplus of money short in the post office that’s where i is. I'm always nearly sure of
it I around, various weeks, could be 100 Could be more. just they buy, each house there's about 9 houses
in itand so many handicap in each house and People that run the houses just get so much for cach house
Stamps. phone cards whatever they have to ast and usually that’s where I would have, if was short of
Toney, I would know that's where it is but that's the only
FT So, how, how, not looking at your account this moming when we arrived, you declared your cash account
~ ‘or £112 short, now ....final cash account for itso that was a cash account that YOu present to the post
office showing £112.05 short
MM Yes
FT So what checks had you done to confirm that this shortage wasn’t a result of the dealings with Camp Hill
MM Well I'll be honest I didn’t actually check Camp Hill’s accounts because I had their accounts away, you
Know, Iwas a bt late in getting them done 'P and then one of them comes in and asks you for them, you
know, so I just had to run them through and give them to them. Then Whenever they come back to pay me 1
Will check what’s owed to me. You Know, we try, there's one man in particular that would come for them,
he's very good, he would go to the Counter and he'll get them money for ‘What he's got but the rest of them
because they can't speak the, there French, German and stuff and there not Very good English, they don't
Understand to bring the money to you or ask at the counter for the money for you so you have to put it on
the account or get someone that’s ‘working with vou to put itm chef account and then hopefully try and
emember to take it down later to the post office
10.04 FT So these accounts you keep for Camp Hill could we have a look at those?
MMi Well you can when {ean get them back from them now. vou know. the ones for the Jast couple of days

MM Yes

MM ‘Yes, we used to get it in cash but it was too much hassle, you know, counting it all out, when they arrived
and it was one man who came to lift all the cash so it was too dangerous too so we changed it to a cheque

them and they took them out

Some reason the Camp Hill account is creating a problem within the post office account
MM At has to be there, you know:
JT What like errors then we need to explore that and look at the amounts involved in the Camp Hill account
MM Well 1, suppose, I know the Camp Hillis, does always create a problem that way with the post office but
it's the way it's always been from before ! took it over, that's the way they have been operating for years
and years
11.45 FT ‘Yes. if this isa source of disguising the tue state ofthe post office account which is allowing errors to go
undetected in the post office account, obviously something we need to address
MM Aha, aha
FT ‘What our concern is and you've given a response to it, is that the consistency of the errors, the size of the
errors occurring each and every week suggests that it isn't error -
MM Itis an error, yes
FT Well, one week which jumps out is week 48 on the schedule which is week ending 20" February now that
articular week the error was £845.55 over claim in your Pensions, again it was group 7
MM £8007 :
PT £845, group 7, in fact in your account we actually have the foils + ‘You want we c2r
sive you a chance to inspect them. you actually claimed 15 group 7 foils and £93.95 when they were
checked there was only 6 foils present, now again we have the foils actually with us to check
MM 27

1 just don’t understand how itis, you know, I'll be honest with yous two, there is a problem here with cash
coming into the post office, you know, if you check the records back also, I have had to be ordering cash
regular, on a regular basis, extra cash every week, right, now the girl that rings up is always saying to me,
oh we'll cut you back £3,000, we'll cut you back 2, she shgutdn't be doing it, she should be adding on 2
and 3 and she’s actually cutting me back which means a lot of the time I'm having to, now take, pay out
Pensions out of my shop money which is creating a problem for me to and I have told Lisahaley to put my
© Money up not be taking it down but they seem to be always cutting me back now I’ve pi

yesterday I had
to take my money from over the Easter period and pay pensions up to the value of nearly £6,000, you

know that is creating an awful problem for me to because when it comes to the end of me balancing
yesterday, like, you can miss £500, £600 here and there, know what I mean, when you're taking money

from one source to another and you're moving it about. I shouldn't have to do that but it's

FT T accept it's not ideal but it doesn’t address this problem really. that was all recent
17.04 MM Well I would reckon in that week there, there has been money had to be put into the post office to carry it

through and that's the only explanation for that amount of money, I've had to put money in to cover
pensions somewhere

Fr But then we've got this £845 surplus

additional money

MM Exactly

MM Aha, because when you're working between 2, like yesterday, know what I'm saying, I checked all the
Pensions over again but I still, I know J pressed an icon wrong when I had a 14 and 10 when J shouldn't
have had them, you know, but I could've made a mistake there too, like yesterday, I checked them all and!
found my mistakes and I sorted it out at the time but there's weeks there we have been so short of money
we're just using the shop to carry it

MM 1'm doing it to the best of my ability
FT I suggest the comment will be supported by the evidence here that every week we are finding foils missing,
itis not a particularly large pension office by comparison to some of the offices ..., you're checking them
against a listing and every week we are identifying errors, so 1 would suggest not only it is perhaps
comment but it is supported by the evidence we have herg,
MM ‘Well probably doing it to, and serving at the same time, when you're a one man band, you're doing it on
your own and you're serving

2 computerised for the past two years, would that be correct
MM Yes
19,12 SA And you do it to the best of your ability
MM Yes, definitely so
SA ‘And if there are any errors they are genuine errors. I think she has been as helpful as she possibly can be. I
think this interview has been going on about an hour. really we've covered all the areas I can see
FT The other aspect is do you understand your responsibilities regarding these errors
SA I think there's been occasions when you've had to pay in money out of your pocket
MM ‘Yeah, I may have in the past, Eugene McMahon There from Omagh post office can guarantee this one for
‘me because there was a week we were £600 short and I couldn’t get it, not up nor down and he came out
and he checked it and we still didn’t get it and to this day it still hasn't been got, I had to make it good
FT So you understand as a sub-master these amounts that are missing are your responsibility
@ MM 1 do know that yes
FTISA? And you've put that out more than once outside when you've had the ....
MM ‘Yeah, there was other times to in the past years
FT Well, that's a contractual obligation
MM ‘Yes I know but I'm saying like if there was something there, you're saying to me short, if I had realised it
‘was short I would've had Eugene out, I would've got it sorted like I did and we we let it run for six weeks
and it still didn't come up and it still hasn't
FT Well, what we're looking at at the moment, there’s still 3 weeks we're waiting to get back from Lisahally
now, if you wish, in the presence of Mr Atherton when they're received we can check those over, they
haven't been touched by anyone as vet and they can be opened in his presence and your presence and
checked to see the accuracy of those accounts but at the present time there's an excess af £2,300 being
identified as errors in the pensions which has been submitted by your office

MM Aha
FT ‘And the rate we appear to be on is somewhere is just less than £200 a week as a magnitude of the error
which has been identified so we're looking at potentially 3, probably about another 13,14 weeks which is
‘going to double if this has been going on on a weekly basis, it's going to be just about double the sum
we've identified today. ’

© FT Before week 26?
MM Aha
Fi Well that was the starting point when we were advised of this from the paid order unit, we haven't gone
before that date, the purpose of our involvement was once we were advised of this, Lisahally went up to
week 30 which was October 2001 by the time it was all put together, a case sent to us, we'd have got it
probably the early part of this year. the end of last year, checks
SA Can you just confirm to me just for the purposes, ...... for myself. these are random checks carried out, is
that right
FT ‘What happens with Lisahally, they are requested to carry out what is called a mainstream check, if they
any errors on that mainstream check, irrespective of what the error is, they put the office, they hold
: the office under enquiry
SA Yeah, yeah. no what { wanted, if other offices submit these receipts
FT Everyone submits them yeah
e SA ‘They're not checked by the post office every week to make sure what the receipt says and the cash account
FT It's not the post office's responsibility to check them, they're checked by Lisahaley
J
SA Every week?
FT Not every office, not every week
SA So it would be fair to say when she submits that there would've been loads of weeks that it wasn’t checked,
is that correct?
FT But they would be held at Lisahally, it should be a subsequent check required, there kept at Lisahally for
12 months °
SA So when she puts that, when any post office submits there pensions and allowances, there held for a period
of time, they may be checked, they may not be checked. is that fair to say

FT Well, if you're understand the system that I've explained to you that week 26 was £506, the office was put,

Time is 14.50.

Form CS001 side B has now been completed. Do you agree that we

have not discussed this matter prior to the tape recorder starting?

Yes

Ok now Maureen, just to give @ quick preamble of what has been
happening. We first interviewed you on the 4" April when we carried
outa special audit at the Clanabogan Post Office due to accounting
irregularities that we discovered in the cash accounts. We then had a
formal tape recorded interview and with your solicitor present and that
was on the 4" April. During that interview we discussed that there had
to be further checks carried out of the pensions that hadn’t been checked
yet by Lisahally or myself. We invited both you and Mr Atherton to
attend the witnessing of the examination of the pension pouches at
Belfast Royal Mail House and that was on 2" May and during that
witnessing you picked at random 5 weeks, isn't that right? So 5 weeks.
just check the weeks and that was, week 31. 34, 35,40 & 52 and during
those checks then we discovered there were other discrepancies similar
to what we had noticed previously in the weeks that the paid order unit
jn Lisahally had discovered and that myself had discovered. Then I
explained to you that I had further weeks that had to be checked. Those
weeks have now een checked and this is why we're here at this

interview today- So first of all can! ask you regarding the weeks that we

you have seen yourself, the discrepancies, can you give me any reasons
why those discrepancies happened in the office?

I do believe I did everything to the best of my abilities at the time and 1
have been under pressure and short staffed and I have done it to the best
of my abilities I believe, I never meant to do anything wrong. I did not
mean to do anything wrong, definitely not. I know, I’ve seen it for
myself, my mistakes, and definitely I have not meant to do, I've been
maybe rushing things a bit and trying to do too much on my own but
that’s been the reason for it, jt has to be because I never done anything
intentionally wrong.

Right then, if you're saying you were doing all to the best of your
ability can you explain to me then why were your post office accounts
were balancing to an extent it wasn't showing up the money that was
J've been putting in money and taking out money. that’s been an
ongoing thing fora long time and at the minute I just said, I don’t know.
J'm getting money right, left and centre money that I don’t need these
weeks and before this I could not, they were telling me [had to wait for
4 weeks to show to them, on record for 4 weeks that I was short of
money before they would give me any extra.

Whenever you're saying “them” that’s the post office is it?

Aha, we used to be, we used to be able to get money from Belfast too,
you know specials and like you could do 2 specials in a week and 3
some weeks but you got one and like. if you rung up and said to the girl.

you know I'm short of money, you would need to add on a few extra the

next week to take me out of this, well we can’t do that until you're
showing us 4 weeks behind, that you're short of money and I just
seemed all the time that you needed to be ringing to get specials. Times
I didn’t have the time, or didn’t mind, just in time for my specials so I
had to put in money, that’s the way it's been going.

10.09 sw Now you mentioned in the previous interview about the Camp Hill

accounts

MM Yes

sw And you said you were going to look at them. what is the situation then
with the Camp Hill accounts?

MM Well the Camp Hill accounts is, well it has been an on-going thing from
when I took over the post office. They come in and give parcels,
postage, various things done, it's put down on the account and when
you're balancing on a Wednesday, well sometimes you balance and you
know that the money is in the account, you know what I’m saying but
that money doesn’t come out of their account until they pay you. sort of
D thing, so you have to go and check that account and see if there's money
} owing from them. Someone, there’s actually one man in Camp Hill
which is very good, he'll come in and do his business and he'll get the
money at the till and pay you, the rest, well their English isn’t that good
and you're trying to, you can't just sort of tell them what to do because
they don’t understand, so you have to try and remember yourself or else
the end of the weeks balanced you have to go and check their accounts
to see what's owing.

sw So do you have, you mentioned that in the previous interview that we

41.17 MM Well you can, 1

sw Would they be available then for to see them

MM always keep a copy of them and they get copies, their own copies, well
can show you them, yes

SW It’s just if there is some concern over how the Camp Hill account is
operating.

MM Well I suppose it isn’t their fault anymore than it is mine, I'm saying it’s
been there when I took over, that was the way it was always when I took
over

Sw That was about 11 years ago

MM ‘And they just do their business as they've usually done and all the time
you've new foreign people coming into the community you know, so 1
as I say they’re English is not that good so you just have to try and
remember to do it for them and things like that, to get postage done or
they left so many stamps, you have to try and remember to get the
money from one part to the other

sw And keep it all accounted for. Now you've mentioned before that you
hadn’t taken any leave for about the past 6 or 7 years, I just wish to
confirm, does anybody else operate the post office for you?

MM Not now, no

sw Why I'm asking is that whenever I've contacted you previously Twas
told you were on leave. so who was operating the post office then?

Why I'm asking, I’m showing copies of the updated pension schedule
dated 21 May 2002 for Clanabogan, FAD code 164714 and it’s from
week 26 through to week 53. Really this is the updated copy of all the

pensions now that have been checked. My interest why anybody had
) covered for you, if we go to the final page of the summary, it’s just

summarising the discrepancies that 1 discovered when checking the

weeks right through from week 26 to week 53 and what I had said on
week 32 just halfway down the page. I've indicated it was prepared
differently to other weeks compared to the way, week 32 was week
ending 31" October 2001, it just, what I would like to know is if you

have been in the post office that week or if you had been on leave.

MM I wouldn’t have been on leave I don’t think
sw It just seems strange
MM Prepared differently from other weeks, red tick on list
sw It was for me examining the pouches and you can see I've examined

B them quite thoroughly. it showed that, gave the impression that
somebody else differently had done the pensions that particular week, SO
} I just want to confirm that were you on holiday

MM That was week 32 of last year or this year?
sw That was 31" October 2001, last October, Halloween
MM

No, nothing comes to mind, Halloween, not like to me to get away in
summer??? Let alone Halloween, I can't, no, so there was a red tick you
were saying

want but all the pensions were put together with one band, one elastic
band around them and every ad list had a little red tick at them which
indicated to me someone else different had done the pensions because
that’s not the way they were normally presented. Halloween, would
spring to mind if anything different would happen in the office. So you
e say your daughter, when did your daughter last work in the post office?
15.51 MM When I was on holidays she would do the. she would just help out you
know do the pensions and stuff like that, Neula would do the computer.
the rest of it you know, all Sabrina would do is do the pensions.

sw Whose Neula?

MM She works for another post office part time.

sw So Neula works for another post office. what post office does she work
for?

MM She was at Tattyreagh But that’s closed down and when J was going ton
holidays I was trying to get somebody from out of here that does part
time, they were all busy with jobs so then Gary Groogan told me that

B Neula was available if wanted her so I rang Neula and Neula came out
; and she did it with Sabrina, the two of them, so Sabrina did the shop and
helped in the post office part of the time and then Neula did the post
office as well.

sw And is Sabrina your daughter

MM Um hum

just someone's used to doing that. they do it all the time

red ticked but that hasn't been the usual way, would you normally red
tick your pensions

something. There was 2 week that, so hard to remember, but there was a
week that there was money we couldn’t get it to sort out. it had to be,
we went back through, then Gary said he had rung Lisahally to ask them
to check the pensions, maybe they checked

So is it just your son working in the shop?

No, my other son was away, he was working away and he’s had to come
home to do the Moypark hen house things like at home, which the boy I
who helped me in the shop used to do so they used another part time
worker now to take on the hen house and try’ and do it up you know

‘And does any of them have a financial interest in the post office?

They do not, they never do the post office, that’s been a rule from the
start, they never wanted to do it so I did it, they had no jnterest in it

As you can see, if you look at this, the final page summary and why
we're here today is whenever I check them it leads us to believe that
there is something more than error, there is discrepancies and whenever
T've checked the values and how many times there's been discrepancies
with that particular value it leads me to believe that it’s more than just a
compensating error, there’s something else happening in the post office
I'm not doing anything intentionally, ! honestly, I know Tve been
putting in money and taking out money on a regular basis and I
shouldn't have been doing it, 1 should've just rang UP when I did the last

other weeks it was £4Kk

MM Thousands

FT Thousands, so what records do you maintain to show what you've paid

in or taken out of the post office?

MM Well usually when we took cash from the shop, you know, J would
always say to whoever it was, do them up in bundles of thousands or
whatever, you know, as soon as you get them done up because the next
day you be jooking for money for the post office and really. most of the
time I would have gone jooking for money. L kept a box actually behind
the scales and always kept bundles from the shop in it so jf customers

came in and I was short of money in the post office I would go and take
a bundle.

FT So what records did you keep to show what you

MM Well usually I would’ve kept a bit of paper stuck on the computer thing.
just took £2,000, took £1 000, took £500 I'd write it on that, then I
would do up the pensions and always keep the pensions out, I would
never put them through the computer because it was throwing me out
then if] did that so would just’keep the pensions out ina bundle and
did them all up together then sort of thing and tried to match what I had
in pensions with the money I had wrote down.

SA? Maureen, can you clarify something. sorry for me. since the last

interview with the post office has there been any mix up of money that's

the garage money and the post office money.

MM No need for
SA Prior to that that wasn’t the case, there was always money
25.59 MM Had to be, there was no way [could stay for 4 weeks without money,
like you know yourself that keeping these people in the post office is
very hard and the post office needs sight of them and once they go there
jt’s not hard for them to change so if you're short of money and can't
pay out somebody

FT Sorry can you just clarify how you're doing the pensions. you lost me a
little bit on that

MM Doing the pensions?

FT Yeah, you said the money from the shop you keep in a box in the post
office for emergency use but then you said you won't put the pensions
through at the time

MM I couldn't put the pensions through at the time because whatever
pensions I had paid out, out of the shop money, ! had to keep ina
bundle together, do you understand

sw This is because you had no money in the post office

MM [had no money in the post office so I had to keep the pensions with the.
you know, away from that, to keep them jn a bundle on there other with
the money, you know, that Thad in the box so then I would try,
whenever I would do up the pensions all together, take the money then
to sort that .

FT So how would you put pensions through the Horizon system

MM Oh put them all in then

MM At the one time yeah

FT So the transaction logs will show that from time to time you're putting
blocks of pensions through

MM Yeah

27.19 FT We'll get the transaction logs back from the computer company but
they’re be blocks of periods when pensions are going through one after
o the other

MM Yeah

FT so if that was the case, what was the problem with actually creating a
balance, if you kept the pensions you paid out alongside the cash. you
tabulated the pensions and you paid out from shop takings.

MM At times you would have a problem of being short of money in the shop
and as soon as someone would come in or a couple come in looking for
pensions well you hadn‘t money in the box. such cash in the box. times
you had to go to the till or shout to some other staff on to get to bring
you down some money, times you would've got a bundle of money that.

BS you know, you've got £300 in that or £500 in that, you wouldn't even
: have time to count it, know what I mean, you were paying out 4
pension, someone was waiting to get away.

FT So how many remittances do you get a week?

MM How many?

FT Yeah

MM One

FT And how much is that for?

MM Well it was down to £11,000 something and I’m up to £16,500 now

FT And so what other in-payments to you get into your post office?
MM I get a cheque also for Camp Hill
FT That’s part of the pension payments
MM That’s part of their pension payments I
FT So how much is the cheque for?

28.47 MM Well they do double weeks sometimes too. you know, rather than do
one week at a time, they would do 2 weeks at a time, there’s could be
£10,000 and other weeks, it’s actually now down at the minute to
£2,000

FT So they have a variable community facility 72???, so you've got the
cheque in, so how about those repayments from giro bank customers.
how much do you average a week on giro bank customers?

MM Not so much 727?

FT Ballpoint figure

MM It varies you know you have some in with club money then giro bank
things, well you could’ve had a few hundred one week and you could
have more the next week, you know, if you had electric bills in or you
had big payments that would vary

FT Can you give me an average figure

MM Well you could be £1,000

FT £1,000, £5,000, £10,000?

MM You could be £1,000, if 1 was putting my own electric bill through, you
know, my electric bills are £2.000 :

FT But that’s obviously the

MM That's the old type but then you would have an odd business in the area

too that would be putting their electric bills through, you know it would
just vary from high amounts some weeks, it’s usually just on a low, few
hundred a week, you know to £1,000.

FT How about ?2?? payments for electric bills, would you pay iton the
swipe cards and what amounts are you getting for that?

MM You could have swipe cards usually in the region of £200 maybe less

@ some weeks
30.27 FT So, £11,000 remittance plus probably on average, what, £1,000, £1200 a
week on giro bank deposits, would that be a fair estimate or?

MM Roundabout

FT Do you get money from any other source. vehicle licence or anything
like that?

MM No I don’t have vehicle licensing???

FT Does your own business pay in with the post office?

MM No :

FT You don’t bank with giro bank or anything like that

MM No

» Ft Just looking on average you paying out £12-£13,000 a week on your
pensions, there doesn’t seem to be much of a shortfall that would
require additional funding all the time, so for what reason have they
tured you down before?

MM Well, I, I don’t know, I can’t understand why, you know. there was @
time we used to get phonecalls back, like‘when I had to go to the post
office first??? To check on your cash account. your flow and if you
needed money. I know everything has changed a fair bit but like now it

just seems to be impossible to get money, I don’t know why it’s me or
another post office I just don’t know, I know that’s what I was told on a
number of occasions that you have to wait, show them for 4 weeks that
your targets are low before they will give you money and then we had a
letter then also at the time to say that the specials in Belfast were not

allowed as such unless they were emergencies and that was put a stop to

@ that too.

32.06 FT So what day did you get your deliveries remittance
MM From the cash? Friday.
FT You used to get it Friday
MM Used to get it early on a Friday morning then we didn’t get it till the
afternoon
FT Right, and what's your busiest pension day?
MM Well Tuesday, Monday & Thursday
FT So you got the money in plenty of time for the Monday & Tuesday

payments obviously and then obviously you've got the whole week
MM Always by Thursday you knew you were. you know, money would be
going short on you

FT Just to clarify the account at Camp Hill, the last time we spoke, you

suggested the error was probably as a result of the Camp Hill account

MM Yes that was always our WorTy when we were balancing and balancing
you were always watching for their account if you were out, you nearly
thought it wasn’t their account, you would have to go and check through

and see if they owed you some money from the previous week or the

week between the last balance

FT So how is that working with the post office, you're operating a credit
account for, for the Camp Hill community post office?

MM Usually if they were shown there was money, post office stuff was got,
or stamps was got on their account and signed for, you knew if some of
the foreign ones had got it, the money had to be taken down to the post

office then because they don’t normally do that so you would have to

check through the accounts and see for the last week and see what
they've got

33.40 FT Right, so, are you allowed to do that, operate a credit account through
the post office? If I came in to buy a first class stamp and

MM No, it’s just the way the system was when I took over off the previous
and it’s just the way it’s always been continued on rather than, you
know when they come in, trying to explain to them and they don’t

understand you, some of them

FT I can understand the difficulties you have with the language and dealing

with the people

ry MM You usually try, with the staff too, to keep them that little bit aware to
° try and remember to bring the money down to you or them to bring the

money down but if they’re busy it doesn’t always happen. you just, it’s

just a routine thing we did, we checked the account

FT Yeah, so where would the Camp Hill people getting the stamps and the

postage from?

MM Well they would've got it from us, you know. we just wrote it down on

apiece of paper for them

FT But you said you were the only one that operated the post office

MM Aha, there was a time when Ruth worked there two a couple of years
ago, you know, she would’ve done the same, you just wrote it down on
a piece of paper for them and they went off to the counter and it was put
on their account
FT Right so you deal with the post office and say that’s £25 on parcels,
stamps whatever and they would go to the shop counter and hand in a

SA I think in fairness we discussed this in detail the last time, 1 can
remember
35.00 FT In fairness Mr Atherton, I think the issue was at the last interview jit was

suggested that the error could've arisen from the way the Camp Hill
account

SA I can remember having a rather heated discussion with you and you said
it was important regarding the actual working of the Camp Hill account
and then I said “fair enough, it was fair comment” but surely you're
going over old ground, just came to make things as straight as possible
FT I understand your concern it just seems we seem to have 2 variables.
money going in and money coming out and private account and also the
Camp Hill account so it’s a slight variation of what was discussed over
the last interview, I'm just trying to

MM We said the last time there was money going in and out, unfortunately I
shouldn't have done it, I shouldn’t have let it happen like that

FT What I’m trying to get my head around is the. if, if the pension

allowance irregularities have been identified were the result of

confusion with one or other of these accounts. some of the amounts are

quite large, the size of the accounts and the use of the accounts, how
these large amounts could arise, look at schedule week 26, there was
over £500 variation between what was claimed and what was actually

received, week 31 there’s £350 and I’m just wondering laterally week

37 £323, week 38 £353, how errors of this size can. actually be disguised

because of the way the accounts been worked

[ MM T wasn’t disguising or hiding anything, I just did it to the best I could do
at this time, I was honestly trying my best to keep a balance on
everything and really and truly you know, putting in money and taking

money out, it’s very hard to take control to keep control of to be honest.

MM ‘When you're understaffed and under pressure jt’s very tight to keep

running from one to the other

business, who is actually employed in the w hole I business. ¥ various

‘james have been mentioned and your son 4

so who actually works in the business altogether

within the shop unit including yourself

time before Christmas and 2 other part time

girls but the main 2 people that was there most of the time was with me
are gone now, since before Christmas and hasn't been back.

asked them but they just didn’t want to and that was it. They would do
the shop work but they didn’t want to do the post office work.
FT Are there times when you wouldn’t be in the business where you're
staff could have possibly have access to the post office
MM No I would never leave the key
FT Obviously we're trying to explore all possibilities. somebody could’ve
got in there and done something in your sort of absence
MM No, I never leave the key, I always take the key with me.
FT So there’s no way anybody could've accessed that area other than
yourself?
38.27 MM No
FT I seem to think when we were going through the audit there was some
stock in the cigarettes and stuff, would they have been ??? access
MM They would've phoned if they wanted cigarettes but usually that’s my
routine, I try to remember everything. leave out cigarettes and stuff like
that before you go. just look at your shelf and see what you need and
just leave it out for the staff to put out and if they were stuck and that’s
happened on the odd occasion like they ring me to the house and I'm
only up the road so, and I don’t be away too often to be quite honest.
I'm there most of the time from’7.30 in the morning till 9.00 at night.

FT There’s nobody else with a financial interest in the post office?
MM No

SW Just to bring the interview then to a conclusion, I just want to clarify
that it’s just yourself that operates the post office, no one else has access
to the secure area. Neula has been working in it just recently, Sabrina.
your daughter has only worked in it on occasion because she doesn’t
actually live at home, you weren’t able to offer an explanation for the

discrepancies that’s detailed on the pension schedule or why the cash

8 account did not reflect an overage mentioned the variations for instance
the £506, there was only a gain of £35.71 in week 26 and also we
discussed the Camp Hill accounts that we maybe we can see the Camp
Hill accounts because there is obviously a concern there and just I want
to mention, have they ever come to you and said they’ve had any

problem with the money that you gave them. have they ever said, no our

accounts have not balance

39.58 MM No never

sw Right and you're aware regarding the credit account that you and you're

solicitor will be looking at the sub postmaster contract regarding the
repayment of the £4,138.21 of the pension schedule. Is there anything

Ad else you would like to say Maureen before I conclude the interview?

MM Well there’s nothing more Ican say except I did do it to the best of my

ability and there’s no way that I did do anything wrong that I could see

at the time, I know I was juggling money, that’s what I was doing
between both parties and I shouldn’t have been doing it but things were
left like that for me and I couldn’t get money otherwise. I’m just sorry it

happened like this. I have a great interest in what I have out there about

that business and J feel like, you know, I need it, maybe ! don’t need as

documents, whether held by himself or by his Assistants, and should keep
them in a place of security} especially at night.

6. The Subpostmaster is responsible for maintaining a standard of security
sufficient to enable him to meet the obligations laid on him by paragraph
5 for the safe keeping of Post Office Counters Ltd cash and stock placed in
his care. If any circumstances arise which lead him to doubt whether he
can do so he should immediately consult the Regional General Manager.

7. In deciding the standard of security which it would be reasonable to
require under paragraph 6 Post Office Counters Ltd will have regard to (a)
the circumstances in which the Subpostmaster was appointed, and in
particular the standard of security then accepted; (b) the length of time
since his appointment; and (c) any particular circumstances affecting the
sub-office which appear to be relevant.

8. All vouchers for payments e.g. Postal Orders, Allowance Dockets etc.,
should be placed in a suitable receptacle (cardboard box or strong
envelope), labelled “Paid Vouchers” and at the close of business kept
separately from cash and stock in another secure place, such as a locked
drawer or cupboard.

manner that they remain in good condition. The stocks must be protected
against damp and dust.

ACCIDENTAL LOSS

If at any time any items of stock (including stock of no intrinsic value such as
motor vehicle licences) is found to be missing. Steps must be taken at once to
ascertain what has happened fa the missing items. The serial numbers must
be ascertained (see 2(a)) and verified by examination of items in stock, and the
requisition forms examined to discover whether or not any of the items
purport to have been issued out of sequence. All the requisition forms for the
previous 3 months must at the same time be impounded and held for
instructions. If, after careful search, the missing jtems cannot be found and
are thought to have been mislaid only, or inadvertently destroyed, a
preliminary report of the loss giving the serial numbers of the items in
question must be sent to the Regional General Manager.

STOLEN ITEMS

1. Ifasa result of burglary, break in, theft, or suspected theft any items of
stocks are missing the facts should be reported as quickly as possible to
the Regional General Manager.

2. The further details which will be required, and which should be obtained
and submitted to the Regional General Manager at the earliest
opportunity, are as follows:

a) The denominations, total values and serial numbers of missing
or stolen items, so far as they are known, with serial numbers of
any remaining stocks.

b) A statement as to whether the date stamp of the sub-office has
been stolen, and if so, particulars of the type in it when stolen. If
the date stamp has not been stolen a statement should be given
which should intimate whether there is a reason to believe that
it has been used upon the stolen items.

c) Aspecimen impression of the date stamp and, if it was stolen,
particulars of the type in it when stolen. -

d) Astatement of the circumstances which are thought to show
that a theft has been committed and of the supposed date, time
and method of commission. It should include, if possible,
written report from the person who last saw the missing items
and the person who first discovered the loss. The former should
say when the items were last seen, in what place and in what
kind of receptacle (locked or unlocked) they then were. The
latter should state how and when the loss was discovered and
describe exactly the condition of the place and of the receptacle
from which the items were apparently taken.

e) Particulars of any cheques, including the transaction for which

they were accepted.
