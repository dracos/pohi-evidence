We cannot go direct to Slaughters they would have to ask RMG to approve giving us the information, so I will ask RM
but as I understand it the Horizon/IT reference was taken directly from our press release.

Susan, Hugh - would you be able to ask Slaughters to send across the latest extracts on POL from the prospectus
please? Just spoke to Will G for an update from their perspective - he said the main sticking point was the sentence on
Horizon/Second Sight in the IT risks section, which they're still pushing to have removed but are facing some resistance.

I asked if that meant the other issues had been resolved (on MDA language etc) - he said he didn't think there was any
push back there, but wasn't able to confirm whether or not our comments had been taken on board. He said he would do
some digging - but it might be quicker just to get hold of the latest language direct from Slaughters.

Thanks,
Martin

Susan and I did a set of legal comments on limited extracts ages ago, then I fed in some IT comments the other week for
Lesley / Sue B.

Tim - the only other channel of communication with RM on the prospectus has been between our legal team (Susan and
Hugh, who I have copied) and a lawyer at Slaughters. Hugh can confirm, but as far as I'm aware the last communication
with them was 1-2 weeks ago, and focussed on narrower points of legal/factual detail rather than the reputational/PR
issues that I flagged to you.

It certainly didn't represent us signing off on the document, so please do bat this idea away.

Thanks,
Martin

someone on the other side might be saying that POL has signed off, and to bat this away (which we will) it would be
useful to understand comms channels and what's been said / agreed.

you updated on progress in real time but there are some weapons we want to keep in the arsenal and only use if they are
absolutely necessary. We have a couple of avenues to try still so let's see where we get to with those.
