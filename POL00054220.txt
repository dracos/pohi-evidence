Subject: RE: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010

Dear Jarnail,

It appears that the two experts did achieve something after all, contrary to the
impression I was given by Mr Hadrill.

I wonder if Mr Jenkins can consider what logs need to be looked at and how long this
exercise might take might take. I hope he agrees that only a relatively short period
needs to be looked at, in the light of the defendant's regular inflations, but we should of
course defer to his expertise as to what is required. If he could then liaise with the
defence expert they car’ hopefully do the exercise together and see if there is any
pattern of errors which might have been counterbalanced by the defendant's false
accounting.

Iam anxious that we are proactive about this to avoid the defence being able to say that
they don't have time to be ready.

Iam happy.to speak to Mr Jenkins direct and he is very welcome to ring me on my
mobile -}... 5

Kind regards,
Warwick
