Vv NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE CROWN COURT

In regards to the Expert Accountants Report 28 July 2009.

I cannot ascertain how much from the business has been deposited without a full list of daily takings
for the period. I have only received extracts.

In regards to the deposits in the Alliance & Leicester Business account and the Holmes’ Personal
Account, I have noted that deposit are made in to both accounts on the same day. I also noted that
large deposits or deposits totalling large amounts, were made in to the Alliance & Leicester on the
same days as the deposits in to Barclay's.

Peter Holmes stated on tape in regards to deposit in too the Personal Account'She lives with me she
comes at night does her accounts counts her money gives me what's got to go into the accounts the next
_morning and I'm coming into a Post Office anyway so I bring it in and pay it in’

The Barclay's statements only indicate ‘Postal Credits' against the description. They do not indicate
the Post Office the deposit was made.

The Alliance & Leicester statements do not indicate the name of the business in the description,
however the main credits are described as

BT DUALITY - E (date) and D ELAVON MERCHANT SERVICES CR MAESTR - E (date). I presume
these are the business deposits.

I have compiled an Excel spreadsheet with the deposits made into both accounts. The majority of
deposits in to the Barclay's account were made at a Post Office. The ones that were not are annotated

in the comments column.

I compared the date of the deposits against the Horizon data for the period 21 August 2007 and 17
September 2008. The amounts deposited on the Barclay's statement have also been transacted
through Jesmond Post Office under Product Number 4370 - Barclay's Bank Personal Cash Deposit.
The Horizon dates differ by up to 4 days previous I would presume this is the period it takes to clear at
the bank. All transactions were transacted under Peter Holmes' user ID with the exception of 7
December 2007. Jenera Bergum, Counter Clerk transacted Holmes' wages (£1840) in to his Bank
Account. The deposits not transacted at Jesmond PO are annotated in the comments column.

The Expert Report states they have done a summary of deposits from 1 August 2001 to 19th
September 2008. The statements I obtained cover until 19th August 2008. There is one statement
missing for the period 22 April to 21 May 2008. I noted the same period on the Experts Report has no
deposits made during this period either.

The Horizon data shows 9 deposits made from 16th April to 21 May 2008 were transacted under
Holmes user ID for Product Number 4370. I would suspect the Experts Report does not have the
statement for period 22 April to 21 May 2008.

Whereas the Expert Report views the amounts in to the Barclay's Account is the takings from the
business, my view is the manner in which the deposits are made suggests differently. However
without the daily takings for the period I cannot say for certain.

I will take a hard copy of the file to court tomorrow.
