No, don’t send the stuff to POL until we know what’s going on.

Subject: Duplicate records in ARQ output

Alan,

As we discussed a few days ago, there are a large number of duplicate records in an ARQ output for FAD 173458.
Could you please have a look at the attached and investigate? Can I send the ARQ to POL in the mean time?

I will send the password in a separate email.

Many thanks.
