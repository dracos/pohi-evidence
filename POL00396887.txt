Time

This section is red because we are unable to meet
the deadline for PCI compliance - December
2008.

Cost

Costs generally are managed by the HNGX

programme.

e In addition there is a cost to eliminating Track 2
from the daily submission file to appease Visa.
Business case passed for £25,000. This work
will not impact HNG-X timeframes

e Costs for eliminating Track 2 from the audit log
to make it PCI compliant will be higher; we are
currently trying to find a solution. Then we will
measure cost.

e Cost of File Integrity Monitoring has finally been
agreed at £175,000.00, £37.000.00 over
original estimate.

QUALITY

requirements of the auditor

e Roadmap.
e Progress - The PM has finally been appointed.
Meeting scheduled 27/08.

COST ¢ Cost for the compliance for the RMG portal
resides with RMG.
e There is no cost to POL for compliance where
the POL! Third’Party has its own direct
relationship with an acquirer.

Quality Doug Warwick attempting to set up meeting with
BOI compliance. Keith Woollard supporting the
initiative. Reported red as so far they have not
received a satisfactory response/engagement with
Bol. However there was a major breach on an Irish
e-commerce site reported in Irish papers 08/08/08.
This may prompt more focus on the subject.

Progress Summary

What went well this week:

1. POL asked by the BRC to write up how they secure their PEDs at Point of Sale.
The POL process to be published as a “Best Practice”

2. Meeting with Matt Hibbard, [Andrew Carter’s replacement] in Chesterfield went
extremely well. He is keen to forge ahead with the Streamline relationship.

3. Meeting with Alan Green training in Rugby. He is in the last stages of
completing the training package for security and keen to start the training
package for Operations.

What did not go so well this week:

e Deborah Howarth did not turn up for the meeting in Chesterfield to conclude the
review of their mapping of PCI into the ISO standards, due to personal reasons

e Despite having failed to deliver on a number of documents end of July, Fujitsu
proposed next meetings for beginning of September, completely passing over
August. Pulled back dates to 22" August.

e PCI project team meeting. There is just so much to do and everybody has so
little time. Do not feel we are making progress.

e No progress with the QSA, so the contract negotiations are still stalled.

Key Activities planned for next week:

e Meeting in London with M. Burley to review PCI project. He is concerned with
lack of progress on project.

e Conference call with legal and security re making the historical audit logs PCI
compliant while maintaining their integrity for prosecution purposes.

POL00396887

e Updating the Audit documentation. This is now the main focus of the project and
the detail over the 12 requirements will take a great deal of time and effort.

e Updating the status of ~Fujitsu’s deliverables. Many documents and information
for the audit were due for delivery 230/07/08 and have not been delivered, so
they need to move into red and start to be chased for new delivery dates.
Update the delivery milestones.

Issues and Risks

e There is now an issue with Fujitsu’s failure to deliver promised documents and
information. Need to work on a strategy to pull this back. Some action already
planned
1. Direct communication with Fujitsu and meeting set for 22/08/08. Earliest

available date due to holidays in Fujitsu.

2. Despite Fujitsu’s failure to make a PCI update meeting in July, the “Fujitsu
meeting record” document has been updates to reflect the current status of
project on 10/08/08

3. Separate meeting scheduled with J. Sweeting also for 22/08/08. This
meeting is between Dave King and J. Sweeting and John Halfacre. I have
given D. King a complete list of items OS. So Dave King has a complete
written record of the status of each item and our expectations from Fujitsu on
each individual item, particularly in relation to J. Sweeting’s deliverables and
have requested a detailed update in writing on actions and dates agreed at
the meeting

4. Torstein Godeseth has also been given a list of the deliverables that have
been delayed and he is also aware from the PCI team meeting and the
records of the PCI team meeting of the items that have been delayed. He will
raise the subject directly with J. Sweeting’s manager.
