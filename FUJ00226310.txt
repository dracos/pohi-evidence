Hi Dave,

Please find attached the integrity document we discussed. Sorry for the delay--we needed to introduce some
degree of commerical and legal review.

Please note that this is purely a technical explanation of how Horizon ensures data integrity, and is submitted
on a “without prejudice” basis.

Speak to you at 4pm.

Hope that helps,
