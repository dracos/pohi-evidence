FAO: Segun Jide, Solicitor to the Inquiry, Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

Dear Mr Jide
Volume 1 of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry Report — Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”)

We refer to Volume I of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry Report dated 6 June 2025 (published
8 July 2025) (the “Volume 1 Report”), in which the Chair makes 19 recommendations. Fujitsu
notes that Recommendation I invites Fujitsu, where appropriate, to provide written responses to
the Chair’s recommendations by 10 October 2025.

Recommendations 2 to 18 of the Volume I Report relate to the scope and operation of the redress
schemes currently administered by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”) and the Department for
Business and Trade (“DBT”) (namely, the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, Group Litigation Order
Scheme, Overturned Convictions Scheme and Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme). Given that
Fujitsu has no involvement in either the design or delivery of these schemes, Fujitsu does not
consider it appropriate to provide written responses in respect of Recommendations 2 to 18 at this
time.

Recommendation 19 of the Volume I Report then recommends that, by 31 October 2025, Fujitsu
publish (either separately or together with Post Office and DBT) a report outlining any agreed
programme of restorative justice and/or any actions taken to produce such a programme. Fujitsu
confirms that it intends to provide such a report to the Inquiry by the deadline stipulated.

Fujitsu is committed to rendering every assistance to the Inquiry and is grateful to the Inquiry for
the opportunity to respond to the Chair’s recommendations. Should the Inquiry require any further
