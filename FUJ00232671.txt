Subject: MER (Manual Error Report) Qtly Credit

Carol —a very minor part of the operating fee charge is this MER credit — which is processed on a quarterly basis &
represents a repayment back to POL. It’s usually only a small amount — a few hundred pounds or less.

It’s a transaction that comes out of the Security team & Jason pointed out a couple of months ago that the MER credit
is no longer relevant since Computacenter took on responsibility for the Branches from April 16. I’m not aware of any
reference to MER in the Contract but wanted to point this out to you just in case there’s a reference in the Contract
that should now be removed. If so I assume it could be added to another ‘tidy-up’ CCN.

Thanks

Martin
