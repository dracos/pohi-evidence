1N.b. It has not been possible to confirm the parameters of this response.
2 Although the request was for data from 1990 to 2020, the response was confined to 1991 to 2020.
3 This figure excluded cases where it was not possible to confirm whether there had been a conviction.

4 As the data was further reconciled and analysed, the conviction dates for some of these cases were subsequently identified.

5 This is because it was thought that unknown individuals might fall within the parameters of the request, but non-POL employees and individuals with job
titles such as ‘engineer’ or ‘cleaner’ were not included as they were understood not to fall within the request.
7 Including cases treated as not involving a shortfall in branch accounts such as robbery and burglary, and ‘other’ cases. The note provided to the CACD on
25 March 2021 also contained a breakdown excluding robbery and burglary cases but still including ‘other’ cases.
8 ‘Horizon-related’ refers to cases which relied on Horizon evidence in whole or in part.
