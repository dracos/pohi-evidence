Subject: RE: Enquiry re: Current Prosecutions

Jarnail,

Thanks for this.

! have a few questions now and will probably come back with a few more if ok:

On the live prosecution cases can you give me a few paras on why you are proceeding with the POCA enforcement
hearings?
There are two scenarios in which we prosecute under POCA
1) Where we have had a defendant plead guilty or a defendant has been found guilty. We use the
process to get a compensation order payable through the confiscation order. This is the best way to
recover POL funds as non payment is backed up by a term of imprisonment.

POL-0143037
POL00141653
POL00141653

2) Where we have been independently instructed by POL financial investigators to appear at our local
Magistrates’ Courts in relation to POCA enforcement proceedings. The Regional Recovery Unit ask
POL for the attendance of a lawyer which we provide.

°

What is a PCMH stage?

The PCMH stage is the Plea and Case Management Hearing where the defendant will either plead
guilty or not guilty. This is usually the first hearing after the service of the full set of
Prosecution papers in the crown court and is the hearing where the Crown Court makes
orders/ give directions for the hearing of a trial where the defendant has pleaded not guilty.

What is a mention before trial?

A mention is literally a hearing where a case is mentioned before a court, usually for a matter of
administration. One might mention a case to apply to break a fixture, ask for disclosure, to make sure
that all parties are ready for a trial or any one of a hundred reasons that might require the input of all
parties and cannot be sorted out by email or letter.

Of the 31 advised on cases how many are being worked on for further evidence, how many has there been
advice to charge and how many are awaiting the expert witness? These are not mutually exclusive. As
the landscape now stands in most of the cases it is better that we have the expert instructed as
any case begun now will attract some type of Horizon issue because this is the passing
bandwagon people are jumping on it. When we have a few wins under our belt the Horizon
challenges will melt away like midnight snow. In some cases e.g. Redman we do not need the
expert as she has made full admissions but the cases where Horizon can be completely ruled
out are few and far between even if it only goes to quantum.(value of loss)

Much of the work requested in our charging advices is dotting I’s and crossing Ts. Most of the
cases advised for charge will be sound prosecutions with comparatively little extra work when
we either have an expert's statement in the bundle or we can get one if the Horizon is raised in
a case.

If you have any further questions please don’t hesitate to get back.

Thanks

David

David
Following on my discussions with you and Belinda this morning here is a quick note which may help with some of the
answers to boards questions ;

LIVE PROSECUTION MATTERS.

1. It was regarded acceptable to proceed with.

2. Number of the prosecutions were in the pipeline and currently in Court.
3. Looked at case by case basis and decision made on them to continue.

POL-0143037
POL00141653
POL00141653

4. Certain cases terminated after review. Others were safe to continue with-Guilty plea. Admissions and not challenged
the Horizon in Court.

i.e. Defendant made full and frank admissions, pleaded guilty ,substantial amount theft of money ,breach of trust, it
would have been miscarriage of Justice to let them walk free. therefore prosecution continued.

5.The cases were not stopped because it did not needed to be.

6. Have Post office stopped every single prosecution, what signal would/ does that send out about confidence in the
Horizon system.

ADVISED ON (either requested further evidence or advised charges)

Here former General Counsel give instructions that no further summons to be issued for the time being.

1.Security team wished to continue investigating and cases were advice on and prepared for the following reasons:
a) so that evidence was not lost/witnesses recollections deteriorated prior to any statements being taken.

b) So that investigation team could continue to process the work and get the prosecution in ready condition thereby
avoiding impossible work load, as and when prosecution is resumed.

Hope this helps .

Regards.
