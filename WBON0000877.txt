Hello Chris, I sent the following on to Tony last week as he requested, but thought he would have sent it
on. He has only just asked me to forward it to you, sorry for any confusion.

Hello Tony, two points.

First, as requested at the Working Group meeting yesterday, I have attached the two documents key to
understanding the ethos behind the “Horizon Initial Case Review & Mediation Scheme”.

What has to be remembered with all of this is what has been promised to the individuals taking part, and
here the main document from the Scheme pack (CaseReviewMediationPackHighlight.pdf) clearly
identifies the roles of those involved and on what basis the Scheme will operate.

Whereas the other document, the statement by the Minister in Parliament (Hansard-Horizon-Minister-Jo
Swinson-9 July 2013 — Highlight.pdf), emphasizes to a number of the MPs who have constituents in the
Scheme, the importance of the independence of Second Sight and “that the work that needs to be done is
not only independent, but seen to be independent of Post Office”. These and similar comments have been
highlighted on the attached document. I do fear that should the Working Group query or interfere in any
way with a recommendation by Second Sight that a case was suitable for going to mediation, that such
decisions would very much fly in the face of what the Minister promised and the MPs expect.

My second point relates to the Part 2 report. I understand that Post Office will be offered an opportunity of
going through that report with Second Sight on Tuesday. As Post Office will have sight of that document,
should not you, Kay and I also have a copy released to us at the same time?

Please contact me if you any questions relating the information I have sent through.

Regards
Alan
