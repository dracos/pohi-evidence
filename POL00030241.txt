Sandra/Brian,

Pretty much the same status with Callendar Square. They need to let Horizon Systems Desk know if they have further
problems, and the fix should be down to them with the S90 release as stated in my previous email. As you can see from
the e-mail below though, there is now recognition that is a wider issue than just a software "quirk" at just one branch,
which means it is now being activiely managed as a cross domain problem with Fujitsu.

It appears that Callendar square is not alone with it's mismatch problem. It also appears that Fujitsu are expecting S90
release to resolve this quirk.

We have opened a cross domain problem record, Lynne Fallowfield is the contact.

Only advice for the branch is to continue logging instances of the problem with HSD.

Lynne, I was waiting for an update on this branch Callendar Sq see the email
chain below. The problem is possible the same as the others that still have
mis matches and whther thay have been moving Stock units ?.

I think i am inclined as per this issue to wait and see if all these
branches are OK after the S90 counter roll out starts 4th after the pilot
this week.

I will maybe just get Anne to check these out to see if there is any
commonality with this Callendar Sq.

Mike,

I believe John has already responded to this, so don't know if you need any
more from me...

Haven't looked at the recent evidence, but I know in the past this site had
hit this Riposte lock problem 2 or 3 times within a few weeks. This problem
has been around for years and affects a number of sites most weeks, and
finally Escher say they have done something about it. I am interested in
whether they really have fixed it which it why I left the call open - to
remind me to check over the whole estate once $90 is live - call me cynical
but I do not just accept a 3rd party's word that they have fixed something!

What I never got to the bottom of, having usually had more pressing things
to do, was why this outlet was particularly prone to the problem. Possibly
because they follow some particular procedure/sequence which makes it more
likely to happen? This could still be worth investigating, especially if
they have continuing problems, but I don't think it is worthwhile until we
know the $90 position.

Please note that KELs tell SMC that they must contact sites and warn them of
balancing problems if they notice the event storms caused by the held lock
and advise them to reboot the affected counter before continuing with the
balance. Unfortunately in practice it seems to take SMC several hours to
notice these storms by which time the damage may have been done.

John, Did you get time to look at this ? do we think all will be well after
$90 counter rollout ?.

Rgs Mike

John, As Anne is away could I have your comments as you were involved as
well.

Rgs Mike

Anne, You are always a good place to start, having read the call I see you
have left the following note:Call E-0510120769

Wed 01 February 2006 15:55 by PINICL / Saved: Wed 01 February 2006 15:55
Update by Anne Chambers:Category 40 -- Pending -- Incident Under
Investigation:The timeout events are apparently fixed in a new Riposte
version released at $90 - see PC0126376. I've looked at problems reported on
31st Jan - can't see why the system reported disconnected nodes, nor why the
same user could log on twice (except that this followed a session transfer
which silently failed, for no obvious reason). I don't think there were any
ill-effects. I think the best thing now is to see what happens after $90
I'll continue to keep this call open to remind me that this site should be
checked then.

I notice that in the early guise of this problem in the call it states the
PM as Female:

Wed 12 October 2005 17:39 by UK956078 / HSH1 Saved: Wed 12 October 2005
17:39 Pm was trying to transfer £2490 from node 7 onto node 2. She states
that she has accepted the transfer on node 2 but the system is not showing
this. On node 7 it is showing pending transfer but it is not showing on node
2. It appears on her transfer sheet as cmpleated.

At the bottom of this email re a magical £43k appearing and disapearing the
PM is Male He reports:

You may recall that in September the above office had major problems with
their Horizon system relating to transfers between stock units.

The Spmr has reported that he is again experiencing problems with transfers,
(05.01.06) which resulted in a loss of around £43k which has subsequently

POL00030241

rectified itself. I know that the Spmr has reported this to Horizon
Support , who have come back to him stating that they cannot find any
problem.

Clearly the Spmr is concerned as we have just spent a number of months
trying to sort out the first instance and he doesn't want a repeat
performance. He is convinced that there is something wrong with his Horizon
kit. I would be grateful if you could investigate this and give him any
support that you can. I'm due to visit the office tomorrow to have a look
at his paperwork and discuss the situation with him.

So apologies for the long windedness but I have been given this by Liz as a
problem so:

1. Is there a problem at this branch ? is it Horizon kit or is there an
issue with staff there ?

2. If there is an issue is this S90 release the cure ? how confident are
you/we it will fix the problem ?

3. $90 counter release due week 4th March. Getting Sarah to check if this
site is in the pilot 24th or just part of the general release 4th March.

Appreciate your comments please

Please see Shaun's questions below. I'm not aware of other branches having
this problem?

If this is an isolated incident how confident are we that the fix will work
and can they be moved up the pecking order for release?

Gary,
Thanks for looking into this for us. Couple of questions occur: -

Do we understand why this particular branch has been having problems? Or
are there other branches in the network that have been having this
problem?

Can this branch be front ended on the counter release of S90 such that
it gets the fix as soon as possible?

The e-mail from Liz suggests that there may be a reoccurence following
$90. What degree of certainty do we have that it will definitely be
fixed?

Sandra/Brian - Appreciate this is frustrating for the branch but from the
e-mail below you can see that the branches issue should be fixed with the
release of the $90 software. I have asked Gary above to see if we can put
this branch to the front of the queue for the $90 release. In the meantime
it is important that the branch continues to report any issues into HSD.

Hi Gary,
I have checked the call and this issue is scheduled to be resolved in $90.

$90 has already been deployed to the Datacentre and counter release is
scheduled to start 04/03/06, due for completion 14/04/06.

3rd line support has been discussing with the PM, and the last contact with
the branch (according to Powerhelp) was on 1st Feb. The call has been left
open for 3rd line to check to see if the issue reoccurs following s90.
Please let me know if I can provide any other assistance with this matter
Thanks

Gary,

Need your advise on this branch. There appears to be an ongoing problem at
this branch with transfers between SU's causing a receipts and payments
mismatch. This first came to my attention some 3 or 4 months ago, when the
branch was chasing up an error notice to account for a loss that they had
that was related to the R & P mismatch. I believe in that case that FS had
taken it on board and were investigating it as a problem (I seem to recall
it had a PinICL number). I had to do some chasing around with P & BA to
ensure that the error notice got issued, as there was a breakdown in
processes between them and FS relating to the BIM report.

Since then it appears to have happened again, although Fujitsu are saying
no issue could be detected. I am concerned that there is a fundamental flaw
with the branches configuration, and would be interested to know how FS put
the first issue to bed.

Let me know your thoughts.

Further to Sandra's email, I visited the branch with Sandra last week and
the Spmr provided clear documented evidence that something very wrong is
occurring with some of the processors when carrying out transfers between
stock units. To be absolutely sure from our side can we either carry out a
thorough check of the alleged faulty processors or swap them out.

Thanks
