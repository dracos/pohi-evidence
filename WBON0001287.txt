Angela, Rod

Attached is a short (9 page) draft statement of Paul Williams regarding the appointment of SPMRs in the 1990s. I'd be
grateful for your comments on this.

Angela — as you were an RMN in the late 90s, could you confirm that Paul's statement accurately reflects your
understanding?

Rod — Paul is on holiday next week so we would like this signed on Friday if possible,

Thanks

Andy

A revised version attached, which accepts all your changes and adds a few more changes from us. Would you mind
reviewing this again? I think we're nearly there.

‘A\so.... do you have a copy of any Subrem or ACC from the 1990s about the appointment process for
Subpostmasters. We've got a number of these from 2000 onwards but nothing from the 1990s.

Thanks
Andy

‘Thanks for your time earlier. Please find attached your draft statement for your comments. I've also attached a few
documents referred to in the statement for you to consider.

'd also be grateful for your thoughts on the Subrem attached. In particular...

Para 11 that reads...When the letter accepting appointment is returned, Sub Office Services should notify the
‘outgoing SubPostmaster in writing of the date of

transfer, with a reminder to have the SubPostmaster contract document (Red book) ready for passing on to
the incoming Subpostmaster. You should also notify all other interested parties (e.g. Payroll, National
Savings Bank, Girobank etc.) confirming date of transfer.

What is the Red Book? — The first version of the Subpostmaster Contract document was a loose leaf document
issued to branches in a red ring binder — hence the reference to the “Red Book’ — which is the Subpostmaster
Contract. As I explained when we spoke, the contract was, at first passed from postmaster to postmaster, so this line
in the subrem is a sensible requirement that the outgoing subpostmaster is reminded of the need to have this ready to
pass on to his/her successor.

Para 14 that reads.... At the transfer it is most important that signed copies are obtained of the form P.13
(Official Secrets Act), and acknowledgement of appointment. P250 and P272 should be completed for any
new assistant which may be employed also for completeness of identification of Sub office assistants we
would suggest a new P356 be raised. The officer responsible for the transfer should be careful to clearly
show which operational equipment and Rules Book are on hand. Completed forms P301 are required from
outgoing Subpostmasters and assistants.

What is the Rules Book? In the days before on-line systems like Horizon the Rules Book (actually a set of ring
binders) contained all the detailed operational instructions that might be needed in a branch. So although the on-site
and off-site training would teach an incoming postmaster how to conduct transactions, deal with collecting postmen
etc, the rules would be left on site so that there was set of reference material that could be consulted should the need
arise (e.g.a rare or uncommon transaction),

Thanks
