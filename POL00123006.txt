Hi Helen,
I also invited Gayle Peacock, but Angela will be attending. If she can't then Gayle. Otherwise that will be fine.

Regards
Rob

Hi Rob,

Can you please confirm what guests, outside of Sec Ops you wish to attend our meeting.
I believe that previously we had Angela Van-Den-Bogerd, Jarnail & Martin Smith.

Thanks
