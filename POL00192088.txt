Subject: Re: Horizon

Mrk, this is v helpful. Susan and I discussed last evening with one of our experienced external lawyers, and came up with
a similar idea of a discussion and resolution Forum, which could be chaired by a professional mediator.

We should play into the Board discussion and regroup afterwards.
