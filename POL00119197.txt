POST OFFICE LIMITED v JULIAN WILSON
REDDITCH MAGISTRATES COURT
COMMITTAL — 29TH APRIL 2009 AT 2PM
CASE NO: POLTD/0809/0126

The committal papers have been approved and served on the Defence Solicitors
and Court. I enclose your copy, together with copy Form 14A.

{GRO} will prosecute at Redditch Magistrates Court on . I understand the
Officer in the case has retained the original witness statements and he will attend
Court to hand these to our Agents.

As soon as I am aware of the defence requirements concerning witnesses I shall
inform you. Please then immediately obtain leave dates/dates to avoid of all of
those witnesses. When obtaining their dates to avoid, please let the witnesses
know that it is of the utmost importance that if any of their dates change and, in
particular, if a holiday is booked after they have given you their dates to avoid then
they should inform you, or this Office, immediately. Please then return the file to
this Office together with the dates to avoid

‘As you are aware, under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996,
witness orders are abolished. It is therefore, your responsibility to ensure the
voluntary attendance at court of witnesses, or to make arrangements to issue a
witness summons from the Court if a witness whose attendance is required
indicates that he/she is unwilling to attend.

In accordance with the most recent Practice Direction seven copies of the
antecedent documents must be prepared which must be sent to this Office. We
shall then forward copies to the Crown Court.

I understand that there is no sensitive material and nothing to undermine the case or

assist the Defence but nevertheless could you please document this on Forms
GS006D and GSOO06B as soon as possible.
