Royal Mail Holdings plc
Chairman and Chief Executive’s Statement

It has been a year of tough challenges and achievements involving a groundbreaking agreement with our people allowing the
modernisation of Royal Mail to proceed and changes to the Pension Plan put in place. The Group made an operating profit before
exceptionals of £162million, which, while down a third on the previous year, was ahead of expectations and was against the backdrop of a
3.2% year on year decline in the overall UK mails market volumes and an increase in the proportion of mail carried by rival operators.
Daunting challenges remain but the Group is now implementing plans to modernise the Letters business and ensure the Post Office
branch network has a sustainable future. Royal Mail's quality of service had been at or above target levels in the first quarter of 2007-08
but fell as a result of industrial action last summer and autumn. Despite the effects of industrial action, the large majority of mail was
back to being delivered at above target levels by the year end

Key elements of the year were:

© Landmark agreements with our people on pay, pensions and modernisation, enabling Royal Mail to launch the second phase of
modernisation of the Letters operations - through automation - using the investment provided by the Shareholder in the form of
commercial loans agreed in March 2007

© Reform of the Pension Plan to help the Company continue meeting the huge cash cost - of over £800million in the year - of both
ongoing and deficit contributions, while providing the best pension benefits Royal Mail can afford for its people.

© The launch of new products and services for customers including Tracked™ which allows the movement of parcels and packets
through the Royal Mail network to be tracked, and Online Business Account, which enables business customers to handle their
accounts electronically instead of by dockets. More new services are planned as the Company strengthens further its focus on
customer service.

© The first steps in the roll-out of new technology and equipment in delivery offices and mail centres ~ making the job better for our
people, improving the business's efficiency and, above all, providing the foundation and capability for new products and services for
customers.

© The launch of more new services and products by the Post Office to bring in new revenue and customers and help support the
branch network.

© Strong revenue growth by Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS, the Group's UK and European parcels businesses, both of which operate
in highly competitive markets. GLS is now by far the biggest contributor to Group profit.

Financial Performance

The biggest change in performance across the Group was the move from profitability to loss by the Royal Mail Letters business which
made a £3million operating loss on its £6 8billion revenue - down on the previous year despite the annual price increase in April 2007
The fall in mail volumes, continued downtrading by Royal Mail customers to lower priced products, and the increasing impact of
competition, resulted in Group operating profit falling by almost a third from £233milllion to £162milllion. If the impact of the Social
Network Payment (which supports loss-making Post Office branches) is taken out of the picture, Group operating profit in 2007-08 was
less than half the comparable figure in the previous year. The huge cost of servicing the Pension Plan continues to bear heavily on the
Company and has again had a huge impact on the operating profit.

Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

© Group revenue rose by just over £200million, largely driven by increased sales by GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide but also because
the 2007-08 accounts include the full €150million Social Network Payment to support loss-making Post Office branches while in
2006-07, only half of this payment, £75million, was included as revenue.

Revenue in Royal Mail Letters fell by £27million. The overall mail market declined again and volumes handled by Royal Mail fell 3.2%
- more than the 2.3% volume fall in the Letters business the previous year. The average daily mail bag now contains 80 million
letters; it was 83 million in 2006-07 so Royal Mail is handling on average three million fewer letters a day.

Royal Mail regulated prices rose in April 2007 by around 5% on average. However, there was continued downtrading in 2007-08 by
customers, for example, from First Class to Second, or from premium business mail services to less expensive ones. This trend,
together with volume falls, meant that overall revenue in the Letters business declined for the second year running,

© The Universal Service made an estimated loss - for the first time - of around £100million with the overall price controlled area of
the business making an estimated loss of around £200million

© Post Office Limited's revenue increased but when the additional impact in 2007-08 of the Social Network Payment is removed, the
underlying trend was downwards. There was less income overall from traditional business but this was partly offset by growth in
sales of new products and services.

© GLS grew its revenues through higher parcel volumes, with particularly strong growth in Eastern Europe, as well as from the
acquisition of ABX Belgium. There was also a beneficial impact in the accounts from the strengthening of the euro against Sterling
Profit fell by £1million, however, but this was again a strong performance by GLS as it operated in a difficult and highly competitive
market and had to make significant network changes to deal with recently changed road speed laws in France

© Parcelforce Worldwide grew its revenue in a market where competitive pressures got even tougher, and also increased its profit and
maintained its operating margin. Quality of service improved further to 96.5% for the year - an impressive performance in a crowded
marketplace

Pension Fund Reform

A series of changes to the Pension Plan began to take effect on 1 April 2008 after intensive talks with the unions and other employee
representatives that began a year earlier, and a formal consultation with every pension scheme member. The length of time taken over
talks and consultation reflected the Company's determination to listen carefully to the representations it received and as a result a
number of significant amendments were made to the original proposals first tabled in the early summer of 2007. The changes to the
fund were agreed by the Pension Trustee in March 2008. They encompass:

The Plan closed to new members from 31 March 2008

All pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 are still linked to final salary at the time of retirement

From 1 April 2008, defined benefits building up for employee members of the Plan are earned on a Career Salary basis.

Anew defined contribution plan will be launched in April 2009.

New recruits joining the Company from 31 March 2008 will be able to begin paying contributions to the new plan after they have

worked for the Company for a year.

Employees can continue to take their pension on reaching 60 but the normal retirement age will increase to 65 for benefits earned
from 1 April 2010.

«From 1 April 2010 it will be possible to draw pension earned before the change to normal retirement age at 60, and continue

working while still contributing into the Pension Plan until the maximum level of benefits has been reached

The action taken to reform the Pension Plan, together with the establishment of a € billion escrow account for the sole benefit of the
Plan, if needed, has enabled the Group to have an achievable funding programme based on the last actuarial valuation of the deficit of
£3.4billion in March 2006. However our estimates indicate that the actuarial deficit has since increased significantly due to market
changes, further underlining how pensions remain a significant and volatile risk to the Group. The continuing heavy cash calls on the
Company - more than £800miillion in 2007-08 - to service the Plan and pay the deficit - demonstrates again how crucial itis for the
Company to succeed in modernising the Letters business and provide a sustainable future for the Post Office network. The Pension Plan
deficit fell in accounting terms from £5.0billion to £2.9billion

Royal Mail - modernisation underway

The landmark agreement on pay, pensions and modernisation reached with the CWU in the autumn of 2007 has opened the door for the
roll-out of a far-reaching modernisation plan for Royal Mail on which its future hangs. The technology we are now deploying is tried and
tested so we know it can be effective. The task facing everyone in the Letters business is to make it work for Royal Mail and, crucially, our
customers.

The work underway includes:

© The deployment of the first of a new range of sorting equipment to deal with “flats”, the A4 sized magazine, catalogues and
brochures which make up around one in six items of the typical daily mail bag

© Successful trials for hand-held keypads that allow postmen and women to record customers’ confirmation of the delivery of packets,
and other mail such as Special Delivery - a huge improvement on the traditional paper-based method.

© Contracts have been placed for a wide array of sorting equipment, including upgrades for existing Integrated Mail Processors (IMPs),
and replacements for existing automated mail sorters. By March 2008 the codemark printers that print machine-readable
instructions on mail to speed its sortation had all been replaced. In addition, to date, 21 IMPs have been upgraded.

© We have ordered 400 walk-sequencing machines the first of which will be delivered to the network this summer under a
deployment programme that will last around two years. Trials have been successful, both operationally and from the perspective of
delivery postmen and women who have been pleased at the machines’ capability in sorting mail down to the route they follow on a
round, vastly reducing the need to sort the mail manually.

The new technology will, we are confident, improve efficiency and cut costs. But we are very clear that one of the greatest benefits of
modernisation is the foundation it provides from which to launch new products and services for customers, so meeting their needs and
expectations, and improving Royal Mail's competitive edge in a market where competition is rapidly increasing. We will be launching
further new products and services this current year with the aim both of providing customers with innovative solutions while at the same
time making it easier for them to do business with Royal Mail

Our strategy for the Letters business is to implement programmes that will provide a more efficient operation, improve Royal Mails ability
to compete and, crucially, have products and services that both satisfy and excite customers large and small. We are aiming at delivering
a hitherto unseen degree of flexibility and responsiveness by Royal Mail

Post Office Limited - creating a sustainable network

Among the most difficult challenges of the year has been the implementation of the Government's decision to close up to 2,500 Post
Office branches. The closure of any branch is always difficult as every outlet is appreciated by its customers, and subpostmasters are
rightly regarded as key members of the communities they serve.

The Network Change programme, therefore, which is reducing the size of the branch network in line with the funding provided from the
Shareholder, is a major challenge for the business. We are seeking to implement the programme as sensitively as possible, and create the
most accessible network within the customer access criteria determined by the Government. There have been more than 75,000
responses to the programme by the end of March 2008, around the halfway mark, and the high level of feedback from customers shows
the attachment communities feel to their local branches, despite the fact that some four million fewer people have been visiting a Post
Office branch each week compared to three years ago

That reduction has been spurred by a further decline in traditional products and services on offer in our branches or, in the case of the TV
Licence, the ending of the service altogether. Card Account transactions went down in 2007-08 and more motorists renewed their car tax
online rather than at a Post Office counter.

However, declines in traditional revenue were partly offset by income from new services we have introduced with new products launched
in 2007-08. We are now:

Selling one in 50 of all car insurance policies in the UK;
Issuing one in every 40 new credit cards in the UK;
Insuring one in every 200 homes in the UK; and
Handling savings from almost half a million savers.

The business's stretching goal remains - to create a network that has long-term sustainability. We are investing in our Crown office
network to improve their attractiveness to customers, and have agreed a new remuneration package for subpostmasters, giving them
greater rewards for achieving product sales; we are cutting our overheads and reducing back office costs for the computer system that
links the network, and we will continue to develop new products and services.

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

Many achievements - but many challenges remain

The Group began its journey of transformation in 2002 when change on the scale we have already achieved was regarded by many as
unthinkable and unachievable. At that time, we were failing quality of service targets repeatedly, the Company was losing more than
£1million a day and without change, our chances of succeeding in a changing and opening market were non-existent

We've demonstrated we can deliver consistent, target-beating quality of service; the Group is profitable and has the funding in place to
modernise; strategies are underway to achieve a transformation of the Letters business and to create a sustainable Post Office network;
and we have a determination to succeed, spurred on by the hurdles we have already overcome.

Daunting challenges remain

© Our tender for the new contract for the Card Account handling benefit and pension payments for many of the most vulnerable
people in society from April 2010 is currently being considered in competition with other bids and it is vital for the future health of
the Post Office network that we succeed in winning the work.

© Modernising Royal Mail to make it much more efficient while providing flexible and responsive products and services to our
customers is a challenge in its own right but to meet it in a market where mail volumes are now falling and with heavy cash calls on
the business from its pension fund will be very stretching indeed

© Online shopping has provided opportunities across our business but it has also created more competition at the delivery end,
affecting not just the Royal Mail Letters business but Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS.

©The costs of funding the new technology that is now being rolled out to the Letters business will increasingly be felt, as the
Shareholder's financing package comprises loans at commercial rates that do, of course, have to be repaid from our earnings

We are contributing to the independent review of the impact to date of competition on the UK postal service. The key issue will be the
preservation of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service which, in 2007-08 is estimated to have lost around £100miillion - the
first time there has been a loss in this vital bedrock of the postal service which is a powerful benefit to the UK economy and every user of
the postal service. The question begging an answer is how to preserve and nurture the Universal Service when the only business with a
commitment to delivering it - Royal Mail Letters - is now loss-making, The Letters business has traditionally relied on profit from business
mail - the only part of the market to face competition from other operators - to underpin the Universal Service, which is used by social
customers to send personal letters, birthday cards and Christmas greetings, by businesses, large and small, and Government, both local
and central. We are very clear that the answer, in part at least, has got to involve regulation reduced to a minimum so that Royal Mail has
the freedom to compete fully in both the postal and wider communications market - while having the right amount of protection for social
customers and small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) who are finding that other mail carriers have no interest in competing for their
letters and cards, when stamped mail loses on average 6p a letter.

Our overall vision through this review is to achieve a high quality, efficient and profitable Universal Service with a Price Control focused on
our social customers and SMEs and forming the backbone of an innovative fully competitive business mail market - provided by an
efficient, transformed, integrated and lightly regulated Royal Mail competing with a variety of rivals, both wholesale and end-to-end.
Central to achieving this vision is the need to continue to take and execute the often difficult decisions that will turn Royal Mail Group into
a world class postal services company.

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Annual Review 2007-08

This has been a year of huge significance for the future of the Company. A groundbreaking deal was agreed on modernisation of the
Letters business and reform of the Pension Plan. New products and services were launched and the Company continued working to
reduce its environmental impact while investing in the health and wellbeing of its people. There were also remarkable achievements by
individual employees who demonstrated again our people's dedication and service to the communities in which they live and work. The
difficult Network Change programme, crucial to creating a sustainable Post Office got underway as we began to implement the
Government decision to reduce the size of the branch network in line with the available funding,

Giving back to the community

Simon Illingworth was named Royal Mail's “Postman of the Year” at the business’ 2008 1* Class People Awards. Thousands of customers
put forward their postman or woman for an “unsung hero” accolade. Simon had run more than 20 marathons to raise £7,000 for charity
and awareness of testicular cancer, having been being diagnosed with the disease himself.

More than 12,000 people across the Company took part in fundraising activities in 2007-08 while individuals themselves dipped into their
own pockets to support charities with 50,000 of our people - more than one in every four - making payroll donations directly from their
wages. It means our people contributed at the rate of almost £300 every hour of every day and the large number of payroll donors
across the Group compares to just 4% of the overall working population who contribute to charities via payroll giving. The Company's
encouragement for payroll giving and its people's generosity were recognised with prizes and accolades at the Institute of Fundraising’s
National Payroll Giving Awards in October 2007

A three year partnership - the first of its kind for Royal Mail - between the Company and Help the Hospices raised £2 million for the
charity - double the target of £1 million. More than 10,000 employees took part in fundraising activities - a tremendous level of support -
and nearly 6,000 gave payroll donations,

There were further improvements in attendance at Royal Mail last year with absence rates having fallen by more than 20% over the last
five years. Initiatives in 2007-08 which had helped drive the improvement included campaigns focusing on health promotion such as
advice on diet and nutrition. There were health fairs in a number of workplaces, a health bus toured many of our offices and centres,
while an internet facility was set up to provide health and lifestyle advice online

Royal Mail also began a four year partnership with Access to Work and Jobcentre Plus, to encourage the employment of disabled people
to build on our existing efforts to welcome applications from all sections of the community and nurture diversity in our workforce.

Working towards a better environment

The Company has set itself the goal of operating in a carbon neutral way by 2015. In 2007-08, the Letters business took delivery of 140
double-deck trailers, each with the capacity to hold 50 per cent more mail than conventional trailers. We are seeking, through these
trailers, to reduce carbon emissions by cutting road mileage annually by the equivalent of twice the circumference of the earth

The Company has also developed an online calculator so that any employee can easily calculate their environmental impact and make
donations to the Woodland Trust to allow the charity to plant trees to offset carbon emissions. The online calculator has been gifted to the
Woodland Trust, which has called on other companies to follow Royal Mail's lead.

‘A further initiative in the Letters business has involved the provision of telemetry technology in around 8,000 vehicles with training in its
use for the drivers. The equipment tracks the vehicles’ movements, fuel consumption, speed and braking patterns so that the best routes
can be chosen in tandem with the best way of driving the vehicle, to minimise its carbon output. Royal Mail is aiming to cut its fuel usage
by 2.5 million litres of diesel a year through use of the technology as well as reducing the number of vehicles it has on the road.

Technology leads new product development

Despite the decline in overall mail volumes, Royal Mail saw further growth in its delivery of goods ordered online, Christmas 2007 saw
Royal Mail deliver a record 120 million iterns which had been ordered online. In July 2007, the business handled orders for 600,000
copies of JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - a copy for one in every 43 homes in the UK

New technical developments also improved the service for online shoppers - Royal Mail's Tracked™ service allows customers to track the
progress of their order online while the Safeplace service was launched allowing shoppers to specify a safe place at their address - for
example, a garden shed - where a package can be left safely if nobody is at home to take personal delivery.

Royal Mail also launched a number of initiatives designed to strengthen the effectiveness of direct mail as a key advertising and marketing
medium. “Sensational” mail allows companies to build on the visual impact of direct mail by incorporating other features that engage
senses other than eyesight. For example, a mailshot can include a relevant aroma or taste about a product or service to heighten the
impact when the mail is opened.

A partnership with Sony DADC allows advertisers and marketers to include in their mailing a CD which is personalised for the recipient of
the mail. The combination of traditional post with digital technology allows companies to communicate with a wide range of their
customers but in a personal, tailored way for each of them.

As part of its investment in data services, Royal Mail has also launched a new source of expert advice on direct mail aimed at improving
the effectiveness of direct mail campaigns.

Celebrations through stamps
Royal Mail's Special Stamps issues in 2007-08 covered a diverse range of subjects. The enthusiasm for Harry Potter was celebrated in a
set of stamps which featured illustrations from the series of books which have captured the imagination of children and many adults for a
decade.

Another set of stamps with a literary theme paid tribute to lan Fleming's fictional secret agent, James Bond, showcasing book jackets from
the novels including titles such as Dr No and Casino Royale

‘Arnold Machin's iconic image of the Queen which has appeared on more than 175 billion stamps has been famously unchanged since its
introduction in 1967. A miniature sheet was issued in June 2007 to celebrate this timeless, masterwork of modern art and it included a
picture of Machin himself on one of the stamps.

Ten rare British birds featured on the first of a series of stamps showing how endangered UK species are benefiting from conservation
work. The set featured the corncrake, the white-tailed eagle and the avocet, the emblem of the Royal Society for the Preservation of
Birds. The next issue available from May, will feature six of the best-loved Cathedrals in the UK

Building a new Post Office - “The People’s Post Office”

Just over three years after launching its financial services partnership with the Bank of Ireland, the Post Office has served its one millionth
customer - in May 2007 - and has continued to grow. During the year the number of customers increased further by over one third,
making the Post Office one of the fastest growing financial service providers in the UK. The achievement means that the Post Office

© sells one in 50 of all car insurance policies in the UK:
* issues one in every 40 credit cards in the UK;

© insures one in every 200 homes in the UK; and

* has almost half a million savings customers.

The portfolio of financial services grew further in 2007-08 with the launch of a Post Office mortgage, which quickly established a
reputation as one of the best rates available in the housing market, while other new services launched in 2007-08 included life cover for
the over 50s and PayOut, which enables payments to be made using barcoded letters or text messages, avoiding the need to issue
cheques.

The MoneyGram service, which customers can use to send cash swiftly and securely abroad, was extended to every branch in the
network. Growing numbers of people took out a Post Office insurance policy to cover their car, van or home with the number of active
policies exceeding 600,000.

The Post Office's commitment to providing free access to cash was underlined by the installation in December 2007 of the business’ one
thousandth fee-free ATM. More cash machines are being added every week to the network of branches with the aim of making the Post
Office, with its banking partner, the Bank of Ireland, one of the biggest providers of cash machines nationwide.

A television advertising campaign featuring a number of celebrities including Joan Collins and the boy band, Westlife, helped raise
awareness of the wide range of services available in “The People’s Post Office.” These have included the launch of the broadband service,
designed to appeal to a wide range of customers including older people who may not have been online before but are seeking the re-
assurance of the trusted Post Office brand, as well as those customers who want to pay for the service in cash at a Post Office branch
rather than set up a standing order.

The Post Office’s Christmas Savings Club was launched in January 2008 to provide savers with a simple and safe way to save for the
festive season. From February 2008, the Post Office offered a pet insurance scheme to its customers.

Parcelforce Worldwide

Parcelforce Worldwide's impressive underlying growth in revenue and volume of over 10% outpaced the UK express parcels market in
2007-08, with a key driver behind the increase coming from high quality of service which improved on the previous year’s performance.
Quality over the Christmas period was excellent when processed volumes hit an all time record of 325,000 on 18 December 2007

The business also helped reduce its environmental impact with a carbon offsetting scheme allowing customers despatching goods online
to make a donation via the Woodland Trust. With around 25% of online retail users using the scheme, it demonstrates both the business's
commitment to reducing its carbon footprint as well as the appetite among customers to support effective environmental programmes.

A comprehensive review of service was conducted during 2007-08, resulting in plans for additional service developments. The business is
aiming to announce in the summer of 2008 the first two of a number of initiatives to drive further growth.

General Logistics Systems
Royal Mail's European operation, General Logistics Systems (GLS), continued to grow and develop its operations as the “Quality leader in
European parcels logistics”. GLS provides reliable, high quality parcel services, logistics and express services throughout Europe.

Through its own start-up companies, acquisitions and its network partners, GLS has created a strong European network providing
customers with services in 36 European states. In August 2007, GLS Romania was established and a new franchise area was acquired in
Milan in October 2007 - increasing the number of GLS managed depots in Italy to 26. In March 2008, new global partnership
agreements were signed with MNG Cargo in Turkey, and GATI in India

In addition to the investments in the physical network, the continuing development of information technology remains an area of specific
focus. GLS's European parcel shops, where private or commercial customers can take parcels for delivery, increased by more than 1,000
to 6,362 outlets

GLS's network now comprises 32 central transhipment points and 655 depots, providing services through wholly owned and partner
companies in 36 European states. A workforce of over 13,000 people and nearly 18,000 vehicles deliver 335 million parcels annually for
220,000 customers throughout Europe, generating £1,232m of revenue in the last year.

Operating and Financial Review

Introduction

Our Pension Schemes

Royal Mail Group Ltd is the sponsoring employer for the Royal Mail Pension Plan and Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (both
defined benefit schemes), and for the Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan (a defined contribution scheme). Based on assets, the Royal
Mail Pension Plan is the fourth largest pension scheme in the UK.

The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes, as measured under accounting standards, are reported as a net pension deficit in
the Group balance sheet. The gross assets and liabilities and the net deficit are significantly larger than any of the Group's other assets
and liabilities. This results in the Group being one of the most exposed UK corporates to pension scheme volatility, particularly with
respect to movements in equity values and bond rates.

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd made a loss in 2007-08, after bearing losses relating to stamped mail and carrying out its Universal Service
Obligation. In addition it has been facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed investment in plant and equipment
and funding its pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition. On 23 March 2007 a funding package
totalling £1.2bn up until 2016 was completed with Government.

The European Commission is continuing its investigation under the EC Treaty’s rules on State Aid into a series of funding measures taken
by the United Kingdom Government in its capacity as Shareholder in favour of Royal Mail between 2001 and 2007, including the funding
agreement completed on 23 March 2007. In its response to the EC in relation to this investigation the United Kingdom Government has
stated that it believes that the measures being investigated by the EC were concluded on commercial terms.

Post Office Limited

Following a consultation process, on 17 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now Secretary of State for Business
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) announced (i) a funding package for Post Office Limited up to March 2011, (ii) a closure programme
involving the compulsory compensated closure of up to 2,500 Post Office branches and (iii) the imposition of certain access criteria
designed to ensure the continued maintenance of a national network of Post Office branches. As part of the funding package, the Group
received £313m during the year under the Industrial Development Act 1982, to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of
providing certain specified “services of general economic interest’. An additional £150m (2007 £75m) was paid to Post Office Limited
during the year to fund the maintenance of a rural network of post offices, which was recorded within revenue as a Social Network
Payment - in the prior year an additional £75m of such costs were borne by the Group from reserves

Both of the above payments made during 2007-08 were in accordance with approval received from the European Commission under
relevant State Aid rules.

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Group Financial Analysis

In the following analysis, all references to operating profit are before exceptional items. The 2006-07 operating profit has been restated
for each UK operating business unit due to the impact of the new subsidiary Royal Mail Estates Limited, as explained in note 3. There is
no impact on the Group operating profit. As 2007-08 is a 53 week period and 2006-07 was a 52 week period, where relevant, revenue
and costs have been restated to make them more comparable

This year we report an operating profit of £162m compared to £233m for 2006-07, a fall of £71m (30.4%), driven by the worsening
performance of Royal Mail. Although Post Office Limited's position has improved, this is wholly attributable to the additional £75m from
Government for the Social Network Payment (SNP) compared to last year.

External Revenue

Group external revenue increased by £209m (2.3%), from £9,179m to £9,388m driven by increases in GLS, Post Office Limited,
Parcelforce Worldwide and Other businesses, offset by a decline in Royal Mail despite the impact of the additional week. The 53 week
this year has increased Group revenue by £113m; therefore underlying revenue growth is 1.0%

Royal Mail revenue declined by £27m (0.4%) even with an average price increase on regulated products in April 2007 of around 5%
Declining market volumes, increased losses to competition and customers continuing to downtrade to cheaper products have led to this
decline, with the only growth area for revenue being Downstream Access, ie. increasing competition

General Logistics Systems increased its revenue by £150m (13.9%) from £1,082m to £1,232m, driven by volume growth in domestic and
export parcels - this includes the impact of acquisitions - and the strengthening of the euro. Parcelforce Worldwide increased its revenue
by £42m (12.5%) from £337m to £379m, through higher volumes particularly in regional and international sales. Post Office Limited
showed a revenue increase of £43m (5.0%) from £868m to £911m, although without the £150m (2007 £75m) SNP received from
Government, there was an underlying decline in revenue of £32m to £761m. This reduction is due to the revenue decline in Government
and financial services exceeding the growth in revenue from the telephony products stream.

Costs (excluding exceptional items)
Total costs of £9,273m have increased from £8,985m by £288m (3.2%). The additional week this year has increased Group costs by
£112m; therefore the underlying increase is 2.0%

People costs of £6,209m represent 67% of the Group's cost base, and have increased year on year by £64m (1.0%) - this includes the
impact of the 53 week. The majority of front line staff received an increase of 5.4% on basic pay and weekday overtime from 1 October
2007. After adjusting for the impact of the additional week, people costs actually reduced year on year, reflecting efficiencies delivered to
absorb the impact of the pay award.

Distribution and conveyance costs of £1,341m, representing 14% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £104m (8.4%). This is driven
mainly by GLS (including acquisitions) and Parcelforce Worldwide, and their associated costs of volume growth.

Other operating costs of £1,723m, representing 19% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £120m (7.5%). This includes increases in

redundancy) 42 51 principally relates to an actuarial gain of £1,798m and net pensions
Within operating profit 743 773__ interest of £131m.

The actuarial gain arose due to changes in market conditions giving rise to an increase in the assumed real discount rate, although this
has been partly offset by a lower than expected return on the assets in line with general market returns. This gain is recorded in the
statement of recognised income and expense.

The net pensions interest reflects the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes’ assets, less the unwinding of the discount on the
schemes’ liabilities. Although liabilities are higher than assets, the expected rate of return on these assets (biased toward equities) was
substantially higher than the discount rate for liabilities (high quality corporate bond rate) resulting in a net interest credit. This interest is
recorded in the income statement after (loss)/profit before financing and taxation.

As part of the recent funding package, the Group established £1bn of investments in escrow shortly before the 2007 year end as security
for the Royal Mail Pension Plan, in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from 31 March 2006.

deficit contributions.

Share of Profits in Joint Ventures and Associates

The Group's share of profits in joint ventures and associates of £47m (2007 £39m) comprises profits from Post Office Limited's Bureau
de Change joint venture (First Rate Exchange Services Holdings Limited), Camelot Group plc associate - UK National Lottery operator,
Quadrant Catering Limited our catering associate, Post Office Limited's financial services associate (Midasgrange Limited) and G3
Worldwide (Spring) N.V. our international mail distribution associate.

Net Exceptional Items

Net exceptional items of £383m (2007 £125m) comprise operating exceptionals of £441m (2007 £243m) offset in part by profits from
property disposals of £58m (2007 £118m with £74m arising from the disposal of a property group). Operating exceptional costs include
£277m for ColleagueShare costs (2007 £nil), £165m for redundancy (2007 £180m), a £141m exceptional charge for subpostmasters’
compensation (2007 Enil), £97m for impairments (2007 £64m), £43m for Agency Network Change programme and WH Smith project
costs (2007 £nil), £10m exceptional property charges (2007 £1m credit) with other Group restructuring costs amounting to £21m (2007
£nil). This was offset in part by Government grant income of £313m (2007 £nil) received to compensate Post Office Limited for providing
certain specified “services of general economic interest’.

ColleagueShare Scheme

On 17 May 2007 the Group introduced a phantom share scheme, ColleagueShares; all associated costs for the year have been treated as.
an operating exceptional item. The value of ColleagueShares is based on a Group share plan valuation model which is updated regularly.
This has generated a discounted charge to the income statement of £116m for 2007-08. Fully eligible employees have been allocated
408 notional shares in the Company with part time staff holding a proportion of this amount. Further allocations will be made over the
next two years. ColleagueShares will be sold back to the Company by 2012 and each fully eligible employee has the opportunity to receive
up to £3,700 from the sale of the phantom shares. A related stakeholder dividend for the year totalling £161m represents a payment of
up to £800 to each eligible employee in recognition of meeting certain Group and business unit targets. This is payable in 2008-09.

Net Finance Income

Net finance income of £13m (2007 £6m) comprises finance income of £84m (2007 £62m), offset by finance costs of £71m (2007
£56m). The increase in finance income of £22m is mainly due to higher average investment volumes and higher average investment
rates, The increase in finance costs of £15m is mainly due to higher commitment, arrangement and advisor fees on the Royal Mail Group
Ltd loan facilities from Government and higher average borrowing rates, partially offset by lower average borrowing volumes.

Net pensions interest
Net pensions interest of £131m (2007 £199m), a non-cash item for the Group, has decreased by £68m as a result of expected returns
on Plan assets increasing by less than the interest on Plan liabilities as a result of the increase in the discount rate.

Taxation

The taxation credit in the income statement of £212m comprises £25m current tax receivable with respect to UK operations, a £29m
current tax charge on overseas profits, a UK deferred tax credit of £226m and an overseas deferred tax charge of £10m. A tax charge of
£18m was taken directly to equity. Last year a taxation charge of £27m was recorded comprising £45m current tax charge with respect
to UK operations, a £31m current tax charge on overseas profits, a £59m UK deferred tax credit and a £10m overseas deferred tax
charge, with a credit of £27m being taken directly to equity. The tax credit reported in relation to the pre-tax loss is mainly due to the
increased amount of deferred tax asset recognised

for property improvements and the remaining £67m (2007 £65m) on software. This analysis includes £36m (2007 £52m) in respect of
GLS projects. The expenditure was offset by inflows of £71m (2007 £65m) mainly from surplus property disposals and £nil (2007 £71m)
relating to the sale of a property group.

Acquisition and sale of financial assets of £61m outflow (2007 £318m) represents the net purchase of investments made by the Group
from cash and cash equivalent resources. It principally relates to interest of £57m on the investments in escrow, provided as security for
the Royal Mail Pension Plan. The comparative figure for 2007 represents the investment of £11bn in escrow partially funded by the
realisation of other investments.

During the prior year, five ordinary shares in the Company were issued to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under section
63(1) of the Postal Services Act 2000. The consideration of £430m was used to fund ongoing cash and funding requirements for Post
Office Limited, including repayment of advances from Royal Mail Group Ltd.

Net drawdown/(repayment) of borrowings and financing of £33m inflow (2007 £64m outflow) largely comprises £55m cash received
(2007 Enil) on sale and leasebacks offset by £20m (2007 £60m) net repayment of the Department of Business Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform (BERR) loans to Post Office Limited

Provisions

Provisions at the end of March 2008 were £411m (2007 £111m). The £300m net increase comprises new provisions relating to
ColleagueShares, restructuring and onerous property contracts of £478m offset by cash spend of £149m and transfers to short-term
pension creditors of £29m.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Operating and Financial Review (continued)
Treasury Management

The Group operates a central Treasury function that manages £1.1bn of financial asset investments (substantially all of which are now
held in escrow in favour of the pension fund trustees) and £1.4bn of cash and cash equivalent investments (including £933m cash in the
Post Office network funded mainly by a Government loan facility), in accordance with investment restrictions set by the Government. It
also manages £847 of financial liabilities and acts as internal banker for the Group's business units. The Group finances its operations
largely through cash generated from its operations, borrowings and grants.

Group Treasury derives its authority from the Royal Mail Holdings plc Board, and provides quarterly monitoring reports for their review. It
only has the authority to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of the underlying business risks; it does not engage
in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre. All strategies are risk averse, and the treasury policy has remained
substantially unchanged during the year. The principal financial instruments are Treasury bills, Government gilt edged securities, deposits
and long and short term borrowings.

‘At the balance sheet date the Group is financed from the following facilities provided by BERR:

other creditors.

‘On 18 April 2008, the facility was extended until March 2011.

The terms of the Government borrowing facility and the associated Framework Agreement impose strict constraints on the separation of
cash funds within the Group and the purposes for which they can be used.

The principal treasury risks arising from the Group's activities are currency, counterparty, commodity (fuel) and liquidity risk. These are
managed as follows:

© the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and
delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, revaluation of the currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within
Post Office Limited and various sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency. Hedging programmes managed by
Group Treasury mitigate these risks. Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a
combination of external spot and forward contracts;

the Group's obligation to pay overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket currency
comprising of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro. The Group has a policy of matching receipts and payments for
individual currencies where possible and then hedging any material net exposure. The policy is that up to 80% of the forecast net
exposure is hedged with agreement of the internal business unit. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month programme, which is
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. There has been no external hedge in place throughout the financial year 2007-08 due
to there being no material net exposure;

© Bureau de Change balances are grouped into baskets of closely correlated currencies. Each currency basket (e.g. US$ or euro) is
then sold forward, up to 100% of the exposure, creating a liability to match the underlying asset,

© significant foreign currency risk arising from capital purchase contracts, primarily in euro, may be hedged up to 100% depending
upon the reliability of the forecast of the underlying cash flows;

© the Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries;

© the Group is exposed to fuel risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe and a jet fuel risk from the
purchasing of air freight services. The Group's fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements
in the oil and foreign currency markets. The strategy operates within the parameters set by the Board, which allow the use of over-
the-counter derivative products to manage up to 100% of these exposures:

© the Group actively manages its liquidity risk through regular reviews of plan and budget projections against all available sources of
funding. The projected headroom on these sources of financing is assessed regularly for adequacy; and

© counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure to any individual counterparty based on their financial strength.
These exposures are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate.

The policies for financial assets - investments and derivative financial instruments - are shown in note 2.

Business Environment

Regulation

Until the last few years, Royal Mail had a monopoly status in the UK letters industry. However, in 2000 the Postal Services Act created an
independent postal Regulator - Postcomm - and allowed Royal Mail to have greater commercial freedom. Postcomm regulates the prices
of nearly 90% of Royal Mail's letters business, controls the terms and conditions for nearly all its services, sets the quality of service
targets and determines compensation arrangements.

Post Office Limited is increasingly subject to regulation in financial services (Financial Services Authority) and in telephony (Ofcom). Post
Office Limited is an appointed representative of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, which in turn is regulated directly by
both the Irish Financial Regulator and Financial Services Authority (FSA) for conduct in the UK.

Itis the Group's policy to be fully compliant with the regulatory framework in which we operate. During 2007-08 we continued to
strengthen our compliance activities working in close liaison with our Regulators.

Competition

The Group's business units now all operate in a competitive marketplace. Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS have been operating in an open
market since their inception. These units have demonstrated their ability to perform in a non-regulated and competitive environment,
which is reflected in their annual results.

Post Office Limited, due to a reduction in income from benefit payments and a significant and continuing decrease in Government use,
has developed revenue streams from financial services products (including car and home insurance, a ‘two-in-one’ credit card and range
of savings products) and its HomePhone and broadband services. These products are in direct competition with services offered by banks,
insurance and telephony companies, as are many of the services it continues to offer, e.g. bill payments, renewal of car tax discs and
travel services.

Royal Mail's operating environment has gradually been opened up to competition since February 2004, with the letters market fully
liberalised in January 2006, well in advance of the rest of Europe. Competitors are now able to offer customers the opportunity of end-
to-end service for the collection, sorting and delivery of their mail

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Major Regulatory Activity in 2007-08

In November 2007 the Group responded to Postcomm’s Strategy Review “Emerging Themes” and believes that four key regulatory
principles need to be addressed which will result in a truly competitive industry whereby all stakeholders benefit:

*  Realign prices to underlying costs - to create transparency for business customers and to ensure that competition is sustainable.
Some competitors in the UK are basing their entry strategies on unsustainable business models that target the historical cross-
subsidies in Royal Mail's pricing structure, but cross-subsidies are fundamentally incompatible with an effectively functioning
competitive market. Royal Mail believes it should be allowed to remove these cross-subsidies, so that customers face the right pricing
signals and competitor models going forward are based on efficiency;

© Anarrower range of universal service products - focused on the needs of all social customers and fully funded through stamp prices.
Business customers tell us they do not need the protection that the Universal Service Obligation (USO) provides - Postcomm.
describes many of these customers as “non-captive” and we agree, given the ample choice they have across mail and other
communications providers. The USO should therefore be refocused on stamped mail only, and prices should reflect the true costs of
this provision;

© Full retail deregulation of business products - the explosion in access competition, representing 40% of bulk mail this year, is
encouraging business customers to demand more commercial and innovative responses from Royal Mail. However, Royal Mail is
prevented from responding rapidly by regulatory requirements such as an involved process for changing terms and conditions. Royal
Mail envisages a near term future in which the intense competition in the business mail market replaces the need for regulation; and

© Continued operational integration of the postal network - we have put in place measures to ensure that competitors and customers
have access to our network on fair and reasonable terms. Separation of the postal network would create confusion for customers,
introduce complex and costly interfaces, endanger quality of service and put at risk delivery of the transformation programme.

In March 2007, Postcomim commenced an Interim Review. Royal Mail has asked Postcomm to consider the following pricing proposals in
this review, all of which are consistent with realigning prices to costs and entirely driven by the need to react to both the volume erosion
and significant downtrading that has been evident for the last eighteen months:

© Reducing the headroom between Downstream Access (DSA) and the equivalent retail prices from a high level set to encourage
competition, to a level which reflects the underlying upstream costs, because entry has been significantly higher than the Price
Control assumptions;

© Allowing Royal Mail retail business to price its non-USO bulk mail products by zone, thereby making prices of cheap to deliver areas
lower by up to 5% and prices of expensive to deliver areas higher by up to 5%. This does not change the price of the “one price goes
anywhere” stamp;

© Allowing Royal Mail to further rebalance its prices so that it has the flexibility it needs to keep up with the pace of change in the
postal sector; and

* Providing dispensation to Royal Mail with respect to bulk mail compensation and C factor adjustments if they are directly linked to
service failures relating to industrial action over Royal Mail's transformation plan

In January 2008, Postcomm confirmed the following decisions with respect to its Interim Review:

Its rejection of a change to the headroom between DSA and equivalent retail prices;
‘sts rejection of Royal Mail's retail zonal application; and
‘* Its agreement to increase the level of rebalancing,

Royal Mail continues to work with Postcomm on industrial action dispensation.

In December 2007, BERR announced a review of the UK postal services market to examine the impacts of liberalisation of UK postal
services, trends in the future market development and the likely impact of this on Royal Mail, alternative carriers and consumers. Royal
Mail has submitted its first response to this review in March 2008 followed by its second response in May 2008.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a key component in supporting the business to be recognised as a responsible organisation that
seeks to optimise the beneficial impacts inherent in our business and reduce the negative impacts. Through improving our CSR
performance and ensuring it is integrated into the way we work, we can make ourselves more productive and competitive. We are
working to reduce the number of accidents, reduce our production of CO> and make our people healthier. We recognise that the route to
achieving and sustaining our goals is through our people and our relationship with customers, business partners, suppliers, communities
and other stakeholders.

‘A more comprehensive overview of our CSR will be found in the annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, to be published later in the
year.

Key Relationships
The Group has several key relationships that are critical to its day-to-day activities and its overall success.

People - Our people are the lifeblood of the organisation and brands. Without their continued support and dedication it will be impossible
to function on a day-to-day basis and embrace the change within our markets. Training, diversity, flexible resourcing and making the
business a great place to work are some of the ways we continue to improve this relationship.

Unions - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents non-managerial staff, with Unite the Union - Communication and
Managers’ Association (CMA) sector representing managerial staff. The Group’s policy is to work with the CWU and CMA to engage staff in
the development and execution of business decisions.

Pension trustees - Our pension trustee board for the main pension plan comprises an independent chairman plus 10 people including
employees, union representatives, a pensioner and independent members. They take external professional advice, from Sacker & Partners
LLP (legal), Watson Wyatt Limited (actuary), KPMG LLP (auditors) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (financial). They are responsible for
obtaining regular actuarial valuations of the plan to satisfy the statutory funding objective, which involves reaching agreement with Royal
Mail Group on the statement of funding principles, the recovery plan and the schedule of contributions. There is a separate trustee board
for the senior executives pension plan which comprises the chairman plus 5 individuals including employees, pensioners and an
independent member.

Customers - The Group's businesses and brands are used or recognised by almost everyone in the UK - from the largest of companies to
individuals. However, the 30 largest customers generate c.15% of Royal Mail's turnover and consequently the business is reliant on a
small customer base. As competition increases the Group will have to continue to simplify ways of doing business and design products
around customers’ needs. Customers are offered standard terms and conditions for the markets and countries in which the Group
operate.

Subpostmasters - The vast majority of Post Office Limited's 13,852 Post Office branches are operated by subpostmasters and franchise
partners. The National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP) directly represents the interests of their members; currently the
membership stands at 9,297. As a consequence of this direct representation, the NFSP indirectly influences all other agents through the
representations and negotiations conducted on behalf of the majority of subpostmasters. Post Office Limited conducts annual
remuneration negotiations with the NFSP whilst also working closely with them on the many agent related aspects of Post Office Limited's
Forward:four2eleven strategy, designed to deliver a viable physical network by 2010-11

There are several major retailers who are also significant partners operating between them around 2,000 branches across the country.
Post Office Limited liaises closely with these companies to maintain successful working relationships. It is through the effective partnership
with the NFSP and these various retail organisations that the business takes into account the interests of all agents whilst seeking to
support the development and achievement of their sales potential and importantly the longer-term viability of the network.

Suppliers - The Group has a wide range of suppliers, with its primary reliance on those relating to outsourcing of non-core services, such
as IT support. It works in partnership with its suppliers to ensure the right products and services are delivered at the right time at
competitive costs. A central purchasing team monitors compliance to Group policy in awarding contracts or new business and adheres to
agreed credit terms.

The consumer body: Postwatch - Postwatch’s role is to act as a consumer advocate in postal matters. Its public views on the effect of
Royal Mail’s policies and management actions on customers can have an impact on Royal Mail's reputation, regardless of the quality of
service achieved.

The Regulator: Postcomm - Nearly 90% of Royal Mail Letters’ revenues are price-controlled and the Price Control is set periodically by
Postcomm in the form of a cap on the average price of a basket of products. The price increases or reductions allowed by Postcomm
through the Price Control have a very material impact on the likely levels of cash flow the Company can generate. Postcomm also
investigates compliance with Licence conditions and has broad powers to publicly reprimand or fine Royal Mail if it finds it in breach of
those conditions

Shareholder - The Company is a plc 100% owned by the Government. The Shareholder Executive (within BERR) manages the
shareholder relationship with the Company as a commercial shareholder. While management of the Group therefore lies with the
Company's Board of Directors, the Shareholder is kept up-to-date through quarterly performance reviews and is asked to approve the
Group's strategic plan. Any new funding required by the Group (apart from short term borrowings of less than one year) can only be
approved by Government if it meets commercial principles.

Segmental Analysis - Revenue and Profitability

In the following analysis, all references to operating profit are before exceptional items. The 2006-07 operating profit has been restated
for each UK operating business unit due to the impact of the new subsidiary Royal Mail Estates Limited, as explained in note 3. There is
no impact on the Group operating profit.

Group external revenue of £9,388m (2007 £9,179m) and operating profit before exceptionals of £162m (2007 £233m) are made up as

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

The Group uses a business-wide framework for the identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk. The process
helps support business objectives by linking into business strategy, identifying and reacting to emerging risks, and developing cost effective
solutions to the management of risk

The following Group-level risks have been identified and are being managed to support the long-term sustainability of the Group. The
impact of some of these risks could be impairment to the value of the Group's brands - Royal Mail, GLS, Parcelforce Worldwide and Post
Office which are some of the most well known and trusted brands in the UK, and major intangible assets of the Group.

The financial restructuring package agreed with the Government needs to be managed effectively

The business has agreed a financial restructuring package that will allow it to restructure the business, invest in new equipment and
address the pension fund deficit that has a major impact on Group profit and balance sheet. Effective management of this package is
crucial for the business to remain within the agreed financial restructuring parameters and to avoid potential sanctions or penalties that
could ensue.

Ineffective investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and our ability to compete effectively
The business is embarking on a major investment programme to replace equipment and technology that is nearing the end of its life
cycle. The investment programme needs to be deployed effectively and future ongoing investment in the Group's operational network
maintained to ensure the Group's ability to compete effectively in the open market.

The Group has a large pension fund deficit that requires funding
The Group's pension fund deficit is being funded in line with a schedule of contributions agreed with the pension fund trustees. Future
pension risk has been mitigated in part by the closure to new employees of the final salary pension scheme and other measures
introduced as part of the pension reform commencing 1 April 2008. There remain uncertainties over the impact of fluctuations in the
equity and debt markets affecting the value of the funds’ assets and liabilities and the ability of the business to achieve the required levels
of profitability and maintain our contributions at the agreed level.

Weakness in the UK economy or recession is likely to have a detrimental impact on the Group's profits
Ongoing changes in the global economy pose challenges and opportunities for the UK and all advanced economies. Historically there has
been a correlation between the state of the UK economy and level of mails revenue. Economic weakness or recession will have a direct
impact on mail volumes and consequently on Group profit

The Government is the Company's only shareholder and the Group may be affected by any future change in Government policy
The influence of public policy considerations on Government may adversely affect the Group's ability to promote an effective business
strategy. This is particularly significant for Post Office Limited which is required to run our branch network as a commercial business and
is reliant on Government support for loss making branches,

24
RMG00000309
RMG00000309

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Group revenues and profit are subject to several uncertainties
The postal market has evolved rapidly as a result of liberalisation. Competitors are aggressively targeting business customers. Additionally
business customers are downtrading using less profitable products. In addition overall mail market volumes are declining. Technological
innovation is increasing, customers can now switch to alternative offerings and information can be sent or made available faster and, in
many cases, at a lower cost than traditional mail services. If technological substitution continues, market volumes will decrease further

Furthermore Royal Mail's regulatory regime impacts the business's profitability in two key areas:

© The Universal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to maintain a national collection and delivery network. The USO results in
Royal Mail incurring a higher fixed cost base than our competitors. Royal Mail has some of the cheapest stamp prices in Europe, as
historically business mail has subsidised the losses made on stamped mail. Unless the applicable regulatory restraints permit Royal
Mail to recover from this imbalance, there is a risk that Royal Mail will always lose money on stamped mail, whilst competitors
procure more profitable products such as business mail. The USO does however ensure that Royal Mail has the largest distribution
network in the country - which may present future opportunities; and

© — Royal Mail's prices for most of its letters products are determined by Price Control reviews and negotiation with Postcomm, which
can reduce our flexibility and profitability, leading to uncertainty over how the future Licence and regulatory regime will affect Royal
Mail

The Group is subject to regulatory restrictions on our operations and the risk of penalties for non-compliance
Royal Mail’s postal operator's Licence contains material restrictions on the operation of the business. These include:

© Obligations over the delivery and collection of mail;
© Restrictions over the freedom to set prices; and
© Obligations to give competitors access to our network

If Royal Mail breaches certain postal operator's Licence conditions or other regulatory requirements it may be subject to financial
penalties. In addition to our postal operator's Licence the Group is also subject to oversight by other regulators. This affects Post Office
Limited which has to satisfy the FSA's requirements as an appointed representative of The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland
who are regulated by the FSA in respect of investment, mortgage and insurance intermediation activity in the UK It is also subject to anti-
money laundering regulations issued under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs. Post Office
Limited is also licensed as a telephone service provider by Ofcom, who require service providers to issue and adhere to Codes of Practice.

Without a continued change of culture within the organisation future development may be affected
The business has undergone, and will continue to undergo, a significant amount of change. Additionally the changing and uncertain postal
market place, the impact of competition and regulation and increased customer expectations place major challenges on all employees to
adapt and improve productivity to levels that will allow the business to compete effectively.

These challenges need to be met by ongoing cultural change within the organisation. Without a flexible, efficient and co-operative culture,
Royal Mail could become loss making as mail volumes decline and labour rates increase. Significant industrial action could have a major
detrimental effect on the Group's reputation and profits.

The Group's business activities are time critical and if key infrastructure facilities were disrupted it could have an impact on
results

The business is subject to a number of operational risks to its nationwide delivery and retail outlet networks, including natural disasters,
fire, flood, explosion, possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest, transport infrastructure disruption, power failures, unavailability of key
supplies, breakdown or failure of equipment, health pandemics, terrorism and the normal hazards associated with running a complex
infrastructure. A major disruption could have an adverse impact on customer services as well as business and operating results.

The Group may be affected by future environmental and related fiscal measures
The Group operates a large vehicle fleet and a substantial property portfolio that consume large amounts of energy. Although the Group
is disposing of surplus property and is deploying a Carbon Management Programme, it may be affected by future environmental
measures and adverse fiscal impact from increased energy costs and “green” taxation. The increasing awareness and focus on
environmental issues may also impact on the Group's current product and service offerings.

The Group operates a substantial treasury operation and is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk. The former is due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying
UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, revaluation of currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change
services and various sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency. The fuel price risk arises from operating a large
vehicle fleet and on jet fuel risk from purchasing air freight services. If the treasury strategy is inappropriate to cover the Group's
exposures, this could result in funds not being readily available when required or a negative impact on profit due to increased costs.

The Group is subject to changes in both domestic and European regulation and legislation, which could expose it to possible
additional costs

Various changes to European or domestic law will have a direct impact on the Group; such as the European Working Time Directive,
speed restrictions on the Group's vehicles and increased liberalisation of the market for postal service providers. Any future changes may
have a material impact on the Group and its individual business units.

Summary

The Group has produced a robust financial performance with operations remaining profitable before exceptional items and cash
generative even with difficult trading conditions and challenges experienced during the year. Despite continued efficiency improvements,
the Letters business made a loss as revenues have continued to fall with core market decline, increased losses to competition and
customers downtrading further to cheaper products. Post Office Limited's underlying performance is broadly flat, largely due to losses in
traditional income streams which have been partially mitigated by new commercial product revenues and cost savings. Both of our parcels
businesses, GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide, have improved their revenue performance, with strong growth underpinning solid profits in
highly competitive markets this year.

Our main achievement is to have secured landmark agreements on pay, pensions and modernisation for the business - we are now well
placed to press ahead with the vital investment in Royal Mail Letters to improve our efficiency and productivity. With the full support of
our people, our strategy to modernise and transform the Letters business - with investment in both our people and technology - will
provide the platform for new and more flexible products and services for our customers, who remain at the heart of everything we do,

Directors’ Report (continued)

In 2003, the Chairman created a programme to make Royal Mail Group a ‘Great Place to Work’ and made it a priority for everyone across
the business. The purpose of the programme is to encourage people to contribute to improving their working environment, to equip them.
with the skills they need, to develop pride in and understanding of the business and to drive respect for colleagues - in short, to ensure
people considerations are at the heart of all major business decisions. The programme is ongoing and will remain an integral part of our
people strategy.

Our people strategy will ensure we realise our potential as an organisation through the strength of our people by developing a high-
performing, sustainable culture where everyone feels involved and valued. It focuses on seven key areas

* creating interesting, meaningful jobs with more flexible working patterns;

© identifying and developing for all our people a set of core behaviours that determine how we treat each other, our customers and
our Shareholder;

© building a fluid, innovative and adaptive organisation to improve our response to environmental and market changes;

«developing a high-performance culture in which everyone understands their contribution and is motivated to achieve their full
potential;

© defining, recruiting and developing the core capabilities we need to thrive in a competitive, deregulated market;
© recruiting, attracting and developing the leadership and management capability we need to deliver our goals; and

enhancing our ability to attract and retain the talent required to compete successfully

Our intention is to underpin our people strategy with a measurement system that will objectively demonstrate the value of our people and
their contribution to the success of our business.

Currently, the way we monitor our progress towards becoming a ‘Great Place to Work is by using Have Your Say. our employee opinion
survey, launched in January 2003. This is carried out on a rolling basis, across all employees and the results are reviewed monthly right
through the business ~ from local level up to Board level.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The Group is committed to carrying out its activities in a socially responsible manner in respect of the environment, employees, customers
and local communities. A Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) Governance Committee reports to the Board, which publishes an
annual report of its activities. Further details of our CSR governance structure and activities will be available in our 2008 CSR Report, due
to be published later in the year.

Disabled employees
The Group's policy is to give full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. Employees who become disabled
whilst employed receive full support through the provision of training and special equipment to facilitate continued employment where
practicable. The Group provides training, career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate

Going concern
After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Group, the Directors consider that it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. Further details are provided under funding in note 2 to the accounts

Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors will be put to the Annual General Meeting

Corporate Governance

Statement by the Directors on compliance with the Combined Code

The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate Governance and supports the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the
Code), published in July 2003 and revised in June 2006. The Company has fully complied with the Code during the year. The following
statement is intended to explain our governance policies and practices in light of the Code principles and provisions in so far as they are
appropriate to a public company with a single Shareholder, and to provide insight into how the Board and management run the business
for the benefit of the Shareholder.

The Board
The Board is responsible for setting the objectives and strategy of the Group and for monitoring performance. At the end of the year, the
Board comprised a Non Executive Chairman, four Executive Directors and four Non Executive Directors. At that date there were one
executive and two non-executive Director vacancies. The biographies of each of the Directors, setting out their current roles,
commitments and previous experience, are on pages 27 and 28. The Board usually meets monthly, and has defined those matters that
are reserved exclusively for its consideration. These include the approval of strategic plans, financial statements, acquisitions and
disposals, major contracts, projects, and capital expenditure. It delegates responsibilities to the Board Committees detailed below. For each
scheduled meeting of the Board, the Company Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, collates and circulates the papers, aiming to allow
sufficient time for the Directors to review the information provided. The Board is confident that all its members have the knowledge,
talent and experience to perform the functions required of a Director of the business. Executive Directors have rolling 12-month contracts
and Non Executive Directors are generally appointed for three-year terms

The Board considers that each of the Non Executive Directors is independent. This means that in the view of the Board, they have no links
to the Executive Directors and other managers, and no business or other relationship with the Company that could interfere with their
judgement. During the year Richard Handover replaced Sir Mike Hodgkinson as Senior Independent Director. There is also a clear division
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual
Directors takes place on an annual basis. This is led by the Senior Independent Director with the support of the Company Secretary. The
evaluation is conducted by way of a formal questionnaire that enables Directors’ perspectives on the effectiveness of the Board and its
Committees to be fed back to the full Board, Performance evaluations of Board Committees are conducted by the Chairmen of the
respective Board Committees. The Non Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, review the performance of the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. The Executive Directors, led by the Group Chief Executive, review the performance of the Non
Executive Directors.

Directors may take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, at the Group's expense. All Directors have access to
the advice and services of the Company Secretary, the appointment and removal of whom is a matter for the Board as a whole.

All Directors appointed by the Board are required by the Company's Articles of Association to be elected by the Shareholder at the first
AGM after their appointment. On appointment, the Directors take part in an induction programme in which they receive information about
the Group, the role of the Board and matters reserved for its decision, the role of the principal Board Committees, the Group's Corporate
Governance arrangements and the latest financial information about the Group. This is supplemented by visits to key business locations.
The Group engages in two-way communication with the Shareholder to discuss information on its strategy, performance and policies. The
Board receives feedback on these meetings from the Directors attending them.

Outside appointments

Executive Directorships of companies outside of the Group. The Board's policy is normally to limit Executive Directors to one Non

Executive Directorship, for which the Director may retain the fees (see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 42 for details)

Non-audit services provided by the external auditors

determined what work can be provided by the external auditors and the approval processes associated with them. The Committee
monitors the level of non-audit fees paid to the external auditors,

Internal control

Overview

The Directors are responsible for the Group's system of risk management and internal control as well as the timely review of its
effectiveness. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss

The Group's approach to internal control is based on the underlying principle of line management accountability for control and risk
management. There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group in accordance
with the guidance detailed by the Turnbull Committee as part of the Code, including financial, operational, compliance risks and risks to
reputation. The Board regularly reviews this process. The process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of
these accounts. The responsibility for joint ventures and associates rests, on the whole, with the senior management of those operations.
The Company monitors its investments and exerts influence through Board representations.

The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. The key elements include a review of
Internal Audit reports, regular confirmations from local management and communications from the Chair of the Audit and Risk
Committee on the outcome of Audit and Risk Committee meetings.

Audit and Risk Committee

The Committee reports to the Board and meets as a minimum on a quarterly basis to monitor and review the effectiveness of the risk
management processes and the control environment. The Committee reviews the scope of work, authority and resources of the Internal
Audit and Risk Management function. The Audit and Risk Committee regularly reviews the Group risk profile

Key control processes
The key control processes are ongoing and include the following:

= the business units have authority to manage within the limits set by the Board and within the scope of reserved powers. The
Group's Code of Business Standards sets the principles of professionalism and integrity for our people;

discussion and approval by the Board of the strategic direction, plans and objectives of the Group and each operating company,
and the risks to achieving them;

. reviews and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts,

= monthly reviews of performance by reference to key performance indicators, updated forecasts and information on the key risk
areas;

= at least quarterly reviews by the Audit and Risk Committee of the scope and results of internal audit work across the Group. The
scope of the work covers all key activities of the Group and concentrates on higher risk areas;

= reviews of the scope of the work of the external auditors by the Audit and Risk Committee and any significant issues arising;

= reviews by the Audit and Risk Committee of accounting policies and delegated authority levels; and

consideration by the Board of the major risks facing the Group and procedures to manage them.

Risk Management process
The process consists of formal identification by management at each level of the Group of the key risks to achieving their business
objectives and the controls in place to manage them. The likelihood and potential impact of each risk is evaluated. The process also
includes

= bi-annual certification by management that they are responsible for managing the risks to their business objectives and that the
internal controls are such that they provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the risks are appropriately identified,
evaluated and managed; and

= independent assurance by Internal Audit as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk management activities described by
management.

The system of risk management and internal control is embedded into the operations of the Group, and the actions taken to mitigate any
weaknesses are carefully monitored.

annual, performance-related bonus, which is paid in the year following that in which it is earned and the amount deferred into LTIP that is
not paid until the LTIP matures.

The total Directors’ remuneration, excluding pensions and Long-Term Incentive Plan and including cash supplement in lieu of pension,
£3,666,000 (2007 £4,164,000)

These payments are consistent with the policy of the Remuneration Committee. The following sections describe the Committee, its
general policy and the main elements of remuneration.

Remuneration Policy

The Remuneration Committee
The Board retains overall accountability for the framework and costs of executive remuneration and the terms of the service contracts
offered to all Executive Directors. These also require the consent of the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform. The Secretary of State also gives consent for the remuneration arrangements for Non Executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee's role is to develop the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their immediate reports and specifically to make
recommendations on their salary, benefits, bonuses and other terms and conditions of employment. The Committee also recommends
appropriate compensation on the ending of employment, giving careful consideration to the circumstances of the particular case and the
ability of the individual to mitigate

The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of independent Non Executive Directors. Membership of the Committee is given on page
34, The Chief Executive, Adam Crozier, and the Group Director People & Organisational Development, may attend these meetings by
invitation and are not present at the discussion of their own remuneration.

Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee calls for information and advice from inside and outside the Group. It takes advice from those independent, professional
organisations that are best able to assist it on the particular topic under discussion.

During 2007-08, advice on the performance of key executives was given by the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Information on the
external marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PriceWaterhouseCoopers), Deloitte & Touche LLP, Hay
Management Consultants and Watson Wyatt Limited. Internal support is primarily provided by the Group Director People & Organisational
Development, and from the Company Secretary, Jonathan Evans. Other advice and information has been provided by specialists from the
People & Organisational Development and Finance Departments.

During the year, advice was given to the Company by Watson Wyatt Limited on pensions and actuarial matters.

Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on Directors’ remuneration is that:

«the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary quality in a
complex business and a competitive market place, who will deliver success for the Shareholder and high levels of customer
service, safety and environmental performance;

© a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance - both short and long-term; and
© the system of remuneration should bring together the interests of senior executives, customers and the Shareholder.
The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

The Committee regularly reviews the package and its competitiveness against appropriate marketplaces. The Committee aims to ensure
that the package is proportionate and effective, and that it follows accepted best practice.

The main components of remuneration
The main components for Executive Directors are: basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus, a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),
pension and other benefits. The Committee believes that there should be a particular emphasis on performance-related elements.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

Base salaries

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives. In making
its judgement, the Committee considers information from several sources so that a fair comparison can be made with enterprises of a
similar size and complexity to Royal Mail. This data is provided by independent consultancies, usually based on the published annual
reports of other organisations. Increases are recommended where the Committee believes that it is necessary to reflect contribution,
increased individual responsibilities and market levels. The Secretary of State's consent is required for all material changes to Directors’
remuneration.

There was no increase to base salaries for Executive Directors for 2007-08. For 2006-07 the increase was 2.9%.

Performance-related, annual bonus 2007-08
For 2007-08, the annual bonus plan followed the model of the previous year, which included the following weightings:

all Business roles had a weighting of 30% on Group performance and 70% Business performance. This applied to the Managing
Directors of Letters and Post Office Limited; and

+ all Group roles had a weighting of 90% on Group performance and a further 10% weighting given to Post Office Limited's,
performance in view of the importance of supporting the recovery of that business.

The following tables show the make up of the annual bonus plan as percentages of annual salary.

Maximum levels Profit __Service Quality Total
Chief Executive 70% 30% 100%
Other Executive Directors 56% 24% 80%
On-target levels Profit __Service Quality Total
Chief Executive 36% 24% 60%
Other Executive Directors 29% 19% 48%
Threshold levels Profit Service Quality Total
Chief Executive 15% 15% 30%
Other Executive Directors 12% 12% 24%

The financial target was based on Group profit
The Service Quality measures were:

Retail First Class;

Retail Second Class;

Bulk First Class;

Bulk Second Class;

Bulk Third Class;

Special Delivery;

Parcelforce 24;

A Post Office Limited Customer Service Effectiveness measure; and
A Post Office Limited measure of new products sold.

Executive Directors also participate in the ColleagueShare plan on the same terms as all other eligible employees. This is explained in note
2 on page 53

Long-Term Incentive Plans

A three-year LTIP was in place for 2005-06 to 2007-08 and a further three-year plan covers the period 2007-08 to 2009-10. This
arrangement will allow the last plan to come to an end at the same time as the next Postcomm price control review. Half of the awards
for 2007-08 are attributed to the 2005-06 to 2007-08 plan and the remaining half to the 2007-08 to 2009-10 plan

Performance is measured by Return on Total operating Assets (ROTA)
For the three years 2005-06 to 2007-08 the principles of the plan were as follows

(a) Annual Company Performance Awards which accrue on a sliding scale above a threshold level of performance and begin at 12.5% of
annual base salary. For on-target performance, the Company Award is 25% of annual base salary and for exceptional performance
this rises to a maximum of 37.5%

39
RMG00000309
RMG00000309

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

(b) Bonus Awards. A Bonus Award can be made each year by the Remuneration Committee. These are only made in situations where
the Director waives a proportion of their annual bonus. Bonus awards do not exceed the amount waived. A Director has the
discretion to waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level. If a bonus above on-target would
otherwise be payable, then three quarters of this additional amount will be compulsorily waived

(dA Multiplying factor. Company and Bonus Awards may be increased by a factor that measures ROTA across the plan. If the on-
target level is achieved for the relevant period then each of the Company Awards and Bonus Awards to which it applies may be
increased by an additional one third. In the case of exceptional performance, then up to a maximum addition of 100% can be added.

Payments under the plan will be made in June 2008.
The 2007-08 to 2009-10 LTIP has the same principles as the previous LTIP.

The Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08 are effectively shared equally between the two plans.

The performance targets for the last two years of the 2007-08 to 2009-10 plan are still under discussion with the Government

Company Awards

These are measured against an annual ROTA target. ROTA incentivises the productive value of the business and emphasises the need to
make efficient use of all operational assets. It covers the need to make a proper return both on any new investments that are made and
on the existing asset base

For 2005-06 the ROTA target was 11.2% and the Company's achievement was 13.7%, 22% above the target and above the stretch of
13.4%. This resulted in Company Awards of 37.5%. For 2006-07 the ROTA target was 4.2% with a stretch of 7.1%. A ROTA of 5.4% was
achieved but the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to cap this at the on-target level of 4.2%, resulting in a Company
Award of 25%.

For 2007-08 the following table against annual ROTA applied:

Royal Mail ROTA achievement, Percentage of Base Salary
21% 25%
5.1% 37.5%

The outturn achievement was 3.9%, resulting in a Company Award of 32.5%

Bonus Awards
As described above, a Director may waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level and must waive three
quarters of any bonus earned above the on-target level. If a proportion of annual bonus is waived then a Bonus Award may be made
within the LTIP, not exceeding that value

Multiplying Factor

The Multiplying Factor is dependent upon cumulative ROTA over 2005-06 to 2007-08.

The cumulative ROTA works as follows. Targets for the end of the third year are 15.9% at the threshold level, 17.4% at the on-target level
and 25.7% at the maximum. To ensure consistency of performance there are intermediate targets at March 2007 of 13.6% at the
threshold level, 15.1% at the on-target level and 20.3% at the maximum. As the on-target level of cumulative ROTA was exceeded at the
end of March 2007, the percentage multiplier at that position on the performance scale was applied to the awards made so far. The
cumulative ROTA for the preceding 2 years was 19.0% and gave a multiplier of 1.84. Across the whole of the three-year period, the
cumulative ROTA achieved was 22.6% and this gave a multiplier of 1.75, which was applied to Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08.

Benefits
Benefits include the provision of a company car, health insurance, relocation costs, or the cash equivalent of any benefits not taken

Pensions
The Group has a liability to pay pensions in respect of Directors’ services and, for some Executive Directors, makes contributions to
pension schemes for this purpose. The Company pays a cash supplement to Directors whose contributions to the Company scheme are
restricted by the scheme-specific earnings cap. The Company continues to apply the scheme-specific earnings cap, indexed by inflation
each year, as a constraint on the amount of salary that is pensionable through the Company scheme

Following a review of its pension arrangements, the Company has introduced changes to its pension provision for all employees including
Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2008. From 1 April 2008 the defined benefit pension plans have been closed to new members
and pension for future service accrues on a career salary basis. Furthermore from 1 April 2010 the normal retirement age under the
plans increase to age 65 and the earliest age for receipt of a reduced pension will be 55.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

Fixed and performance-related elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration (excluding pensions)

For 2007-08, 33% of Directors’ potential annual earnings related to fixed elements whilst 67% related to annualised performance
elements, for the Group Chief Executive 30% was fixed and 70% was variable. The element of rernuneration at risk to performance is that
available through the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the performance-related annual bonus.

Service contracts

The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors appointed to the Board are offered notice periods of one year. The Committee has a
defined policy on compensation and mitigation, to be applied in the event of a Director's contract being prematurely terminated. In such
circumstances, steps would be taken to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.

The rolling service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms as at 30 March 2008

Expiry date of current service Unexpired term
Date of contract contract (months)
Non Executive Chairman
Allan Leighton 25 March 2008 25 March 2009 12

Adam Crozier 1 February 2003 12
Alan Cook 1 March 2006 12
lan Duncan 1 September 2006 12
Mark Higson 5 November 2007 12

The Non Executive Directors do not have service contracts. The dates of the current Non Executive Director appointments are as follows:

Non Executive Directors

David Fish 1 January 2003 30 September 2008 6
Richard Handover 1 January 2003 30 September 2008 6
Baroness Margaret Prosser 1 November 2004 31 October 2010 31
Helen Weir 1 January 2006 31 December 2008 9

All Executive Directors have a contracted 12-month notice period from the Company; the Director must give six-months notice. The
compensation for loss of office is a payment of 12-months basic salary, which may be subject to mitigation. David Burden retired from
the Company with effect from 31 July 2007

Non Executive Directors

The Company is committed for the full term of appointments for Non Executive Directors, including the Chairman. The fees paid to the
Non Executive Directors are determined by the Executive Directors and approved by the Secretary of State, Independent market surveys
are consulted in determining them. Fees comprise a basic fee for Board membership and, as appropriate, additional fees for the
membership or chairmanship of the Audit and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, and for the Senior Independent Director.
Details of the fees are given below.

Performance-related, annual bonuses outturn for 2007-08
The details of the bonus plan are given on page 40. Bonuses awarded for 2007-08 have suffered due to the period of industrial action,
although financial performance has been better than budget. The Remuneration Committee also disallowed any short-term financial
benefits from the delays in implementing planned projects that were a result of industrial action. In the case of Adam Crozier the bonus
awarded was 60.1% of the maximum. For lan Duncan it was 58.9%, for Alan Cook 68.7% and for Mark Higson 61.5%. As the Company had
exceeded its financial target it was decided to award the non-executive Chairman a bonus of £180,000.

lan Griffiths and Tony McCarthy were made no awards in respect of their part-year service during 2007-08.

Adam Crozier, Alan Cook and lan Duncan were awarded £800 ColleagueShare stakeholder dividend for the year. Mark Higson was
awarded a pro-rata amount of £317

GRO

The Group previously offered its most senior people membership of the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (the Plan), which is
now closed to new members. Details of the Plan are set out in note 25 to the accounts. The Plan is a funded, Inland Revenue-registered
final salary occupational pension scheme. The Plan provides for a pension on a final salary basis for service up to 31 March 2008 and for
subsequent service on a career salary basis. The pension is payable from normal retirement age (currently age 60) and is subject to the
maximum pensionable service and the scheme-specific earnings cap. Pensions in payment are increased annually in line with Retail Prices
Index (RPI), subject in some cases to a cap of 5%. Pensions are also payable to dependants on the death of the member and a lump sum
is payable if death in service occurs.

Adam Crozier

Alan Cook

Pensions

For senior executives whose membership of the Plan is restricted by the earnings cap, pension provision is made by a combination of the
Company scheme and a cash pension supplement or its equivalent. lan Duncan and Adam Crozier receive a cash supplement of 40% of
base pay above the earnings cap. Alan Cook and Mark Higson are not members of the Plan and receive a cash supplement of 40% of base
pay. The Company has made provision for retirement pension arrangements at a rate of 40% of base pay above the earnings cap for
David Burden, and this provision was used to buy an additional pension on his retirement from the Company. A reserve has been
established for the additional pension for Tony McCarthy to provide the total retirement pension, including his previous employer's
pension scheme, of two-thirds of base pay at normal retirement age. During the year the provision for David Burden was released and
the total provision at the year-end for Tony McCarthy was £1m (2007 £1m),

Statement of Directors’ responsibi s in relation to the Group financial statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements, in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

The Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial position of the
Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period

In preparing those Group financial statements the Directors are required to:

= select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’
and then apply them consistently;

* present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;

statements.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial

We have audited the Group financial statements of Royal Mail Holdings plc for the year ended 30 March 2008 which comprise the Group
income statement, Group statement of recognised income and expense, Group balance sheet, Group cash flow statement and the related
notes 1 to 29. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein,

We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Royal Mail Holdings plc for the year ended 30 March 2008
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors

The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities

Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)

We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report
includes that specific information presented in the Group Operating and Financial Review that is cross referred from the ‘Review of the
business and future developments’ section of the Directors’ Report.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.

We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reflects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.

We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement, the Annual Review, the Operating and
Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance statement, the Internal Control statement, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
‘An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the Group financial statements

Opinion

= the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the Group's affairs as at 30 March 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
= the Group financial staternents have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and

* The information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

Notes to the Group accounts

1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs

The Group's financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 30 March 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board on 19 May 2008 and the
balance sheet was signed on the Board's behalf by Adam Crozier and lan Duncan.

The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 53 weeks ended 30 March 2008. The principal accounting
policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.

2. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation and accounting
The Group comprises Royal Mail Holdings plc (the Company) - which is wholly owned by HM Government - and its subsidiaries. The Company
is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) and the accounts are produced in accordance with the Act and
applicable IFRSs.

The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise indicated

Royal Mail Group Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is exposed to the risk of being fined by its industry Regulator and of being
required to pay compensation to certain customers, as a result of failing to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in its licence. The
amount of such fines and compensation will be determined by the Regulator after further representations from Royal Mail Group Ltd and no
further information is being disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process.

Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows

The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year. Adoption of these revised standards
and interpretations did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group in the current or prior periods. In certain
cases, they did however give rise to additional disclosures

© IFRS7 Financial Instruments; Disclosures
e =IAS1 Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures
es IFRIC9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives

JERS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures

This standard requires disclosures that enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the significance of the Group's financial
instruments and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments. The new disclosures are included throughout the
financial statements. While there has been no effect on the financial position or results, comparative information has been revised where
necessary.

JAS 1 Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures
This amendment requires the Group to make new disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the Group's objectives,
policies and processes for managing capital. These new disclosures are shown in note 23

JFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives

IFRIC 9 states that the date to assess the existence of an embedded derivative is the date that an entity first becomes a party to the contract,
with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. As the Group has no embedded derivative
requiring separation from the host contract, the interpretation has no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year relate to the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligations, deferred tax and ColleagueShare
plan costs. Measurement of the defined benefit obligations requires certain assumptions to be made including on life expectancy, future
changes in salaries, inflation and a suitable discount rate. The size of these obligations, and therefore the pension deficit, is materially sensitive
to the assumptions adopted. The assumptions which have the most significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit obligations
are the real discount rate and the mortality rates. A 0.1 percentage point change to the discount rate could change the liabilities by
approximately £450m. An additional one year on the life expectancy could increase liabilities by approximately £650m. The major assumptions
are disclosed in note 25. Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability. Such estimation is inherently
uncertain in a market subject to various competitive pressures. Should estimates of future profitability change in future years, the amount of
deferred tax recognised will also change accordingly.

The calculation of the ColleagueShare costs and liabilities is reliant on a number of estimates. These include in particular forecasts for the
potential equity value of ColleagueShares, forecasts of joiners and leavers throughout the life of the plan and judgements on when participants
are likely to exercise their rights for the Company to redeem the ColleagueShares that they hold. The magnitude of the costs involved is
sensitive to these forecasts and assumptions.

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd
Royal Mail Group Ltd made a loss in 2007-08, after bearing losses relating to stamped mail and carrying out its Universal Service Obligations.
In addition it has been facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed investment in plant and equipment and funding its
pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition. On 23 March 2007, a funding package totalling £1.2bn up
until 2016 was completed with Government

The European Commission is continuing its investigation under the EC Treaty's rules on State Aid into a series of funding measures taken by
the United Kingdom Government in its capacity as Shareholder in favour of Royal Mail between 2001 and 2007, including the funding
agreement completed on 23 March 2007. In its response to the EC in relation to this investigation the United Kingdom Government has stated
that it believes that the measures being investigated by the EC were concluded on commercial terms.

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabilities as at 30 March 2008 and has operated at a loss during 2007-08 and prior years, primarily because of
supporting the loss-making rural network

To become viable in the longer-term, new business areas continue to be developed and grown in order to replace the lost contribution from
traditional income sources, and significant cost reduction programmes continue to be implemented,

During the year, Post Office Limited has updated its five-year strategic plan and will proceed with the implementation of a number of radical
programmes which are designed to improve the profitability of the company. These programmes include:

the development of new business and drive for sales growth;
«the restructuring of the network;

© bringing the crown branch segment into profit; and

© a programme of fundamental cost reduction.

The future financing of this Plan is underpinned by:

© rural network funding of £150m received from Government during 2007-08;

© a funding agreement with Government announced on 17 May 2007, which provided a further £313m, which was received on 31 July
2007 to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified "services of general economic interest’;

© afurther equity injection of £77m received on 1 April 2008 and £75m on 15 April 2008;

© the extension on 18 April 2008 of the existing working capital facility of £1.15bn to 2011 (at the balance sheet date this was to 2010);
and

© State Aid approval has been received for the above funding and also for the provision of network subsidy payments of around £150m per
annum in each of the three financial years 2008-09 to 2010-11 for the purposes of meeting, up to a specified limit, the net costs of
maintaining certain loss-making parts of the network.

Whilst the Directors are satisfied with the progress that has been made it should be noted that the completion of the regeneration
programmes will take several years to achieve, as anticipated in the company's five-year strategic plan. Accordingly there will be a need to gain
agreement with respect to the continuation of the network subsidy payment for the period beyond March 2011, as well as the replacement or
extension of the working capital facilities. These arrangements will need State Aid approval.

Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the Directors recognise that significant progress has been made in delivering its Plan and that the
Funding Agreement is now in place and, after careful consideration, continue to believe that Post Office Limited will be able to meet its
liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, on that basis, the Directors consider that it is appropriate that these financial
statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Group, including consideration of the financing
arrangements outlined above, the Directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The financial statements of the
major subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies

All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full
Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through a negotiation with the respective businesses

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which
control is no longer held by the Group. Where the Group ceases to hold control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include
the results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group held control.

Minority interests represent the portion of profit/loss, gains/losses and net assets relating to subsidiaries that are not attributable to members
of the Company. The minority interests balance is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent
shareholders’ equity.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Investments in je ventures and associates

The Group's investments in its joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity
method, the investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the joint,
ventures/associates, less any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group's share of post tax profits from the joint ventures/
associates.

Any goodwill arising on acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group's share of the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is included in the carrying amount and not amortised. To
the extent that the net fair value of the associate's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the
investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group's share of the associate's profit or loss in the period in which the investment is
acquired.

Revenue
Revenue reported in the income statement comprises of Turnover and the Social Network Payment. Turnover principally relates to the
rendering of services:

Royal Mail

Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the mail delivery is complete. Prepaid revenue mainly relating to
stamp and meter income is recognised when the sale is made, adjusted to reflect a value of stamp and meter credits held but not used by the
customer.

Parcelforce Worldwide

Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the delivery of an item is complete

Post Office Limited

Revenue is recognised when retail and financial services are provided.

General Logistics Systems
Revenue is derived from specific contracts and is recognised at the time of delivery.

The Social Network Payment is Government grant revenue recognised to match the related costs of providing the network of public post
offices that the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform considers appropriate and which would otherwise not be
provided.

Distribution and conveyance

Distribution and conveyance costs relate to third party costs incurred in carrying mail. These include conveyance by rail, road, sea and air,
together with costs incurred by international mail carriers and Parcelforce Worldwide delivery operators. These costs are disclosed separately
‘on the face of the income statement.

Operating profit before exceptional items
Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business. This incorporates revenue, people costs, distribution
and conveyance costs, other operating costs and the Group's post tax share of profits from joint ventures and associates. Operating exceptional
items are separately identified.

Operating exceptional items
Operating exceptional items are material items of income and expenditure arising from the operations of the business which, due to the nature
of the events giving rise to them, require separate presentation on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of
financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years

ColleagueShare plan
ColleagueShare is the name for the Group’s phantom share plan. The plan, introduced in 2007-08, is a five-year plan spanning the accounting
years from April 2007 to March 2012 and comprises both a phantom share scheme and a related stakeholder dividend worth up to £5,300
per person throughout the life of the plan. The ColleagueShares represent up to a total of 20% of the projected equity value of the Group.
Additionally Royal Mail plans to pay a stakeholder dividend dependent on the achievement of certain targets.

The costs of the plan are being charged to the income statement as an exceptional item throughout the life of the plan. Any long-term
liabilities arising in relation to the plan will be discounted at an appropriate high quality corporate bond rate. These discounts will be unwound
through the income statement during the life of the plan. The Group will redeem all ColleagueShares by 2012

Operating profit

Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging operating exceptional items
defined above. It excludes the non operating exceptional items for profit or loss on disposal of businesses and profit or loss on disposal of
property, plant and equipment. These items are not part of the normal recurring operations of the business but are material, so are presented
separately on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior
years.

Goodwill

Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. Any
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised

53
RMG00000309
RMG00000309

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising from business combinations is
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired

An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

For the purpose of such impairment reviews, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the balance
sheet as goodwill

Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably
on initial recognition. Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially recognised
at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or indefinite useful life. Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those
with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is charged annually to the income statement. The useful lives of such intangible assets are in
the range of 1-6 years.

Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off in the year it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised where they meet the criteria required under
IFRSs. If these criteria are not met, then the costs are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, including attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its intended
use, Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to net book value and to the remaining
useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual values. The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment are:

Range of asset lives

Land and buildings:

Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease, 50 years or the estimated remaining useful life
Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers 1-12 years
Fixtures and equipment 2-45 years

An individual property that the Group has identified as surplus is reclassified within ‘non-current assets held for sale’, a separate category on
the balance sheet, when a sale is highly probable. This has been determined to be when authority to market the property has been approved
and the property is vacant and therefore available for immediate sale and occupation by a third party. Such properties are expected to
generate economic cash flow primarily by sale of the asset rather than by operational activities, and are expected generally to be disposed of
within a year.

For a disposal group of properties or other assets and liabilities, the requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued
operations’ are applied to the specific circumstances of the disposal group.

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where appropriate, an
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Leases

Finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group, are
capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases and
rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental
expenses over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow-moving stock. Cost includes all costs in
bringing each item to its present location and condition and comprises weighted average cost for supplies and materials and purchase cost for
merchandise.

RMG00000309
RMG00000309

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any non-collectable amounts. An estimate for
doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Financial instruments

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as; financial assets at fair value
through the income statement (held for trading); held to maturity investments, loans and receivables or available for sale financial assets as
appropriate. Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement
or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year
end.

When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial
instruments not at fair value through the income statement, any directly attributable transactional costs.

The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on their classification as follows:

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term, Derivatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised
in the income statement.

Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as ‘held to maturity’ when the Group has
the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the
amortisation process. Investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification

Loans and receivables
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, do not qualify as trading assets
and have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the income statement’ or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement
when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Available for sale financial assets
‘Available for sale financial assets’ are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the three
preceding categories. After initial recognition, interest is taken to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and the assets
are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised, or
until the investment is deemed to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income
statement.

Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)
Derivatives liabilities are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. They are carried in the balance sheet
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are
initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs. After initial recognition, non-derivative
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, Gains and losses are recognised in the
income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an original
maturity date of three months or less. In addition, the Group uses Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash, which are bought
and sold on a daily basis to meet the cash requirements of the business. These funds are also categorised as cash equivalents.

For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank
overdrafts.

Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments
Financial assets - pension escrow investments comprise; short term deposits with banks; conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt
edged securities and Treasury bills.

Short term deposits with banks (pension escrow investments) are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills are classified as available for sale financial instruments
on the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Financial assets - other investments

Financial assets - other investments comprise; short term deposits (other investments) with Government, local government or banks with an
original maturity of three months or more and conventional gilt edged securities. Short term deposits are classified as loans and receivables
financial instruments. Conventional gilt edged securities are classified as available for sale financial instruments on the basis that they are
quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity.

Financial liabilities - interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when
incurred.

Financial liabilities - obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts
All obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group, in line with the Group's treasury management policies. Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to relate to an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non financial asset or non financial liability, then, at the time the asset or
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of
the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit/loss, for example
when the future sale actually occurs

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income
statement in the period.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting, At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to
the income statement for the year.

Fair value measurement of financial instruments

The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is
no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's length market transactions; reference to
the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same; and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models.
Specifically, in the absence of quoted market prices derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the underlying commodity/currency
and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date).

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of quoted market prices,
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date

Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except
+ jnitial recognition of goodwil:

. the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

= taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future

Other than stated below, deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
carry-forward of unused tax assets, and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of:

deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and

= deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the
extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary difference will be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
balances are not discounted.

Current and deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise
it is recognised in the income statement.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

The pension plans’ assets for the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value. Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term. The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Full actuarial
valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the Trustees and, with appropriate updates and
accounting adjustments at each balance sheet date, form the basis of the deficit disclosed. All members of defined benefit schemes are
contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State pension scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from
settlements, curtailments and past service costs. The net difference between the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets is
recognised as net pensions interest in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
recognised income and expense (SORIE). Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and losses is also recognised in the
SORIE

For defined contribution schemes, the Group's contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate. Overseas subsidiaries make separate arrangements for the provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail Holdings plc is sterling (£). The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in
Europe is mainly the euro (),

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The trading results of
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period, being a reasonable approximation to the actual
transaction rate. The exchange differences arising on the translation, since the date of transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to the Foreign

Currency Translation Reserve in equity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Currently hedge accounting is not clained for any monetary assets and liabilities. All differences are therefore
taken to the income statement, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group's net investment in a
foreign operation. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment occurs, at which time they are recognised in profit
or loss.

Non-moretary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates
of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date
when the fair value is determined.

Contingent liabilities and financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of amounts under IAS 37 or the amounts
initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’.

Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possibility of losses occurring is considered to be remote

Government grants
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement and are shown separately to the expenditure to which they
relate

Segment information
The Group's primary reporting format is by business segments and its secondary format is by geographical segments. The business segments
are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a
business unit that offers different products and serves largely different markets. The five business segments are:

Royal Mail: Delivers letters to all addresses in the United Kingdom. Royal Mail offers a number of products to both business and domestic
users.

Parcelforce Worldwide: The parcels business unit operating within the UK.
Post Office Limited: A limited company responsible for the network of Post Office branches offering a series of retail services
General Logistics Systems: The European parcels business which, via its subsidiaries and partners, offers its services in 36 European states

Other businesses: Includes PostCap Guernsey Limited and iRed Redefining Docurnent Management Ltd, both wholly owned subsidiaries,
Romec Limited, and NDC 2000 Limited, both part owned subsidiaries, investments in the following associates - Quadrant Catering Limited,
Camelot Group ple and Camelot International Services Limited, and our Group Property unit. The Group Property unit includes Royal Mail
Estates Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary,

Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective businesses.

The two geographical segments are UK operations and European operations. The latter consists of the GLS business segment. The former
includes the other four business segments plus Corporate, representing central shared services for the UK and the corporate centre. Corporate
is not a revenue or profit centre but incurs certain costs on behalf of the business segments, which are passed on, and manages certain assets
and liabilities of the Group.

Accounting standards and interpretations not applied

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have issued
accounting standards and interpretations with an effective date for accounting periods beginning on or after the date of these financial
statements. Of these, the Group has not applied the following

International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) Effective date

IAS 32 & IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 1 January 2009

Presentation of Financial Statements - Puttable Financial Instruments and
Obligations Arising on Liquidation

International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)

IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 -The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and

their interaction 1 January 2008

IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations

The amendment to IFRS 2 deals with vesting conditions and cancellations for shares. Although the Group operates the Colleagueshare
phantom share scheme (see policy note above) this does not constitute a share based payment arrangement under IFRS 2. Consequently the
Group has no share based payment arrangements, and therefore, this amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance
of the Group.

IFRS 3 Business Combinations

The Group does not anticipate early adopting the revised IFRS 3 and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after
29 March 2010. Whilst it is not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a
requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase price; and for contingent consideration to be
recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to
goodwill). The standard also changes the treatment of non-controlling interest (formerly minority interests) with an option to recognise
these at full fair value as at the acquisition date and a requirement for previously held non-controlling interests to be fair valued as at the
date control is obtained, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.

IFRS 8 Operating Segments

This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group's operating segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary
(business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments. It is anticipated that the operating segments will be the same as the business
segments previously reported under IAS 14. It is expected that this new standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March
2009 and will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

IAS 4 Presentation of Financial Statements

This revised standard sets overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum
requirements for their content. It does not change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of specific transactions and other events
required by other IFRSs. Hence it is expected that this new standard, which will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009, will
have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

IAS 23 Borrowing Costs

This standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. It is expected that this new standard will have
no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group although the standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 30
March 2009

2. Accounting policies (continued)

IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements

IAS 27 revised is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, with earlier application only permitted when the revised IFRS 3 is
applied. The revised standard applies retrospectively with some exceptions. IAS 27 revised no longer restricts the allocation to minority interest of
losses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the non-controlling equity investment in the subsidiary. A partial disposal of equity interest in a
subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control will be accounted for as an equity transaction and will have no impact on goodwill nor will it
give rise to any gain or loss. Where there is loss of control of a subsidiary, any retained interest will have to be remeasured to fair value, which
will impact the gain or loss recognised on disposal. It is expected that retrospective application of this standard will have no impact on the
financial position or performance of the Group although the standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 29 March 2010.

IAS 32 & IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
The amendments to IAS 32 & IAS 1 require that puttable financial instruments and instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another
party a pro-rata share of net assets on liquidation are classified as equity provided that they have particular features and meet specific conditions.
It is expected that these amendments will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009 and will have no impact on the financial
position or performance of the Group

IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
This interpretation applies to service concession operators and explains how to account for the obligations undertaken and rights received in
service concession arrangements. No members of the Group are operators in this regard and hence the interpretation will have no impact on
the Group.

IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
The Group has no schemes involving customer loyalty awards hence there will be no impact on the Group's financial statements when this
IFRIC is adopted.

IFRIC 14 - IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction
This interpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme that can be recognised
as an asset under IAS 19 on Employee Benefits. It is expected that at present, this interpretation will have no impact on the financial position
or performance of the Group, as the Group has an absolute right to any assets left over after benefits have been secured,

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group's primary
financial statements. Certain of the above standards will require amendment to disclosures in the period of initial application

The above analysis of revenue between segments for 2006-07 has been restated to include the impact of the operations of Royal Mail Estates
Limited (RMEsL), £94m and Romec Limited, £143m, within the ‘Other businesses’ segment. These amounts were previously classified as internal
recharges and hence did not form part of revenue between segments.

Operating profit before exceptional items for all UK operations has also been restated as if RMEsL had been operating in 2006-07 in the way it has
operated in 2007-08. The effect of this change has been to reduce the operating profit before exceptional items of Royal Mail by £58m and
Parcelforce Worldwide by £3m and to increase the operating loss before exceptional items of Post Office Limited by £9m, Consequently, the
operating profit before exceptional items of the Other businesses segment has increased by £70m. There has been no overall change to the Total

Segment result as a result of this restatement.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £338m (2007 £1,159m) relating to the retirement benefit obligation, £289m (2007
£272m) relating mainly to fixed asset temporary differences, and £189m (2007 £101m) relating to tax losses in subsidiaries that are available
to offset against future taxable profits. The Group has capital losses carried forward, the tax effect of which is £16m (2007 £13m), The Group
has rolled over capital gains of £74m (2007 £86m); no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which the gains have
been rolled be sold at their carrying value, as it is anticipated that a capital loss would arise.

At 30 March 2008, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2007 Enil) for taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should
such amounts be remitted due to the availability of double taxation relief or other exemptions.

The Finance Act 2007 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. The effect of this change on deferred tax
balances is included in these accounts and is detailed above. In his 2007 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced forthcoming
changes to the capital allowances regime which have subsequently been confirmed, In accordance with accounting standards the effects of
these capital allowances changes on deferred tax balances has not been reflected in these accounts due to the relevant legislation not having
been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It is expected that the phased abolition of industrial buildings allowances will reduce the
Group's unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately £100m

The carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations of £173m (2007 £143m) at the balance sheet date includes £172m (2007
£142m) relating to the General Logistics Systems (GLS) business segment. In line with the accounting policy (see note 2), this goodwill has
been reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value in use. The carrying value of GLS,
excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities, is £369m (2007 £322m) at year end (see note 3) and the operating profit
before exceptional items is £114m (2007 £115m) for the year (see note 3). The carrying value represents a multiple of 3.2 (2007 2.8) on
operating profit before exceptional items. The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review (ie. the ‘fair value less
costs to sell), has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector. On this basis, the net realisable
value of GLS has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value. No reasonable possible change in the earnings multiples referenced

would reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value

On 1 October 2007 certain assets of a Milan Franchise Area business, Italy were acquired by the General Logistics Systems (GLS)
subsidiary. If this combination had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, Group revenue from continuing operations would
have been £9,392. The profit of the acquired entity since its acquisition date and if it had been acquired at the beginning of the financial
year is not material in the context of the Group's profit after tax.

The goodwill arising on this acquisition represents the strategic benefit of securing control of operations in one of the major industrialised
areas of Italy, and thereby significantly increasing GLS's presence in this market.

The prior year acquisitions relate to the purchase by GLS of 100% of the voting shares of ABX Belgium Distribution, a parcels and general
cargo business based in Belgium, on 31 December 2006, and certain assets of three franchisee businesses in Italy (not material in
aggregate).

The Mails and Parcels provision includes amounts relating to ColleagueShare £105 (2007 £nil), onerous property contracts £15m (2007
£27m) and decommissioning costs, £7m (2007 £9m) with the balance of £91m (2007 £70m) principally relating to redundancy. The Mails and
Parcels provision in the main is expected to be utilised in 2008-09 with the remaining amounts expected to be utilised over the next two to three
years, except for £105m (2007 £nil) relating to ColleagueShare, expected to be utilised within 5 years and £2m relating to onerous property
contracts expected to be utilised over a period longer than 3 years. The timing of cash flows for such provisions are by their nature uncertain and
dependent upon the outcome of related events.

Counter Services provisions include amounts in respect of Agency Network change £127m (2007 £nil), a programme to close 2,500 agency
branches agreed with Government to be completed during 2008-09, the WH Smith project £22m (2007 £nil), a programme to transfer 70

branches to WH Smith, the organisational design review and other redundancy £14m (2007 £1m), onerous property contracts £19m (2007

expected to be utilised within 5 years and certain property provisions that are expected to be utilised over a period longer than 3 years.

Details of amounts charged as operating exceptional items are contained in note 7. The amounts released in other operating costs relate to
onerous property contracts and decommissioning costs. The change in the carrying value of the discounted element of the provision balance due
to the passage of time is not material. Non-cash utilised amounts principally relate to transfers from provisions to current payables for amounts
due to the pension scheme for redundancies with early retirement. Of the current payables recognised in this way during the year, £22m (2007
£27m) had been cash settled by the balance sheet date

The cash utilised of £149m (2007 £128m) includes £144m (2007 £118m) of spend relating to exceptional rationalisation and £5m (2007
£10m) relating to other operating costs. Total cash spend in the year relating to exceptional rationalisation is shown in the cash flow statement.

23. Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise short-term deposits, money market liquidity investments,
Government gilt edged securities, loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts and cash. The main purposes of these financial instruments
are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as

trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from operations.

The Group enters into derivative transactions, principally commodity swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the
commodity and currency risks arising from the Group's operations

Itis, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be

undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price and

credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Interest rate risk

The Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the Group’s debt obligations and interest bearing financial assets
The BERR loans to Royal Mail Group Ltd of £500m (2007 £500m) are at a fixed interest rate to maturity with an average maturity date of
2023 (2007 - average date of 2023). The BERR loans to Post Office Limited of £280m (2007 £300m) are at short-dated fixed interest rates ~
average maturity 1 day (2007 average 16 days). The total interest bearing financial assets of the group (excluding the pension escrow
investments) of £540m (2007 £428m) are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with average maturity 12 days (2007 average 15

days), These short-dated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.

The Group's policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments. No external

hedging of interest rate risk is undertaken.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the

Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from available for sale (whether floating or fixed rate) financial assets is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet

date and impacts equity.

Effect on of a decrease in GBP interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) (4) rR (a4) -

Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign
origin mail in the UK, the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited and various purchase contracts
denominated in foreign currency. These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury. Where possible, exposures
are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts. Hedging will not
normally be considered for exposures of less than £1m; hedging is normally confined to 80% of the forecast exposure where forecast cash
flows are highly probable.

The Group's obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) ~ a basket of currencies
comprising of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which is
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. There has been no external SOR hedge in place throughout the financial year 2007-08 due to
there being no material net exposure.

For the Bureau de Change business, balances of major currency holdings are hedged along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated
movement.

The Group's obligations to settle conveyance charges in USS and euro has been hedged (USS to April 2011, euro to April 2008).
The Group has four active hedge programmes covering obligations to settle euro invoices on automation projects
The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the
Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from financial instruments owned by GLS denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet is
calculated as the balance of the instruments multiplied by the change in exchange rates and impacts equity.

The effect from other financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet is calculated as
the balance of the instruments multiplied by the change in exchange rates and impacts profit

The effect from derivative assets and liabilities is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet date and impacts equity (for
derivatives within an effective hedging relationship) or profit before taxation for ineffective hedges and derivatives not designated in hedging
relationships.

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Commodity price risk

The Group is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 140 million
litres of fuel per year, and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services. The Group's fuel risk management strategy
aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets. The strategy uses over-the-counter derivative
products (in both USS commodity price and USS/Sterling exchange rate) to manage these exposures.

In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas. The Group's risk management strategy aims to
reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets. These exposures are managed by locking into fixed rate price
contracts with suppliers.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, with all other variables held constant, of
the Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from derivative assets and liabilities is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet date and impacts equity (for
derivatives within an effective hedging relationship) or profit before taxation for ineffective hedges and derivatives not desginated in hedging
relationships.

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Credit risk

Royal Mail operates a Credit Policy, which provides a fair and equitable arrangement for all its account customers. The level of credit granted is
based on a customer's risk profile assessed by an independent credit referencing agent. The Credit Policy is applied rigidly within the regulated
products area so as to ensure that Royal Mail is not in breach of compliance legislation. Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products is
based on commercial factors, which are commensurate with the Group's appetite for risk

Royal Mail has a dedicated credit management team, which sets and monitors credit limits, and takes corrective action as and when
appropriate. Despite all the controls in place, Royal Mail does suffer from bad debts, but the level of bad debts incurred is around 0.2% of
turnover.

With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalent investments, available for sale
financial assets, held to maturity financial assets, held for trading financial assets, loans and receivables financial assets and certain derivative
instruments, the Group invests/trades only with high quality financial institutions. The Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the
counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group, apart from a £0.2bn exposure to the Royal Bank of Scotland as a result
of the establishment of the two pension escrow accounts. This exposure is expected to be short-term, pending the implementation of a longer
term investment strategy for the accounts.

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This is
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include money
market funds, time deposits with approved counterparties, UK Government gilts and Treasury bills. Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed
to ensure continuity of funding.

The unused facilities for Royal Mail Group Ltd of £1,200m expire between 2014 and 2016 (2007 £1,200m expiring between 2014 and 2016)
The unused facility for Post Office Limited of £870m (2007 £850rn) expires in 2011. Additionally, the Group has £300m (2007 £300m) of
uncommitted lines of credit which are reviewed annually.

Capital management

Royal Mail Holdings plc is a public limited company which is not traded and regards its capital as share capital, share premium, retained
earnings and debt provided by the UK Government. The sole shareholder and the provider of the majority of debt to the Group is the UK
Government. The management of capital is closely linked to the Group's relationship with its Shareholder. The Group maintains its liquidity
requirements by the management of its internal funds and by the drawing down of equity and debt from its Shareholder as well as drawing on
limited external debt facilities. The Group's debt to equity ratio is determined by its Shareholder.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments
On 23 March 2007, Royal Mail Holdings plc and Royal Mail Group Ltd established £11bn of investments in escrow. These investments are held
as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from March 2006. At 30 March 2008, Royal Mail
Holdings plc had £909m of investments in the pension escrow and Royal Mail Group Ltd had £161m. Charges over these assets have been
registered. Further details on the Royal Mail Pension Plan, including the latest full actuarial valuation, are contained in note 25.

Carrying amounts and fair values
Set out below is a summary by category of the carrying amounts of all the Group’s financial instruments. Trade debtors, creditors,
prepayments, accruals and client creditors have been omitted from this analysis on the basis that carrying value is a reasonable approximation
for fair value. Pension scheme assets and liabilities are also excluded. Fair values have been calculated using current market prices (forward
exchange rates/commodity prices) and discounted using appropriate discount rates. There are no material differences between the fair value
(transaction price) of all financial instruments at initial recognition and the fair value calculated using these valuation techniques. The only
financial instrument where the carrying amount at year end is different to the fair value is the ‘BERR loans to Royal Mail Group Ltd’. At the
year end the respective fair value is £507m (2007 £494m).

Contractual maturity analysis for gross financial liabilities

The table below sets out the gross (undiscounted) contractual cash flows of the Group's financial liabilities. For overdrafts, loans and finance
leases/hire purchase contracts, these cash flows represent the undiscounted total amounts payable including interest. For derivatives which are
settled gross, these cash flows represent the undiscounted gross payment due and do not reflect the accompanying inflow. For derivatives
which are settled net, these cash flows represent the undiscounted forecast outflow.

Hedging Activities

The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous financial year.

i) The diesel fuel hedge programmes uses forward commodity price swaps and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure
arising from commodity price and USS/GBP exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases.

i) The air conveyance hedge programme uses USS and euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from
USS/GBP and GBP/euro exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.

ili) Four capital programmes using euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from GBP/euro exchange rates for
contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.

The £3m gains released from equity to income during year (2007 losses of £4m) are included within the distribution and conveyance operating

There is no material ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement relating to cash flow hedges.

For all the above cash flow hedge programmes, the underlying cash flows being hedged are expected to occur at the same dates as the hedge
instruments (derivatives) mature. For the non-capital programmes (Diesel and Air Conveyance), the profit or loss will be taken on maturity. For
capital programmes, the impact on the income statement will be through the depreciation charge over the life of the asset being hedged

The Group's fuel hedges, which fix the GBP cost of purchasing fuel, consist of two elements which may be hedged jointly or separately:

© a commodity forward transaction fixing the cost in US Dollars of purchasing fuel; and
© a currency forward transaction fixing the GBP cost of these US Dollars.

The table above contains both of these transactions. The commodity forward transactions are shown under the heading Fuel (US Dollars) -
$65m (2007 $94m) maturing within one year and Snil (2007 $25m) maturing after one year. The related currency forward transactions are
contained within the total of US Dollars - $142m (2007 $133m) maturing within one year and $182m (2007 $25m) maturing after one year.
25. Employee benefits - pensions

The Group operates pension schemes as detailed below.

Scheme Eligibility Type
Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) UK employees Defined benefit
Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) UK senior executives Defined benefit
Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan (RMRSP) UK employees Defined contribution

Various other small-scale schemes operated by overseas
subsidiaries Overseas subsidiary employees __Defined contribution

Defined Contribution

A charge for the defined contribution schemes of £2m (2007 £2m) was recognised in operating profit before exceptional items within the
income statement. The Company contributions to these schemes was £2m (2007 £2m).

Defined Benefit

Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds. The latest full actuarial
valuations of both schemes have been carried out as at 31 March 2006 using the projected unit method. For RMPP, this valuation has been
concluded at £3.4bn deficit. For RMSEPP, the valuation has been concluded at £43m deficit. A series of changes began to take effect on 1
April 2008 and are summarised in the Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement.

Payment of £548m (2007 £541m) was made during the year in respect of regular future service contributions, with £542m (2007 £538m)
relating to RMPP. The regular future service contributions for RMPP, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, has remained at 20.0%,
effective from the beginning of the previous year. This rate is not expected to change materially during 2008-09. For RMSEPP, these
contributions have been at 48.2% (2007 20.9%)

Payment of £284m (2007 £243m) was made during the year to fund the deficit in the schemes, with £276m (2007 £241m) relating to
RMPP. Deficit recovery payments are planned for RMPP over the 17 years from the date of the latest full actuarial valuation. These
payments will be made before each 31 March, and may therefore span across the Group's year end (the last Sunday in March). Over the 16
years from 31 March 2007, planned deficit payments are £260m per annum, increasing in line with RPI (base year is 2006-07). For
RMSEPP, deficit recovery payments will be £5m per annum from 1 April 2007 to 31 December 2015

A current liability of £7m (2007 £14m) has been recognised for payments to the pension schemes relating to redundancy (see note 21)
During the year, payments of £36m (2007 £74m) relating to redundancy were made,

On 23 March 2007, the Group established £1bn of investments in escrow as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of the 17
year deficit recovery period

25. Employee benefits - pensions (continued)

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and deficit in the schemes recognised for the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in
the financial statements of the Group:

a) Major assumptions

The size of the pension deficit, which is large in the context of the Group and its finances, is materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted. Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the deficit and overall income statement charge. The
major assumptions were:

‘At 30 March 2008 At 25 March 2007
%pa %pa

Rate of increase in salaries 4.6 44

Rate of increase in pensions and deferred pensions 3.6 34

Discount rate 65 53

Inflation assumption 3.6 34

Expected average rate of return on assets 68 7.0

The above assumptions relate to both defined benefit plans with the exception of the expected average rate of return on assets which is
computed for the combined assets of the plans. The expected average rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the long-term
expected rate of return of each principal asset class (see section b). The expected average rate of return is computed at each balance sheet
date based on the market values and long-term rate of return of each principal asset class as at that date.

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the larger scheme are based on the 1992 series mortality tables allowing for ‘medium cohort’ projections of
future improvements. These are detailed below:

Average expected life expectancy from age 60: 2008 2007

For a current 60 year old male RMPP member 26 years 26 years
For a current 60 year old female RMPP member 29 years 29 years
For a current 40 year old male RMPP member 28 years 28 years
For a current 40 year old female RMPP member 31 years 30 years

b) Plans’ assets and expected rates of return
The assets in the plans and the expected rates of return were:

Deficit in schemes (2,923) (4,985)

There is no element of the above present value of liabilities that arises from plans that are wholly unfunded

Certain of the above investments relate to properties occupied by the Group, but the contribution of these properties to the fair value of plans
assets is not material. The pension plans have not invested in any other assets used by the Group or in the Group's own financial instruments.

those people paid compensation in respect of redundancy during the accounting period. Such payments may occur in an accounting

e) History of experience gains and losses

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since transition to IFRSs at 29 March 2004 in the statement of recognised
income and expense is £890m gain (2007 £908m loss). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit
recognised in transition to IFRSs is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes. Consequently, the
Directors are unable to determine the curnulative amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the statement of
recognised income and expense between inception of the pension schemes and transition to IFRSs

Rural Network Reserve

The Rural Network Reserve was created by Post Office Limited, following directions issued by the Secretary of State under section 72 of the
Postal Services Act 2000 (the Act). The amounts allocated to this Reserve are to be applied as if they were profits available for distribution. The
purposes for which the Rural Network Reserve may be utilised are stated in the directions issued, and principally relate to the maintenance of
a rural network of post offices. A total of £594m has been used from this Reserve towards the maintenance of a rural network between March
2003 and the beginning of the 2007-08 financial year.

Following an order issued by the Secretary of State under section 103 of the Act, Post Office Limited received £150m during the period (2007
£75m). This subsidy has been accounted for as a Government grant and recorded within Revenue as the Social Network Payment (see note 2).
Under the terms of an agreement, Post Office Limited immediately allocated £150m to the Rural Network Reserve on receipt of the Social
Network Payment. During the period £150m (2007 £150m) of the Rural Network Reserve was applied towards the maintenance of a rural
network of Post Offices.

Interest

The transfer of interest relates to income recorded in the income statement, which has been earned on the assets that support the Rural
Network Reserve.

Financial Assets Reserve

The Financial Assets Reserve is used to record fair value changes on available for sale financial assets.

Foreign Currency Translation Reserve

The Foreign Currency Translation Reserve is used to record the gains and losses arising from 29 March 2004 on translation of assets and
liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency.

Hedging Reserve

The Hedging Reserve is used to record gains and losses arising from cash flow hedges since 28 March 2005.

Other Reserves

Other Reserves of £47m (2007 £47m) comprise £2m (2007 £2m) unrealised gain on First Rate Exchange Services Holdings Limited, a joint
venture transaction, and £45m (2007 £45m) relating to unrealised gains on Midasgrange Limited, an associate company. There were no
transfers between this Reserve and retained earnings during the year (2007 £8m).

Notes to the parent Company accounts

1. Parent Company accounting policies
The following accounting policies apply:

Financial year
The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and, accordingly, these accounts are made up to the 53 weeks ended 30 March
2008 (52 weeks ended 25 March 2007).

Basis of preparation
The parent Company's financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 19 May 2008

The accounts on pages 100 to 102 have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards and law, including the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985. Unless otherwise stated in the accounting policies below, the accounts have been prepared
under the historic cost accounting convention.

Royal Mail Holdings plc (the Company) has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by the Companies Act s230 (3).
However, the results of the Company for the year are disclosed in note 8 to the accounts.

The Company has taken advantage of paragraph 2D of FRS 29 (IFRS 7) Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has not disclosed
information required by that standard, as the Group's consolidated financial statements in which the Company is included provide
equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7.

No new UK Accounting Standards, which affect the presentation of these accounts, have been issued.

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Company assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where
appropriate, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash
generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries within the Company's accounts are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The opening and
closing carrying value relates solely to the Company's investment in Royal Mail Group Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of the Company. Royal
Mail Group Ltd is the only direct shareholding held by the Company.

Investments in pension escrow
Investments in pension escrow are financial assets within the scope of FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

The investments are a combination of short-term deposits and long-term investments which mature between 8 days and 48 years but
have been included within fixed assets as the investments have been provided as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of
the 17 year deficit recovery period from March 2006.

The investments comprise short-term deposits with a bank, Treasury bills and gilt edged securities.

The bank deposits are non-derivative assets that are neither held for trading nor quoted in an active market and therefore classified as
‘loans and receivables’ for measurement purposes under FRS 26 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). The
investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount deposited. The investments accrue interest, thereby increasing the
carrying value of the investments. This interest is included in the reported profit/(loss) for the year. The investments are derecognised
when they mature.

Treasury bills, index-linked gilt edged securities and conventional gilt edged securities are classified as available for sale financial
instruments on the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity. The
investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the purchase price. After initial recognition, interest is included in the reported
profit/(loss) for the year, using the effective interest rate method and the assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being
recognised in the Financial Assets Reserve until the investment is derecognised.

Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possibility of losses occurring is considered to be remote.

2. Directors’ emoluments

The Directors of the Company are not paid fees by the Company for their services as Directors of the Company. The Directors of the
Company are paid fees by other companies of the Group. These emoluments are disclosed in the Group accounts.

3. Auditors’ remuneration

The Auditors of the Company are not paid fees by the Company. The Auditors of the Company are paid fees by the other companies of
the Group. This remuneration is disclosed in the Group accounts.
