Thanks Mik, there was no intention to have a wash up on this particular case as such but | must stress
that from the outset this was 'new ground’ and a particularly unusual case (1st of its kind in 10yrs)for all
concerned. It involved many different variables which, at any point in time could have culminated in a
totally different outcome.

This enquiry took well over a year to conclude and routine procedures which have served us well for 10
years were suddenly being stretched to new limits, but it does highlight how (POA) can be called to
account and | totally agree we must learn from this.

Ann (many thanks for your comments) you have highlighted some interesting areas of procedure which
we need to recognise, and | will discuss these with Naomi and will keep you both informed.

Kind Regards Brian

Brian,
| understand from Anne that you do not intend to have an internal review on the Castleton case.

Nevertheless, We are concerned that POA made some errors during the course of this case which
could prove critical in any future litigation.

To this end, Anne has written-up her thoughts and comments (attached) , and | would welcome your
comments.

Regards
Mik
