Chris, David - just spoke to Andy and our proposed (legal) reply is:
1. Legally, changing the way you act does not amount to an admission that what you did in the past was wrong.

2. We have a contractual right to suspend subpostmasters, which we can choose to exercise depending on the facts of a
case.

3. We can use a policy to help us decide if we should exercise that right, e.g. for consistency in application.
4, We can change that policy, or how we apply it, if it is in our interest to do so, e.g. to improve the way we do business.

Do you need anything more?
Rod

A question for tomorrow at 9am.

If we have changed our policies so dramatically on suspensions etc, isn't that an admission that we got it wrong in the
past and should therefore automatically pay compensation to all affected?

Subject: Further briefing for tomorrow
Alice, Paula,
Please find attached is further briefing from Chris following a phone call from lan Henderson.

Also attached a draft agenda that James has sent through after seeing ours, I suggest we ask to take business
improvement first at the start of the meeting as this sets the tone for our wider engagement.

There are some further bullet points below setting out a proposed response to the past cases issue:

«Cartwright King have reviewed past cases in line with a process that has been by endorsed by leading Counsel.

*® 325 individuals cases were reviewed to see if any issues arising out of the Second Sight review ought to be
disclosed to the defence in accordance with our duties as a prosecutor.

«Further disclosure was provided in 21 cases.

e It is up to the defence in cases where disclosure has been provided to review the material and take any
appropriate action in the interests of their client.

«Thus far no convicted defendant has sought the leave of the Court of Appeal to challenge his conviction; this
may of course change.

e Post Office is still confident that we have not seen an unsafe conviction. We continue to keep this matter
under constant review as the Second Sight work and Post Office's own investigations into the complaints
continue.

e All 147 applications (including those with a criminal conviction) are being overseen by a former Criminal
Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony Hooper.

Regards

David
