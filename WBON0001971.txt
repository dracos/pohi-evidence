Hi Matthew,

Can we have both please — a sample of the deleted KELs from the online system first and then all of the deleted KELs
as well. The experts are looking for a sample but would like the ones that impacted branch accounts to be included.
Let's discuss this further on the call.

Kind regards,

Lucy

I think Jonny said on the phone on Monday that we would be asked to provide all of the deleted KELs; is
that now not likely to happen, and we are instead just being asked to provide sample as you request below?

Also, could you please clarify if you are looking for 15 KELs (10 Horizon, 5 HNG-X), but only including
those that potentially impacted branch accounts, or are you looking for all deleted KELs that may have had
that effect, or just a sample of any 15 deleted KELs split 10:5?

We will need to request these from our SSC team, and would like to be able to be clear with them on the
amount of work we are asking them to do.

Matthew, Dave, Pete,

Our IT expert wants to see a larger sample of the deleted KELs from the online system. They have asked for 10 more
from Legacy and 5 from HNG-X, ideally including any others that impacted branch accounts.

Are you able to provide these?

Kind regards,
