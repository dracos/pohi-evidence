And the specific period covered by my witness statement was either week 47 or 48 - as my witness statement says, I
can't remember which it was that I looked at at the time.

Subject: Marine Drive (POL v Castleton)

Brian / Peter,
Anne and I have completed our initial set of analysis for this case. Attached is a report of our findings.

<< File: 6825.anal.doc >>

I suggest that it is sent to POL or the solicitors. I appreciate it by no means resolves things, but I’m not clear exactly
what else can be done at this stage. Ideally, we should obtain the analysis that the letter indicates that Mr Castleton has
done and explain where he has got it wrong. However I appreciate that that may not be practical.

I retuned a marked up version of the witness statement that Stephen Dilley wrote for me some time ago. I had another
look at it today and I see that the specific questions that I'm supposed to be commenting on refer to Week 49 (end Feb -
early March 2004) and so have not been covered by this analysis. Do POL want a similar analysis done of that period?
I suspect that there will be further requests to analyse data to progress this, but don't feel it worth doing anything without
further guidance as to exactly what is required. There should still be plenty of budget left on the CT (I think I'll have
spent about a day - not sure how much time Anne has spent) to cover this once we know what is required.

Regards

Gareth
