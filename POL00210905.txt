Subject: Mediation Scheme letter to Jo Swinson

Richard

We spoke just now about a letter from Paula to Jo Swinson updating on her on the Initial Complaint and Review

Mediation Scheme.

The letter was sent in the post last night so should be with you on Friday. The attached is the final version (we don’t
have a scanned version with Paula’s signature but no further changes were made). As! mentioned, I had intended to
share the document with you in draft but our clearance was more efficient than expected on this occasion.

Copied to Belinda in case it’s helpful to discuss further for any briefing you might be preparing.

Best

Gavin
