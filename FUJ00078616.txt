Model Office Testing Progress Report Final Pass

Progress Report for Model Office Testing - Day 14
Tuesday 02"¢ March 1999

Management Summary

¢ A potential workaround to a number of the BES issues raised previously
has been identified. Practicality and implementation of this solution is up
for debate

e A number of EPOSS issues have been identified, the most serious of which
allowed production of a Cash Account with revaluation errors.

e All testing activity complete to schedule

Overall status of MOT testing: I GREEN
The management summary status indicators are defined as follows;

Green No major issues which require escalation outside of the testing arena
Amber _ Testing have serious concerns over quality
Red Major system difficulties have prevented progress

Planned ‘Key’ Counter Activity

¢ Second day of contingency payments due to temporary closure of Celtic.
The count of foreign encashments is not expected to be incremented
during this period.

e Manual ‘Final’ Cash Account to be produced at Omagh to simulate an
outlet changing ownership.

Actual ‘Key’ Counter Activity
e A pattern seems to be emerging that may account for a number of the BES
issues identified during MOT. Some examples of these issues are;
e Erratic results when attempting Carded Casual Agent encashments
¢ Inability to perform foreign encashments during the hybrid period
between counter and data centre migration
¢ Inconsistent results when applying Geographical Restrictions (i.e.
encashing a GB -only payment ata Northern Ireland outlet)
e The incorrect application of a 30 minute lock-out when attempting
nominated office encashment
After preliminary investigation, all of these issues seem to be because we
are attempting to encash payments generated on a Release 1c data centre
at a Release 2 outlet. The inconsistent results can be explained by the fact
that a stop and reissue of a Rel 1c payment once the data centre has
migrated to Rel 2 effectively cures all of the above issues. A possible
solution for Live Trial may be to enforce a stop and reissue of all payments
once the data centre has migrated. Although some problems will still be

encountered during the four week hybrid period, when the counter has
migrated but the data centre is still at Rel 1c, the impact of the above issues
could be reduced significantly.

The Cash Account at Arsenal was produced successfully, however a
worrying issue has been identified. All Stock Units were balanced
successfully and rolled to the next CAP. The cash account produced
subsequently misbalanced by 4p. Investigation found this to be an error in
the postal order revaluation performed on day 13. This should not have
happened, as the system validates the postal order revaluation process
before a Stock Unit balance and rollover can occur. This is a late breaking
issue, so further investigation is underway, and the incident will be
detailed on the day 15 report.

All other AP, BES, EPOSS and OBCS activity completed without major
incident

Overnight Processing
