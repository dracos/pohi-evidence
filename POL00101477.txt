Dear Alice

I am becoming increasingly worried about how the sub-Postmasters mediation process is working. The Post
Office is treating the decision as to whether individual cases should go through to mediation as a legal
battlefield, to the extent that I am getting close to asking another Urgent Question in the House of Commons
about it. I have requested a meeting with Paula, who I know is on leave this week. My office is receiving
requests for me to talk to the media, and I intend to do so, but I want to discuss matters with Paula first, if
possible. I, the subpostmasters and Second Sight agreed to this process in the expectation that it would be
carried through in good faith. I would hate to be in a position of having to call that into question.

Iam sorry to write in these terms, but I felt you needed to know how serious the matter was becoming.
Yours ever

James
