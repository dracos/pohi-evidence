Accountants. This report has been prepared by myself. The opinions given in this

report are my own. I understand that my duty is to the Court and I have complied

with that duty. I attach a summary of my professional qualifications and experience

at Exhibit 1.

( ; Background and my instructions
1.2

I am instructed on behalf of the Defendant, Mr Peter Holmes (‘Mr Holmes’), to

assist in examining the accounting evidence in respect of monies allegedly stolen by

him from the Post Office amounting to £46,049.

1.5 Given this shortfall, Mr Holmes was questioned about transactions amounting to

£48,000 which had passed through the Barclays Bank account, held in joint names

with his wife, over the period 21 July 2007 to 21 August 2008.

Mr Holmes

contended that these sums related to the takings from his wife’s business and that he

had till receipts for these.

1.6 I have sought to establish whether or not sums in the region of £48,000, which were

paid into this Barclays Bank account, relate to the takings from his wife’s business. I

consider this within Section 2 of my report.

Summary of my findings

1.7. My review of the accounting records maintained by Mrs Holmes’ business has led

me to the view that the monies deposited into the Barclays Bank joint account of Mr

& Mrs Holmes, amounting to £43,605 during the period 1 August 2007 to 19

September 2008, derive from the takings of Mrs Holmes’ business, as opposed to

being monies allegedly stolen by Mr Holmes from the Post Office.

1.8 This view is strengthened by the fact that regular deposits have continued to be made

into this account after the date that Mr Holmes ceased working as the Manager of the

Jesmond Sub-Post Office.

Scope and limitations

Peter Holmes, and I understand that it will be made available to the Defendant,

2. DEPOSITS MADE TO BARCLAYS BANK ACCOUNT NO. 4517490

Given the alleged theft by Mr Holmes, amounting to £46,049, auditors from the Post

i)

Office sought an explanation from Mr Holmes regarding approximately £48,000 of

deposits made into his Barclays Bank account, which he held jointly with his wife.

2.2 It was claimed by Mr Holmes that these deposits related to the takings from his

wife’s business. I have sought to establish whether or not this is the case.

Mrs Holmes’ business
2.3. Mrs Holmes operates a cake shop and also provides cake making tuition. The

business trades as I The business’ accounts for the year
ended 5 April 2008 are attached at Exhibit 3. They indicate that the business is both
profitable and solvent. The business employs the services of Mr EE of
Tax Assist Direct, to prepare its annual accounts from the accounting records that are

maintained by Mr Holmes, on behalf of his wife.

2.4 On 22 July 2009, I met Mr I at his offices and discussed the preparation of the
business accounts with him. It was his view that takings from Mrs Holmes’ shop
were paid into the jointly held Barclays Bank account. However, when preparing the
accounts of the business, he relied upon the accounting records prepared by Mr
Holmes and did not check the personal bank statements of Mr & Mrs Holmes for the

purposes of establishing the business’ takings.

2.5 Therefore, I have carried out a separate exercise to establish whether the deposits
paid into Mr & Mrs Holmes’ Barclays Bank account relate to the takings of Mrs
Holmes’ business. I have considered the period from 1 August 2007 to 19 September

2008, being the period of the Indictment.

Gross takings from 1 August 2007 to 19 September 2008
2.6 From the accounting records of the business provided to me by Mr EE at Exhibit

4A I have calculated that the gross takings of the business (inclusive of VAT)
amounted to £137,423 during the period 1 August 2007 to 19 September 2008.

Bankings made to Alliance & Leicester business account

WITNESSES

2.7. Mrs Holmes’ business operates a bank account with Alliance & Leicester. From the

bank statements provided for this account, at Exhibit 6, I have established that the

deposits paid into this account during the period 1 August 2007 to 19 September

2008 amounted to £70,239.

Bankings made to Barclays joint personal account

2.8 At Exhibit 7, I have identified that during the period 1 August 2007 to 19 September

2008, Mr & Mrs Holmes’ joint account received deposits amounting to £43,605,

excluding Mr Holmes’ wages from the Post Office of £16,591 and a loan for £8,100.

Cash expenditure of Mrs Holmes’ business

2.9 In order to understand the extent of cash banked by Mrs Holmes’ business from the

gross takings it receives, I asked Mr Holmes whether any monies were deducted from

the cash takings prior to them being banked. I was advised by Mr Holmes that the

employees of the business were paid in cash at the end of each week. The wages for

these individuals are recorded within the accounts of the business. During the year

ended 5 April 2008, the wages paid to employees amounted to £18,075 (Exhibit 3).

2.10 Therefore, on a pro-rata basis, I estimate that the cash wages paid during the period 1

August 2007 to 19 September 2008, would be £20,551 !.

Summary

APPROVED
EXPERT
FINANCIAL
WITNESSES

2.11 Having considered the accounting records of Mrs Holmes’ business, I set out below

my summary of the funds that would be available for banking within the Barclays

joint account, after the deduction of funds paid to the Alliance & Leicester account

and the cash payments made to employees:

Period 1-Aug-07 to 19-Sep-08 Ref £
Total gross takings of Mrs Holmes’ business 2.6 137,423
Less:

Banked at Alliance & Leicester 2.7 (70,239)
Cash wages paid 2.10 (20,551)
Cash available for banking into Barclays Bank joint account 46,633
Actual cash banked into Barclays Bank joint account

43,605

2.12 My calculations set out above illustrate that there was sufficient cash available from

Mrs Holmes’ business to explain the deposits made into Mr & Mrs Holmes’ joint

bank account during the period 1 August 2007 to 19 September 2008.

2.13 In addition, I have noted that three deposit slips were found at Mr Holmes’ house

following a search by Post Office Investigators. These were for deposits made into

the Barclays joint account of Mr & Mrs Holmes. Each of these deposits are included

within the above totals and are capable of being derived from Mrs Holmes’ business

takings.

Deposits made after 19 September 2008

2.14 When carrying out my review of Mr & Mrs Holmes’ Barclays Bank account, I

identified that cash continued to be deposited on a regular basis into this account

after Mr Holmes ceased his duties as the Manager of Jesmond Sub-Post Office. The

pattern of regular cash deposits into this account continues from September 2008 up

until 30 March 2009 (being the last statement provided to me).

2.15 Therefore, in my opinion, the continuation of regular deposits into the Barclays

account provides further evidence that such deposits derive from Mrs Holmes’

business.

Conclusion
2.16 My review of the accounting records maintained by Mrs Holmes’ business has led

me to the view that the deposits into the Barclays joint account of Mr & Mrs Holmes,
amounting to £43,605 during the period 1 August 2007 to 19 September 2008, derive
from the takings of Mrs Holmes’ business, as opposed to the monies allegedly stolen

by Mr Holmes from the Post Office.

2.17 This view is strengthened by the fact that regular deposits have continued to be made
into this account after the date that Mr Holmes ceased working as the Post Office

Manager at Jesmond Sub-Post Office.
