Summary

From the above results, the majority of new agents who completed
the feedback questionnaire feel that they have received sufficient
training to enable them to process transactions and prepare the
office balance.

The transactions that the respondents highlighted as feeling most
confident with were Automated Payments/Banking and Mails. The
transactions they felt least confident with were balancing,
especially the Trading Period (TP) balance, and infrequent
transactions.

To address this, the new training offer now includes a full TP
balance at the Follow up Balance regardless of whether or not this
date is the branch’s scheduled TP balance. Emphasis has been
placed on the use of Horizon Online Help to assist in areas that
the agent may be unfamiliar with so that they can help them selves
and not automatically call the Helpline when they come across a
transaction that are have not seen before.

Half of the respondents felt that they did not need any further
training or support. From those who did feel that they needed
further training/support 18% replied that they required further

training in the weekly and TP balances. 7% replied that they
required further training in selling.

As part of the new training offer the agent receives coaching on
the Minimum Service Standard conversations and as part of their
Performance Assessment they are assessed on the quality of their
conversations both in the classroom and on site at their branch.

The majority of respondents understood both the Branch Standards
requirements and the security requirements for logging on to the
Horizon system.

Over half of the respondents felt that nothing was missing from
their classroom or on site training. Out of those who felt there
was something missing 6% replied balancing at TP and 3% replied
not enough time on the transactions.

The classroom timetable has been reviewed and the timings for each
session have been re- evaluated and include a mix of product
knowledge and practical sessions.

Overall, over 75% of the respondents felt that the time spent with
the trainer was Worthwhile/Useful/Sufficient and 84% felt that the
training only interfered with the running of their Business a
little or not at all.

Over half of the respondents who stressed a view on the trainer
felt that the trainer was good/knowledgeable/excellent and 21%
felt that the training delivered was good. Possible areas for
improvement included spending less time in the classroom and more
time on site and experience in a live branch prior to training.
The new training offer now includes 8 days classroom training
instead of 10 with on site training starting from the transfer day
instead of the following day.
