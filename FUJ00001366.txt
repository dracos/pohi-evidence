Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/1/2000

2 Introduction

This document, when approved, will be a Contract-Controlled Document (CCD).

2.1 Intent of agreement

The intent of this interface agreement is to establish effective co-operation between
ICL Pathway and POCL for the timely efficient and cost effective delivery of
Operational Business Change — Product using Reference Data to Horizon enabled
Post Office Counters.

This agreement identifies:

¢ POCL’s and ICL Pathway’s requirement for Product changes introduced via
Reference Data,

« the agreed end-to-end service solution of ICL Pathway and POCL, both
separately and jointly, for implementing such changes and

e the obligations of both parties, both separately and jointly, that must be met in
order to deliver the solution.

There are a number of documents (which are not CCDs) that describe the
interfaces and agreements made between ICL Pathway and POCL for the
management of Operational Business Changes [refs. 1, 2, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17]. This
document provides an “umbrella” agreement for those others and they will comply
with the agreements made within this Interface Agreement.

2.2 Maintenance of this agreement

This agreement is applicable to the CSR Horizon release. It will be reviewed for the
CSR+ release and regularly after that on an on-going basis. It is maintained by ICL
Pathway on behalf of both parties.

2.3 Future Developments

POCL and ICL Pathway agree to work jointly to improve the quality and
effectiveness of the Reference Data interface as follows:

e Enhance the functionality, scope and effectiveness of the Reference Data test
environment

e Continuously improve the toolset available in the test environment. In particular
ICL Pathway will further develop its Reference Data comparison tool for
identifying impact of planned Reference Data changes

e Continuously improve the Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) relating to
business rules. A consolidated set of business rules and procedures will be
jointly developed and implemented

3 Scope

3.1 Interfaces

This agreement covers all the interfaces between ICL Pathway and POCL that
support the Operational Business Change process for pre-defined product changes.

Interface Interface Interface
POCL Pathway Pathway POCL Pathway
—process rocess [—process rocess * rocess
* this step is not
needed if change is
pre-authorised

The start is the point where an OBC form has been completed and issued within
POCL, and the end point is where the Reference Data has been released within ICL
Pathway for delivery to the live counters.

The delivery of the Reference Data to counters is covered by the SLA [see section
3.2].

It applies to both Advanced and Basic Product Changes where:

e a Basic Change is a change which consists solely of Reference Data which
requires no additional ICL Pathway actions and may be submitted to ICL
Pathway without notice

« an Advanced Change is a change which requires additional ICL Pathway activity
and is subject to advanced notification.

3.2 Outlet Changes

This Interface Agreement does not cover Reference Data for Outlet Change [see ref.
15].

3.3 SLA

The contractual provisions relating to the distribution of Reference Data are defined
in the SLA in Schedule G10 of the contract.

Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/1/2000

Where the required date for delivery is not the day following authorisation, the SLA
requirement to release the next day does not apply as long as the Reference Data
change is delivered before the required date.

3.4 Operational Business Change processes

The Operational Business Change (OBC) process for product change is defined in
[ref. 1] and the types of change that qualify for the OBC process are defined in the
Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2]. Changes not found in the
RDCC must be requested via the normal Change Control mechanism (CR/CCN).

A summary of the process is given below.

Note: not every Change Type follows every step of the process [see section 5].
The timescales for each stage of the process are defined in [section 5].

The types of change that the process applies to are defined in [section 4].

The responsibilities of each party are defined in [section 8].

4 Types of Change

4.1 Introduction

Change types are pre-defined for inclusion into the OBC — product process. This
definition can be found in the Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2].
Each pre-defined change type also can be grouped into one of the following:

Standard:

e Basic Change — Pure Type A Reference Data only, does not required
erification

Basic Change — High Risk IType A Reference Data only, requires verification

e Advanced, Type A Reference Data, plus after-the-event
Simple Change Ichanges

e Advanced, Type A & Type B Reference Data, MIS change &
Standard Change testing required

e Advanced, IRequires Type C Reference Data from ICL Pathway
Complex Change

e AP changes AP Client Take On

Fastracks:
e Basic Express An agreed lead time for a specific requirement to

change specific Reference Data quickly

e Migration Special (An addition to the Product mappings for an outlet

« Tight Timescales (A contractual requirement (Reqt 539/3) to make any
kind of Reference Data change quickly, in specified
circumstances.

e Error Correction IThe method of changing Reference Data for Error
Correction purposes is described in [ref. 12].

The RDCC Product Change categories that apply to these changes are listed
(section numbers provided, based on release 2.2 of the RDCC [ref. 2]) in [sections
4.2 and 4.3] below. The assumptions listed in the RDCC must be adhered to in order
to apply these categorisations.

4.2 Standard Changes

(with cross-references to RDCC section numbers)
4.2.1 Basic - Pure

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from POCL to ICL Pathway
(OBC form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see
section 0.3] is the request for change. The file must identify that its contents are
Basic Pure changes. The file may contain more than one change of the same type.
All Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. Pure changes do not
require verification and are pre-authorised for release.

6.7.9 Change clerk instructions

[DN: it is currently under discussion whether increasing product availability
(non core) can be a Pure Basic change].

4.2.2 Basic — High Risk

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from POCL to ICL Pathway
(OBC form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see
section 0.3] is the request for change. The file must identify that its contents Basic
High Risk changes. The file may contain more than one change of the same type. All
Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. High Risk changes
require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by POCL before
release.

6.4.1 Change to product price

6.46 Revaluation

6.5.2 Increase product availability (non-core)

6.4.3, 6.7.1, 6.7.5 Change to min/max quantity/value

6.7.2, 6.7.3 Change whether voidable or reversible

6.7.6 Change between existing methods of payment
6.6.1 - 6.6.3, 6.10.6 Change product names

4.2.3 Advanced simple

Advanced Simple changes require advanced notification from POCL to ICL Pathway
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be
identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the contents of
the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway has actions to take to
implement the change (in addition to processing the Type A Reference Data file
from POCL) e.g. update documentation, but these actions can occur after the
change has been released and therefore do not extend the leadtime for the change.
These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by
POCL before release.

6.2.1-6.2.5 Cease non-value product*

6.2.1 -6.2.3 Cease Sell and Remit In/Out of value product (at same
time)*

6.5.3 Non core product becomes core

6.7.8 Change to use of additional fields

* see appendix A

4.2.4 Advanced standard

Advanced Standard changes require advanced notification from POCL to ICL
Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files
must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway has actions
to take to implement the change (in addition to processing the Type A Reference
Data file from POCL) e.g. process Type B files, and these actions must occur before
the change has been released, therefore the leadtimes are longer than for Simple or
Basic changes. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and
authorisation by POCL before release.

6.4.2 Change to discount indicator

6.6.4 Change ability to print receipt

6.6.5 Change from value to non-value stock
6.9.1 Change to client name — non AP
6.13.5 Change to calendar

6.8.11 Remove AP client

4.2.5 Advanced, complex

Advanced Complex changes require advanced notification from POCL to ICL
Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files
must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway must
generate Type C Reference Data to implement the change and test that the change
works as requested in the OBC form. These changes require a Verification and a
Comparison report and authorisation by POCL before release.

6.1(all) Add new product - non value stock

6.1.1 - 6.1.4 Add new product - make value stock available to rem-in
(up to 6 weeks prior to it being made available for sale)

6.3(all), 6.8.7 Remove product permanently (not available at CSR)*

6.2.1 -6.2.3 Cease value product and leave on Rem Out screen*

6.4.4,6.4.5 Change to scales matrix /tariff change (no Type C

required but BSM need extra time to verify the OBCs).

6.10.2 - 6.10.5, 6.10.7 Change to screen layout

6.12.3, 6.12.5 Change to accounting node

6.5.4 Change product categorisation i.e. making a non-core
product core (making a core product non-core at CSR is
implemented through the introduction of a new product).

6.6.7 Change to Best Fit screens

6.5.1 Temporary withdrawal of a product

* see appendix A

4.2.6 AP

AP changes require advanced notification from POCL to ICL Pathway (an OBC
form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as
such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the contents of the file are
appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway has actions to take to implement
the change e.g. test Tokens and supply test files to HAPS for POCL End to End
testing of changes. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report,
additional testing and authorisation by POCL before release.

(as agreed in AP CTO & Token Verification documents)

6.8.1 -6.8.5 Introducing new AP client, service or token
6.8.9 Change to client name (new token data)
6.8.7, 6.8.10, 6.8.11 Ceasing AP Client, product or token

Notes on AP change:
« Changing AP product details is treated the same way as changing EPOSS
products.

e Ceasing AP Client, product or token may be implemented as an Advanced
Simple change if required, with the client service list being amended after the
event.

4.3 Fast track changes

(with cross-references to RDCC [ref. 2] section numbers)
4.3.1 Basic express

A Basic Express change is a subset of Basic High Risk changes and must comply
with the definitions in [section 4.2.1]. However, the leadtimes [see section 5]
specified for a Basic Express change can only be achieved where verification can
be performed on the basis of the Verification Report and not a Comparison Report.
The type of change must be such that there is minimal risk of error occurring
elsewhere within the system as a result of applying the change and is therefore
limited to:

6.4.1 Change to price of non-value stock

6.4.6 Change to price of revaluable value stock
(must still allow 3 days ‘warning’ period at the counter for
PMs)

6.7.1 Change to min/max quantity/value

6.6.1 -6.6.3 Change to Long/ Medium / Short name

The limits for use are:

© only for the categories of change which conform to the above e.g. ‘Ticket
and Travel’ products or to meet the requirement for Tight Timescales

© only OBCs that must be active on completion of the change within 48hrs
(note: for revaluations, the 48hrs must be in advance of the 3 days
‘warning ‘ period at the counter)

© OBCs must be received by Pathway by 10am on a working weekday and

only normal volumes of change as defined in [section 6]

© the Change Number must start with defined prefixes [ref. 16]. If a Change
is delivered to ICL Pathway with this prefix but the contents do not meet
the specified criteria it will be processed according to the normal
leadtimes.

4.3.2 Migration special

A Migration Special change is a specific subset of Basic High Risk changes and
must comply with the definitions in [section 4.2.1] except that Migration Specials
are pre-authorised for release. They are verified by POCL after release,
requiring Verification and a Comparison report, so the authorisation can be
confirmed.

Migration Special changes are additions to the Reference Data defining which
non-core products a particular outlet can sell, where the outlet has been selling
the item but the Reference Data does not reflect this. This Reference Data is
needed so that the cash account can record those sales, when it is migrated to
the Horizon system.

The limits for use are:

© additions to Non-core Product to Outlet mappings only
® Reference Data must be received by Pathway by 10am
® Reference Data files must be identifiable as Migration Specials

If the HFSO discovers that there is a discrepancy in the Product to Outlet
mapping (also referred to as non-core items or local products) at the Outlet
which he is currently migrating he will follow the procedure set down in
references [8 & 9] for the HFSO to contact RDOT with the requested OBC. This
Reference Data file will be recognised by ICL Pathway by the fact that the
Change Number is in the defined form [ref 16] and the file only contains
additions to Product to Outlet mapping Reference Data for an outlet currently
being migrated. If the file sent contains any other Reference Data or does not
have a Change Number of the prescribed format the file will be treated as a
Migration Special change but shall instead be categorised as appropriate and
be dealt with accordingly.

This process may also be used immediately following migration where mapping
errors are subsequently found.

Once ICL Pathway has confirmed that the Reference Data is of the required type
it will be released to the ‘Live’ environment. The authorisation for this release is

implied by the pre-fix to the Change Number and will be confirmed by BSM as
soon as possible after the event.

Requirement 539/3 states there is a need to “implement changes to Reference Data
to tight timescales. As an example of such timescales, it shall be possible to
implement Reference Data changes consequent on a [Treasury] Budget by start of
business on the following day”.

4.3.3.2 Definition

A Tight Timescale change is caused by either:

* an emergency situation where normal leadtimes cannot be adhered to because
of legal circumstances outside of POCL control, or

¢ to allow POCL to exploit commercial opportunities.

Each instance of such change must be notified in writing by POCL to ICL Pathway
and agreed between POCL Head of Business Service Management and ICL
Pathway Head of Operations Management or their nominated authorised deputies

4.3.3.3 Types

Analysis by POCL of the business requirements indicates that the types of change
that require to be actioned in tight timescales are:

e Price changes

e Emergency cessation of a product

e Product introduction or change where the product has been created in advance
with interim details.

4.3.3.4 a) Price Change

The most frequent tight timescale changes are price changes. These will be
processed via the fastrack Basic Express route.

4.3.3.5 b) Emergency cessation

Normally, cessation of a product (i.e. ending the ability to transact a product) is an
Advanced Simple change with a lead time of 2 weeks*. By agreement, it will be dealt
with as if it were a Basic Express, with a lead time of 2 working weekdays. The
normal processing will occur after the event e.g. generation of Comparison Reports.
* see Appendix A

4.3.3.6 c) Product introduction or change (with interim details)

A new product (or product change) can be introduced in advance of all details being
available e.g. to meet a late-breaking business opportunity. Mandatory details
should be provided initially, although some will have interim values

e.g.

* product name may be set to “test name” or other identifiably interim name

e the cash account mapping may be to a line marked as “temporary”

e the button for the product may not be introduced until a later date, and the
product only available to be sold by PLU initially.

The “interim” product should be verified using standard processes for product
change [see sections 3.4 and 5.6].

To set up the interim product the normal leadtimes should be adhered to (e.g. 31
working weekdays for a new product). When the interim product cannot be set up
with the normal lead times, it will be dealt with as a high priority exception [see
section 9.2].

The interim details will be later replaced using:

e a Basic Express change for the final information relating to price and name. This
must be identifiable as part of the tight timescale change, and will be verified via
the Verification Report for Basic Express, before the change is released

e standard changes that occur after the go live of the product e.g. the introduction
of the button, or the change of the cash account mapping.

4.3.4 Error Correction

All incidents are managed through the incident management process [ref. 12] and
the time scale for its correction is driven by the impact of the incident and the go live
date of the change [see section 9.3].

5 Lead time for changes

5.1 Introduction

The lead times quoted in this section are the end-to-end times covering both POCL
and ICL Pathway activities. Each party must meet each milestone applicable to it in
order that the subsequent milestones and the end-to-end lead times are achieved.

The types of change that relate to each category are defined in [section 4].

These lead times apply for the volumes given in [section 6].

The lead time runs from initiating a change until the change is released to the live
system.

For information only, the SLAs to be achieved as set out in the Codified Agreement,
Schedule [G10], are shown at the end of each model. The SLA applies to the
delivery of the released Reference Data not to the delivery of the OBCs.

Notes:

For simplicity, the models used do not show activities that occur in parallel.

day = working weekday (Mon-Fri, excluding public holidays)
adow = any day of the week, includes non working weekdays (Mon-Sun)
times = latest time action can occur to meet the schedule

Where a time is given next to a milestone, the time is critical to achieving that
milestone. Where the time is not given, the default is for the handover between
organisations to be complete by 8am. Failure to achieve a milestone by the given (or
default) time potentially extends the lead time of the change.

6 Volume of change

6.1 Introduction
The POCL forecast volume of Operational Business Change is shown in Appendix B

On a 3 monthly basis the Operational Service Review Forum will review actual and
forecast volumes to estimate the impact on future capacity and lead times.

6.2 Committed volumes

The parties agree that the POCL Dec ‘99 estimate in [Appendix B] is deemed to be
the baseline volume of OBCs for this agreement for the year 2000. The baseline for
Reference Data record changes is given in the AIS [ref. 5].

Where:

e the quarterly forecast figures (or observed actuals) for a rolling 12 month period,
show an increase of more than 15% on the baseline for the (aggregated) total of
all OBCs or for all Reference Data records or

¢ Fastrack changes (excepting Migration Specials) exceed 10% of the rolling
annual total volume of changes, then

a Change Request (CR) is required for full impacting of the resource needed to
deliver the end-to-end process and to establish a new baseline.

Where these limits are exceeded changes will be processed as exceptions [see
section 9.2].

6.2.1 Peaks in Business Change activity

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is no more than
15% above the baseline, the changes will be processed to meet the agreements
specified in this document.

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is more than
15% above the baseline, this is termed a ‘peak’.

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 15% and 30% above the baseline notification must
be given at least 1 week in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet the
agreements specified in this document.

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 30% and 50% above the baseline notification must
be given at least 4 weeks in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet
the agreements specified in this document.

Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 3.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20/1/2000

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is anticipated to
be greater than 50% above the baseline, or where a the notice period of a peak
is not possible, the changes will be treated as an exception [see section 9.2].

« Where sufficient notice of an increase in volume over 50% above the baseline is
available, a CR can be raised to change the baseline.

e Where the total volume of Business changes is greater than 20% above the
baseline, over a 3-month period, a CR is required to change the baseline
volumes.

The operational reviews will ensure that there is careful co-ordination of each
component of the change(s) and will prioritise between current work, where
necessary.

Examples of peak activity are end of year and tariff changes.

a) End of year

The end of financial year changes will normally represent a peak in change activity.

Changes that can be expected at this time of year include:

* cash account changes (which are not covered by OBC processes but do need to
be co-ordinated with the OBC activity)

« changes caused by budget decisions

e other product changes, e.g. Tariff Change or the introduction of new Homecare
Stamp Changes.

POCL and ICL Pathway will plan and manage these changes as separate peak

change projects.

b) Tariff changes

A Tariff change may include new product introduction, revaluation, price changes
and/or scales data changes, with multiple changes of each type. It may cause a
large overhead on verification, particularly of scales data, and requires careful co-
ordination, as well as being open to last minute amendment by POUNC.

9 Orders and exceptions

9.1 Orders

e The receipt by the OBC Product Mailbox of the OBC form is the confirmed
request from POCL to ICL Pathway, for Advanced Changes.

e The receipt of a Reference Data file containing only Basic (Class 1 Reference
Data) in the RDMC, is the confirmed request for change from POCL to ICL
Pathway.

e The receipt of a correctly completed Authorisation Form from POCL is the
confirmed authorisation to release the change.

« The receipt of pre-authorised change files (e.g. Migration Special or Pure Basic)
clearly identified as such and containing that type of change, is the authorisation
for release of the changes.

e Requests for non-OBC changes (i.e. those not defined in the RDCC [ref. 2]) will
not be accepted and need to be submitted as a Change Request. However, the
change request may also initiate an update to the RDCC so that new changes
are introduced to the OBC process, where agreed.

9.2 Exceptions

Exceptions, e.g. to volumes or lead-times, will be processed using available
resources without any guarantee of service delivery. Both POCL and ICL Pathway
shall notify the other party when a request is recognised to be an exception.

Note: An agreed Deviation to the Service is not an exception.

POCL may wish to change the priority of an exceptional change so that it is given
preference over normal changes. In this instance the agreed lead times will be
extended pro rata for displaced activities.

9.3 Errors

All errors will be raised as incidents once identified (using the process [ref. 12]) and
the change will be suspended awaiting corrective action, potentially delaying the
achievement of that milestone e.g. files containing records that are rejected will not
be processed until the rejected records are corrected. Where the achievement of a
milestone is at risk, corrective action will be taken by the appropriate party or
parties, by agreement, in order to achieve the final milestone, where possible

An incident will also be raised for late deliverables.

If the Start Date contained within Reference Data record is set to a date prior to the
Required Date an incident will be raised i.e. it is either prior to the date on the OBC
form, or is not consistent with the lead times defined in [section 5].

If it is known that the final milestone will not be achieved, the incident management
process will trigger contingency action to be taken by POCL e.g. notifying outlets of
delay in issuing a change.

The Operational Review forum shall review the number of error files transmitted to
ICL Pathway by POCL with the aim of reducing the total number to less than 0.1% of
the total number of files in any quarter. Appropriate steps shall be taken to establish
and eliminate the root cause of such errors.

9.4 Escalation

Disagreements about the service e.g. whether a change is exceptional, will be
resolved using the Service Management processes [ref. 12].

9.5 Charging

e AP Client Take On is charged as specified [see ref. 3].
e Deviations to the service will be charged as per the CCN.
¢ Invoices will be raised and paid in accordance with Schedule A10.

Business tests for the purpose of verifying changes to Reference Data are
conducted by POCL and are described in [ref. 18]. These tests include, where
appropriate, review of Verification and Comparison Reports and the functional
testing of Reference Data on test counters supplied by ICL Pathway. Authorisation
from POCL to ICL Pathway to release Reference Data is made on the basis of these
tests.
