You may see news today about a legal Judgment criticising Post Office in the High Court.

I want to assure you that we take the Judgment extremely seriously and lessons being
learned through the litigation are being taken on board.

There is nothing more important to our business than our relationship with you, the people
delivering our services to customers day-in, day-out and we are committed to making it

easier for you to build thriving businesses.

Please take a moment to view this short video in which I provide some background and
hopefully answer questions you may have. (link)

It’s important to underline that the Court’s findings do not affect the products and services
we provide for our millions of customers through our UK network of 11,500 Post Office

branches

We will continue to keep you updated on any developments and the actions we are taking
following this judgment.

You can also ask us questions xxxxxxxx/ or talk to your Area Manager.

communities up and down the country.
