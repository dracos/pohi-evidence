Hi Belinda

Please find attached a letter sent to Paula regarding a Horizon integrity concern. I have spoken to Gayle
today, and she has advised me that you are the person to help me. The letter is from Oliver Heald QC MP
on behalf of Mrs Jasvinder Barang, who was a subpostmaster until her contact was terminated due to
fraud. Mrs Barang believes that there was as issue with her horizon system and would like her case to be
considered under the Mediation Scheme. Both Oliver Head MP and Mrs Barang are aware the closing date
was 18 November.

Not sure if this case can be looked into? Can you please advise what we can do?
Kind regards
Angela
