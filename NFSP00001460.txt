Helen,

The word systemic means "referring to something that is spread throughout,
system-wide, affecting a group or system, such as a body, economy, market or
society as a whole."

The opposite of up is down, the opposite of in is out and the opposite of
systemic is localized. There is no systemic or system wide problem with
Horizon but that doesn't mean that it is 100% robust and without flaws.
Within any system over time, flaws and bugs etc will create anomalies. I'm
not saying everyone is innocent but I'm also not saying they're all guilty.

Tf over 150 MP's say there is a case for the Post Office to answer over this
then it seems rather odd that the SLT of the NFSP don't.

truths?
