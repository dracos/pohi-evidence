STATUTORY ACCOUNTS

The draft Statutory Report and Accounts for the period from
incorporation. of the Company (19/1/95) to 31/12/95 are attached.

These need not be filed with the Registrar of Companies until

31 October, but it is possible that the potential customer may
wish to see a set of accounts (even though the company does not
trade and there are no entries in the books beyond £100 in issued
share capital). Consequently the Board are asked to approve these
(delegating any one Director the power to make any necessary
changes eg arising from the auditors) then authorise any one
Director to sign the accounts, and the Secretary to sign the
Directors’ Report and convene the Annual General Meeting once the
auditors have signed the accounts.

SUBJECT: Managing Directors Report
Board Meeting 25th April 1996

1. INTRODUCTION

An update report on the Pathway tender was issued to the
Board on the 9th April 1996. For convenience, a copy is
attached.

2. NEW ITT

Following the Core Negotiating Team meeting on the 12th
April, we have now received the request to re-tender. This
was issued following a meeting of the sponsors on the 16th
April and is due for reply by 10.00am on Monday 22nd April.

The elements of the Pathway price amendment proposal which
have been accepted by the programme include the following:

Monthly payment terms.

An extension to contract life.

A modest reduction in the total counter

population.

iv. The removal of the need for the service provider
to provide Storage and Retrieval for .receipts.

ve Acceptance of a more simplified mechanism for POCL

documentation

vi. An acceptance of a more limited scheme of issuing

pick up notices.

In cost impact terms this means something over half of our
ideas have now been accepted and this is very encouraging.

However this re-tender is not without risk, particularly
when the instructions to tenderers states "You should feel
free to vary any other aspect of your original tender,
whether or not such variations were discussed with the
authorities during the repricing negotiations". This in
many ways opens the door to any major repricing a_ service
provider may wish to make. It is generally well known in
the marketplace that Pathway’s was the best priced on the
table so far, so this may well stimulate more competition.

FUJ00117331

FUJ00117331

The strong advice we are getting from the programme is to
make our re-tender compliant against the new terms now
issued. These terms themselves have adopted a large number
of our amendments made in our variant bid of the 21st March.
They have not however met us in all aspects and the key
decision for Pathway is how far to go along this road.

3. PATHWAY’S SUB-CONTRACTS

Very good progress has been made overall on this subject
this month and in all cases we now have either signed sub-
contracts or agreed terms and conditions. These will be
activated as soon as an award is made.

Work with the EDSC resources has moved ahead very quickly
and Escher have been running in Boston a training -programme
for our key people, followed up by a two week practical
workshop during which actual code and work will begin.
Progress on this is being very positive from all sides.

We have also run our monthly Suppliers Forum which currently
we use as a main focus for communication to all our sub-

contractors. This is well received by the community at
large and give us an excellent platform to communicate the
overall picture. After award has been placed, then I see

this Forum taking even greater importance as we drive all
our work to meet key milestones.

4. I PATHWAY ORGANISATION

Following the decision by the shareholders for Pathway to
become a totally owned ICL subsidiary, I have reviewed all
the resources within Pathway and have agreed with Girobank
the timing of all the secondments and how long they should
continue. As a result a number of staff will finish by the
end of April and May, and as it stands at the moment all
staff will have returned to the Bank by the end of the year.

5. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS

Careful ‘submission of a re-tender.

Rapid competence building in the EDSC facility.
Building up key resources and planning such that
Pathway hits the street running after an award
decision.

Finance Director’s report - April 1996

Highlights

Good:

*

ee

Pathway restructuring accomplished to meet customer
requirement

Strong indications that we were competitively priced following
the first Tender - albeit above Budget

Retender substantially on our terms - compliantly

Our timetable adopted as the compliant standard for all three
bidders, we believe

No surprises in the second ITT, which invited straightforward
confirmation of the changes discussed after the first Tender
Good progress on sub-contracts

Resourcing and competence ramping up in anticipation of award
Full planning and control processes becoming established

No degradation of Business Case

Not so good:

*

*

Work still to do on financing, reflecting the new
circumstances

Tight deadlines on functional spec. and acceptance criteria
Counter equipment definition not entirely stable

ISDN boards still undergoing change

Timetable

The Procurement team appear confident that award will be made mid-
May despite the second iteration of tender.
FUJ00117331
FUJ00117331

We will then run a number of activities in parallel:

° agree functional specs by end June, then go on to finalise the
Release strategy, Service Definitions and Acceptance criteria
- and tie up any other loose ends (eg. exact counter equipment
spec.) - within 90 days of award;

° prepare for limited go live in September (Beta site);

° ramp up the detailed integration and test of all end-to-end
components (function and stress tests) prior to User
Acceptance Tests in Ql;

° complete the setting up of Pathway as a business;

° complete financing arrangements (see below).

The target start date for commencement of roll out remains July
1997, completing December 1998 for counters and July 1999 for
cards.

The end date for the contract has been extended from July 2004 to
February 2005 - a factor which has been taken into account in the
repricing.

Customer negotiations

The majority of the changes we made in the Variant bid were
accepted by the customer following protracted further negotiation.
Substantive fault remains, but given all the other changes, is now
confined to serious and medium severity faults regarding stated
requirements not satisfactorily met. Requirements continue to have
precedence over Service Definition unless amended by change
control, but this is something we should be able to manage.

Notably, the customer has accepted our proposed timetable with
respect to agreement of functional specs by end June, release
strategy and UAT starting January 1997. We understand that it has
been stated as the re-ITT timetable requirement for all three
potential service providers. This is a major coup and helps us
greatly.

Against a backcloth of requirements creep and consequent increase
in price as compared with the Indicative Costings provided as part
of the June Proposal, we put forward a shopping list of savings for
the procurement team to take back to sponsors. These totalled some
£30m per annum in potential savings to them (but with no adverse
effect on our Business Case). Of these, the Re-ITT confirmed take-
up of roughly two thirds.

Taken together, a very satisfactory outcome compared with where we
were before Christmas, enabling us to re-tender on a compliant
basis.
FUJ00117331
FUJ00117331

Punding

The restructuring of Pathway has caused us to have to revisit the
financing strategy.

Credit Suisse have withdrawn. ‘Toronto Dominion remain a possible.

We are now looking to lease finance (partly for ICL tax reasons,
partly for balance sheet reasons) rather than senior debt. That
calls for at least one major UK bank with tax capacity to be
included in the syndicate. In addition, we want a major Japanese
bank who will take comfort from ICL’s Fujitsu connection. A
European or North American major would round out the profile and
ease the task of selling down to smaller banks across a wide
spectrum.

The target composition for the lead players is probably three banks
drawn from:

- one UK clearer - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland?

- one Japanese bank - Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi?

- one European bank - Societe Generale, BHB?

- one North American bank - Citibank, Toronto Dominion?

ICL Treasury are now leading the search activity based on ICL’s
relationship bank community, with Hambros still leading on the
wider community.

The financing will be full recourse to ICL during the design and
build phase (up to steady state), with a switch to limited recourse
from that point. This will be. defined by reference to a detailed
set of performance and financial criteria to be agreed up-front,
probably requiring an amount of preliminary due diligence on our
solution by independent consultants acting on behalf of the banks
(the final due diligence being to certify satisfactory conversion
to steady state).

Pricing and Business Case

The Scorecard methodology, including discounts for volume by year
and differing guarantee levels by service element, has been
carefully modelled and integrated into the Business Case model.
[The combined set, including sub-contract data and performance
penalty model, now fills four diskettes....].

It has therefore been possible to reliably and quickly assess the
effects of possible changes to payment profiles, levels of
requirement or extension of contract. More importantly, we could
select the best combination of price parameters to ensure that the
impact of each change on the Business Case at the individual
service element level was either neutral or marginally positive.
FUJ00117331
FUJ001173314

At the same time, the latest cost predictions from Terry Austin’s
group have been factored in. These had a small negative effect on
the Business Case (costs exceeded what I had previously assumed,
but not by much). The negative impact has been exactly offset by
the marginal improvements from the repricing.

Risk

On both risk registers, one customer, one our own, the update is
all positive.

The end position prior to closing for ITT on the customer register
was that we had almost a completely clean bill of health. Only
four B2 risks remain (all associated with fraud and reflecting our
resistance to accepting uncontrollable fraud risk transfer), and
three B3s. This was a superb achievement on the part of the full
team, and means that we went into the evaluation with minimal
handicapping (better than the competition, we believe).

On our own risk register, the position has also improved
significantly, albeit we have plenty of demanding work ahead of us.
In particular, excellent progress has been made on the technical/
programmes front with Escher, Oracle and the European Development
and Support Centre (EDSC): we are now in good shape on the major
components.

The only components worth noting for risk currently are:

- counter terminal configuration still fluid
- ISDN card not yet to spec
- MIS approach/spec not yet agreed.

Actions are in hand on all. three.

Manpower and Costs

Plans are now being reviewed at the detailed programme plan level
on at least a monthly basis, in terms both of output to timescales
and cost inputs.

Cost inputs are expressed in work breakdown structure terms
(operating spend and capital spend). They drive the manpower plans
and the cost budgets/forecasts by department. These are then
reflected into the Business Model.

A separate report describes the spend contemplated this year and

during the first six months of 1997 - showing that a rapid and
significant ramp up of spend has already started.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON PATHWAY TENDER

Since our two Tenders were. submitted on 21 March the
progress has been as ‘follows:

1.

The compliant response has been disregarded and all
activity now centres on the main proposal which is a
variant bid.

We have received approximately 20 requests for
clarification. None of these have been too difficult
and all have been replied to within 24 hours.

We have, however, been asked to submit a price
amendment proposal. This applies to all three Service
Providers and is due to the fact that prices have
increased substantially since the proposals were
submitted in June 1995 together with indicative prices.

We ‘submitted on Thursday 4 April a response to this
request which also bridged in detail why our variant
prices were higher than the indicative prices.
Virtually all of this is due to increased requirements
coming from the two sponsors.

Perhaps more importantly we also suggested ways in
which the programme could reduce its annual costs.
The key components are:

i. modification to payment terms for paying in
advance.

ii.. an extension to the contract life of steady state
service.

iii. the programme purchasing the benefit cards when
issued.

‘iv. a re-definition of SLA penalties and their costs.

v. modification of maintenance cover to reflect
better value.

vi. transfer of fraud risk back to the programme
rather than with the Service Provider.

9 April 1996

FUJ00117331
FUJ00117331

vii. looking for ways to reduce the total counter
population by approximately 8%.

viii.transfer of the paper, storage and retrieval
system back to the programme.

ix. a better way of handling POCL documentation.
x. a more efficient way of issuing pick-up notices.

All these possible areas will save the programme money
but none will bring about a discount on the core
services provided by Pathway.

6. Should the full package of changes above be accepted
then there is a slight improvement in Pathway's
internal rate of return.

7. Pathway has been asked to attend a further core
negotiating team (CNT) on Friday 12 April for a final
discussion on a price amendment proposal.

8. The overall reaction to the Pathway Tender and indeed
to the price amendments has been prompt and good. The
next key event is the Sponsors meeting on 16 April when
the intention is for a final recommendation to be made.

If anything changes significantly this week, I will issue a
further update.

Regards.

x. a more efficient way of issuing pick-up notices.

All these possible areas will save the programme money
but none will bring about a discount on the core
services provided by Pathway.

6. Should the full package of changes above be accepted
then there is’ a slight improvement in Pathway’s
internal rate of return.

7. Pathway) has been asked to attend a further core
negotiating team (CNT) on Friday 12 April for a final
discussion on a price amendment proposal.

to the price amendments has been prompt and good. The
next key event is the Sponsors meeting on 16 April when
the intention is for a final recommendation to be made.

If anything changes significantly this week, I will issue a
further update.

Regards.
