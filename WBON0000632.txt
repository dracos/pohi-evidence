AC_152437578_3 2

WBD_000502.000002
WBONO0000632

anomalies in branch accounts (para 2 of Evidence Request)

Evidence as to the proportion of calls to the help desk about branch account anomalies that were resolved to the detriment of the
SPMR (para 12(vi) of Alternative Formulation and para 3(d) of Evidence Request)

Evidence in KELs, PEAKs or other reports of anomalies in branch accounts (para 12(iii) of Alternative Formulation)

Evidence as to the quality of the process by which KELs were analysed and resolved and the extent of any reoccurrence of
supposedly resolved issues (para 12(iv) of Alternative Formulation)

Evidence as to the number of anomalies in branch accounts which were identified as being caused by errors in-branch and
therefore were attributed to the branch (para 12(v) of Alternative Formulation)

POL/Fujitsu's awareness of the 9 KELs/bugs (out of the 62 KELs referred to by Coyne) which Dr Worden believes could have the
potential to cause errors in branch accounts (comment AdGR¢ in “Analysis of KELs in the Coyne Report" document (Analysis of
KELs))

Evidence as to the extent to which SPMRs report all significant anomalies that affect their accounts (comment SH9 in Analysis of
KELs)

Evidence as to the extent that "testing good practice (TGP)" (eg regression testing, user testing, testing edge cases) was used as a
countermeasure in relation to Horizon (comment AdGR14 in Analysis of KELs)

Evidence as to the extent that "bug finding and correction (BFC)" was used as a countermeasure in relation to Horizon (comment
AdGR15 in Analysis of KELs)

Evidence as to the extent that "large-scale IT architecture (ARC)" (eg using a distributed network of sub-systems) was used as a
countermeasure in relation to Horizon (comment AdGR17 in Analysis of KELs)

Evidence as to SPMRs' behaviour in reporting anomalies. Specifically, are most anomalies reported when they exceed a certain
financial value (eg £300)? Do some SPMRs still report even small anomalies? (para 2 of "Financial Impact of All Bugs" document
(Financial Impact), paras 32-33 of Summary of Opinions and referred to in Opinions Response)

Evidence as to the likelihood of a bug affecting branch accounts not resulting in a KEL and a PEAK (para 2(ii) of Financial Impact)
and to support the conclusion that any bug with a potential impact on branch accounts is highly likely to be reported and
investigated (and with high priority) on most occasions when it occurs (paras 32, 33 and 35 of Summary of Opinions and referred to
in Opinions Response)

Further evidence to demonstrate that, where an anomaly is immediately visible to a SPMR as part of daily trading, the issue is
reported on at least some occasions even if the financial impact is small (para 13(i) of Financial Impact)

Further evidence to demonstrate that, where an anomaly is only visible to a SPMR upon monthly balancing/rollover, the threshold
financial impact value for reporting is likely to be higher, but that anomalies over £100 are likely to be reported on at least some
occasions (para 13(ii) of Financial Impact)

Evidence to support the conclusion that the process for creating and maintaining KELs is fairly efficient and effective (paras 17-18
of Financial Impact and para 35/comments AdGR34 and AdGR36 of Summary of Opinions) including evidence as to the quality of
the drafting of KELs, their comprehensiveness and evidence that fixes identified were actually implemented (comment AdGR36 of
Summary of Opinions)

Evidence about the creation of KELs — does the potential financial impact of an issue make fixing it a higher priority? (para 18 of
Financial Impact and comment R44 in Response to Financial Impact)

WBONO0000632
WBON0000632

Evidence as to the financial impact of the three known bugs (para 28 of Financial Impact) [Note - covered by Torstein 2 and

Opinions

Evidence to demonstrate that, in relation to the three known bugs, all affected branches were identified, all false figures were
identified and all affected SPMRs were compensated (paras 29-31/comment AdGR20 of Summary of Opinions) [Note - covered
by Torstein 2 and Alison Bolsover]

Evidence to demonstrate that there have never been any undetected bugs affecting branch accounts (comment AdGR43 of
Summary of Opinions) [Note: I don't think this is possible]

Evidence to demonstrate that all of the bugs identified was recorded as KELs and their full financial impact was recorded in the
KELs (comment AdGR43 of Summary of Opinions) [Note: I don't think this is possible - KELs subjective/only as good as their
author makes them]

Evidence as to whether whenever a mismatch is discovered, the contract between POL and the client organisation defines how it is
to be investigated and handled (para 62(iv) of Summary of Opinions) [Note: I thought we had dropped this?]

Evidence to oppose Coyne's conclusion (if it is opposed) that the "human element" of the reconciliation process adds another level
of unreliability to Horizon (para 65/comment AdGR58 of Summary of Opinions) [Note: it does doesn’t it?]

Evidence as to the proportion of TCs that are contested by SPMRs, for what reasons, how they are investigated and what
proportion of contested TCs are resolved in favour of the SPMR (para 66/comment SH59 of Summary of Opinions and referred to
in Opinions Response) [Note: covered by Paul Smith]

43/comments AdGR42 and AdGR44 of Summary of Opinions and referred to in Opinions Response)

Evidence as to how the claimants’ branches compare to other branches in terms of transaction volumes (the impression is that
claimant tend to have smaller than average branches) (para 1(b) of Evidence Request)

In general, evidence that can be used to disprove the possible contention that claimants’ branches were more likely to be affected
by Horizon bugs than other branches (ie are there any special characteristics of the claimants’ branches? Are they generally
smaller?) (para 4 of Alternative Formulation and referred to in Response to Alternative Formulation)

Evidence as to the number of SPMRs who have been members of the JFSA (para 3(a) of Evidence Request) [Note: should this
