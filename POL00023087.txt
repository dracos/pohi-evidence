All

Attached is my summary of statements that might demonstrate ‘bias’ and I have highlighted the most obvious. Reading
through these again, it is clear that they need to be understood in the context of a decision that was not supposed to be
about the factual evidence. Absent that lens, many of them are strong statements, however one would normally expect
a trial judge to form a view as to the reliability of witnesses. Jane, I agree with that statement.

So the bias argument hangs on the argument that the evidence should have been inadmissible or at the very least not
relied upon by the Judge when making findings, but that seems not to have occurred here ~ despite the Judge's strained
assertions in the judgement that he didn’t take into account the findings of fact that he then goes onto make . If for any
reason the contention that this evidence was inadmissible is not upheld, then these findings of fact and credibility must
surely stand? Yes ~ but then there is the second aspect of this matter which is the “legal” bit of the appeal and how far

POL-0019566
POL00023087
POL00023087

(if at all) those findings of fact (even if ‘validly made‘) can be relevant to the question of what the contract meant and did
at the time it was formed.

To that extent the views on appeal and the strength of the argument about procedural unfairness is key. We would not
be considering the recusal application if procedural unfairness were not seen as a ground of appeal. Given the
comments it may have been considered anyway ~ but here I do agree the two issues are tied together. To what extent
would our appeal chances be lessened if we did not rely on procedural unfairness? Is this something we are ready to
discuss yet? This is a detailed piece of work and it is this that LNQC has said 40 to 50 hrs' work on. That is paused for
now. My view is that absent a recusal application the procedural unfairness element of an appeal is weakened
considerably but the “law" bit of an appeal lives on. The black letter stuff. In answer to your question, we can discuss at
a high level, but the forensic detail and real informed view on prospects is some way off. As part of that we need to
trigger LNQC when POL is ready.

ideally, I would like to know today whether Grabiner is supportive of the recusal application, and if so, to what extent
OEC have asked LGQC for this today. I don’t know if that means we will get it, but the Q has been posed of LGQC. Are
we able to get any insight on that? Provided that he is, then we should stand up Neuberger for the Board call, and I will
also be able to feedback the outcome of the meeting with Grabiner. (which could be any time from 1.30 onwards that
suits him).

Thanks

On timings for Monday I have heard from Rob at OEC.

Lord Grabiner can make 1pm or after on Monday for a pre call. But Rob says:

He has another appointment at 5.25 that he cannot cancel. He can speak earlier or from 6.30.
Thanks

Jane, thoughts on which QC in light of the above ? Thoughts on timing of meeting ?

As discussed, I have made a number of comments and re-sequenced the draft paper ~ attached.

One key piece of work is to pull out some of the more egregious comments that the Judge has made —
most of the Board will not have read the judgment, so it’s worth putting these in an Appendix. {ll pull
out my ‘favourites’ tonight and send them through.

Very happy to discuss the changes/comments.
Kind regards,

As you have an important call shortly I attach the note as it currently stands.

The draft note picks up some of your bullet points, but not all. It will need to be added te over the course
of today (ail comments gratefully received).

1am tied up for an hour now but will be around this afternoon, just after 12.30.
I hope sending on the draft now is a helpful step.

Many thanks — I have a call at 12.15 with our Chairman, Al Cameron and our Minister Kelly Tolhurst (and
others), although I don’t believe recusal will be part of the discussion. I have been advised by the UKGI
GC that ‘government’ will not express an opinion on recusal as they will not want the ‘executive’ to be
seen to be criticising the ‘judiciary’.

This will put more pressure on our Board, and the Chairman is acutely conscious that such an application
will not sit well with the perception that PO is arrogant, whereas we are trying to edge towards
‘contrition’.

That effect of that is that we need to be very clear what the risks will be of not proceeding with the
application, which I imagine include:

e Impact on evidence given by PO witnesses (especially Angela) in the current Horizon trial, and
the impact of that on our case;

* — Extent to which this detracts from the ‘procedural unfairness’ grounds for appeal;

e impact of delay - if we didn’t bring the application ‘now’ and then decided that the Horizon
judgement also demonstrated ‘prejudice’ ~ would we be able to use that also in an appeal on
the Common Issues judgement (which almost certainly will be after the HIT judgment};

® Would result in (I assume?) only appeal grounds as being incorrect interpretation (and
application) of the law. Although LNQC opinion seemed to suggest we had reasonably good
grounds?

VI look forward to receiving the draft, and will let you know if I need a call later today to discuss.

A short e mail as to timings. We will be sending you a draft "Board friendly” (I hope...) recusal note on or
before lunchtime today.

I hope that works for you.

Tom, Andy

As discussed, set out below is the email I sent this morning to the Chairman and Tom Cooper setting out
the proposal for the recusal application. We are setting up a board call for 5pm Monday, and I will need

to issue a ‘plain English’ paper to the Board over the weekend to get them familiarised with the issue. In
particular that will need to address:

e Why we are considering a recusal application

° What the application (if successful) will achieve

* — Risks of not proceeding

* Prospects of success: what advice have we received, who from (LNQC but given speed with
which it was produced - is it fully considered?; Will LGQC have read in sufficiently by then to also
be able to offer an opinion? ‘why we should believe them?’)}

e@ risks

* Process & timing

In addition, the following Monday (25) we have a scheduled Board meeting and I will need to be able
to brief in more detail on an appeal, recognising that it will still be a work in progress. However as we

POL-0019566
POL00023087
POL00023087

don’t have another scheduled Board until end May, it is likely that we will need the Board to endorse
the appeal strategy at end March, with a further approval meeting/call once the appeal grounds are
finalised and we can assess ‘risk’.

As mentioned I think that as part of the initial Appeal discussion, the board will want to understand the
scale of the financial risk of:

{a)_ not appealing {and therefore how many existing & historic contracts will be affected by the
judgement?)

(b} appealing and losing (same as above?)

(c) appealing and winning — restores contracts to pre-judgement position

Recognising in each case that the consequences apply not just to the claimant group but to all
postmasters on those contracts types, and potentially, all those on other contract types but who have
substantially the same provisions.

{ will task one of my team to start looking at the modelling to support the legal analysis.

Subject: URGENT: Litigation Options - CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE.
Importance: High

Dear Tim and Tom

As flagged on the board call on Tuesday, we have sought further advice on appeals and as to whether
we have grounds to request the judge to recuse himself on the grounds of bias.

Advice
We sought advice from Lord Neuberger who stepped down last year as the President of the Supreme
Court (and as such was the highest judge in the U.K.). We sought his views as to whether the draft
judgement demonstrated the following grounds for appeal:
- Whether the Judge has correctly interpreted and applied the law as to construction of a
document or application of a principle of law;

POL-0019566
POL00023087
POL00023087

- Whether there are grounds to argue that findings have been made as a result of serious
procedural irregularity (which goes to the admission of, and reliance on, among other issues,
inadmissible evidence), and

- (most urgently) Whether Mr Justice Fraser demonstrated grounds on which we could apply for
him to recuse himself.

The test for recusal is ‘whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts,
would conclude there is a real possibility that the Judge] was biased’.

Attached is Lord Neuberger’s preliminary advice (Please note, in paragraph 11 he refers to ‘the Note’ —
this is a note put together by David Cavendar QC summarising the key extracts of the judgement and
trial transcript). As you will see, in paragraph 5 Lord Neuberger states that although he has only looked
at the issues very cursorily, “at least some of them raise quite significant points on which the PO has a
reasonable case, and at least on the face of it, some points on which the PO has a pretty strong case.”

Further however, he suggests (para 19) that if we wish to rely on the ground of procedural unfairness at
an appeal, then ‘PO has little option but to seek to get the Judge to recuse himself at this stage” and in
para 20 that if we fail to act promptly during the Horizon trial we “risk being held to have waived [our]
rights, or at least weakened our position on the recusal issue.”

TiminI

I have set out below the proposed process and timetable. This suggests that we should make the
decision urgently - preferably not later than Monday with a view to making the application early to mid
next week.

Risks
The risks with seeking for the Judge to recuse himself are:

a) The application is successful and the Horizon Trial is adjourned (and probably has to be re-heard by
another judge); we proceed with an appeal on the Common Issues Trial (timing to be determined)
and a new judge is put in place for remaining aspects of trials.

b) The application is unsuccessful (at first request and in the Court of Appeal) then it is likely that the
judge is further antagonised, however he will be aware that the Common Issues appeal is
progressing which includes the "procedural unfairness" assertion. Possible impact in that scenario is
the Judge is more cautious as to behaviours to (possibly) POL's benefit.

c) The theoretical downside to a recusal application is that it fails and that Fraser remains the judge at
Trial 3 which will require multiple findings of fact which are more tricky to appeal.

We should also not proceed with this course of action unless we are prepared to appeal a decision by
him not to recuse himself.

In the meantime I propose today to brief a further senior silk today (probably Lord Grabiner) to act on
the recusal application. Should the Board decide not to proceed, then we can withdraw the instructions;
however as he will need reading in time, this parallel track will minimise delay.

Next steps

Tim, this is clearly a board decision and we would need to give the Board time to consider the options,
however we would like to convene a call over the weekend or on Monday at the latest to discuss this
proposal. Lord Neuberger is available for a conference call to discuss his views, although he is in
Argentina, so there are some time considerations. Once he has read in, and assuming he agrees with
Lord Neuberger, I expect Lord Grabiner would also be available for a call.

Tom, you have previously counselled us that any appeal should be discussed with the shareholder -
please advise how we progress this as amateur of urgency?

Would we be able to talk today to consider the way forward?

POL engage with the QC who is likely to be instructed to make recusal application ASAP (if one is
made) to get QC "warmed up" to application, arguments to be deployed and (potentially) to speak to
POL Board if needed, as the person who would in fact be the mouthpiece of POL. Timing: Friday for
choice of QC and delivery of papers.

Assuming a QC is to be "warmed up" David Cavender QC to brief on background as fully as possible.
Timing: Friday.

POL to decide if it is to make a recusal application. Timing: By (say) Monday.

POL Board may wish to speak to Lord Neuberger as part of their decision making process. The
Clerks at OEC have confirmed that is possible and have contact numbers for Lord Neuberger as
needed. Please NOTE Lord Neuberger is in South America (Argentina).

As soon as decision to make application has been made (if that transpires) Freeths & Judge to be put
on notice. Suggested "appropriate" notice period is one day (or more if decision made earlier than
early next week). Freeths put on notice by letter from WBD (or possibly Counsel to Counsel) and the
Judge by a note between the Clerks ? Timing: early next week once decision to proceed made.

Gideon Cohen (at One ESSex Court and already part of the Counsel team) to be instructed to be
Junior to chosen QC. Timing: Friday, if "warm up" route followed.

QC & Gideon prepare Application Notice and Skeleton for recusal application. This work could start
now if we follow the "warm up" route.

Application is made first half of next week at 10am during the Horizon trial. Thereafter there are
variables:

a. Judge may agree. Unlikely but possible. HIT trial is adjourned there and then and POL
appeals the CIT findings and (if successful) we re-list CIT & HIT.

b. Judge may pass matter to another judge to hear. Unlikely.

c. Judge refuses (likely) and POL takes that refusal to Court of Appeal asap. That could be
same day (possible but unlikely) or at that same week at some point if CofA recognise
urgency.

d. CofA may agree with recusal application. If so, POL appeals the CIT findings and (if
successful) we re-list HIT.

POL-0019566
POL00023087
POL00023087

e. CofA may refuse recusal application in which case HIT rolls on.

Please note in any scenario where HIT is adjourned then there will be possible increased costs
consequences for Claimants that POL could bear if it is ultimately unsuccessful.
