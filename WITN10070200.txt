POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF DAVE WARD

I, MR DAVE WARD, will say as follows...

CORRECTION OF EVIDENCE IN FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT

1. I am the General Secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU). I
provided a First Witness Statement to the Inquiry on 21% June 2024 in response
to matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 17" April 2024 (the “Request’).
I am submitting the following supplementary statement to correct an error

contained in my First Statement, as follows.

2. In my First Witness Statement of 21% June, I said that the CWU Postmasters

Branch was established in 2014. This was my understanding at the time I

WITN10070200

drafted my witness statement, which was based on an internal CWU document
provided to me in January 2024 setting out a timeline of events during the
Horizon scandal alongside details of CWU action. The timeline document was
compiled by the CWU’s Research Department with input from the CWU
Postmasters Branch. It has since been brought to my attention, as a result of
evidence provided during Tony Kearns’ evidence session on 20" June 2024,
that the CWU Postmasters Branch was in fact established in 2011, not in 2014.
The error in the CWU’s timeline document appears to have been a
misunderstanding or a typographical error that was not spotted in proofreading

the document.

3. Therefore, all references to the date of the establishment of the CWU
Postmasters Branch and initial representation of postmasters, which are
contained in paragraphs 6, 18, 35, 36, 46, 55, 67, 83 and 91 of my First Witness

Statement, should be read as 2011 rather than 2014.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
