Dear Sir / Madam,

Disclosure for CPS

You may be aware that there has been recent publicity regarding the Horizon
computer system used by Post Office Ltd for accounting purposes. This system was
referred to during a BBC Panorama programme. There has also been televised
coverage of a number of parliamentary discussions. It is also in the public domain that
a number of convicted defendants have asked the CCRC to look into their cases. In
these circumstances we would ask that any Post Office related cases are referred to
Mark Raymond in order that she may review them and determine whether Post Office
may have any relevant information which may assist the CPS.

Yours sincerely,

Wark Raymend

Mark Raymond
