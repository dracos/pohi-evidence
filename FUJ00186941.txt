Mike

Just you let you know I had a conversation with Rob Haughton yesterday about Oracle DBA Super users and the fact
they had access to databases. I am pleased to say we gave the same answer that it would be impossible to support the
databases without this access and the controls around the limited users who have these logins and the fact of the
other controls on access rights to the storage, encryption, and user logins means this is not a security issue in his
opinion.

Pete
