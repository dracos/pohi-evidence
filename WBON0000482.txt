isputed sum settled centrally [BD-

Thanks, Amy.

I can’t print out the picture of the table you have inserted into your email — for some reason my computer cuts off the
right hand side of the table (see below). Never mind.

A few questions:

r

What is the table you have pictured and inserted in your email? Is that a picture of a postmaster’s account?
What is the table you have attached to your email — is that a picture of a postmaster’s account (and why does it
refer to a customer rather than a postmaster, by the way)?
If the answers to I and 2 are both yes, why are the two tables different?
In the table inserted in your email:

a. could you give us the full names of the column currently marked “S...” and “DD”; and

b. could you tell us what an entry would look like if it wasn’t blocked — would it have no red blobs or marks

in the “S...” and “DD” columns, and would the blocked column be blank?

In your attached explanation of abbreviations, does TX signify a TC which is being disputed and is accordingly
being settled centrally and blocked pending resolution of the dispute? If not, which abbreviation signifies that
situation?

Dear Tony, Owain

Briefing note on flags which are applied to SPMR accounts where disputed sum settled centrally
Where an item has been settled centrally and disputed, the agent accounting team apply a dunning block to the open
item on the account. This prevents any further requests for payment being sent to the agent.

The account below shows (in the column titled "block")
« the item marked with an R is already set up to be deducted from remuneration and therefore blocked for any

further request for payment; and
« the items marked with an M relates to a miskey error where the agent is waiting for a TC, so this will remain
blocked until the enquiry is completed.

The effect of placing these blocks on the system is to prevent a dunning letter (chaser letter) being produced and/or
preventing the item from falling on a processors worklist for further action.

Please also find attached an example of a customer account and an explanation of the abbreviations which are used
in this.

If you would like any further information on this please let me know.
Kind regards
