RAPID PROGRESS- must be evident for any ##LAD until it is Proposed or Targeted

IMPACT TAB- critical for any ##LAD and must be up to date with all fields worded as well as we
can

RELEASE DATES — show when the defect will be fixed and where it is in the process

HDR is the highest level of importance for ##LAD — we report them to POL. POL report them to
postmasters

We must ensure that we report on DATA derived from the SYSTEM

We should be completing these updates when we are INVESTIGATING or SOLUTIONING
e@ But we have a small amount of catch-up to do
