Andy

Just to confirm the discussion this morning, we will aim for a briefing (preferably) on Thursday next week to
address:

e Appeal strategy with David Cavendar QC
o Attendees will be DCQC, yourself/other WBD, Al Cameron, Tom Cooper (tbd), Mark, Jane , Norton
Rose
o Will cover appeal strategy: what we should concede on, what we recommend appealing on (and
inter-connectedness), timetable. To be followed up by written advice/summary from/co-signed by
Lord Neuberger (if available)
e — Approach to settlement
o Same attendees (but not DCQC)
© Will cover: matrix factors, and how that informs quantum, strategic options — timing, mediation v
settlement, dealing with the Claimant group. Concern will be to ensure that those with genuine
grievances are addressed; but approach must be scalable to deal with subsequent claims outside
the claimant group.

Di is liaising on internal availability - would you please work with her to get an agreed time? I would have thought
we need 2-3 hours to address both topics.

Many thanks,
Jane
