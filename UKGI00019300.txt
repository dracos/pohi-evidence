Horizon system and mediation scheme

There has been over
two years of
independent

scrutiny of the
Horizon IT system
and no evidence of
systemic flaws has
been found.

Post Office agreed a
mediation scheme
for subpostmasters
who believed that
Horizon had caused
them losses.

The scheme
continues to
consider cases. It is
independent of
Government, and
details of individual
cases are
confidential.

Following complaints from a small number of (mostly former) subpostmasters about the Horizon IT
system, the Post Office commissioned an independent firm, Second Sight to examine the system
for systemic flaws that could cause accounting discrepancies.

Second Sight’s interim report, published in July 2013, and final report, published in April 2015, both
make clear that there is no evidence of system-wide problems with Horizon.

On the basis of the interim report, which raised questions about the training and support offered to
some subpostmasters, Post Office implemented a series of measures to improve its processes and
also created a mediation scheme to consider individual subpostmasters’ cases.

A Working Group was created to set up the mediation scheme, consisting of POL, Second Sight
and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) and with an independent Chair: Sir Anthony
Hooper, a former Court of Appeal judge.

Each case in the scheme was subject to a re-investigation by Post Office and then independent
review by Second Sight, following which the Working Group would recommend whether a case
should proceed to mediation. Mediation is a voluntary process requiring the consent of both parties
and is overseen by an independent mediator. It is nota compensation process, although an
outcome of mediation may be that some compensation could be awarded.

Individuals who had criminal convictions (usually for theft or false accounting) were eligible for the
scheme, but on the basis that mediation cannot overturn a Court judgment. POL consider whether
to mediate these applications on a case-by-case basis. Any individual who feels their conviction is
unsafe can pursue legal avenues, regardless of whether they enter into mediation.

POL hopes to complete mediation on all remaining cases by the end of 2015.
