STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED
QUTLINE HANDLING STRATEGY FOR SPARROW
Aim
To get on the front foot and mitigate against reputational challenge following a decision to offer
mediation in all non-criminal caseselese/ehange-the Scheme.
Objectives
Explain position, limit media coverage, manage stakeholders to minimise adverse comment or
further campaigning, minimise parliamentary risk, limit on-going reputational exposure.
Advice Tactics I advisors (BrusnwickBrunswick}:
+  Asimple press statement supported by publication of Post Office report on the
processas-soon-as-we are ready is-all that is required.
+ Likelihood and timing of a Select Committee report isnot a key consideration. No
further hearings will be held and given time restrictions prior to purdah, whether a
report will be produced is in the balance
+ However, tThe greater risk is Second Sight's Part Two Report. Leaking or
publication would put us on the back foot, and make any announcement to change
the Scheme appear reactive.
* The sooner we announce, the more likely we are to “own” the story

Key messages (Srunswick are-drafting statement) Formatted: Normal, indent: Left: 0.63 cm )
+ Post Office is now offering mediation for all cases, except a small number that
involve criminal convictions.
+ This will speed up the process and provide further reassurance for the majority
applicants that their case will be mediated.
+ We have now investigated every case. The-small minority (it is just under half) of
cases in the Scheme that involve criminal convictions have all been subject to the
same rigorous investigation and review process as other cases. No evidence has
been found or put forward that suggests any convictions are unsafe.
+ The Scheme cannot overturn criminal convictions — only the courts can do that.
+_We are making this change so that we can focus on fulfilling our commitments to
applicants. That is where our focus must lie. ___~— [ Formatted: Font: Bold, (intl) Trebuchet MS }

+ Each applicant will continue to have exactly what we promised ~ thorough
reinvestigation and review by independent forensic accountants
