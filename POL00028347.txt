Subject Incident Rectification Plans

John

From yesterday’s meeting I understand that we will receive today from you final rectification
plans for the following acceptance incidents:

376, 378, 211, 218, 372, 391, 390, 395, 298, 314, and 408.

Please ensure that these plans, to the maximum extent possible, have been discussed with the

_ POCL ATM. The plans should include identifiable actions with scheduled dates and expected
outcomes. It will then be possible for POCL to advise you of our approach to closure and
whether the plans are acceptable.

For completeness, I note that 342, 361, and 371 have agreed rectification plans which are in the
process of implementation and observation to determine success.

Finally, as noted yesterday, we will shortly advise you of our position on 369.

John
