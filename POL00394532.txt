Suki,

It is the only fault raised by Fujitsu on the training vsn, I have no reason to think they would hide any more. You are correct the trg vsn does not do any
On-line trx's so none will not be covered. We started to drift between the live vsn and the trg vsn at the introduction of banking, it drifted further apart at S50 and
now even further at S60. We do not cover testing the trg vsn within our testing.

My understanding of the KEL process is that there is a list maintained of faults by Network support and Fujitsu and others that are identified during live running of
the systems some of which will have been added at the start of a new release going live as they were agreed not to be fixed during the testing and are deferred to
a future release. Items on the ongoing KEL will be fixed either :-

eASAP

eWhen that area of the code is next opened up
At the next release

At a later release

Never fixed

Some of the items found during S60 testing were stated as being in the S50 live code baseline but had not been found by the users.

So in summary a new KEL should now be created by Network support & Fujitsu which includes all known errors in the S50 baseline plus all the incidents deferred
from S60 testing.

Hope this helps
Regards

Peter

Peter,

Ray had a meeting with Ann Cruttenden yesterday to talk through the deferred list. She would like to know if the defect below is the only discrepancy introduced by $60 for the

training mode. I understand that in the training mode we do not do online transactions so clerks will not be able to do PAF or DVLA. Is this correct?

Also, can you confirm that the defects on the deferred list below were already on the KEL before S60 testing commenced. Or have they been put on the KEL
during the earlier cycles of testing?
