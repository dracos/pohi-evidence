Subject: Second Sight case review repo! rocess for response

Hi all

Having now received three case review reports from Second Sight, we have considered the process for replying to the
reports and going forward will manage the process in the following way:

© When Second Sight release the report, the WG secretariat issues it to parties

* I will send the report around this panel by email

* This panel has 24 hours to review the report and reply to all with comments

* Meanwhile, Bond Dickinson draft a reply

© The following day, we will hold a case conference call to discuss the draft and agree any changes
* BD will update the draft following that call

© Final sign off of the reply will be provided by Chris and Angela

« The reply is returned to SS

The process is summarised in this flow diagram (days here are working days)

Day One Day Two Day Three

ensure that deadlines are not missed, replies will be submitted even if they have not been signed off.

If anyone has any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

Many thanks and best wishes
