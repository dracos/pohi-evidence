Al

| have ready to send to the Board the following (all attached):
e Draft paper from me (‘Recusal 2019-3-18) which recommends the recusal application and retaining counsel on
the basis | proposed to you yesterday
e Lord Neuberger’s preliminary advice
e Advice from WBD (Post Office - Recusal Note), which has been reviewed by David Cavendar and which Lord
Grabiner has seen. Lord Grabiner has commented this afternoon (not to be repeated) :

“Treat this as my broad ‘yes that is ok’.

I’m still wading through the treacle of this mad judgment. | don’t understand what he thought he was doing or
what he thought he was supposed to be doing. The constant repetition of the mantra that he wasn’t deciding
anything outside of the common issues is hardly credible. I’ve yet to get to the many other matters but | can see
from Gideon’s note and from the various quotes that it just gets worse.”

| have discussed stakeholder and Comms issues with both Mark and Patrick. They both acknowledge that this will be
difficult to manage and will cause significant noise in more than one quarter, however they are both supportive of a
strategy that delivers the best legal outcome for Post Office.

’'m around to discuss, however | would like to get this pack to the Board (cc GE) tonight if possible.
Kind regards,
Jane
