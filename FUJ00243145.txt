FUJITSU Data Centre Operations Service: Service Description
FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Service Summary

141 The Data Centre Operations Service consists of two (2) component services:

a) the Data Centre Operations Service — this service is described in sections 2 and 3 of this
document;

b) the AP Client File Re-Send Service — this service component of the Data Centre
Operations Service is described in Annex A: PODG Client File Re-Send Service of this
document;

1.2 The Data Centre Operations Service is responsible for the provision of all Data Centre
operations, which includes, for example; all the agents, servers, and databases used to
manage and support the Branch Infrastructure and HNG-X Central Infrastructure used to
deliver the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities irrespective of technology platform or
geographical location.

1.3 The primary elements of the Data Centre Operations Service cover the day to day
management and operational control of the Data Centre environments located in the live Data
Centre and the Disaster Recovery (DR) Data Centre applying ITIL best practice within these

environments.

1.4 Operational staff will be appropriately trained to carry out the Data Centre Operations Service
process, which includes monitoring capability within each of the respective Data Centres to an
agreed level.

1.5 The Data Centre Operations Service provides on-site operational support in order to identify /

minimise interruptions to the HNG-X Services provided by Fujitsu Services.

1.6 The management of the Data Centres shall be aligned with the operational requirements
within the Branch Infrastructure.

1.7 Changes to the Data Centre environments shall be made without impacting the live service
and in accordance with Fujitsu Services’ corporate working practices and operational

standards and policies and follow approved procedures as set out within the Contract
Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Security Management Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0017).

1.9 The live Data Centre will run in an active / DR mode with the DR Data Centre being used for
testing. The live Data Centre (including the communications in and out of the building) is, in its
own right, fully resilient. There are single high capacity network links in each data centre.
Resilience is achieved by triangulation, for example, if the single network link into the live Data
Centre fails then traffic will use the single high capacity link into the DR Data Centre and
traverse the inter campus link. Also many network components are active / active across the
data centres. Business Continuity testing is completed during the week (Monday to Friday) for
a maximum of two (2) weeks per year, during which operational testing will not take place at
the DR Data Centre.

1.10 Whilst this Data Centre Operations Service shall not apply to operations and support of the
Post Office Cloud, the following elements of second line application support described in this
CCD shall continue to be provided to those elements of the HNG-X Application migrated to
Post Office Cloud:

a) Incident Management as documented in paragraph 2.1.1.2 below for the operations of
the HNG-X System hosted on the Post Office Cloud only. This shall not apply to incidents
relating to the functioning of the infrastructure used to deliver the Post Office Cloud.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

2.3.1. General Principles

2.3.1.1 The Data Centre Operations Service has prime responsibility for SLT's with and without
associated liquidated damages and performance measures as set out in sections 2.3.4 to
2.3.8 of this ‘Data Centre Operations Service, Service Description’.

2.3.1.2 SLT's detailed in sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description, which do not specify a measurement period are:

e — reported monthly via the SRB; and

*® measured over a Service Level Measurement Period equating to a Post Office financial
quarter; i.e.

a) January to March;

b) April to June;

c) July to September; or
d) October to December.

2.3.1.3 SLT's detailed in sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description, which specify the “SLT Calendar Year” as the measurement periods are:

a) reported monthly via the SRB; and

b) measured over a Service Level Measurement Period equating to a Rolling Year (with the
exception of Central Systems Availability which is measured over a rolling five (5) year
period), i.e. the current month and the previous eleven (11) months.

2.3.2 Service Level Relief

The “HNGX Capacity Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033) sets out the limits
(the Contracted Volume) which, if exceeded over a monthly period, will entitle Fujitsu Services
to adjust the measurement of performance in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service
SLT's, and Liquidated Damages Targets (LDT's) if applicable and affected by this excess.
Such adjustments shall be made on the following basis:

1. Fujitsu Services shall identify, for joint consideration with Post Office, any failure to
achieve the Data Centre Operations Service SLT's and / or LDT's within the month due to
the limits being exceeded so long as such failures are not caused by limitations in the
support that the hardware or software vendor is providing or unavailability of working
spares, in accordance with Clause 10.15. Post Office and Fujitsu Services (acting
reasonably) will agree the reasons for that SLT or LDT failure if it has been caused or
contributed to by Fujitsu Services:

a) if the SLT or LDT failure occurs as a result of a Default by Fujitsu Services, no
adjustment shall be made to the performance measurements for the affected SLT's or
LDT's in respect of that month;

b) if the SLT or LDT failure is agreed to be as a result of the limits being exceeded, the
performance measurements for the affected SLT's and LDT's in respect of that month
shall be reported as reasonably required by the Parties;

2. Following each Service Level Measurement Period, Post Office and Fujitsu Services will
assess whether, on average during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period, any
of the limits have been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) or more. In making that
assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall consider the cause of any daily peaks
in excess of the daily averages during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period and
disregard the measurements in respect of those days where the peaks have arisen as a
result of a Fujitsu Services Default. If, having made this assessment, Post Office and
Fujitsu Services agree that a limit has been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) and within
any three (3) consecutive months, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet to discuss,

on the Post Office Cloud, for which Post Office shall be responsible for failover testing, the
following sub-services shall be operational from the DR Data Centre within the specified table
below of the approval for invoking Data Centre disaster recovery:

b. Priority would be given to any services crucial at the time of DR e.g. DVLA if at the
beginning/end of the month. The PAF service, if the failure occurred at the Christmas
mailing peak period.

c. Due to the single BRSS Data Access Server (BDAS) in the live data centre, failure of
BDAS will involve a failover to the DR Data Centre in failure scenarios, which will incur
downtime. Such downtime is estimated as a 2-5 hour outage to the BDAS service whilst
a new instance is recovered from the boot disk clone (similar to the times as described in
Table 18, above.) Failure of BDAS alone would not initiate DR.

2.9.1.2 Testing

The DR Data Centre has two functions, namely for business continuity/DR purposes on the
one hand and for Release testing on the other. Data Centre business continuity and DR

DR tests will be done at an agreed time with POL out of normal business hours, i.e. evenings
and weekends and there may well be charges associated to complete these at these times.
All Data Centre failover tests will assess impacts of interactions with Post Office Cloud and
those elements of the HNG-X Systems hosted within it. Any tests needing to be repeated due
to failings in any of the Post Office Responsibilities in respect of Post Office Cloud will incur
charges for the repeat planning and testing, such activity to be provided under a CWO and
charged on a time and materials basis using the rates set out in paragraph 10.4(b)
(Development Resources) of Schedule D1 (Charges). Whenever such Data Centre business
continuity, DR testing and/or Data Centre fail-over tests take place, the DR Data Centre will
not be available for Release testing. No full Data Centre fail over tests shall be performed due
to the age of the Service Infrastructure.

2.9.2 Frequency

Fujitsu Services will carry out one (1) walkthrough per calendar year for the Data Centre,
subject to agreeing the actual dates for such walkthrough with Post Office, such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld. In accordance with the Working Document entitled: “HNG-X

The scheduled re-start will occur at 18:00. During the re-start the PODG service will be
unavailable for approximately 15 minutes.

Data files will be made available for transfer to a destination end-point as defined in the PODG
route definition which controls the processing of data files by that PODG route.

A data file transfer invoked from an external end-point may take place at any time that the
PODG service is available.

5.2.7 Resilience
The PODG service is configured on two pairs of servers (PODGe and PODGi).

Within a datacentre each server is deployed on a blade in a blade server. The blade server
provides resilience to a single blade failure. If a blade on which PODG is running fails then the
blade server will automatically restart the PODG instance on a different blade.

To provide resilience against major failures one pair of servers is located in each datacentre.
Only one pair of servers is running the live service at any one time.

The data storage used by the PODG service is mirrored between the two data centres. Data is
automatically synchronised between the mirror copies.

In the event of a site failover, the IP addresses advertised by PODGe to Post Office clients for
incoming connections are unchanged.

5.2.8 Business Continuity
The PODG service is deployed in the Fujitsu data centres.
The PODG service is configured with:

e — The primary PODG service in the IRE11 data centre and a standby PODG service in the
IRE19 data centre;

e The PODG data storage is synchronised between the IRE11 and IRE19 data centres;

e The Fujitsu Services data centre network infrastructure, including the internet network
services in both the IRE11 and IRE19 data centres.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI) with potential impact on business
continuity of the PODG service then the standard Fujitsu Services business continuity plan
(HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)) will be invoked.

FUJITSU Data Centre Operations Service: Service Description
FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

If there is a failure in the live (IRE11) datacentre, and Disaster Recovery is invoked, then the
PODG service will be operational from the standby datacentre (IRE19) within 5 hours of
approval for invoking datacentre disaster recovery being given by Post Office Limited (see
also section 2.9 Business Continuity).

5.2.9 Service Levels or Targets
There are no contractual service levels or targets for the PODG service.

Fujitsu Services Post Office Account shall use reasonable commercial endeavours to meet the
operational targets documented in the Operational Level Agreement between Fujitsu Services
Post Office Account and Post Office Limited for the Post Office Data Gateway
(SVM/SDM/OLA/1797)

5.2.10 Capacity

The capacity of the PODG service will be managed by the HNG-X Capacity Management
Service (see HNG-X Capacity Management and Business Volumes (PA/PER/033)).

For Awareness: The original requirements PODG-146/147/148 is REQ/CUS/CDE/1397 state
that the Total Files per day will be baselined after migration of EDG routes is complete and
then allow 25% for expansion (please refer to PA/PER/033).

To increase the capacity beyond the limits specified above, Post Office Limited shall submit a
Change Request to Fujitsu Services Post Office Account.

For any further details regarding the PODG Capacity please refer to PA/PER/033 for the
contractual Capacity position in regards to PODG.

The peak times for PODG are between 05:50 and 06:20 and 20:45 and 21:15 (processing of
APOP files). During these times the system is processing a larger number of concurrent
incoming files. It is therefore suggested that any large additional load is placed during the
quieter times using the route active times to control when this takes place (route start time and
route stop time). Smaller increments should be distributed during the day if possible.

By distributing route start/end times throughout the 24 hour period then we can aim to protect
the system from receiving too many concurrent files to process. There must be a balance
between these items to minimise Disk/CPU and network utilisation. E.g. if a large number of
files are to be processed then these should be relatively small files. Likewise if a large file is to
be transferred it should be done whilst the system is processing few other files

Whilst Fujitsu see no issue with the volumes presented, should we find through analysis that
the internet circuits are being consumed with PODG related traffic, Fujitsu reserve the right to
request Post Office Ltd raise a Change Request to amend/increase the bandwidth to ensure
that bandwidth for other internet accessible services (e.g. smart meter, POLSAP HR, Ingenico,
Bank of Ireland etc.) is not impacted.

5.2.11 Changes

Post Office shall raise changes to existing data transfer services, or introduce new data
transfer services, in accordance with the process defined in ‘PODG Client Connection
Procedure’ (SVM/SDM/PRO/1871). An OBC19 form must be completed and submitted by
Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services Post Office Account in order to request changes to existing
data transfer services, or introduce new data transfer services. Fulfilling the service request
submitted via the OBC019 form does not require on site attendance. The service is not
directed at specific branches — it is a data centre change with all activities carried out remotely.

The OBCO19 form must include precise details of the Post Office Ltd requirements and must
provide sufficient detail to allow Fujitsu Services Post Office Account to assess and respond
with a charge and delivery schedule. The different request options that can be requested are
broken down into categories which are detailed in the appendix to “PODG client Connection

6 Annex D: Collect and Return Web Service

6.1 Summary

Post Office Limited extended their ‘Local Collect’ services such that a facility exists whereby Web
Purchasers may select a local Post Office as the delivery address of their parcels. Once the parcel is
delivered to a Branch, the Web Purchaser may collect the parcel at their convenience using a suitable
method of identification.

This was done by;

 — Introducing two new platform instances in the IRE11 data centres that run in an active/active
cluster configuration,

e — Introducing two new platform instances in IRE19 for LST and two new platform instances for
SV&l

e Providing connectivity to the service through the existing Huthwaite managed link (provided
by Fujitsu)

e Re-use of the Reverse Proxy Service from Bluecoat® introduced by the Channel Integration
Service

e Re-use of the Branch Database

e Re-use of the PODG gateway to transfer data to transaction and standing data between the
solution components

« Please see the relevant Service Design (DES/SVS/HLD/2143).

Measurement Periods

e The performance of the Collect & Return Service during each calendar month shall be
measured against the OLT for availability, measured during the service hours.

e Where the Collect & Return Service is available but the Royal Mail web service is unable to
access the Collect & Return system due to problems arising from components that are not
part of the Collect & Return Service these periods of will not be measured against the KPI's
for availability or incident resolution. Examples of components that are not part of the Fujitsu
managed service but must be available for Royal Mail partners to access the Collect &

Return system include:

co The Royal Mail web service

co. The internet

co Postcode Anywhere.

e Where Fujitsu passes an incident for resolution to Royal Mail and Royal Mail does not
provide support arrangements that are aligned to the Collect & Return Service (in terms of
hours of cover) the period of waiting for Royal Mail to commence investigation and resolution
activities that falls within the Collect & Return Service hours will not be counted against the
KPI's for availability or incident resolution.

e KPI measurements are suspended in the event of a disaster being declared and the disaster
recovery process being invoked.

e Inthe event of a disaster KPI calculations will only be resumed once the Collect & Return
Service has been restored to normal operation.

« Where an emergency period of service outage has been agreed in advance with Post Office
and Royal Mail and takes place within the supported hours of operation, this period will not
count towards the availability KPI calculation.

e The KPI's identified only apply within the hours of 08.00hrs to 18.00hrs Monday to Friday
and 08:00hrs to 13:00hrs on Saturday's excluding Bank Holidays.

e Service availability is calculated using complete loss of service periods during the supported
hours of operation, ignoring any loss of service which has been pre-agreed with Post Office
and Royal Mail for application of an emergency changes and ignoring any period in which a
disaster has been declared and the service is not operating from the prime data centre.

e The calculation of resolution times for incidents is based on the supported hours of service.
For example a severity 3 incident reported at 15.00hrs on a Wednesday will be regarded as
fixed within target time if it is resolved before 15.00hrs on the following business day.
