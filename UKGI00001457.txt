At a recent meeting with Jo, in the context of having signed off the attached pdf reply to John Pugh
MP, she asked for a short note summarising the position with the Horizon issues referred to in the
reply. This is now attached.

We are also currently dealing with a FOI request from an investigative journalist relating to our
contacts with POL and meetings with/briefings for Minsters in the context of the integrity and
performance of Horizon. We expect, in the next 2-3 weeks, to be seeking a S36 exemption
(prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs) in respect of certain documents identified which we
would be putting to Jo for consideration as the relevant ‘qualified person' as regards their disclosure.
