Hi Paula,
You may want to raise this with Alice because of the circulation of Alan Bates original email
(James Arbuthnot, Jo Swinson etc), although you could do so in the wider context of the second

sight review.

We spoke to Martin's wife on Friday. Martin is still in a state of induced unconsciousness but is
more stable than he had been.

We agreed with Martin's wife Gina that we would ring her again today to see how Martin is - I'll
update once I have this.

The police have the note which we haven't seen or have any indication of the content.

Our priority is to support the family in this difficult time - we have put a temp subpostmaster in
the branch and continue to pay Martin.

JFSA have not gone to the press, we have reactive comms prepared should this become
necessary.

Regards,
Kevin

Kevin/Fay, what is the latest on this? Do I need to brief Alice - was there a ref to the
PO in a suicide note? And what happens next if so?

All,

I have just spoken to Glenn Chester who has this morning spoken to
Martin’s mother and sister. Martin is still unconscious — this is induced
by the hospital. He has a bleed on the brain and pelvis and some
broken bones. They concluded that he is relatively stable at this time.

Martin’s mother is not at the hospital today as she is at the Post Office
and shop as she wants to keep the business running. Glenn is talking
to her about getting some temp Spmr cover to help in the situation.
Glenn is being very supportive — as is his nature — and will do what he
can to help the family at this difficult time.

If you need any further information please let me know,

Thanks
Angela
