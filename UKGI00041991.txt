Think weekend press officers should have the tip off but respond to any weekend enquiries
with a holding line of 'Report not yet published so can't comment’.

Just to confirm that this is embargoed for 6pm on Monday (and so I don't need to tip off

the weekend press officers)?

Hi Claire

Many thanks for your forbearance today. Please see attached a short covering note setting out
the key narrative and findings of the draft Second Sight report, POL's proposed next steps and
handling for its release on Monday, and suggested lines to take. A scanned copy of the report
(handed to us earlier today) is attached.

Kind regards
Peter
