Copy of E-mail from Andrew Price to Cath Oglesby

Cath,

When I spoke to the PM at Marine Drive he was unsure what was causing these errors. He
told me that he has been using the slave machine for his rems and I assured him that
wouldn't cause a problem as long as he was attached to the correct stock unit.

The PM thought there would be some errors relating to National Lottery, I phoned the Lottery
team at Transaction Processing who confirmed that there were some errors relating to Lottery,
but for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error, this was due to the lottery
figures been entered on Horizon in the wrong CAP.

PM was also concerned that when entering the lottery figures, it was as though the terminals
were not communicating, but if that was the case the PM would have large number of errors
on every report and product.

The PM sent cash account information to NBSC and it was looked at by Andrew Wise, he

was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned was a large amount on the cheques
to processing centre which Andrew was able to confirm was a cheque payment for the
purchase of Premium Bonds.

The PM was advised there was nothing more we could do and we suggested he works a
manual system at the side of Horizon to see if any problems were highlighted.

Also when doing the rems the PM should take a snapshot before and after to see if any
problems were occurring when doing a remittance.

Andrew Wise and ! both feel that the Horizon system is working properly and we are unable
to help the PM any further

{hope this information helps, please contact me if you want to clarify anything.

Regards
Andrew
