SUMMARY OF CHANGE:

Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu Services") provides, amongst other things, Services and
Applications to Post Office Limited ("Post Office") under an Agreement between them
dated 28 July 1999 (as amended, in particular by CCN 1200) ("Agreement").

Post Office has submitted Change Requests CR00957 and CR0O1034v3 in response to the
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard. This CCN (the “PCI CCN”) has
been raised in response to those Change Requests (although CR01034v3 is only included in
this PCI CCN for budgetary purposes the work being covered by CT577a). This PCI CCN
describes amendments to the Agreement necessary to reflect the changes to be made to
Horizon counters, the HNG-X System and to the Operational Services to handle Sensitive
Authentication Data and Cardholder Data. The intention is to introduce these changes
during the Horizon Release occurring at TS plus three months and as part of Project
HNG-X. For the avoidance of doubt, this PCI CCN does not include work to deliver two
factor authentication for the TESQA application.

This PCI CCN incorporates and consists of this CCN number 1202 and the following

REASON FOR CHANGE:

Operational Services as described in this PCI CCN.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:
1. Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree that:

(a) the Agreement and certain CCDs will be amended as set out in this PCI CCN;
and

(b) the PCI Requirements will be included into the Post Office version of the
DOORS tool as agreed Requirements. They will be changeable via the Change
Control Procedure.

2. Each amendment to a CCD or CRD introduced by the Parties in connection with an
amendment to the Agreement described in Attachment 1 will, or will be deemed to,
take effect on the same date on which that amendment to the Agreement takes
effect.

3. Where, in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 above, an amended or new provision of
the Agreement, a CCD or CRD has become effective, but the availability in a Branch
of the function or service described by that new or amended provision is dependent
on the relevant component being activated in that Branch by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services’ obligations in respect of the functionality of the relevant Operational
Services and/or Applications available in or to that Branch prior to such activation
will be those which existed prior to the new or amended provision becoming
effective.

4. As at the date on which this CCN is approved the CCDs and CRDs referenced in
“AMENDED CCDs and/or CRDs Part B” of this CCN have not yet been updated or
