Hi Amanda,

I feel Hithendra’ s role and objectives may evolve over the coming months.

I agreed with Elliott’s point regarding something to gauge his success as we will be asked this at some point
by PM’s and we can produce the facts and prove his effective.

It’s also important that other individuals within the business are informed about Hithendra’ s objectives so

we are all consistent.

Thanks Elliot

You are absolutely right on the last one

looks like’

Thanks Amanda

Totally agree!

The final objective could really do with some metrics to measure the improvement — what is our base-line now — what
does good look like, what does great look like — how do we know we are having impact.

Both, hope you are well

You asked about supporting Hithendra with his objectives, thank you for your offer

I know Hithendra has shared with you at a high level, here they are in detail with the timescales and success measures
Hithendra and I are very aware that the understanding of his role among PMs is limited whilst some may expect him
to be a ‘representative’ for PMs, I think your roles are similarly misunderstood?

Realistically, it was always going to be hard to explain as your roles are so new but let’s keep working together to find
the best way to do this to drive improvements and of course, please let me know if you think there is more I could or
should be doing to support

Amanda
