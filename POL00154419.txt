Dear Ms Maskell
Crichton Avenue Post Office

Thank you for your letter of 4th November 2015 about the above Post Office branch.

We have addressed the issues at the branch with Mrs Martin, the Postmaster, and, as you know, service to
customers has been fully restored.

We have made a goodwill payment to Mrs Martin recognising the inconvenience she experienced. We took
this action with consideration of all the facts and both our and Mrs Martin’s contractual obligations. We
believe this is a fair and reasonable approach to the matter, which we now consider closed, and we look
forward to working with Mrs Martin to continue to provide Post Office service in her community.

Thope this reply is helpful.

Yours sincerely

Kevin Gilliland
Network and Sales Director
