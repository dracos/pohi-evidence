CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS: HEARSAY AND RELATED

(Law Commission Consultation Paper No 138)

As promised in my letter of 11 October I am now able to let you have our response to
the above Consultation Paper.

We found the Consultation Paper to be of considerable interest and to be so complete
and clear in its coverage as to leave little scope for worthwhile comment. I can start,
however, with one general comment. Since we are experiencing a move away from
adherence to formal rules of evidence in the civil cases which we conduct before
General and Special Commissioners, we have no difficulty with the proposal at
paragraph 1.15 that “the admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal cases should
continue to be governed by rules separate from those applicable to civil cases.”

More specifically, we welcome the proposed rationalisation of the hearsay rule in
criminal cases. We agree in general with the criticisms levelled at the rule and would
endorse your provisional preference for automatic admissibility of specified types of
hear evidence coupled with a limited discretion to admit “multiple hearsay” in
certain circumstances (option 7).

The main concern that the Inland Revenue has in connection with the hearsay rule is
the problem of adducing documentary evidence, mostly of a financial or business
nature, in fraud cases. This problem has been considerably eased by sections 24 and
27 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and we have not suffered from the erratic use of
discretion referred to in paragraph 9.14 of the Consultation Paper. We are therefore
pleased to note that the paper recommends the retention of these provisions, even if in
an altered form.
