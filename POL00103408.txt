Common Issues Trial

We have been advised this afternoon that the embargoed judgment in the Common Issues trial will be sent out by
10.00am tomorrow, 8 March 19.

The judgment is 175,000 words (excluding appendices) — at least 300 pages, so it will take some time for the legal team
to undertake the high level review and provide this back to the POL team. We will provide updates as soon as possible
tomorrow, but it will be later in the afternoon given the length of the judgement. We will comment on next steps in
that update.

The Judge has asked for submissions on typos etc by 6.00pm on Wednesday 13 March 19, with a view to handing down
the finalised version - preferably on Friday 15 March; but possibly on Monday 18 March, but the Judge will notify the
parties on Thursday 14 March to confirm the date.

Horizon Trial

The Horizon trial also starts on Monday. We do not expect any material press coverage ahead of the trial starting,
however we expect Nick Wallis to attend Court each day and, as with the Common Issues trial, he will tweet the live
proceedings and post on his website the various witness statements — including the expert witness reports, as they are
released by the Court. As before, the Communications team will be monitoring press and social media comments.

One piece of good news is that the experts have stated in their 4°" joint agreed statement that Horizon is ‘relatively
robust’. The advantage of this formulation is that it means that the judge cannot find as a matter of fact that Horizon is
less than ‘relatively robust’.

As ever, please let me know if you have any questions.
Kind regards,

Jane
