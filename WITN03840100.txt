POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RICHARD CHRISTOU

1, RICHARD CHRISTOU, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. | am a former employee of International Computers Ltd (“ICL”) (later
renamed Fujitsu Services Limited (“FSL”) and thereafter a former employee
of Fujitsu Limited (“Fujitsu”). | retired in May 2012. | attach as an annex to

this statement a brief curriculum vitae.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated
6'" January 2023 (the “Request’), to the extent | have direct knowledge of
the matters addressed in the Request. The Request deals with events many
of which took place over 25 years ago, so in some cases my recollection is
limited. | have therefore refreshed my memory by reviewing the documents
provided to me by the Inquiry. To the extent those documents have assisted
my recollection, | refer to the documents using the URN numbers listed in

the index accompanying this statement.

3. In preparing this witness statement, | have been assisted by Morrison

Foerster, the recognised legal representatives for FSL in the Inquiry.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
4. Most of my involvement in the issues being examined by this Inquiry
occurred in the second half of the 1990’s during part of the period when |
was employed as Director of Commercial and Legal Affairs for the group of
companies (the “ICL Group”) owned in the UK and abroad by the holding

company then named ICL plc.

5. In this capacity, | was responsible for the provision of legal and commercial
advice in connection with the participation of the ICL Group in the tender
for the Horizon IT System (“Horizon”) by a consortium operating under the
umbrella of Pathway Limited (“Pathway”). ICL, a wholly owned subsidiary
of ICL plc and its operating company in the UK, was a member of this
consortium and owner of the necessary shares in Pathway on behalf of the

ICL Group. The other shareholders were De La Rue and Girobank.

6. The project for the development, supply, installation and maintenance of
Horizon (collectively the “Project”) for the Benefits Agency (“BA”) and Post
Office Counters Limited (“POCL”), was awarded to Pathway. | was
involved, acting on behalf ICL, in the legal and commercial aspects of the
preparation of the tender and (after award of the Project to Pathway) the
negotiation of the initial contracts for the delivery of the Project which were

signed in May 1996 (the “Related Agreements’).

DELAYS IN DEVELOPMENT OF HORIZON
7. Although | recall that there were various periods of delay and consequent
changes of the time scales for the deliverables forming part of the Project,
| cannot recall any details of the exact periods of delay. Certain documents
which | have been asked to consider, FUJ00077850, FUJ00077835 and
FUJ00077836 contain forecasts of delays, but | do not recall the details
mentioned therein. However, it is clear that the forecasts were overly
optimistic. For example, the forecast for completion of the national rollout
was the second half of the year 2000, while in fact such completion did not

occur until 2002.

8. The reasons for these delays, in my opinion, go back to the tender process

and the provisions of the Related Agreements.

9. In an ideal world, the placing of any system development contract of the

nature of the Project should take the following course:

a. The customer decides upon the high-level business requirements

which the project would satisfy.

b. The customer (in some cases together with the contractor) then
creates a detailed functional specification showing each step of the
business processes involved in delivering the business requirements.

The customer (even if assisted in its creation by the contractor) then

Page 3 of 34
10.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

accepts that the functional specification satisfies its business

requirements.

c. The contractor then creates the detailed specification of a system
(comprising hardware and software) which would operate in

accordance with the requirements of the functional specification.

d. The resulting contract is then based on the premise that the contractor
undertakes to deliver the system as specified and warrants that such
system will enable the customer to carry out the business processes

set out in the functional specification.

e. There may (but not always) then be a service level agreement under
which the contractor undertakes to provide specified services (for
example, maintenance or help-desk facilities) in respect of the system
during the term of the contract. Such agreements may also contain
change control processes which allow for the provision of additional
functionality or other changes required by the customer subject to

agreement on the specification, price and delivery dates.

Unfortunately, such an ideal contractual framework is hard to obtain in the
world of competitive tendering, and impossible when dealing with the
Private Finance Initiative (“PFI”) regime, which | do not believe is suitable

for IT projects.

In practice, the tendering process for the Project resulted in little room for
negotiation of the terms and conditions which, after the award to Pathway,
were embodied in the Related Agreements. In addition, the time scales set
out in the tender were very ambitious. BA, in particular, was anxious to
conclude negotiations, make an award and place a contract for the Project
as quickly as possible. | understood this to be because the then Minister,
Peter Lilley, wanted to demonstrate substantial progress on the BA smart

card at a forthcoming Conservative Party Conference.

Although some negotiation was possible, Pathway was determined to win
the tender, and decided to undertake as little negotiation as possible in

order to better its chances of obtaining the award.

The result of this was that, when Pathway finally negotiated and signed the
Related Agreements, it was on the basis of an incomplete system
specification with many areas left unsatisfied and subject to “agreements to

agree”, which are of course not binding under English Law.

There was no true functional specification, and neither BA nor POCL had
really considered in detail the changes to their businesses processes that
would be necessitated when Horizon became POCL’s business platform. |
recall that POCL had very little by way of existing business process
manuals. In order to proceed with the development of Horizon, it was
necessary for POCL to produce these manuals with the assistance of

Pathway, in parallel with the progress of the development. Thus there was

Page 5 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

continued discussion with both customers on how to resolve “agreements

to agree” and on what detailed business processes required digitalisation.

15. In my view, this was a situation in which the contracting parties were trying
to finalise both a functional and a system specification at the same time as
the contractor was trying to develop and deliver the system. Delays and

disputes were inevitable.

16. There were two additional factors contributing to delay.

a. The first was that the Related Agreements, in essence, amounted to
a consortium contracting with two customers. This is never an ideal
situation. Even with good will on the part of all parties, and a properly
drafted contract, genuine differences of opinion on the way forward

are likely to occur.

Even if the two customers had both been enthusiastic about the
completion of the Project, there would have been differences between
their requirements which would have likely caused problems for
Pathway. However, in this case, the problems were exacerbated
because, from the outset, BA was reluctant to move to the smart card
method of paying benefits (see below my views on the position of BA).
In these circumstances the conclusion of any “agreements to agree”

which involved BA was never easy.

19.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

b. | The second factor was the delay in the development and rollout by BA
of its Customer and Accounting Payment System (“CAPS”). As |
understood it, CAPS was necessary for the operation of the BA smart
card element of the Project. This was because, when a smart card
would be presented at a post office for payment of a benefit, Horizon
would then have to interface with CAPS, via the relevant benefit card,

in order to verify and make the payment.

The problems caused by the fact that Pathway was in essence a consortium
were removed when the other consortium members withdrew from the
Project and sold their shares in Pathway to ICL in July 1996, although |
recall their representatives remained on the board of the company for some
time afterward, as sub-contracts between the withdrawing shareholders
and Pathway in respect of some aspects of the project were at that time still

in place.

| believe their reason for withdrawal was their perception of the amount of
risk inherent in the terms of the Related Agreements. | believe that ICL, for
its part, wanted sole control of the Project in order to manage it as it thought

best.

Pathway then became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICL, and was renamed
ICL Pathway Ltd (“ICL Pathway”). Although the withdrawal of the other
consortium members made decision making in ICL Pathway easier, it was,

of course, too late to solve the problems arising from the stance taken by

Page 7 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

the consortium members (including ICL) in the conduct of the tender and

the negotiation of the Related Agreements.

20. | thus became solely responsible for advising the ICL Group, including ICL
and ICL Pathway on the legal and commercial aspects of the Project. From
1997 onwards, | was therefore closely involved in the various disputes

concerning the delays in the progress of the Project.

21. The short-term consequence of the above delays was increases in ICL
Pathway’s costs. As is always the case, this gave rise to disputes as to
whether such increases were caused by ICL Pathway’s default or changes
in the customers’ requirements. In addition, these delays put severe strain
on ICL Pathway’s cash flow position. There were also longer-term

consequences, which | have explained further below in paragraph 68.

22. The increasing delays in the Project and their financial impact on ICL
Pathway led to intensive contractual negotiations with POCL and BA during
Q4 1998. It was agreed to submit the then current disputes between the
three contracting parties to Mr. Graham Corbett in September 1998 by way

of mediation.

RELATIONS BETWEEN POCL AND ICL/FUJITSU
23. In order to respond to questions regarding the relations between POCL and
ICL/Fujitsu, | have been asked to consider documents POL00028689,

POL00028444, POL00028688, POLO00039895, POL00028693 and

Page 8 of 34
24.

25.

26.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

POL00031113. These documents relate to attempts of the three parties to
find a way forward which would enable the Project to continue (subject to
specified contractual amendments) for the benefit of all parties. The
suggested solution was based to some extent on the results of the

mediation with Mr. Corbett.

The problem with this mediation was that Mr. Corbett considered ICL
Pathway should write off all the work in progress relating to the Project
which was currently held on the balance sheet in anticipation of future
payments from the customers under the terms of the Related Agreements.
He thought there could then be a clean slate from which to renegotiate the

future performance of the Project.

This write off would have resulted in the insolvency of ICL Pathway, and its
losses would have been reflected in the balance sheets of ICL plc and
ultimately of Fujitsu. Having considered again the copy of my memorandum
dated 13th October 1998 entitled “Proposed Way Forward for the BA/POCL
Programme” ( POL00028688) (“My Memorandum’), | confirm that this was
an accurate summary of the status of the then current problems with the
Project and of ICL’s reactions to Mr. Corbett’s proposal; and that My
Memorandum accurately set out the objectives which ICL was seeking to

secure by way of contract renegotiation in order to preserve the Project.

The remaining documents | have been referred to in relation to this section

(POL00039895, POL00028693 and POLO0031113) record the advice

Page 9 of 34
27.

28.

29.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

given by BA and POCL’s legal advisers on the merits and drawbacks, as
they saw them, of the proposals in My Memorandum. | would highlight in

particular the following points about the negotiation.

As stated above, and in My Memorandum, the financial position of ICL
Pathway was precarious. It had suffered cost overruns due to delays in the
project, and cash flow problems due to delays in payment. It had already
spent cash of some £250m from its own borrowing sources, most of which
expenditure had resulted in the accumulation of work in progress held on
the balance sheet, and would require around another £250m before there
was any possibility of obtaining non-recourse funding under the usual terms

for PFI contracts.

In conclusion, ICL Pathway was faced not only with the risk of writing-off
the accumulated work in progress, but also with the inability to continue the
Project if it could not either find a source of funding externally or persuade

ICL plc or Fujitsu to provide more cash.

The requirements, set out in My Memorandum, for certainty around the
system specification and acceptance criteria were therefore aimed at
making clear what the customers’ requirements were, so as to minimise the
risk of failure of the Project and the consequent write-off of the work in

progress.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

The requirements to amend the contract to make it more acceptable to third
party funders were proposed in My Memorandum in the hope that they
would make such funders amenable to providing, at least at some future
stage in the Project, the non-recourse funding that was then the norm for
PFI contracts. However, ICL Pathway was never able to obtain such non-

recourse funding, and the ultimate contract was financed by Fujitsu.

It is interesting to note that in paragraph 10 of the Bird & Bird draft
memorandum dated 13 November 1998 contained in POLO0039895, Mr.
Hamish Sandison comments on the Treasury Guidelines for PFI projects,
which (following the advice of the CCTA) state that PFI non-recourse
funding is not necessarily suitable for IT projects. In fact, my experience is
that it is not possible to obtain such funding until a project has been
delivered and is running in steady state; by which time the contractor has
already had to finance most of the cost of the project out of its own

resources.

In general, the contract negotiations with POCL during Q4 1998 and Q1
1999 were amicable and constructive. | took part in these negotiations and
had meetings with various members of POCL including Mr. Stuart
Sweetman, and Mr. John Roberts of the Post Office. The atmosphere was
of two parties who were trying to cooperate to solve a problem and save

the Project.

Page 11 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

33. Sir Michael Butler’s proposal at this time that POCL take an equity stake in
ICL Pathway was indicative of this state of affairs. It was in effect a proposal
to turn the Project into a joint venture which would completely align ICL
Pathway’s and POCL'’s interests. Ultimately, this was a bridge too far, but |
believe that if it had occurred both parties would have benefitted. The
problem was to solve what the new relationship would be with BA. As will

be seen below this problem was insoluble.

RELATIONS BETWEEN UK GOVERNMENT AND ICL/FUJITSU
34. By the beginning of 1999, it was clear that resolution of the disputes
surrounding the Project would be difficult to solve. ICL’s position had not
changed from the proposal it put forward following the mediation conducted
by Mr. Corbett, as set out in My Memorandum. My Memorandum was
discussed to some extent, but never received a positive reply, as it did not
find favour with BA. By the beginning of May 1999, it was clear that this
proposal on the part of ICL, which had been dubbed ‘Option A’ during the
course of the discussions, was no longer viable. Although ICL would have
been happy to proceed on this basis, Option A was withdrawn by my letter

to Mr. Steve Robson dated 4th May 1999 (see POL00090460).

35. With regards to the relations between UK Government and ICL/Fujitsu, |
have been asked to consider documents POL00090460, FUJ00003630,
HMT00000009, HMT00000064, POL00069066, POL00028574,
CBO00100002_013, FUJ00003599, CBO00100002_003 and

HMT00000013. The underlying problem of the negotiations during this

Page 12 of 34
36.

37.

38.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

period, as shown by this documentation, was that there was no consensus
either within government or within Fujitsu and the ICL Group on the correct
way forward (see on the part of the government, for example, the
memorandum dated 10th May 1999 sent by Mr. Geoff Mulgan to the Prime
Minister — CBO00100002_013- and on the part of Fujitsu and the ICL
Group the minutes of meetings dated 4th February 1999 — FUJ00003630-

and 14th May 1999 — FUJ00003599).

In my opinion, the reasons for this lack of consensus on the part of the
government were: (i) the reluctance of BA to proceed with the payment of
benefits by smart card, (ii) the desire of POCL to retain the income stream
generated from BA or at least to be compensated for its loss, and (iii) that
neither POCL nor BA were willing to pay in whole, or even in part, for ICL

Pathway’s sunk costs.

In my opinion the reasons for the lack of consensus in the ICL Group arose
from: (i) the extent to which various people felt that they had been badly
treated by BA and government in general, and (ii) the extent to which they
felt that, under the current circumstances, the Project could not proceed

further on any basis at all.

Fujitsu itself was more concerned with why the government and a valued
supplier could not reach an amicable conclusion. At least at that time in
Japan there was a close partnership and a long-term relationship of mutual

support between the Japanese government and its major suppliers. Fujitsu

Page 13 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

did not fully comprehend the tension created by the shorter-term

relationships arising from the requirements for competitive tendering.

39. Further, in the case of both the ICL Group and Fujitsu, the pressure to
produce a resolution of some sort, to enable both Fujitsu and the ICL Group
to close their accounts for their financial years ending 31° March 1999, did

not help, and was starting to give rise to hasty reactions.

40. Fujitsu were willing to be supportive of a reasonable solution, but they felt
it was the ICL Group that had got itself into the Project and it was up to the

ICL Group to solve the problem.

THE OPTIONS
41. The three options on the table from government were now B1 (Horizon
including the BA smart card), B 3 (Horizon without the BA smart card) or C
(termination). (See the memorandum dated 10th May 1999 addressed by
Mr. Geoff Mulgan to the Prime Minister - see CBO00100002_013). Again,
the problem was who would pick up the costs — the ICL Group or the
government; and it was Fujitsu rather than the ICL Group, and the Treasury

rather than BA and POCL, that held the purse strings.

42. At this stage, | personally felt that those in the ICL Group who were
contemplating a fight with the government, both in the press and the courts,
were not acting in the best interests of either the company or its customers.

| did not favour option B 1 because | had no confidence that BA would

Page 14 of 34
43.

44.

45.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

cooperate in the performance of the contract, even if they were instructed

to agree to the use of the smart card.

| favoured option B 3, since | felt that this represented a deliverable project
with a willing customer, provided that a suitable contract could be put in
place and BA removed from the scene. | had always believed that BA had
acted in bad faith in failing to cooperate in the performance of the Related
Agreements since they had never favoured payment of benefits by the
smart card. BA’s preferred method of benefit payments was by ACT, as it
was much cheaper. My recollection is that ACT cost 3p per transaction

while payments through POCL would cost 50p per transaction.

In my opinion, Option B 3 was the best solution for POCL, and its
customers. It also satisfied BA, and left the ICL Group with a potentially
profitable contract which it was capable of delivering. | was certainly under
no duress or indeed any form of influence to ensure that the Project

proceeded no matter what.

In fact, in favouring option B 3 as the way forward, rather than (as was once
suggested by others in the ICL Group) building a case which would enable
ICL Pathway to terminate the contract by reason of breach on the part of
BA/POCL (see some of the discussions in the minutes of the meeting of

14th May 1999 in FUJ00003599), | was actually swimming against the tide.

Page 15 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

THE WITHDRAWAL OF BA
46. In late April and early May, | had some meetings with Mr. Steve Robson at
which we agreed that the best course would be to focus on Option B 3, but
that we needed more time to sort out the details of the new contract and
arrange for the withdrawal of BA. The difficulty was how to satisfy the Fujitsu
and ICL plc auditors on the position to be taken on closing their respective
accounts for their financial years ending on 31st March 1999. Probably, in
the absence of a solution, and certainly, in the case of a termination of the
contract, the auditors would have required all of the work in progress to be
written off. If this had happened, | was sure litigation would have become

inevitable.

47. We agreed that the solution was to sign two legally binding agreements:
one under which BA withdrew from the Project and the other under which
ICL and POCL undertook that within three months from the date of
signature they would exercise best efforts to negotiate a revised contract,
no longer on the basis of PFI but with payment against milestones. In the
event that the negotiations failed, ICL would be paid a termination payment

of (as | recollect) around £150m.

48. | was able to convince Fujitsu that this was the best way forward, even
though it was not without consequences for ICL because there would still
be a substantial portion of unrecoverable costs from the work in progress

relating to the BA smart card. However, Fujitsu was satisfied with the

Page 16 of 34
49.

50.

51.

52.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

solution because matters had been solved amicably between ICL and the

government of the UK without resort to litigation.

The two agreements described above (the “Withdrawal Agreements’)
were signed on 24'" May 1999 and BA withdrew on that date. Accordingly,
all further references to “Horizon” and the “Project” in my testimony should

be understood no longer to include BA and the BA smart card.

The Withdrawal Agreements were sufficient to enable Fujitsu and the ICL
Group Auditors to close the Fujitsu and ICL plc accounts for the fiscal year
ending 31S March 1999. As a consequence, ICL Pathway wrote off £180m
of the work in progress on its balance sheet. This related to the work on the

BA smart card which no longer formed part of the contract.

The new agreement between ICL Pathway and POCL (the “Codified
Agreement”) was signed on 28" July 1999. It was guaranteed by ICL plc

and Fujitsu.

It was now possible to continue with the development of Horizon without
the involvement of BA and to proceed to acceptance and rollout under the
terms of the Codified Agreement. | was optimistic about the way forward for
the Project, and pleased that | had been able to broker a satisfactory and
amicable solution to a difficult situation which was fair to all parties
concerned, even though it had necessitated some sacrifices on the part of

all of them.

Page 17 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

53. In the year 2000 | was invited by Sir John Bourne of the National Audit
Office (“NAO”) to meet to discuss the issues surrounding cancellation of the
BA smart card and the withdrawal of BA from the Project. | discussed with
him in substance all of the matters set out above and my views are reflected
(although of course subject to Sir John’s own opinions) in the NAO Report
entitled “The Cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card project” (HC 857
Session 1999-2000) dated 18 August 2000. | thought then that this Report
was a fair and balanced assessment of the problems arising during the
performance of the Project under the regime of the Related Agreements.
My opinion at that time was confirmed when | obtained a copy of the NAO
Report from Morrison Foerster whilst preparing this statement and re-read

the executive summary (POL00000805).

ROLLOUT AND ACCEPTANCE
54. After the Codified Agreement had been signed, | was content that the future
task of delivery of the Project should be the responsibility of the ICL
Pathway team, including roll out and acceptance. | was not therefore
involved in the detail of the Horizon acceptance tests and rollout. | kept in
touch with progress at a high level through meetings of the board of ICL
Pathway, and meetings with Mr. Stuart Sweetman of POCL. | also visited
the Horizon team of ICL Pathway and sat in on some of their review
meetings. My interest was mainly commercial, revolving around the
progress on milestone payments and the proper operation of the new

change control procedures in the Codified Agreement.

Page 18 of 34

57.

58.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

The process of acceptance and consequential rollout was of necessity a

joint exercise by ICL Pathway and POCL.

In the case of acceptance, POCL’s internal IT department was fully
involved. Acceptance, which had already started under the Related
Agreements, was a lengthy, iterative process in which the two parties would
jointly review various acceptance test results as they became available,
identify issues that needed correcting, remedy them and then tick them off
on the list of issues that had to be satisfied before acceptance could take

place.

There is nothing unusual in such a process in large IT system contracts.
Within ICL, the responsibility for achieving acceptance was with the ICL
Pathway team, as was remedying issues which showed failure to comply
with the specification in the Codified Agreement. There was sometimes
discussion as to whether an issue in question was outside the specification
and therefore its remediation would give rise to a change control note, but

this is a common feature of acceptance programmes in such contracts.

The discussion about reference data in minutes of ICL Pathway board
meeting dated 24 November 1999 (FUJ00003660), about which | cannot
recall any further details, is an example of this process. Reference data was
information about products which were supplied by post offices, for instance

pricing or terms and conditions of supply. It was necessary in order to

Page 19 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

enable consumer transactions in respect of such products to take place.
This was a technical issue, the solution of which only became possible once

ICL Pathway and POCL worked on it together.

59. During the latter half of 1999, the Project continued to make good progress
and acceptance was achieved. The contractual requirements for the
milestone payment of £68m having been satisfied, POCL paid the sum over

to ICL Pathway at the end of the year.

FROM ACCEPTANCE TO COMPLETION OF ROLLOUT
60. At the beginning of 2000, Mr. Keith Todd decided to make changes in the
board of ICL Pathway. Sir Michael Butler retired as chairman and | was
appointed in his place. Mr. Todd also appointed a new managing director
of the Company. The first managing director (Mr. John Bennet) had a
background in marketing, commerce and business development, but the
emphasis in the Project was now on delivery in accordance with the
Codified Agreement. Mr. Michael Stares was appointed in Mr. Bennett's

place. His speciality was in project delivery, service provision and logistics.

61. In July 2000, Mr. Todd left the ICL Group and | was appointed as acting
chief executive in his place. This appointment was confirmed, and | became

Chief Executive of the ICL Group at the end of 2000.

62. From July 2000, | followed the progress of the Project only in outline, and

was content to leave its management to Mr. Stares, in whom | had complete

Page 20 of 34
63.

64.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

confidence. There were many more pressing issues which required my
attention as Chief Executive. | continued to make courtesy visits from time
to time to POCL and the Post Office (to Mr. Stuart Sweetman and Mr. John
Roberts respectively) but | do not recall either of them raising any problems

with me.

Mr. David Courtley (with whom | was acquainted from the time when he
was working for EDS) was recruited as Chief Operations Officer of ICL plc
in July 2001, reporting to me as Chief Executive. He thereupon became
responsible, amongst other things, for the delivery of all major projects
within the ICL Group, including Horizon. He would regularly discuss with
me in face-to-face meetings (our offices were at that time next door to each
other) any major problems or strategic issues related to such projects.
However, | do not recall him raising with me any problems concerning
Horizon. Any day-to-day problems arising would not have been escalated
to me, but would have been handled initially by Mr. Stares and his team,

with, from July 2001, the oversight of Mr. Courtley.

| only recall two substantial issues that arose at this time in relation to
rollout. The first was the question of how to handle rollout over the
1999/2000 Christmas period when POCL had its peak volume to handle.
This issue was resolved by a revision to the rollout programme and a
suspension of activities over that period. The second problem related to the
number of post offices which did not have ISDN connections. This was a

technical issue which was solved in the interim by various work arounds

that | cannot recall, and was only finally solved as the UK network became
more advanced with the increasing replacement of copper cable with optical

fibre.

By 2002, the rollout to all post offices was complete. Looking back, | cannot
see how the rollout could have been handled as anything other than a joint
process in cooperation POCL. It was dependent on the schedules that
POCL could agree with their postmasters to make themselves available to
attend the mandatory training courses and their offices available for

installation of the system.

When rollout was finally complete, |, and indeed Fujitsu and the ICL Group,
regarded the completion of such a large and complex activity as a

significant success.

| have been asked whether or not Horizon could be considered a robust
system. In all my experience of over 40 years working in the
Telecommunications and IT industry | have never come across the use of
the word “robust” as a contractual term. With respect, | think it is a
subjective term without any precise legal meaning. | believe that the only
pertinent questions in relation to the Horizon system are, (a) did the system
pass the acceptance tests, and (b) was it delivered in accordance with

contract. Both these conditions were satisfied at the end of rollout in 2002.

CONTRACT EXTENSIONS AND REORANISATIONS
68. Nevertheless, there was a long term consequence for ICL Pathway of the
delays that had occurred prior the signature of the Codified Agreement.
Since the Codified Agreement was only for a term of five years, and rollout
was completed in 2002, ICL Pathway now had only three years in which to
receive an income stream that would provide some compensation for costs
not yet recovered under milestone payments and that would hopefully

generate a profit.

69. However, following completion of rollout, POCL were sufficiently satisfied
with Horizon to agree an extension of the term of the Codified Agreement
to 2010. Naturally, | discussed this with Mr. Courtley and supported the
extension. As | recollect, the main objective for ICL in this regard was to
extend the contract term in order to assist with the recovery of costs, and
the generation of profits from the additional revenue to be received during
the period of the extension. In responding to the Inquiry’s questions in
relation to the extension, | have considered the documents FUJ00003645
and FUJ00003557, however, | do not recall any further details about the

other objectives mentioned in those documents.

70. At the time of the contract extension in 2002, a substantial corporate
reorganisation was taking place within ICL plc. ICL plc was to be rebranded
as Fujitsu Services plc. The same would happen to its operating companies
in different regions. So far as concerned the UK, ICL was to be rebranded

as Fujitsu Services Limited (“FSL’).

WITN03840100

Mr. Courtley and | had created a new strategic model for FSL. As part of
this model ICL Pathway, with the consent of POCL, was to transfer the
whole of its undertaking to FSL and become dormant. This necessitated a
novation of the Codified Agreement, so that the new contract took effect
between POCL and FSL. As before, it was guaranteed by Fujitsu Services
plc and Fujitsu. Once this happened, Horizon was delivered as a major

project within the reorganised operations of FSL.

| have no personal recollection of the red alert in 2004 mentioned in the
minutes of the meetings in the documents which | have been asked to
consider FUJ0003590 and FUJ0003575). Nor do | have any recollection of
discussing the matter with Mr. Courtley further to his report. | could not
therefore have been overly concerned about it at the time. Having read the
report now, | see no reason to change what must have been my initial
opinion. On reading the nature of the red alert, | have no doubt this would
have been an issue that Mr. Courtley was more than competent to deal
with. Given my lack of knowledge and failure to recall the red alert, it would
not have been possible, neither then nor now, for me to regard the red alert

as symptomatic of any broader problems connected with Horizon.

In 2006, there were proposals to upgrade Horizon to what was called
Horizon New Generation (“HNGX’). | have no recollection of the details of
the upgrade or the contract amendments that were put in place, except that

the upgrade amongst other features catered for on-line banking. This was

Page 24 of 34
WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

all handled within FSL by Mr. Courtley who had replaced me as Chief
Executive of Fujitsu Services Plc on 1 April 2004. Although | was still
Chairman of Fujitsu Services plc, most of my time during 2006 was taken
up working with business groups in Tokyo to create a new strategy for
Fujitsu’s global business outside of Japan. At this time, | was also acting as

director of some Fujitsu companies in the USA.

74. The document | have been asked to consider in connection with the events
occurring in 2006 (Fujitsu Services Holding PLC Directors Written
Resolution dated 14 August 2006,FUJ0003648) is an assurance that,
despite the changes in the Codified Agreement occasioned by the HGNX
upgrade, the guarantees already in place would remain in full force and

effect.

REFLECTIONS
75. Finally, | have been asked my opinion on the question of who might be
responsible for the miscarriage of justice in respect of certain prosecutions
of postmasters by POCL. Since | have no knowledge of this issue, | do not
feel able to give such an opinion. In this connection, | make the following

points.

76. Following the events of 2006, | was appointed in 2007 as responsible for
Fujitsu’s EMEA businesses (thus becoming an employee of Fujitsu), and
then in 2008 as President of the Global Business Group (all of Fujitsu's

Information Technology Operations outside of Japan) | had very little

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

contact with the detail of operations within the various subsidiaries, and was
mainly reliant on the chief executives of the country or regional operations

who reported to me.

No further problems were raised with me in connection with Horizon during
my time with Fujitsu. In particular, | had no knowledge of the prosecution of
postmasters by POCL. | always regarded Horizon as one of FSL’s major

successes, with POCL as a satisfied customer.

After | retired in 2012, my only relations with Fujitsu were through a
consultancy agreement. | was never consulted under this agreement about
any issues relating to Horizon and thus, although | became aware of the
issues between POCL and the postmasters through a few reports in the

press, | therefore did not enquire further into the matter.

My objectives in negotiating the Codified Agreement were to create a
detailed specification and precise acceptance criteria, and to replace the
PFI financing provisions with a schedule of payments to be made on the
achievement of specified milestones. | focused on the main provisions of
the Codified Agreement, in order to achieve the above objectives. | had little
involvement in preparation of the schedules and appendices of the Codified

Agreement, which | never read.

Subject to legal review by both parties’ external advisers - in ICL’s case,

Masons (now Pinsent Masons) - the schedules and appendices were

Page 26 of 34

82.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

attached to the main part of the Codified Agreement after being drafted and
agreed by joint working parties of the relevant technical, financial and
commercial staff in ICL Pathway and POCL. Other than above, | cannot
recall any details of the Codified Agreement, and | do not recall having dealt

with any provisions relating to prosecution of postmasters.

Since | could not recall details of the Codified Agreement, | obtained a copy
from Morrison Foerster, POCL and ICL Pathway, Information Technology
Services Agreement of Bringing Technology to Post Offices - Codified
Agreement dated 28 July 1999 (FUJ00000071). Once more, | read only the
main contract provisions, since they contained the matters | was most
involved with during the contract negotiations. | did not read the

appendices.

The only provision | found in the contract which might, | suppose, be

relevant was clause:

“106.2 The Contractor shall offer all reasonable assistance to POCL in
preventing fraudulent use of the POCL Services and POCL Service

Infrastructure by POCL’s employees and Agents.”

This does not seem to me to have anything to do with prosecuting
postmasters. Liability for fraud was a point of considerable contention prior
to its resolution in the Codified Agreement. Having now seen this clause,

and reflected upon it, my belief is that this was part of the negotiation which

Page 27 of 34
84.

85.

86.

WITNO03840100
WITN03840100

shifted to POCL some of the liability for fraud imposed on ICL Pathway in
the Related Agreements, but left it with an obligation to assist in its

prevention.

However, in conclusion, | would make the following observations on this

issue.

In my experience, when problems arise in connection with the operation of
an IT system, the easy answer is always to blame the system itself.
Concerning Horizon, | think it is noteworthy that POCL was satisfied to
operate with Horizon as its business platform, including a contract
extension and an upgrade, until 2010 and beyond. Would this really have
been the case, if, as it appears is being suggested, Horizon itself, as
developed and operated under the terms of the Codified Agreement, was

in some way seriously defective?

If | had been charged with investigating this issue, | would have focused
mainly on the relevant management processes (if any) in place in both ICL
and POCL which were relevant to the prosecution of postmasters, the
extent to which these processes were adequate for their intended purpose,
and, if they were, whether the persons charged with the carrying out of

those processes had in fact complied with them.
