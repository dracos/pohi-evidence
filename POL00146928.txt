Hi Andy,

V'd be interested in your views on Ron’s approach here ie copying the e-mail correspondence to the
applicant, their advisor and Alan Bates. Shirley is investigating case M001 (a case Ron saw in the pre-
mediation scheme phase) and has legitimately asked Ron for some information he may have in relation to
the case. This interaction should in my view not be widely circulated — I'd appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks,

Angela

I don't think I've been given those Shirley but will take a fresh look. Lee: if you still have
those, please get them to us.

Shirley: At this stage of the process, I think you should routinely copy (as I did... and have
again here) the Applicant and his chosen Professional Advisor (Emma) on correspondence.

Best regards, Ron.

Shirley:

First set of scanned docs (4 pages) re SRO18 (the £1,256.88 13th May 2004 transaction
processed (both Input AND Authorisation)* by someone with the system ID 'CPVPB77).

* Isn't there meant to be a dual-control over journal entries (with SEPARATE Inputter and
Authoriser)

Regards, Ron.

Shirley:

Am looking at Lee's source docs now. Will scan and send to you those you've asked for (later
today because we're still busy on the end-of-Scheme-Phase 1 late arriving Apps). In the
meantime, here's Spot Review 18 that related to the £1,256.88. I'll also locate - in Lee's
docs which I have here - the pages that relate to the txns that Lee claims were entered at
times when neither Lee nor his staff were logged in. My thoughts turn to auto-generated
reversals as a possibility here. As we've already established, Horizon allocates (to each of its
own reversals) the ID of the staff member who input the transaction that it (the system) is
then reversing. My position on that is that the design is incorrect and that such auto-
reversals should have always had attached to them an ID naming Horizon itself, not asserting
that the person who keyed the (about to be reversed) transaction - and who may not even
know that his or her transaction is about to be reversed - also processed the reversal. It
seems also that, in many cases, not only did the originator not know that one of his/her
transactions was being reversed... but also never found out about that reversal at any later
time either.

Best regards, Ron.
