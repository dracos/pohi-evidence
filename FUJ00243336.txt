Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing: Proposal

Mike

’ve spoken to him. My point to him was that, for the final version of the report, it would not be an audit in the sense
that they would not be warranting that the system was free from defects, rather it would be more like a “peer review”
or scientific paper where they are explaining what they did, the result of what they did, and what they found (i.e. no
defects) — which is a rather different statement to saying that no defects exist (which is what an audit warrants, in
effect).

On that basis I said that I would expect them to allow us to show the report to whoever we liked, subject to (a) some
statement that we had to show it in context (i.e. not just the line saying “it’s fine” but the caveats that go with that, (b)
some statements from them about what they did/didn’t do and the scope of their study. On that basis I couldn’t see
what a third party could sue them for, other than being negligent within the scope of what they said they had done (in
which case we wouldn’t hold them harmless).

The point is that they would not be auditors or expert witnesses (neither of which, within our budget, I think they can
do). They would be external experts providing a peer review and third party validation of the work, which we could point

to in evidence. I think that is all we want, and if so I will do some words.

PS I can’t make the call later but if you want to discuss, please give me a ring

Ervin,

Thanks for the reply and clarification.

Your 1.1) below appears contradictory with your proposal

“At the conclusion of Phase two, Fujitsu will have a comprehensive report to be used only for its own internal risk and commercial
compliance assessment”

,but this may be my naivety in your latter comment below regarding distribution.

I would like Ed to bottom out on this point with you please. If it is possible to get a call today pre 13:30 or 15:00-16:00,
that would be great.

The other areas to which we require clarity, and any subsequent amendment to your proposal, are listed below:
FUJ00243336
FUJ00243336

1. Fujitsu already complies to audits on procedure, process and policy hence it would be anticipated that these
would be cross referenced and effectively out of scope from this KPMG audit. Our scope is to ensure the
technical assurance of transactions. However, page 6 suggest otherwise.

2. Please can we clarify exactly what KPMG means by “transaction types” in the paragraph on document review on
Page 12. Horizon supports a few thousand different types of transaction. However these fall into about half a
dozen broad categories and in all cases a transaction is recorded as part of a basket and the integrity and
auditing is related to the overall basket structure. If the reference to transaction type, means one of these
broad categories of transactions, then that is fine, but we feel it is unnecessary to investigate all types of Horizon
transaction. We would expect this to be clarified as part of the “Understanding” sessions.

3. The exact same process applies for every transaction type, hence we deem it unnecessary to test all transaction
types. The integrity of the data in the audit trail is covered by the digital signature. Page 12 talks to
understanding of different transaction types.

4. Documentation — is available, but whether this is in the preferred KPMG format is unlikely. We are concerned
that this would grant an open licence to significantly increase the cost to Fujitsu whilst we would derive little

benefit to ourselves.

5. Future proofing: would you please split this piece out as an optional extra on the basis that if your findings are
merely to confirm good practice, then we might leverage little benefit from a future proofing process.

On these 5 areas, it would be useful to get a quick position/understanding from you, if possible today. We may need to
set up a session with our respective teams to narrow down and can do this in coming days.

Mike

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing: Proposal

Hi Mike,
The reason for this clause is to support Fujitsu's requirement to undertake a proactive ‘internal’ risk assessment, whereby

the report is used initially by Fujitsu to determine and inform its legal position, and act on any gaps, and perform
remediation from the findings.
FUJ00243336
FUJ00243336

Stage 1 & 2 effectively enable Fujitsu to assert the existence of controls, and for KPMG to then test and validate these
assertions based on agreed-upon procedures.

As discussed at the scoping meeting there are two options, which we understand option 1 being the Fujitsu requirement:

Option 1) Review and assess with an initial Fujitsu internal only report on ‘as-is’. This gives Fujitsu the opportunity to
proactively determine exposure and address issues from the findings as a restricted Fujitsu only document.

1.1) A follow-up review/test post any remediation carried out by Fujitsu over the findings. It is this second report that you
could use to issue externally, per your points below, as it would reflect the assured and remediated controls — thus
providing an independent perspective on the integrity of the audit-trail for the system.

Option 2) Only Review, test and report on ‘as-is’. This would not reflect any Fujitsu management action taken to address
any findings.

For both options, should Fujitsu want to waiver its legal privileges regarding the distribution of the deliverable reports
externally and to other parties, this will be subject to agreement of ‘hold harmless’ letters with KPMG. This is because
Fujitsu's requirement in this case is bespoke compared to a SAS70 or ISA3042 equivalent certification and audit opinion,
which can typically be freely distributed by Fujitsu.

Let me know what time suits you to discuss on Monday.

Ervin,

As previously mentioned I aim to come back to you early next week in respect to our points on your proposal
having briefed my stakeholders.

Akey area noted, however, is the restriction on page 3 under heading “Stage Two” that “...Fujitsu will have a
comprehensive report to be used only for its own internal risk and commercial compliance assessment. “

We are primarily commissioning this report in order to inform our legal team, as discussed. However, if we later
choose to waive legal privilege on this document, we would be expect to be able to produce it freely in to other
FUJ00243336
FUJ00243336

auditors, Post Office, in disputes (either between us and Post Office, or where we are supporting Post Office in
defending the integrity of its systems). We appreciate that you will not be expert witnesses, but that is a
separate issue to not being able to use this document for any external purpose. We therefore need to
understand whether this is intended to be a restriction on use of the report, and if so, we need this restriction to
be relaxed and will need to discuss with you how that can be achieved.

Could we please set up a quick call on Monday morning to discuss the intent of this clause?

Thank you.

Hi Mike,
Thanks for the update.

As you would have noted, we have issued the proposal in ‘draft for discussion/comment' to provide you an
opportunity to refine the scope/deliverables if needed.

We've scoped a multi-dimension approach to getting assurance and comfort over the integrity of the data & audit
trail of the system, based on our understanding from our discussions and the updated scoping/ToR document.

We look forward to your approval or feedback in the coming week.
My best,

Ervin,
Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

We need KPMG to define a set of scenarios taking enough to demonstrate robustness of the
overall process. This may be more than the scenarios that we have defined, but need KPMG to.
make this recommendation

The objective is to audit the integrity of the overall basket process. Transaction audits should
not be necessary to achieve this.

Mike

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing

HI Mike,

I hope you had a nice weekend. Just as an update — We're aiming to get the proposal back to you
by this Thursday for your review.

We have a few questions in relation to your updated scoping document:

e Section 1.2 — Scope. In shaping our approach, we will define an agreed-upon
proceedure for the audit. To help guide and size the audit, will Fujitsu have a
mimimun or maximum number of prescirbed transaction types to be tested?

e Section 1.3 — Deliverables: For clarity, Fujitsu have specified the delivery of an ‘ audit
report’ that may be submitted in court to demonstrate adequacy of the controls in place.
As discussed at our scoping meeting, we can provide litigation support, particularly of the
nature in the scope of your requirements. However as external auditors we are restricted
from providing expert witness services, particularly where there is a quantum aspect that
results in us actually self auditing such material values through the external audit.

* Section 3.0 — for clarity, we interpret these scenarios as the ‘test scenarios’ that
may occur stand-alone or in combinations, in which transaction audits need to
be validated against. Is this correct?

In our proposal response we will outline an approach in terms of two iterations of deliverables.
This will enable us to expedite the initial findings audit report for Fujitsu ‘ONLY’ review and action.
With the second iteration reflecting your comments/feedback that will be subject to final risk
review by KPMG such that the final release can be relied-upon.

Many thanks,

Ervin

covers everything you need, but please call out if you believe there is anything
missing.

I have asked Tim Healy to organise countersignature to the NDA and will have
