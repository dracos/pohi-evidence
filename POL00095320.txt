introduction

In this module you will explore how to use the Lotus Notes
Corporate Security Database and access:

* Post Office Investigation Policies, including the Safe Working
Practice Guidelines.

* Risk Assessment Guidelines for Criminal Investigation Procedures.

The Investigation Policies contain the standards and working
practices which underpin the Post Office Group Investigation and
Prosecution Policy. All staff who are authorised to conduct
investigations into crimes or suspected crimes will carry out their
duties in accordance with:

» Post Office Legal Standards for investigation of crime.

+ Post Office Rules relating to the treatment of employees and agents
in accordance with mandatory instructions detailed in the
Investigation Policies.

All the Investigation Policies are contained within the Corporate
Security Database.

As part of the Investigation Policies in the Corporate Security
Database there are the Safe Working Practice Guidelines which
underpin Health & Safety in investigations. The importance of these
Guidelines cannot be overstated. All Security Managers need to
understand these Guidelines and comply with them during their
normal day-to-day work. We shall also look at how the Risk
Assessment Guidelines on Criminal Investigation Procedures help
Security Managers to assess the risks they face while conducting
their duties.

OF course, legislation and Post Office Policy are always evolving and
as such there are always changes in the law, and to the way in which
investigations are conducted. This module also looks at how Security
Managers are notified of such changes.

Building up an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the various
rules and policies will take time; you are not expected to remember
everything just by completing this module. However, what you will
gain from this workbook is a better understanding of where you can
obtain information from, as and when you need it,

Section 1:

This section looks at the Investigation Policies contained within the
Corporate Security Database. It aims to provide you with the
opportunity to become familiar with the layout and structure of the
Database, and how to use it to access information contained within
the various Investigation Policies.

The Corporate Security Database contains Investigation Policies
which are mandatory to all Post Office Security Managers.

The Investigation Policies contain the standards and working
practices which all Security Managers must comply with -- therefore
it is essential you have a good understanding of what they contain.

Before we look at the Investigation Policies in more detail, we shall
spend a few minutes exploring how to use the Corporate Security
Database.

The Corporate Security Database contains a wealth of information
relating to security issues, but we shall focus on just one aspect in
this section — that of the Investigation Policies.

To open the Corporate Security Database you need to double-click on
the following icon on your Lotus Notes Workspace.

POL00095320
POL00095320

This section looks at the responsibilities Security Managers have to
conduct their duties in a safe manner, and in line with our Health &
Safety policies.

Everyone in The Post Office has a responsibility to maintain a safe
working environment in compliance with business Health & Safety
Policy, and Security Managers are not immune from this
responsibility. When conducting inquiries Security Managers:

must take all reasonable steps to ensure their own safety, and that of
their colleagues;

* have a duty of care to ensure the safety of everyone else involved in
inquiries, including suspects and witnesses.

In view of these responsibilities, Safe Working Practice Guidelines
and Risk Assessment Guidelines have been produced to help Post
Office Security Managers to conduct their duties. Both of these
documents can be found in the Corporate Security Database:

« the Safe Working Practice Guidelines can be found in the Rules and
Standards Investigation Policy, Appendix 17;

+ the Criminal Investigations Procedures Risk Assessment Guidelines
can be found in the Standards and Process view of the Database
(which we have not looked at yet).

We shall start by looking at the Safe Working Practice Guidelines.

POL00095320
POL00095320

Section 2:

The Safe Working Practice Guidelines include a number of
mandatory operational requirements, together with advice on existing
good working practices and improved safety procedures.

Security Managers must familiarise themselves with the Guidelines
at Appendix 17 and always seek guidance from their Line Manager,
or a more Senior Manager, in situations with which they are
unfamiliar or where a serious risk has been identified.

‘We will deal with all the Guidelines in this section of the workbook,
with the exception of those relating to Search (Section 3.6 of
Appendix 17), as these are covered in the Search module of this
Security Foundation Programme.

If you have not already done so, print off a copy of the Safe Working
Practice Guidelines (Rules and Standards Investigation Policy,
Appendix 17} now. To do this you will need to follow the procedures
we looked at in Section 1 of this module.

Read this copy (with the exception of Section 3.6 which deals with
Search) and then answer the following questions:

Q7. Who should serve a summons on suspected offenders?

Security Managers who formed part of the
interviewing/search team, rather than a Security
Manager not previously involved with the individual,
should serve the summons.

FEEDBACK

Q8. What action should be taken if a threat is perceived prior to an
interview?

If @ threat situation is perceived either prior to or during
the interview, a third Security Manager should
be made available to cover any temporary absence of the
first or second officer from the interview room.

Q9. How many Security Managers should be present when a
suspect is approached?

Two Security Managers must be present when a suspect,
or @ person who may become a suspect, is first
approached for interview, or where an arrest is intended.

Q10. Where, ideally, should interviews be conducted?

Ideally, interviews should always be conducted on Post
Office premises or at a Police Station,

QI1. Describe what you should do before any surveillance or testing
operation.

The local Police should be informed if carrying out
‘external’ surveillance, including testing operations, as
part of an investigation, in addition to collator checks.
Police advice should be sought on the advisability of
conducting surveillance in the designated area.

Q12. What checks should you carry out before making inquiries with
a person who is a suspect and not a member of staff?

For ‘outsider’ suspects such as this, background checks
of individuals and the locality concerned must be made
with local collators and/or other law enforcement
agencies as a matter of routine before any approach

is made,

The Criminal Investigation Procedures Risk Assessment Guidelines
contain an assessment of the risks which are specific to criminal
investigation work. They detail the control measures designed to
ensure that safe systems of working are followed.

‘The principle is that if Security Managers are already aware of the
areas they are most at risk in, they can take action to avoid the risk
becoming a reality.

These measures are reviewed annually, or where new working
methods are introduced, or in the event that any serious incident
occurs.

Section 2: I

The example on the previous page details the risks Security
Managers are likely to be exposed to while conducting outsider
and out-of-hours enquiries. Three risk areas have been identified:

+ Personal attack from suspects/others

+ Driving — Road Traffic Accident

* Robbery

So, by applying “scores” given in the Risk Assessment Table (taken

from Page 6 of the Criminal Investigation Procedures) below, we can
see that:

» the probability of personal attack from suspects/ others is scored as
a “1” (low risk);

* the outcome is assessed as a “3” (serious injury).

By multiplying the two together we arrive at a risk rating of “3”, .
which indicates that this activity carries a medium risk. -

This module aimed to introduce you to, and provide you with, the
opportunity to become familiar with:

+ Post Office Investigation Policies;

* Safe Working Practice Guidelines and the Risk Assessment
Guidelines.

Both of the above are contained in the Corporate Security Database.

In Section 1 we looked at the Investigation Policies, how they are
structured and the information they contain. We looked in detail at:

« where in the Corporate Security Database the Investigation
Policies are;

+ how the Database is structured:

* how to find your way around the Database.

In Section 2 we looked at Health and Safety in investigations, the
Safe Working Practices Guidelines and the Criminal Investigation
Procedures Risk Assessment Guidelines. These documents have been
produced to help Security Managers to conduct their duties safely.
We again looked at where these documents can be found in the
Corporate Security Database, and provided you with the opportunity
to familiarise yourself with their content.

You will, of course, need to build on the knowledge you have gained
by completing this module, by reading the various Investigation
Policy documents over the coming weeks; and you are again
reminded of the planner on pages 16/17 on to which you can record
those you have read.
