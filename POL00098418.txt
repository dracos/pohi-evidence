Hi Alwen
Paula has asked me to check on a couple of things please:
1. The email below (she believes she did mention this) — please would you draft some words so she can respond as
soon as possible
2. Do you want Paula to check the notes re Mark Russell and the Board Minutes — if so, as she really does need to
take her break this week, shall she ask Chris (or perhaps you've already done that) or are you happy with them
as they are?
t hope you manage to get a good break ~ is it just today or for the rest of the week?
Kind regards

Theresa

Subject: PRINTED Horizon Inquiry and JFSA concerns

Hello Paula,

It is been a while since we met at James Arbuthnot’s office, but at that time you did say that if I had any concerns I
should contact you directly, hence the reason for this email.

Would it be possible for Kay Linnell and I to meet with you? You will recall that Kay is an independent forensic
accountant who, on behalf of JFSA, has been monitoring the work 2" Sight has been undertaking.

The main purpose of the meeting is to ensure that you have been receiving the full details of what has been occurring
with the 2" Sight investigation. Bearing in mind what has been discovered so far, I for one am surprised that we haven’t
yet met to discuss the implications. Whilst I appreciate that the majority of the issues began under previous regimes and
you have expressed a genuine willingness to address the concerns that JFSA has been raising, these issues are still
continuing. I have little doubt that it is now feasible to show that many of the prosecutions that POL have pressed home
should never have taken place, and I believe this is a view shared by Kay.

If you would like to meet with Kay and myself, we could attend an early afternoon meeting on Wednesday 5" June or
could look for a suitable alternative date.

Regards
Alan
