Support Facility shall be co-ordinated such that, for example, changes and faults can
be tracked across Business Capability and Support Facility boundaries.

1.6 Changes to the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities shall be made on the
request of the Release Management Service in accordance with Annex A of the CCD
entitled: “Service Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1 Service Definition

2.1.1 Event & Systems Monitoring

2.1.1.1 The Systems Management Service will provide event and systems monitoring of both
the Branch Infrastructure and HNG-X Central Infrastructure. Events are the
indications of conditions that have operational significance to either the Branch
Infrastructure or the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. They include Software,
Hardware or security conditions that may require investigation and also include
occurrences of particular, repeated events, for example, a low battery in PIN Pads.
Investigations will involve either other relevant Operational Services or a defined
recovery procedure.

Systems Management Service to enable systems monitoring to take place.

Fujitsu Services will ensure that all access to the HNG-X Central Infrastructure will
be by approved scripts that have predetermined functionality. Access is role based
and will be able to be fully audited

Software Distribution

The Systems Management Service will distribute Software to the Branch
Infrastructure and Central Infrastructure in accordance with direction from the
Release Management Service detailed within Annex A of the Contract Controlled
Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Management Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

Where an update to the Branch Infrastructure Software is required, new or updated
Software may need to be deployed and remotely installed across the HNG-X
Telecommunications Infrastructure to a specific Branch, all Branches, or a group of
Branches. The distribution process separates the transfer of Software from its
subsequent installation, thus enabling the installation process to take effect from a
particular date or time. Updated Software can be reversed out.

The Systems Management Service will maintain Software repository management
through the update of a Software inventory database which identifies which Software
versions are stored on the components of the Branch Infrastructure and the HNG-X
Central Infrastructure.

Time Synchronisation

The Systems Management Service provides a time synchronisation service to all of the Branch
Infrastructure and the Central Infrastructure. All platforms have access to an accurate time
source and this access is configured to ensure a consistent date and time across all Branches
This caters for the handling of clock changes at the beginning and end of British Summer

Time.

2.1.4 Operational Change Proposals (OCPs)

2.1.4.1. The Systems Management Service will create and/or impact Operational Change
Proposals (OCPs) for operational changes in accordance with section 2.1.6 of the
CCD entitled: “Service Management Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0007).
