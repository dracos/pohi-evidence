Hello Joe

Thank you for confirming the meeting on Wednesday 17 July 2013 at 09.15, here at Portcullis
House Westminster. Mr Arbuthnot is looking forward to meeting Mr Blagden then.

In case Mr Blagden has not visited Portcullis House before, it is the building opposite Big Ben
whose main entrance faces the Thames on the Victoria Embankment. Visitors go through a
security screening on arrival, n Mr Blagden has cleared this could he please ask staff at
Reception to call extension id we will come down to collect him. These meetings are
arranged subject to Parliamentary business and in the unlikely event this is announced at
short notice I will give you as much warning as I can. It would be very helpful if you could
confirm the best contact number for the day, in case circumstances intervene at the last
minute, and also let me know if Mr Blagden will be accompanied by anyone and if so who
that might be.

If you need any further details, please let me know.

With kind regards

Dear Joe

Thank you for your message with the request from Simon Blagden for a meeting with James
Arbuthnot. Could you let me know if Wednesday 17 July at 09.15, here at Portcullis House
Westminster, might suit? If so, I would be grateful if you could let me know as soon as you
can, so we can get something pencilled in the diary. If this works, I will confirm further
details once I hear back from you.

With kind regards
Susanne

Dear Susanne
Thank you very much indeed for all your help so far.

Further to our conversation earlier, I have now spoken with Mr Blagden. He can be free on
any day next week, except for Monday when he is at Fujitsu’s office in Wakefield — as such,
he can fit in with Mr Arbuthnot’s diary if there is any free time at all between 16-18" July as
he will be in Westminster anyway from what I understand.

I don’t think the type of meeting Mr Blagden is seeking will take more than 20-30 minutes
and he will fit in with whatever time might be convenient; however, I do appreciate that
given the constraints on Mr Arbuthnot’s diary this might not be possible to arrange at such
short notice.

In any case, I really am very grateful for your help and I look forward to hearing from you in
due course.

With best wishes, Joe

Dear Mr Arbuthnot

You kindly met with the CEO of Fujitsu, Duncan Tait, to discuss the company’s extensive
work with the Ministry of Defence and associated agencies back in 2011 at the party
conference.

I am now contacting you on behalf of Simon Blagden, Fujitsu’s Non-Executive Chairman. Mr
Blagden would like to talk to you about the recent MoD White Paper which outlines the next
stages in the move to transform DE&S and, more specifically, to discuss some of the
implications for the private sector of the ‘GOCO’ model as currently set out.

I wonder if you might be willing to discuss these points with Mr Blagden at a time of your
convenience in Westminster?

I look forward to hearing from you.
With best wishes
Joe Moor
