Hi Chris
As discussed last night please find attached draft letter for the SoS to approve to send to CX. Glenn
has commented on this draft.

You will wish to be aware that official level feedback from HMT has indicated that they are
considering fully funding Budget announcements on both EFG and SSI. You will recall that they had
been indicating to us that they would be requesting that we fund these announcements from within
our current budgets, simply adding to BEIS pressures. HMT officials have told us that in line with the
Chief Secretary’s ‘operating principle’ they will be continuing to ask us to fund POL.

I do not think the above information changes things materially in relation to this draft letter and POL.
Firstly, the SoS sees POL as a shared inherited pressure. And even with EFG and SSI funding there are
still residual BEIS pressures including POL of £230m and £109m in 18/19 and 19/20 respectively.
These would require significant savings and tough choices.

More than happy to discuss.
Kind regards
David

Importance: High

Tom, Caleb

Given we are still yet to receive a Budget settlement letter, Alex has asked for your advice on whether
he (or SoS) should write to HMT along the lines of the following:

e As you know from previous correspondence back in [July?] we haven't got the money for
POL

e POL are expecting a decision to Budget timeframe

e The case presented by UKGI has support from both of our officials

e We've examined BEIS’ budgets and given other pressures it remains the case that we are
unable to fund POL. All the more the case given the two new items announced at last week's
Budget which are unfunded and were not discussed in advance with my officials.

e Welcome your thoughts on how you propose to proceed

I understand that HMT advice is due to go to CST imminently. Do you think a letter from Alex/SoS
would help or hinder progress?

Alex is meeting SoS later this afternoon, so grateful for a response ASAP pls. To note, I may need to
commission a draft along these lines quickly afterwards.

Alex
Just a quick update on a couple of points.

SoS is planning to call Cx tonight on the issue of the scale up programme. So we’ ll see what
happens with that and I’ll let you know the outcome.

No 10 have been asking about whether POL funding could be brought forward to the current
financial year. They think that might help with a solution.

Tom and David have been looking at this. The spending scores when it it is spent by POL not
when it is given to them so this is unlikely to be a solution that helps HMT and there are other
issues - payment in advance of need and the need for state aid clearance. If we could bring
other spending forward that would be an alternative but the scope for that appears limited to
the low tens of millions.

I thought worth you being aware in case JJH is in touch over the weekend.

Caleb
