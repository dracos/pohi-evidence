We can include a covering message acknowledging difficult Christmas trading, which we will talk more specifically
about to Postmasters in the New Year.

I recommend that showing progress over the year with the thank you message is valid and important.

We can remove the link to the video from the message if you prefer (and have that solely on the One website).

Whilst this has a jolly theme and positive messages it is going to land on some on the worst Christmas trading that
Postmasters have ever experienced.

There is no acknowledgement of how bad it is or that we know they are struggling...

I am deeply concerned this missing the mood of the front line by about a zillion miles.

We will be sending Festive Greetings from the Board to Postmasters tomorrow to thank them for all of their work
serving customers and communities.

Similar to last year, the ‘card’ includes some key highlights from the year and is complemented by this short video:
