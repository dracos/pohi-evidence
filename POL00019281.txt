John

The case is a prosecution for theft of over £53k by removing cash from PO stock and putting it into his
bank account. The defendant admits theft. In my view it was clearly in the public interest to prosecute at
the time advice was given and remains so. If we were to take any other view such a stance could cause
us difficulties in relation to other prosecutions.

I cannot see anything in the MP's letter other than mitigation.
Let me know if you require any other information

“Lewis

Mike.

Please find attached a letter from the Rt Hon Elfyn Llywd, MP, in regards to Post Office Security
prosecuting one of his constituents (Mr Lewis) and requesting that we discontinue.

The letter is being forwarded to the Chairman’s Office, so is likely to become a flag case.

l'll ensure that the case and prosecution is reviewed and that any future action taken is appropriate and
proportionate, although you can see the initial assessment from Rob Wilson below.

We'll arrange a holding letter in the mean time before formally responding with the outcome.
Regards.

John.

see from the associated summons the allegation in this case concerns the theft of over £53,000.

My current instructions are that not all of the money has in fact been repaid. My understanding
is that a total of £18,104.75 has been paid and that in any event despite the comments made in
the letter that this case in the public interest to prosecute.

Bearing in mind that this letter has come from an MP and has been forwarded to the Chairman, I
have copied the correspondence to you and will be grateful if my instructions could be confirmed

in due course.

If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me at this Office.

Yours faithfully
