ExCo Meeting 22 October

- Actions and Decisions

22/10/06

Action 4

Maypole
Need to return to ExCo for final sign off of the approach and

delivery plan. Use the ExCo subgroup for governance.

Update: DWP have advised that they would like to make a
joint announcement in December although BIS are pushing
for an earlier announcement.

Discussions with DWP about the future of POca have
moved on since the presentation to ExCo in the autumn.
DWP decision-making was slower than expected and POL
did not receive feedback on its proposed approach until a
meeting of officials in January. At this meeting, DWP
confirmed a replacement service (“POca2”) was needed and
Post Office Ltd was asked to develop a costed proposal to
be presented to DWP on 20" March. A subsequent meeting
of DWP Secretary of State (SoS) with BIS SoS and the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury took place in late January and
was inconclusive (although the need for a future service
was acknowledged).

A degree of scepticism has emerged from discussions with

NK, KS

Ongoing (on
ExCo agenda)

POL00027423
POL00027423

DWP and in particular HMT officials about whether NS&I will
truly offer the best ‘value for money’ (this is obviously
surprising given that NS&I is an executive agency of HMT).
In addition, our state aid discussions have recently
commenced and it is clear that scrutiny of how the future
service is procured will extend to our suppliers. These
issues may affect our decision to appoint NS&I directly with
the implication that Post Office now needs to plan for
possibility of having to run a public procurement for the
new supplier.

The Maypole Project is continuing to focus on developing a
proposal for DWP by the 20 March deadline, taking due
consideration of the procurement risks outlined. As agreed
with the Board, the ExCo sub-group is being used for
governance and will be the approval route before
submission.

22/10/08

Action 6

Maypole

Carry out a contract comparison between the existing POCA

Action 5

Horizon

Include a risk assessment of introducing the local’s model in the

Update 5” Feb: All post office operating models are included in
the Business Improvement Programme considerations. Each of
the 9 work streams that make up BIP will detail their future state
implementation and milestone plan by end of Feb 2014. A
further update can be given in March.

Update 12th March - the milestone plans have been
developed to include all post office models. These plans
will be reviewed in detail over the next few weeks to ensure
the new ways of working accommmodate the variances of
each of the models.
