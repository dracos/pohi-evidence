Andy,

I have just been discussing with Rod — he felt this would be worth getting Brian Altman to provide advice on. Not sure if

this will be possible ahead of the Working Group?

Martin

Thanks for the advice below.

POL would prefer to avoid leaving the WG with a "yes / no" decision on whether to mediate a criminal case or not. To that
end, we are considering the idea of holding a face to face meeting with the "criminal" applicants to the Scheme rather than
mediating. This allows POL to frame the meeting differently — for example, we could setup the meeting to "explain POL's

findings" rather than "settle" disputes, and make clear that no compromise is being offered.

POL have asked me to get your view on whether the criminal risk is different for this type of meeting rather than
mediating? If POL were to go down this route, please could you also advise on what steps / measures it could take to
further reduce any risk (eg. letters setting out the basis for the meeting, criminal lawyers at the meeting, etc.).

Please bear in mind that POL are going to get pushed hard on this topic by JFSA / Tony Hooper so your advice needs to
be very robust. We may need to set up a meeting / call with you and POL so that they can test your thinking.

I'd be grateful you could provide the advice by close tomorrow. It would be useful if it could again include some speaking
notes.

If you need more context, please feel free to give me a call. Best on the mobile as I'm travelling a lot today.

Kind regards
Andy
