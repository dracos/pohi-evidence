Thanks for this.

I can’t seem to print pages 61 to 69 inclusive (Appendix 4, Engagement letter) because of the image size.

Any chance you could have another go? I can print it out from my original copy, but then it would have the “x” on
those pages.

Also, I’m attaching the Board Report. Could you do the same with that?

Thanks, Rod

Rodric

Please find attached a covering letter to the CCRC based on the letter that went with Brian's advice.

Also attached is a copy of the Deloitte report that I've marked in the bottom left corner with a X on every page so we'll
be able to track this document if it is leaked. I've also stripped out Deloitte's security so you can now copy text from
this version (don’t tell Deloitte!)

I don't have a copy of the Deloitte board report — do you have it?

Kind regards
Andy
