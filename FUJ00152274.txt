1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Within the Fujitsu Services domain for July 07 there were no Major Incidents or service affecting incidents, 3
incidents relating to VIP sites and one further service affecting incident outside the Fujitsu domain. Details are
given in the Incident Overview below.

There was a continuation of the severe weather conditions across the UK, leading to increasing call volumes in
some areas, a noticeable increase of branches with services unavailable at the start of each business day and
associated difficulties in resolving some calls. As in June, those outlets without communications have returned
to service and the number failing has been under the set threshold by 09.15 each morning.

Branch and counter availability continue to remain above target at 99.7% and 99.4% respectively. Despite this,
service levels on A & C priority engineering calls have fallen this month. In part this was affected by the call
profiles due to the extreme weather conditions, but poor call & resources management continue to cause too
many issues. Performance and commercial negotiations are in hand to correct this trend and agree achievable
targets.

Only 75 OBC changes were delivered in the month, with 3 combined failures resulting in a failure of the joint
target of 2%. Corrective actions are in place to address these and the adoption of the joint target is proving to
be a useful approach.

The Epson printers are now installed on more than two thirds of counters. The number of incoming calls for the
Ithaca printers has reduced accordingly, and the new print cartridges for the Epsons have been trialled
successfully. Although there are still a high number of incoming calls for those printers yet to have the new
cartridges installed, over 80% of these are resolved at the desk, and only 8% have needed the printer to be
changed.

The revised complaints process is continuing to prove useful, ensuring that Fujitsu have full sight of any
complaints relating to the service. No overall total received was passed over from POL, but 99 were passed to
Fujitsu for investigation, with 36 deemed justified after investigation. The rise in the number of complaints was
attributed to chases for ETAs for calls during the peak volume periods. Corrective actions are identified and
implemented against all justified complaints.

The profile of the Service Improvement Plan continues to be raised, and the significant areas are covered in the
Service Review Book. Additional focus will be placed on this going forward, in balance with the reporting of
historical service performance.

2 Incident Overview

Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for July 2007,
There were no Major Incidents.
There was no Service Affecting Incident.
There were 3 incidents affecting VIP sites.

There was one service affecting incident outside of the Fujitsu domain.

NB. There was a continuation of the severe weather across the UK
during July. This included storms and also flooding and caused several
branches to temporarily close. However by 09.15 hrs each morning, the
number of outlets without comms was under threshold.

Major Incidents:

None
Other incidents in Fujitsu None
Services domain:
VIP sites affected this Tuesday 3% July. VIP site Belfast City 011704, Gateway failed at
month: 10:28. Gateway replaced, branch services restored at 13:50. Call E-

0707030356 refers.

Wednesday 4" July. VIP site Liverpool St Johns 002420. Gateway
failed at 09:18. Gateway replaced, branch services restored at 11:16.
Call E-0707040153 refers.

Monday 16" July. VIP site Ashton-under-Lyme lost power due to staff
activity from 14:50 to 16:00. Power reset restored service. Call E-
0707160765 refers.

Incidents that were outside On Saturday 28" July, there was an incident that caused the loss of

the Fujitsu Domain: online satellite services to 55 outlets from 08.00 to 10.20 hrs. This was
caused by an unknown source transmitting on BT’s reserved frequency.
As this is the second incident of its kind, FJ requested BT to provide an
improvement plan to prevent further recurrence.

This was taken up with BT, by the Network SDM. In response, BT stated
that the only possible corrective action would be to change frequency.
BT stated that as any network frequency is vulnerable to intrusion, a
change of frequency would still be vulnerable to similar infiltration.

We are monitoring the situation with BT even though immediate action
is not thought to be the way forward.

Call E-0707280001 refers.

3 Business Continuity

3.1 Business Continuity Testing

On Wednesday and Thursday 4th and 5" of July the Outlet Change Management Service operational
test was successfully conducted.

On Sunday 22" of July the partial operational retest for the Data-centre LAN Catalyst (test 6.2) was
successfully conducted.

During July procedural walk-throughs were successfully conducted for the Reference Data
Management Centre (test 9) and the Database Server (test 2).

3.2 Forthcoming Testing

Due to the Data-centre LAN Catalyst operational re-test being conducted on the 22” of July the
Generic Agent (test 7) has been rescheduled for Sunday 12" of August.

Procedural walk-throughs are planned for:
The Key Management Service (test 19) on the 8” of August;
The Web Services (Test 26) on the 15" of August;
The NBX Client Interfaces (test 22) on the 22" of August.

It is provisionally planned that if the Service Support Manager is in Belfast during August he will
conduct the SOS operational test (test 11).

3.3 Business Continuity Planning

The first drafts of the HNG-X Business Continuity Framework and the HNG-X Operational Test Plan
have been checked into the Dimensions document library for internal Fujitsu Services review. Work
also continued on the development of the HNG-X Services Business Continuity plans.

3.4 Business Continuity Incidents and Issues

On the evening of Sunday 22" of July an incident occurred at the electrical sub-station providing power
to the Wigan Data-centre, which resulted in the loss of mains supply. Horizon service continued
unaffected through the Data-centre’s Uninterruptible Power Supply and Generator.

Further progress has been made on the commissioning of the LST rig in the LEW02 Disaster Recovery
site. The LST ‘data implementation phase’ has been completed and LST are now verifying and
confidence checking the system.

4 Complaints

Commentary
During July there were 99 complaints logged about Fujitsu Services. The breakdown was

57 in connection with engineering services, 34 of which were justified
23 in connection with online services, one of which was justified
18 in connection with HSD, one of which was justified

1 in connection with OBC and not justified

Compared with June, a 50% increase in engineering service complaints was observed. The reasons for
complaints are detailed below.

A separate spreadsheet is available containing remedial actions for justified complaints. These are also
added to the CSIP register and discussed at the respective ORFs.

Engineer Complaints:

The majority of complaints were caused by issues with ETAs and the expectation set with PMs. The
situation was worsened due to the impact the adverse weather had on the number of calls carried over
in the work in progress count.

The desk attended a presentation on the 9" August which included broken ETA’s, complaints received
and the impact to the customer. The importance of owning the calls/ expectation and stepping into the
customers shoes was re-iterated. The presentation will be re-used for new starters to ensure the desk
is as in tune with the customer as possible.

Any isolated engineer attitude problems have been taken up with the engineers in question, and where
necessary are being performance managed.

HSD: The one justified complaint was a branch (FAD 183647) that had a scales calibration issue. The
process for resolution is to apply a software patch followed by a full swap of Gateway/Monitor/Adaptor.
The software patch has been applied and the hardware replacement is scheduled. This is being
managed by the BIM South.

Online Services: The one justified complaint against online services was in relation to an intermittent
satellite issue. This occurred when FJ moved the satellite service from HOT to BT. The corrective
action involved BT making a minor adjustment to their satellite in Turin.

5 Service Summary

5.1 Horizon Service Desk

The HSD saw a slight increase in the number of calls from Post Office Branches logged during July, with 16,404
calls to the Helpdesk, compared with 16,123 in June. The figure is slightly above the average for the last nine
months. As per June, July’s calls were subject to the severe weather across the UK with flooding and lightning
strikes. The projected call volume for the complete month of August — based on the first 9 working days — shows
an overall reduction in the Hardware, Network and Software call totals. This is as expected following the
improvement in the weather.

- Both Software and Networks Calls show a slight reduction compared with June.
- Hardware calls show a slight increase

5.2 Engineering Service
July 07 has seen call volumes remain just under 6000 with 733 A Priority calls in this period.

With two thirds of the live estate counter printers now Epson, a significant drop in Ithaca visits has resulted. The
combined visits are down by 506 this month.

Compared to June, July has seen a decrease in A and C priority SLT conformance. The A priority calls fixed
within four hours fell from 80.4% to 71.9% and the six hour from 88.1% to 82.4%. Conformance on C priority next
day calls showed final figures of 89.8%, a decrease of 1.5% on the previous month which came in at 91.3%. Next
Day +2 hours on C priorities reached 90.7% conformance after being 92.2% in June.

The drop in SLT performance was caused by a number of factors. The adverse weather and prolonged flooding
resulted in a tail of calls that impacted subsequent day’s SLT performance. This was is in addition to the carry
over from the weather issues experienced in June. The impact of weather had a detrimental effect on engineer
productivity, and hence SLT conformance. These issues were compounded by certain resource areas where
there were some challenges in the field. The strain on the desk resulted in an adverse effect on their performance
in prioritising calls as well as their long term training plans. We have been working proactively together to drive
the oldest work in progress down on a daily basis, and the tail is now eradicated. We are already seeing
improvements in this month's SLT performance.

The automatic SLA expiry time generator caused a couple of issues due to incorrect information in the RDMC
database, and a source code error which is being corrected. This problem understandably contributed to the fails.
A macro tool is being designed that will provide a more accurate Auto SLA by taking the access times from the
PM and ignoring the data in the RDMC database. This will have a positive impact on conformance and accurate
information provided to the desk. Base unit builds continue to be the highest single point of failure when we
attend A priority calls.

Compared to June, there was a slight increase in fail on fits across the products, with the exception of Pin Pads,
and BCRs. The reduction in Pin Pad FOF can be attributed to getting engineers to re-install rather than replace.
The increases will be taken up with the suppliers and investigated on our side. This would increase the time the
engineer spends on site, and could subsequently impact calls allocated for later in the day as allocated stock
would no longer be available for use.

We are having commercial discussions with our engineering supplier to ensure that any supplier contracts
support our end to end SLT. Currently we have some SLT timing challenges in this area. The initial commercial
proposal is expected by 47" August for discussion.

A new single set of reporting will be phased in this week allowing closer performance management. The weekly
reviews of failure points will continue and feed into the Service Improvement Plan. Time will be spent with the
desk to understand immediate issues, and provide training to the team. Fujitsu has provided additional POA
training to our engineer service help desk. This has been well received, and will continue on an ongoing basis.

Calls logged by branches which resulted in an on-site visit from an engineer were down on July 2006 despite the
overall increase in incoming hardware calls to HSD.

Despite the challenges of adverse weather, July has again seen all counter availability targets met with branch
availability at 99.71% and counter availability at 99.36%. This equates to 41 out of 13983 branches and 220 out
of 34325 counters being unavailable during the month.

5.3. Branch Network Services / Central Network

5.3.1. Branch Network Services
During July there were 1,086 calls logged across all Network Types into the HSD.

SLTs

The ‘Priority A - 6 hours’ SLT saw 15 failures from a total of 1,086 closed calls measured, resulting in 98.6%
achievement. This is the highest achievement to date. A contributing factor to the SLT conformance miss can
be attributed to volume of incidents that require investigation outside of the Incident Management process, thus
requiring extensive investigation from Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd under Problem Management. Many of
these calls require assistance from POL for BT retail investigation which causes undue delay in resolution.

Other issues in July

We are still investigating an issue with the VSAT solution with current Investigation and assistance from Core ISP
and BT.

July continued as June left off with poor weather, Flash floods assisted in maintaining higher then expected call
volume. This is expected to reduce over the next couple of months as weather patterns return to normal.

We are also investigating a process with BTW which may result in a vast reduction in calls requiring escalation to
POL and BT Retail visits. If this process is successful it is hoped that the standard fault process can be
shortened with significant reduction for “problem faults’. At present this process is under trial and is being
monitored for its effectiveness. The new process reduces the requirement of referring to POL where the fault is
believed to be requiring the assistance of BT Retail. Preliminary results are good however the trial has only been
running for 1 week is still in its initial phase.

5.3.2 Central Network

BT’s VSAT broadband platform manager and lead engineer visited the Skylogic Skypark in Turin on Thursday
26th July to investigate the high level of major incidents. They conducted a Systems Audit for which there were
no recommendations identified. They conducted a Service Management Audit for which there were 6
recommendations identified which are being carefully considered prior to implementation.

The Datacentre LAN, Central WAN, IPStream and ISDN VPOP networks were again extremely stable. This
month the data warehouse reported the fastest average network banking transaction time at 0.35 seconds within
the Fujitsu domain. This follows 6 months at 0.36 seconds and the previous 4 months at 0.37 seconds.

7 Sense & Respond

Due to the timescales around production of the Sense & Respond data and analysis, the information in the SRB
will always be for the previous month. The full Sense & Respond report is issued separately.

The data captured during June has highlighted the top 2 highest demand types as being Hardware and Software.
Trend analysis has shown an increase in total call volume for Hardware (+706) and a decrease for Software calls
(-225) from May to June.

During June, the HSD fixed 63% of calls received (11923) and this represented a slight decrease of 1.6% of total
calls from May.

For networking calls, a focus has been made to track ADSL and ISDN call volumes and the mean time to clear.
Trending has highlighted a decrease in call volume from May to June for ASDL (-181) calls however an increase
of ISDN calls (+154). We are changing the CMT desk structure to try and improve our mark clear time for all of
the calls by having more agents available for problem-fixing/diagnostics side of the team when we have the white
space on the reporting side of the team.

For Pin Pad errors, Hypercom have revised the HSD KELs to help frontline diagnostics/fixes. Due to a high
number of no fault found parts being returned to Hypercom repairs, HSD will now be advising engineers to
attempt a re-installation of the Pin Pad before swapping it out. The expected benefit of this initiative would be to
increase HSD first time fix on Pin Pad calls and also decrease downtime of a Pin Pad for the customer. The
volume of engineer 'No Fault founds’ could also be reduced.

desk worked along side Hypercom in reducing their incoming call demand by introducing remote tool:
S and saw a decrease in call demand. A future action will be to hold discussions with the

ervice desk to identify potential Best Practice for reducing pin pad calls.

For hardware demand, the highest call volume received is Counter Printer faults (approximately 5000 calls
received in June). Epson counter printer calls have increased this month due to the known ‘Blank receipts’ issue,
the root cause is under investigation by Epson.

The current HSD resolution is to perform multiple cleaning tests. HSD's first time fix rate for the Epson's remains
high. In July HSD received 2856 Epson printer calls, HSD were able to resolve 1066 of them. 317 were resolved
by performing a self clean test. Multiple self clean tests (usually 2-3 are needed) take about 1 Minute for HSD to
complete and resolve.

Another area of focus is regarding chase/repeat calls. Investigation has highlighted there is an even split between
A99 repeat calls and C45 repeat calls. Base unit A99 calls are the highest demand, while C45 calls are caused
by counter printer Issues.

An additional objective regarding engineering calls is to reduce the amount of calls to HSD from Touch, Fujitsu
and ROMEC engineers. Engineering call volumes have increased during June and we will monitor this volume
during July to see if the trend continues.

A project monitoring Inappropriate calls between the HSD and NBSC desks has achieved its objective of
reducing the number of calls between the desks from 10% to 5%. The team will continue to monitor the
inappropriate call volumes and ensure monthly communication is maintained between the HSD and NBSC desks.
