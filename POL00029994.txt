Assuming Rob's additions are the underlined elements, I'm not keen on the final sentence.

T have reworded this wording -

.4 Access to databases/ servers. In line with standard IT practice at all organizations: There are a
small number of persons at Fujitsu (not Post Office) who have special permissions to access and
edit, within strict controls, the databases and servers that sit behind Horizon. Use of these
permissions is logged and so there would be an audit trail of any activity undertaken using these
permissions. Importantly, given that the audit log is hardware encrypted (TBC with FJ) it is not
even possible for those with super user access to alter the audit trails of access. Enquiries are
continuing as to whether this access could be used to affect a branch's accounts but we currently
understand that, if this is possible, it would be a difficult and time consuming process. We
believe, given the above methods open to Post Office to deal with errors in a branch's accounts.
the use of this access to amend a branch's accounts would be rare however Post Office is making
enquiries as to whether it has ever happened.

Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion on our call at
6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

POL-0026476
POL00029994
POL00029994

1. In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to hopefully
present this issue in a better light.

2. Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing with this point
candidly, even if that does cause some short-term pain.

3. We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation issues on this
topic. We therefore need to be careful not to overstate our case. This draft wording will also
need to be run past Deloitte / FJ.

Kind regards
Andy
