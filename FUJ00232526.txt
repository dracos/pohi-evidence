General

The Transaction Benchmark Service defines a benchmarked standard for the
counter system components used by certain specified Applications and transaction
types.

Service Principles

General

Benchmark evaluation will at all times be carried out in accordance with the
document entitled “Counter Transaction and Benchmarking Methodology”
(CS/PRP/001).

Benchmark evaluations and findings shall be auditable at all stages of measurement.

Benchmark activities will be supported by full documentation identifying
methodology, application and results obtained.

The parties shall review and evaluate the use of system diagnostic tools to measure
counter system component timings and these tools will be introduced where
agreed

The contracted counter system component times and the latest benchmark times
for those Applications identified in paragraph 3.1.2 shall be the system component
times forming part of the counter transaction benchmark target times detailed in
the contract controlled documents: CS/PRP/011, CS/PRP/013, and CS/PRP/014.

The contracted aggregate counter system component time for each NBS
transaction type are as detailed in the CCD entitled “NBS definition”
(BP/SPE/035). Following the benchmark review relating to the introduction of
NBS, the contracted aggregate counter system component time for each NBS
transaction type together with the related benchmark time shall be recorded in a
contract controlled document.

Following each benchmark review the new benchmark times shall replace the
previous benchmark times in the appropriate document identified in paragraphs
2.1.5 or 2.1.6. This shall be done in accordance with paragraph 3.1.11.

3.0 Service Definition

3.1.5

This Transaction Benchmarking Service comprises the activities described in this
paragraph 3.

Benchmark evaluation of counter system component times within the Applications
below:

e Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS),
e Automated Payments Service (APS), and
e Order Book Control Service (OBCS).

Benchmark evaluation of counter system component times for the Network
Banking Service (NBS) transaction types.

Benchmark review, including analysis evaluation to determine the impact of each
major release on

3.1.4.1 counter system component timings for each of the Applications
identified in paragraphs 3.1.2; and

3.1.4.2. counter system component aggregate timings for the NBS transaction
types.

This review activity shall happen prior to implementation of that major release, in
accordance with the plan for that release.

Comparison of the outcomes of the benchmark review (described in paragraph
3.1.4 above) against counter system component contractual times (see paragraph
2.1.5) and the previous benchmark times (see paragraph 2.1.7) for those
Applications identified in paragraph 3.1.2. Analysis evaluation shall be performed
in respect of adverse variances shown by this comparison.

Comparison of the outcome of the benchmark review against contracted counter
system component aggregate timings (see paragraph 2.1.6) and the previous
benchmark aggregate times (see paragraph 2.1.7) for each NBS transaction type.
Analysis evaluation shall be performed in respect of all variances shown by this
comparison.

As part of the Transaction Benchmark Service Fujitsu Services shall present
detailed results of the benchmark reviews to Post Office prior to release
authorisation.

Where benchmark counter system component timings for the Applications
identified in paragraph 3.1.2 are greater than the contractual target times, this shall

be deemed a “Benchmark Time Discrepancy”. Save as described under paragraph
3.1.10 below, a Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not constitute a Default.

Where benchmark system component aggregate timings against each NBS
transaction type are greater than the contractual target times, this shall be deemed
a “Benchmark Time Discrepancy”. Save as described under paragraph 3.1.10
below, a Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not constitute a Default.

In the event of Benchmark Time Discrepancy the following provisions shall apply:

3.1.10.1 The Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree (such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld) a method of rectification, including a
timetable, (a “TBS Rectification Plan”) for each Benchmark Time
Discrepancy (which plan may involve the agreement of an adjustment to
the contractual target times). If that TBS Rectification Plan requires
changes to be made to the provisions of this Agreement (including any
CCD), such changes shall be made pursuant to the Hard Change
Control Procedure. Any changes to the Horizon Service Infrastructure
required to rectify a Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall be made at no
charge to the Post Office.

3.1.10.2 Each Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not be a Default unless within
90 days after the identification of that Benchmark Time Discrepancy the
Parties have failed to reach agreement upon a TBS Rectification Plan
and the Benchmark Time Discrepancy has not been rectified by Fujitsu
Services, in which case that Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall become
a Default upon expiry of that 90 day period.

3.1.10.3 A failure by Fujitsu Services to comply with a TBS Rectification Plan
shall be a Default.

3.1.10.4 This paragraph 3.1.10 shall be without prejudice to Post Office’s rights
with respect to release authorisation.

The update of contractual documentation showing counter system component
times shall be performed after the introduction of a major release, or the
completion of a TBS Rectification Plan where applicable.

4.0 Service Availability

The Transaction Benchmark Service will be available during the hours 9:00 to 17:30 Monday
to Friday inclusive excluding Bank Holidays throughout periods when activities associated
with the introduction of a major release are scheduled.
