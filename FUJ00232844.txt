SUBMISSION TO POST OFFICE DATE: 4'* March 2022

SUMMARY OF WORK:

Post Office require additional Horizon data to be made available to their Security team for
their use when dealing with remote access to Branch counters by the Fujitsu Services Support
team. In addition to the data in the ISMF monthly management report, Post Office would like
a weekly report on all remote access made by the Fujitsu Services support users to Post
Office Branch counter systems.

The report will be shared by Fujitsu Services SecOps on a weekly basis via HORIce and consist
of the following detail:

- Summary title

- Date and time of access

- Branch code

- Node

- Command Request

- Command Result

- Post Office ServiceNow reference number (where available)

- Rig (i.e. Live or RDT Counters)

Reporting will be carried out 1 week in arrears and will be provided on the first working day
of each week. It will be delivered in PDF format and will show a week’s worth of counter
access logs for the period Monday - Sunday.

The production of this report will be incorporated into the Management Information Service
(MIS), added into section 2.1.6 ‘Reporting for Information Only’ of the MIS Service
Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0016). A CCN will be produced to formalise the updates to this
ccD.

This CWO covers the effort to develop and test this report, and 3 months of ongoing
production of this report following CWO approval. Provision of the report beyond this 3-
month period will be covered as part of the ongoing MIS.
