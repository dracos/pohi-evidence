“The number of system errors identified, by year, that could affect branch accounts together with
the number of branches that were affected and were capable of being affected by these errors,
together with reasons”

From the data that is still available to Fujitsu (i.e. since 2010), it has been able to identify 4 system
errors that could have affected a branch’s accounts. These are listed, in sequential order, below:

1.

The ‘Receipts Payment Issue’ or ’62 Branch Anomaly’ as referred to at paragraph 6.5 of
Second Sight’s July2013 Interim Report. Although it was an error that was capable of
affecting the entire estate, as it was identified by Fujitsu in September 2010 during the pilot
phase of HNGX, it affected only 62 branches.

The ‘Local Suspense Issue’ or ‘14 Branch Anomaly’ as referred to at paragraph 6.6 of Second
Sight’s July 2013 Interim Report. Although it was an error that was capable of affecting the
entire estate, it only affected 14 branches, as it was as a result of a change in archiving
process (which replicated historic accounting entries in the 2010/11 financial year in the
accounts for 2011/12 and 2012/13).

The ‘TC anomaly’, whereby, following a counter release on 29.06.2015, issued TCs became
accepted whether the branch pressed “accept” or “cancel”. Although this anomaly was
capable of affecting all branches from 29.06.2015 until 13.09.2015, at which point the
change was reversed via a ‘hotfix’, very few calls were received from branches during the
incident, which led to 7 cases being looked into for root cause analysis

The ‘Branch Outreach Issue’. Further detail has on this issue has been provided in the
‘Outreach BLE Extract Findings V6 091215’ Presentation. It is only capable of affecting
Postmasters who run Core and Outreach branches (c.500). An audit has revealed that there
have been 112 occurrences over the past 5 years, 108 of which were corrected at the time by
either as TC or the Postmaster performing a Reversal. 2 of the 4 outstanding occurrences are
still being investigated, jointly by Fujitsu and FSC, with the other 2 occurrences amounting to
discrepancies of a £1 and 1p, which were written off.
