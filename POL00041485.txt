Subject: Postmaster Litigation - Update tomorrow morning CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE - DO NOT

FORWARD.
Attachments: Board briefing re Postmaster Litigation CMC Options v4.docx

All

Following the discussion on Monday morning, we have now produced the attached paper which sets out the rationale
for the proposed strategy of addressing as a priority the question of the proper construction of the postmaster contract.

Included in the paper is the summary of options which we discussed on Monday (Appendix 1), as well as a summary of
the duties which Freeths seek to imply, and the possible actions that Post Office could take as a result of an adverse
decision (Appendix 2).

I would then propose to use the paper as speaking notes at the Board on Tuesday to explain the rationale for the
decision.

Kind regards,

Jane
