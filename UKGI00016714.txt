3 Post Office Ltd strategic plan update

The Post Office is meeting the Government's policy requirements regarding the
size and accessibility of the network, and has started its network modernisation
programme well with interim (2012/13) targets met; but an anticipated slowing in
engagement with the programme by subpostmasters is requiring a change in
Strategy.

Background

3.1 POL is funded by a 4-year £1.34bn agreement for the period 2010/11 —
2014/15. £750m is subsidy to protect provision of post office services across
the network of >11,500 branches; and £585m is funding to transform POL and
its network.
3.2

3.3

3.4

3.5

UKGI00016714
UKGI00016714

The most visible element is Network Transformation (NTP), developed in 2010
as a voluntary strategy to transform the network by moving c.10,000 branches
to new models (c.6,000 by 2014/15). This was a response to commercial

challenges, and sought to make POL more flexible and financially sustainable.

The 4-year funding only enabled implementation of NTP to 2014/15 and the
conversion 6,000 branches. It was always envisaged POL would seek funding
for a final phase of NTP and for a continuation of the network subsidy.

To date 2,113 subpostmasters have signed contracts to convert their post
offices of which 1,287 have opened as new models. Benefits are already
emerging.

POL sales have risen by c.10% and costs are reduced and are more
flexible.

Subpostmasters benefit from >10% higher retail sales and footfall.

Customers see opening hours c.70% longer and better branch
environments.

This year conversions have fallen below target and this trend is expected to
continue. Subpostmasters are remaining on fixed and higher cost contracts
rather than converting to variable pay models (i.e. where more of their income
is at risk) due to the uncertain economic and commercial environments being
experienced. These environments are weaker than was envisaged in 2010/11.

Proposed changes to NTP approach

3.6

3.7

POL has been working with the National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP)
to develop a new approach to NTP, and is close to agreeing a deal. This
includes:

Completes the transformation of the network by 2017/18 ensuring the
post office network is fit-for-purpose and responsive to customers’ needs.

Protects post offices that are unviable under the new operating model
(e.g. those in deep rural areas). These Community branches have access
to a dedicated £20m investment fund (e.g. to improve layout).

Reduces HMG subsidy funding required by POL from the £200m it
receives today to £70m by 2017/18 (i.e. the end of NTP) and £50m by
2019/20. This reduced subsidy will be focused on maintaining service

provision to Community branches (i.e. to ensure access criteria can be
met).

Establishes a firm foundation for a mutualisation. Some workstreams
(e.g. cultural change and stakeholder engagement) are underway today.

This new proposal has been assessed by ShEx and KPMG and is considered
to be an effective and deliverable strategic plan as it:

Has NFSP support and a clear strategy to manage possible public
concerns.

Has a detailed delivery plan, developed by POL, its advisers and the NFSP.
Ensures the same commercial and financial objectives are maintained.

Reduces HMG funding needed to maintain the network of >11,500
branches.

44 The R&AC has received very positive feedback from attendees both on the
presenting teams and also from members of the committee about how the
meetings have helped to provide both valuable advice and challenge to those
involved. Feedback from ExCo has also been positive and they feel more
sighted on the risks of the different projects being undertaken by ShEx. ShEx
is also fully plugged into the BIS risk process which is currently under review
and will ensure the outcomes are reflected in any ShEx process.
