SUBJECT: - Investigation Ref: - POLTD/1112/0045 - Littleton Road / Mr Patel

The Financial Investigation has now been concluded.

The Sub Postmaster, Mr Chirag Rajendra PATEL was reinstated at this branch as there had
been failings in the training given by Post Office Ltd, He intimated to the Auditor that Horizon
system had “lost” data. The Contracts Manager, Paul Williams felt that, due to these issues he

would have to reinstate with conditions attached including a full repayment of the shortage.

Kevin Ryan, Security Manager discussed the case with Lesley Frankland and Dave Pardoe and it

was decided that there was no point in continuing with the investigation.

The initial repayment cheque for £12,485.77 initially received was returned ‘Refer to Drawer’
but a replacement cheque cleared on the 30" August 2011. The shortage was repaid in full

and there is no further known shortage to Post Office Ltd at this time. .

The case file is now forwarded for formal closure.
