Mark, I'm really sorry but my brain isn't working properly

So my powers of analysis are underpowered at present! Could you bounce off Al, Alwen, Gavin - you'll get a better quality input.

Let me know where you get to.
Thanks, Paula

applicants a payment - say £5,000 - only to be used to mount a case in the courts.

appropriate.

> Clearly this needs to be worked up properly - but I do think it is worth considering, including legal risk, quickly.
