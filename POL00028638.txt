Working Draft- 16 Oxtuber 1998

1 Introduction

1.1 Background t

In May 1996, the Benefits Agency (BA) / Post Office Counters Limited (POCL) signed PFI
j contracts with ICL Pathway (ICL). ICL would set up and maintain an automated infrastructure for
POCL to enable benefits to be paid to customers using a magnetic strip card and to provide a
plattiorm for other POCLibusiness. :

Ministers have been reyiewing the future of the project m view of the serious delays to the
I implementation timetable and ICL's failure to deliver a key.contracmual milestone for which ICL
I has been placed in breach of contract.
Mini:ters have decided, (without prejudice to sponsors’ legal rights under the existing contract, to
allow. a period of one month for discussion between the parties to see whether sansfactory
commercial terms can be agreed for continuing the project, outstanding differences on the
Timetable can be resolved, and a credible programme for full implementation can be agreed.
Ministers will need to sptisty themselves that the proposed way forward offers best value for
moncy, taking account of the costs 10 the public sector as a whole, of the alternatives,

Tn broad terms, the alternptives to continuing the project are:

™ to abandon the benefit payment card elemert of the project, but continue with the rest of the
Horizon system;

1
W to terminate the whole project and for POCL to commission alternative technology.
1.2 Terms of reference !

‘The purpase of this consittancy is to assist the Treasury with the analysis of fallback options. We
‘were required to review and assess four specific :ssues:

= POCEs nenwork modelling of the impact on the post office network of the loss of BA income ss
and claimants foorfall jrcome, in particular:

= extentof’ closures and losses if no subsidy were provided;
m extent of. subsifly Tequired if closures were to be avoided...

« viability of DSS and BA’s programme for an early shift to benefit payment by automated credit
traasfer (ACT), including the impact on the banks and their charges to customers;

® timescale and costs of implementing an alternative technology platform for POCL;

© validity (in both technical and commercial terms) of pursuing the Horizon proyect without the
benefit payment card. I

!

13° Qualifications i

The timescale within whidh this work has been curried out has been extremely compressed and we
have been heavily reliant on project costs und assumptions produced by BA, POCL. and ICL
Pathway, adjusted in a number of cases by KPMG. We must emphasise that the realisation of the
projeccions is dependent qn the continuing validity of the assumptions on which they are based .

24.10 POCL’s network model

We held a number ofjdiscussions with POCL to understand the process of their nerwork
modelling. In specific afeas of the modelling we queried some of the assumptions used in the
network model, and asked POCL to provide further evidence to support their rationale. We also
nates that POCL’s inputs to Treasury were based on scenarios which were not entirely consistent
with the requirements of the Working Group, and so we requested POCL to’carry out some further
modelling to represent mpre accurately the impact on the network and their profits.

Enisting ATM facilities, including free withdrawals, are expected to remain unchanged.
However, it must be noted that some banks charge customers for withdrawals at any other bank
ATM, a policy which is expected to continue. Some concern was expressed regarding a
putative increase in counter cash withdrawals. {f there was a noticeably large rise-in counter
transactions, banks would be likely to review the need for charges in this area. In this
coanection, it is a common retail bank strategy to migrate customers out of branches to ATMS.
‘This trend is not ben fits related;

suited to all sectors of the market, and are keen to extend these to those on benefits without
bank accounts and fhe unbanked generally. Under money laundering rules the main

of there being any detailed plans for the changes at this early stage. The plan shows the cost and

Given the complexity of GAPS, this dependency Tepresents a risk. The risk is aggravated by need,

2.2.1 Scope of POCL banking fervice :
Development of a banking strafegy for POCL is at an early stage, and is unlikely to be complete
for x further 3-6 months. However, the agreed objective is for POCL to provide a delivery channel
for retail banking. POCL wall not be aiming to support all aspects of retail banking, nor will it

become a bank in its owniright. ‘The provision of retail banking services via POCL is intended to

Agency income and the longer-term future of the post office counter network.

The proposed POCL bankjng offering has been envisaged as the equivalent of a “manned ATM”.
For the purposes of the vibility assessment, the following assumptions have been made:

offices offer consumers benefits over existing alternative distribution channels?

@ in tural areas, will POdL be able to offer a profitable service which is more cost-effective for
the banks than the provision of an ATM?

Banking software

! :
Op the basis of the banking service outlined-in section 2.2.1 above, the core software required is
essentially a teller appli¢anon, which would emulate an ATM to interface with banks’ systems.
Teller software would ot necessurily be available “off the shelf’, but standard development tools
are generally used in thys market, to develop it set of teller functions adapted for a customer's
particular business envithnment. Software-development of this nature should nor present major
technical problems, thohigh a number of issues would need to be explored thoroughly, in
partivular: i

m functional and security differences between “manned ATMs” and “real ATMs” would require
investigation. For example, the first use of a card generally results in the user being prompted
to change his or her ‘PIN. It is not clear how this would be handled by the POCL counter
system; ! ° . .

™ the possible need for! support of the Euro:should be considered, particularly with respect to
Tansition issues. I ;

1
Adopting a “manned ATM" approach has the advantage of theoretical simplicity based ona single -
process for POCL staff, although depending how it was implemented it might restrict furure
growth of services to Telail financial services customers. For example, some services currently
excluded from the network banking definition - eg caprure of address changes - would not be
supported by the ATM. Prptocols.

Tn addition to a front eng wller application POCL may even under this relatively simple option,
and depending on their retail banking goals, need to-consider implementing systems to handle
customer information, settlement, funds transfer. accounting end management information. POCL
will need to outline all ofthese requirements in more derail to enable credible estimates of costs or
timescales be provided. This will also drive out potential issues in other areas such as ownership of
customer data, data protection and the extent to which banks might feel a competitive threat from
PQCI. which would make them unwilling to co-cperate, .

1
Bank interfaces I

The development of the ploposed capability for FOCL is dependent on establishing interfaces with
retail banks There are three main possible approaches to this:

= POCL interfaces with banks individually: POCL would enter into reciprocal arrangements with
a number-of banks The banks would then allow 2 POCL “front end “ teller application to
emulate an ATM which interfaced directly with a bank’s core banking systems, thereby ucting
as an additional delivery channel for that bank. The practical issues around banks granting
aceess directly to a core. systems and the controls and safeguards needed to preserve
integrity are likely to result in a lengthy discussion period. Our view is that it is unlikely that
backs will accept the “black box” stance on this which Pontis advocates for POCL: as parties to
an 48reed interface, banks will expect evidence of the appropriate security and controls;

= POCL interfaces with hanks via the LINK network: POCL have indicated that they may wish to
gonsider using an established intermediary such as LINK Interchange Network Ltd (LINK),
wh:ch provides a switching service to members network membér ATMs, as a suitable vehicle
for their pseudo ATM:zpplication, However, to the best of our knowledge POCL have not
approached LINK officially to discuss this idea Based on our knowledge of LINK and
exploratory discussiong with them, they would perhaps aot readily accept a new member whose
“system” was not an ATM network irrespective of how it was disguised. In addition tt is likely

' !
that LINK would have reservations about taking an organisation which had 19,000 new “ATM”
ourlets into a proven and reliable ATM network of approximately 15,000 LINK ATMs.
Comments on the vidblity and likely timescale of establishing a network via LINK are not
possible withour invdlving them in detailed discussions. LINK will require clear and detailed
definitions from POEL about how it proposes to meet LINK standards and preserve the
wntegrity of the LEINKInenwork, and strong ousiness case for why tts pseudo ATM or “manned
A&TM" should be accepted into the LINK ATM network. It 1s likely that LINK would not
avcept POCL without due consideration of its. application and consultation with the member
bunks. It is envisagedithat this process may-take at least 6 - 12 months,

um LOCL interfaces with one bank, This bank would in tum provide the interface with other
banks for POCL. POCL may feel that they could approach Alliance and Leicester on this, as a
development of their ¢xisting banking relationship with them. .

Option 2: commercipl and technical feusibility
Jt

Option 2 commercial vidbiliy

Drivers of the commerci4I viability of option 2 include:

& vaability of POCL netivork banking;

® remuneration of ICL. ;

The viability of network banking in general 1s discussed in section 2.2.3.

ICL has provided an indi¢ation of the margin which it will forego should option 2 be implemented.
Our enalysis indicates that this peaks at around £60m. The HM Treasury Working Group report
suggests that ICL may sepk compensation for this lost revenue In considering any potential claim
by ICL, consideration should be given to the fact that they have already requested an increase in
charges in order to avoid Josses. :

The situation may be somewhat ameliorated by the early introduction of banking, with associated
transection volumes. From this point of view, a two-phase approach to the implementation of
banking, with the early introduction of EFTPOS and “cashback”, may be desirable. This option is
discussed further below Gee section 2.4 1).

I

Option 2 technical viabillyy
1

Remoyal of the benefits payment card

Commercial sensitivities have meant that this issue has not been discussed directly berween POCL
and fathway. Nor haveidiscussions been “held more broadly about the provision of banking
technology by Horizon. Our own discussions with ICL have been restricted 10 more general
coverage of the Horizon technical architecture and their proposals for banking. Working
assumprions regarding af viability of removing the BPC from Horizon can be made from these
findings, but the technical implications would nesd to be reviewed more fully with Pathway.

Our high-level understanding of the architecture supports the POCL view that-Horizon has #
madular structure and that removal of the BPC is feasible. (NB. It is in Pathway’s interest to
ensure that the Benefit Entashment System (BES) module - which has the rules and options for the

counter benefit card element - can be removed, as they hope to develop Horizon for foreign
marsets, where it would not be required].

The ampacts of removing the BPC are likely to .nclude.
® possible need for changes to the EPOSS counter application;
m possible need for changes to the TPS host application (reconciliation);

& revisiting of I capacityimodels and infrastructure deployment plans (number of communications
devices etc); I

&@ retesting of the modifjed system;
™ modifications to teainjng material.

It should be noted that the bulk of the benefit payment software has now been developed so no
major development cost pavings for {CL would result. From our understanding of Horizon, we do
nor expect the changes qutlined above to be.onerous, although the need.for.retesting is likely to
give cise to a slip in the — date for New Release 2.

Suitability of the Horizon architecture for development of a bankmg capabiliy

ICL Pathway appears confident of the feasibility of providing banking services over Horizon. This
view is supported by the!Pontis report. However, this assessment of feasibility is based on a high-
level technical design which, in tum, is based on @ number of assumptions about the business
Tequizement and the busjness, technical and procedural aspects of the putative interface berween
Horizon and the banks. I

1
Further definition of the business and technical requirements, and their agreement by POCL, ICL
Pathway and the relevant banks, would be required before the impact on the Horizon architecrure
conld be confirmed. We lave commented on the issues involved in section 2.2.

‘The.other area which wil] require more thorough technical review is the impact of on-line banking
aufhorisation requirements on the current Horizon architecture. One option for the transmission of
the messages constituting the authorisation dislogue is the Riposte infrastructure. Riposte is
essentially a batch system, albeit with frequent batch transmissions (at 15 minute intervals). The
ICL cesign relies on the ‘use of “priority messzges" which will cause a batch transmission to be
“forced”. ICL is confides that Riposte is sufficiently robust to be used in this. way. However, this
is an wrea of potential technical risk since we understand there to be no Riposte implementations of
this size in existence, ler ‘lone any with significant on-line elements. Pontis has highlighted this

asarisk area, i
; 1

i .
Pojeutial for early introdycuon of EFLPOS and cashback

There is already an intenhion, although not a commitment, to introduce ESTPOS capability into
Horizon. Given the risks associated with the establishment of # network banking interface, it may
be appropriate to consider introducing EFTPOS into Horizon in advance of the move to full
network banking. This would prevent the Joss of customers moving to ACT should the full
network banking implementation be delayed. : ‘

POCL suggest that the actual timescale might be up to 9 months later,

for example if protracted negotiations with the banks cause delay.

Deve opment . We have estimated 6 to 9 months for the. development of the banking
° ‘unctionality. This may include derailed technical work.with the banks.
Ne timescale also assumes that there will be a single external
Interface to network baaking, eg to LINK. :

Testing and Live Trial Wwe understand that testing and live tril of current Horizon releases
fakes around 9 months The reduction in functional complexity arising
rom the replacement cf benefit payment with banking may reduce the
Timescale. However, stringent acceptance approaches on the part of the
banks may increase it, We have therefore estimated 6-12 months.

Pitot (optional) there 18 a possibility that the banks/LINK would expect to pilot the
pperation of network banking before full rollout began. Such a pilot
Would involve a larger number: of-outlers:than-the live mal. We have
Howed 6 months for this. Because this is an “optional” activity, we
ave shown the “best case” bar in the plan running concurrently with I -
the rollout. The possibility of the pilot being required is reflected in

potential slippage (the grey bar).

Rollout Ne have estimated a “rollout” rate of 300 per week. Rollout tmescale
pill be dominated by-

time to install PfNpads if these are not installed as part of the
rollout of NR 2. We would expect that 1CL Pathway would seek to
: distribute the upgraded software from the centre by electronic
means;

‘Mm time fo train users in network banking;

im tate at which LINK/a bank would accept additions to its network of
connécted systems.

!

t
Given the plan outlined ;above, it 1s hkely that POCL and ICL would wish to consider merging
New Release 2+ with thk banking release. Components of that release not directly dependent on
the banking requirement - for example the key management service --could be developed while
definition of the bankingirequirement was in progress.

Qption 3: commercial and technical feasibility
‘Two main scenarios have been considered here.
a simple debit terminalé;

m-a full Horizon replacement, including all the non-banking functionality which Horizon is
ictended to support (other than the benefit payment card and - given the likely timescale for
Procurement - the Ofder book control.sysiem), as well as network banking (the “manned
ATM”). t

‘The scenario favoured py Treasury is an innial implementation of simple debit terminals, to

provide a basic cash withdrawal service quickly, followed by the full Horizon replacement.

We have also considered 4 further option which involves the provision of network banking without
any other services. This ‘gption would delay the provision of cash withdrawal as compured with
debit cerminals and would also delay the provision of any richer infrastructure (eg support for
elegtronic access to government services) suitabl> for POCL’s longer term strategy. Consequently,

Simpte debit terminals

Simpiz debit terminals: commercial viability

i
‘The simplest “non-Horizon” banking option for POCL is to install debit terminals and provide a
service allowing customers to purchase existing goods or services from POCL and also to
wiphdraw money from their bank accounts via cashback. To provide this type of service POCL
waul need to enter into agreement with a merchant acquirer, a bank who. would act as the
intennediary berween POLL and the card issuer.

This option has not beep put forward as a long-term commercial prospect, but as an interim
solution which enables POCL to develop a basic banking service as quickly as possible, to prevent
the less of benefit customers on migration to ACT which is envisaged if no post office banking
facililies are in place in ume. Iris not, however, taking POCL into retail banking. a

Nou-Horizon “full functionality” option

~ Under this option, POCH! provides network banking services, as described in section 2.2.1 above,

242.1

together with a full functjonal replacement for Horizon.

With respect to the banking component, the general commercial and technical issues raised in
section 2.2.2 again apply,

“Bull functionality” in 4 non-Horizon context has not been explicitly defined to date.. For the
purpuses of this pian we have assumed, in consultation with POCL, that the requirement
would be for the existing committed Horizon functionality with the benefit payment card and
order book control servides removed, und banking added. Further details of these assumptions are

provided in appendix C. §
i

Non-Horizon “full. functipnality”. techcal viadility

Whilst suppliers may prppose various technical options for this, some of the issues applicable to
opticn 2 will be relevantjhere too, m particular:
1

w the need to reconcile meeting standards for banking services (eg. the ATM interface) with
FOCL's potential need for commercial diversification;

wm the need to ensure a software basis which enables new applications to be added readily. This
suggests a PC/Windqws front end based on generic software, rather than a system based on #
more specialist banking package.

tt should also be observed thar a full-function Horizon replacement is unlikely to be significantly
simpler - or necessarily gheaper ~ than its predecessor. In particular:

w te connection of the Horizon replacemenc to banks’ systems. or LINK, and the associated
approval processes i$ analogous to the connection of ‘Horizon to BA systems, and will have

Discussion of key assumptions’
POCL network modelling

Profit impact and network closures ©

There is a close inter-relafionship between the figures for Ist round impact on POCL profits,
estimated profit from banking and the size of the post office nerwork. Tuble 1 summarises these
inter-relationships. The grecise impact‘on the size of the network will depend on both the effect
on sua-postmasters and whether they continue in business (“unmanaged closure”) and the effects
on POCL and the measures that they take to reduce their fixed cost base ie. close post offices in
the locality (“managed closure”). If POCL are successful in managing closure they succeed in
both reducing the fixed cost base and in maintaining their income flow. Of critical importance to
the etent to which eocr 1 forced To carry out closures, is the extent to which banking income
can replace Benefits Ageticy income and hence maintain the viability of the nerwork,

Key essumptions made by POCL aré:

wm that ma managed clogure scenario they migrate 60% of the. PO business to other offices. This
assumption is based on very little information from a small closure programme in the mid
1980s and from resulfs from office relocaticns. Whilst these are rather unreliable guides, we
have no reason to change this assumption,

a that footfall from the Post Office side of the business to the private side is in the range = 27-

38%, that this percentage of retail customers are PO dependent in footfall terms. This is based
on @ survey which interviewed customers of the retail side of the business as to whether they
had also visited the Post Office. The core assumption is that if customers had not been visiting
the Post Office they would not otherwise visit the retail side of the business, This is an extreme
assumption and is .cgntradicted by other survey evidence trom POCL which indicates that
between 20% and 65% of customers of the retail and post office side would still have visited
the shop that day even if the post office were not there. However, the footfall assumption only
affects the unmanaged closure scenario under Option 3, where as a result the estimates of Post
Office closures are liely to be overestimates.

The differential impact op the number of post offices between Options 1, 2 and 3 is generated by
POCL’s success in retaining BA recipients as benking customers rather than order book/BPC
cystemers. As discussed in section 3.3, outlining assumptions in the denvation of banking profits
is critically determined under Options 2 and 3 by the speed with which POCL can get banking,
technology and contracts with banks in place in order to achieve a seamless transition of customers
to accessing bank accousts through POCL.. : .

Compensation to sub-pdstmasters

POCL have assumed thét they wil} pay an amcunt equivalent to 26 months compensation to sub-
postinasters in respect of all network closures. This level of compensation is the current
arrangement if post offices ure compulsorily closed Ir is arguable that declining sub-postmaster
profits will lead to volintury closures, but we accepr the judgement that there will be a lot of
pressure to compensate} sub-postmasters for closures resufting, indirectly, from a goverament
acticn to move to payment of benefits by ACT. toe

3.2 Cost of banking technology
!

3.2.1 Option 2

Senup costs are assymedIto be £20m in the early years (£10m for software development costs and
£}0m for hardware) We,continue to include these costs.

The main component off this cost is the recogrution that POCL will need to remunerate ICL for
their investment, becaus¢ the loss of revenue for the BPC significantly outweighs any cost savings
they can achieve at this ;tage. Option 2 in the Working Group Report included a cost to POCL of
£75m per annum from 2001/02 to 2006/07 regarding remuneration of ICL, assuming ICL could

reduce costs by about 20h,

We asked ICL if they equld provide us with information on.their reduction in margin if the BPC
was discontinued. We made a slight adjustment to their calculations (as they had assumed
compulsory migration of ACT from 2005/06 so therefore had included an extended. revenue, flow
from OBCS in partial offset of reduced BPC revenue). The result is a much lower cost to POCL
(NPV reduction of £112).

322 Option 3

3.2.2.) Debit terminals

The lener from Sarah Mullen (HM Treasury) to Helen Corlett (KPMG) of 7 October 1998
indicates that the costs Used for debit terminals in the HM Treasury Working Group Report were
derived from POCL estimares of a setup cost of £18M and running costs of £60M per annum. The
derivation of these is presented in the letter from Mena Rego (POCL) to Isabel Andérson{DFI),
13 July 1998. : _™

Full-junction Horizon Repent

The lemer from Mena Rego (POCL) to Isabel Anderson (DTI) of 7 August 1998 indicates that the
original POCL estimate Supplied for input to the HM Treasury Working Paper for a replacement
fujl-tunction Horizon was a one-off cost of £109M with ongoing running costs of £74M.

The lemer also indicated ither subsequent work had led to a revised estimate of a one-off cost of
£30M-60M and running gosts of £60M-100M.

We understand from discussion that at least the initial estimates-were derived from the Pathway
charges for the service which would be being provided (ie banking and no benefit payment card).

It is our view that comparison with Pathway charges may not“be’an appropriate means of
estimating the likely furure costs of a Horizon replacement. This is for the following reasons:

w The number of transgctions passing through the replacement will be lower than would have
péssed through Horizon since the number of banking transactions will be Jess than the number

ot benefit transactions. All other things being equal, this would cause the supplier 10 raise
transaction charges correspondingly.

emphasis on banking and electronic government may encourage suppliers to view the

w The nature of the gee will be different in marker terms. For example, an increased
. Opportunity as worthy of strategic investment - this would tend to lower charges. Alternatively,

* suppliers may perceive the opportunity as being high risk because of the fate of Horizon - this -

would tend to raise prices. Furthermore, the revised mix of services required may give rise to a
competition very different in character from that of the original procurement.

m Tae winning supplief might take: different approach from that adopted by Pathway, for
example making mary use of existing infrastructure, thereby allowing charges to be reduced.

mw Tne detail of the requirement is nor yet known und may differ significantly in complexity from
thatof Horizon. .

In order bemer to assess fhe potential range of costs for a Horizon replacement, we have modelled
the possible costs of a Horton replacement and: then: determined the revenue which a supplier
would require for the prdject to have an Internal Rate of Return of 15% - a (conservative) industry-
standard figure for bidiproject. evaluation.

Ty order to reflect the s4nge of influences on price, we have modelled @ number of scenarios of
which three are shown here:

m Scenario A - integrated solution ‘largely constructed from scratch for the project; high
implementation capex; significant proportions of support infrastructure dedicated to project;
rollout at 200 officesiper week; high proportion of contract staff.

uw Scenario B - significant element of reuse in development and support, implementation capex
ead ongoing operational costs reflect significant economies of scale and very strong purchasing
power; rollout at 300joffices per week; no contract staff.

© Initial development takes 1 year and is followed by a pilot rollout to 1% of sites. ‘This
assumption is primarily driven by the issues relating to acceptance of the infrastructure by the

Banking profits

POC: have estimated future income from banking with reference to consultancy provided by
McKinsey and to sore off their own, limited, research. The drivers of total income are the amounts
banks sre willing to pay, and the number of customers and transactions POCL are able to attract.

1 :
Payment from banks
PQCL based their calculations on an income per account per annum of £25 (which Treasury
revised downward to £20 in the Working Group Report). However this 1s value is based on
discyssions which McKinsey held with banks regarding how much they would be prepared to pay.
for thei customers 10 bg able to use POCL for banking transactions should the bank wish. to
reduce the size of its network to achieve cost savings. 7

Our discussions with a: indicated that payment on a ‘per transaction’ basjs would be more

likely and around 50p - 60p 1s a frequently quoted range. We asked POCL to assume SOp per
Transuction in their revised modelling. .

Key DSS assumptions
ts

Costs of ACT : ;
DSS administrative savings estimates include the cost of transferring cash by ACT into benefit
recipients’ bank accounts.! However, in addition to this cost there will be a cost to the banks of -
custorrers withdrawing cash from their accounts which is estimated to lie in the range of 50p-90p
(dependent on whether thé withdrawal is through an ATM or over the counter and the extent to
which fixed casts of the branch network are included in the calculation). In the case of the
“onbeaked” a provision has been made in the estimates of £32 million per annum payment by DSS
To the banks for them to take on this business without charging their customers for cash :
withdrawals. !

Discussions with the banks held by both DSS and KPMG have not indicated that banks would seek
to chazge for such services und indeed there is considerable interest in uttracting new customers
even taough they are benefit recipients There is some concern about large additional numbers of
customers using their braych network at a time when bunks are.seeking to transfer cash
withdrawals to ATMs. However, this illustrates the potential for the Post Office to develop its
bank1g business alongside the move to.ACT.

In the case of the “banked?, DSS have assumed that banks would not seek to recover uny
adqitivnal costs, There is p number of possible justifications for this.

i packs would obtain adgitional money flowing into bank accounts, the interest on which would
heip offset any udditional costs, e

™ individuals would manage their accounts and their pattern of cash withdrawals in such a way
the they do not incur afditional charges.
t

Whilst this might appear 16 be a somewhat extreme assumption, in the course of aur (limited)
interviews with the banks jhis hus not been seen as an issue. Our judgement, therefore, is that in
view cf the existing provision for possible costs of the unbanked which appears ta bé quite
prudev.t, there is not the need to make any additiozal provision for this sum. Indeed, the

Appendix B:Banking functional assumptions

In addition to

je core “manned ATM” services assessed in 2.2.1 above, a number of

further services have been discussed by POCL, which have not been reflected in the
viability assess{nent, These are listed below, together with the rationale for excluding

them from the skrvice scope

2 ]
Service ‘

Comments

Information of banks’ fidancial
products

aren

Service would require careful negotiation with
banks, and may raise regulatory issues re. giving
financial advice Propose that this is not included in
the banking validation ‘scenario, (This would not
preclude provision of simple product details).

Corporate bagking for small

business users
!

Represents a distinct service area, which may. have
different market requirements. Extension into this
area may also be resisted by banks.

7
Passhook withdjawals

This raises logistical issues, particularly given the
different passbook printer standards and practices for
different institutions.

7
Opening and cldsing accounts

Banks are likely to want to retain full control of
account openings and closures. Assume thar POCL
will provide no more than a form-filling service here.
