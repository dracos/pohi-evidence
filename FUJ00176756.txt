Subject: DC Audit Report Issue

Attachment: Consignia Report-Horizon-v1d JH.doc.

Attachment: Rashpal Dhesi Report 05-02-02.doc

I've drafted a note to go to Rashpal and also some responses to the recommendations in the report. I shall want to talk
with Graham a bit more on the responses but some initial thoughts on the tone and content of the note would be
appreciated.
