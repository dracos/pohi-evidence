2 APRIL REVIEW OF SERVICE

2.1 Management Summary

Another excellent all round performance in respect of SLT achievement demonstrated in April.

Network Banking volumes continued to grow in April with 338k transactions totalling £27.5m. Against this background of increasing business,

delivery of release S30 to the live estate commenced with 2,135 branches having S30 software at week ending 2nd May 2003. There were a

number of low business-impact issues resulting from the committal of S30 together with problems within the NBE and Streamline, which have

now been resolved:

« There were 13 instances where the NBE ignored a cancelled NWB transaction after being replaced by a new transaction within the same
customer session.

« There were 4 known instances where a reversal of a ‘REM IN’ doubled up causing a misbalance on the Cash Account

e There were 2 known instances where a counter with a counter ID of ‘3’ or higher was rebooted causing the AP function to be disabled.

e Anissue within Streamline resulted in a large number of unmatched NWB transactions due to an issue with the format of the ‘seconds’
field within the transaction time
(This issue did not affect any branches or PO settlement with clients)

e Ifthe same card is used on the same day, for the same value in the same branch, Streamline would treat all but the first transaction as
duplicates and request authorisation to proceed from PO Ltd causing unmatched transactions.

Fujitsu Services have presented the revised pricing schedule to PO Ltd in respect of OBC (Branch) re-structuring. The new processes have
been agreed at operational level, and have been introduced ahead of formal sign-off of pricing and documentation. Fujitsu Services is seeking
interim approval from PO Ltd in the event of any issues arising during this initial stage.

Fujitsu Services submitted CCN1106 for PO Ltd approval in respect of Paypole support and maintenance. The Fujitsu Services proposal reflects
the service offered by UKME in respect of break fix by way of SLT and LDT thresholds, however the work will be sub-contracted to Romec
Services. We are now awaiting a response from PO Ltd regarding the acceptance or otherwise of our proposal before formally engaging
Romec Services. Support will commence 4 weeks following the approval of the CCN.

The BI3 Transaction Benchmarking exercise in relation to the existing EPOSS, APS and OBCS services will be presented to PO Ltd following
formal sign off of the CSR+ transaction times at system component level. At this point Fujitsu Services believes that all BI3 benchmark timings
are within the agreed target times. Fujitsu Services is completing formal documentation for sign off by both parties.
