He may indeed Hugh. Jon has a couple of enquiries to write up (he can achieve this whilst still supporting you) and then
he's all yours.

To note Jason please and as discussed - given the brevity then this may need to be Jon's day job as required and I expect
your peers to pick up casework in the interim. Thanks.

Hello

I need a big favour plse — if it's possible.

We are starting to have these cases come in again on Horizon.

Apparently having Jon Longman help us is saving us hundreds of thousands in external fees.

Problem is it looks like Jon is being pulled in a number of urgent directions, cannot dedicate the time to Horizon issue
etc. Would you be able to free him up for us plse?

Kind regards

Please see below email - it looks as if there may be an issue with John Longman's ability to assist on the Horizon claims.
His help is extremely valuable and is saving considerable legal cost, so I wonder if anything can be done to free him up so
he can continue to help?

Many thanks in advance.

I have had to undertake an urgent and high priority set of interviews relating to Financial Specialists which I do not know
how long at this stage will take to complete. I am not being able to give these Horizon integrity requests as much time as I
would like. I will discuss this issue with my Manager at my 1:1 on Tuesday and let you know his decision. I am more than
willing to assist as I think you are aware but workload at present is causing a major problem. You may wish to discuss
this with Dave Pardoe.

John,

I am feeling rather pessimistic about being able to track down the branch file for Astwood bank (see below). In terms of
application documents, training records, audit reports, and so on, Graham helpfully suggested that Glenn Chester, the
contract manager, might have relevant material on his Lotus Notes database. If you are drawing a blank on some of the
information requested, Glenn might be a good port of call. Please let me know if I can be of help with this, and thank you
very much again.

Kind regards

Emily,

I will have another look today — however your reference to being disorganised is not too far from the truth. To be honest
the files have been kept in damp and dirty conditions, hence file management not given the focus it deserves. I took over
this role six months ago and have tried to organise filing, inclusive of chasing up files that were sent out in 2009 and not
returned, however this is proving problematic. The filing is not seen as a priority for the team as we are currently under
some intense pressure to achieve targets in respect of SPMR recruitment.

POL-0053407
POLO00056928
POL00056928

Every effort is made by the current regime in this team to ensure that a first class service is provided, however where
areas / levels have let slip in the past it is proving difficult to bring these back to a respectable level due the pressures we
are under.

I will let you know of the outcome later today.

Thank you.

John,

Thank you for checking. As you may be aware, we have just received two claims from former supostmasters challenging
the integrity of Horizon and claiming they did not receive adequate training — we expect to receive more in the next few
weeks as this has been building a head of steam for years. It is vital to our defences that we are able to demonstrate the
training that was given and provide other details relating to the way the branch was run. I can’t see how the file can be
anywhere other than in your offices or at Iron Mountain. Please pursue every possible lead to track this file down — we will
come across as disorganised and vulnerable if we are not able to do so.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards

The string of e-mails below relate to the urgent need to locate the Agency File for Astwood Bank. Just in case this helps to
locate the Astwood Bank file, when I returned it in November 2009, it was one of six (see details in table below) so maybe
it has been mis-filed, any help finding this file would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Graham,

The files are not kept here, they are kept at Leeds and I forwarded the request and I’ve copied their reply below (they copied this to
John also).

cipal Lawyer ~

You will need to take this up with the Leeds team, their manager is Graham Padgett (1 think he may be on annual leave) and his
manager is John J Jenkinson.

I would suggest you contact John whilst Graham is off as it is this team who are responsible for the archive files.

Sorry I can’t help any further

I understand from John Longman that you have been trying to help him locate the agency file for the above named person
/ office. It is important that this file is located and forwarded to Emily Springford as soon as possible as it is needed in
support of a civil litigation matter. (Emily's full address is on the e-mail below). This file was returned by me to the Agency
Team in Leeds in November 2009.

Many thanks in advance

Hi Graham,

I am trying to trace the agency file relating to Astwood Bank. Apparently John Jenkinson in Network believes that the file
was booked out to you, presumably for use in the investigation, but he thinks it was subsequently returned — however, it
doesn't seem to have been archived and they can't find the file in the office. Would you be able to have a look at your
records and see if you have anything which might cast light on where the file ended up?

Many thanks again.
