1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. APPROACH

This document contains those reports and information necessary for the Service Management Forum to review delivery of the
contract by ICL Pathway.

The issue of this document is an interim solution to meet the need to have data presented at the Service Review Forum and as

such will have a short life span. It will be replaced during 1998 by the issue of a Service Review Book direct from the ICL
Pathway Customer Services Service Level Agreement Monitor (SLAM).

Until such time as SLAM Review Book establishment circulation in this current draft format will be limited and controlled
by the Author.

1.2 INTERPRETATION

Interpretation of data, beyond report label classification, can be further qualified by the author as required.

1.3 REVIEW BOOK CONSTRUCTION

This book is sectioned by those key areas against which initial Service Management Reviews will be conducted. Within
each key area there can be presented up to four elements comprising of:

Volumes & Profiles (Optional)

Service Performance (Mandatory - where applicable)
Exception Reports (Where applicable)

Ad-Hoc Reports (Where applicable)

1. Summary.
The Release 1C service remains stable with no major new problems being experienced.
Five problems have been closed off during the month.
2. INew Problem Reports
None.
3. WIP Update
3.1. Authentication of Users to Helpdesks - One Shot Passwords
Discussions between Pathway and PDA Security have brought agreement on a procedure close. Dave King has requested that a
formal Change Proposal be raised to cover the process. This CP has now been raised and issued for impact within Pathway.
Forecast closure - July 1998.
3.2 Cards expiring at Post Offices before being collected
Existing beneficiaries are being nominated for new cards long before their current order books expire. In cases where benefit is
paid four-weekly, the trigger point used by CAPS is 8 weeks in advance of the last foil being used. The system is required to
expire uncollected cards after 56 days (8 weeks) and so in many cases the card expires as soon as it is received at the post
office. As a temporary measure in order to reduce unnecessary cost and inconvenience to customers and post masters the card
expiry time has been set to 90 days.
The next steps are for CAPS to raise a CR to formalise the temporary measure and then produce an optimum requirement in due
course.
3.3. Card Batch Reconciliation Procedure at Post Office

Card batch reconciliation is the process currently carried out by a post office clerk on receipt of a new card batch from De La Rue

Card Systems, prior to issuing a card to a customer. The purpose of this process is to check the integrity of the card batch.

Recent experience suggests that card reconciliation at the post office is onerous and time consuming for the post office clerk,
delays the issue of cards to the customer, and incurs an unnecessary cost for Pathway. Cards are being swiped through several
times. This causes a card and PUN re-order because the system then believes the card to be faulty or the card reader is faulty
(known as a Surplus to Batch Problem).

Action is required to reinforce the Batch Reconciliation Procedures at post offices.

CCN232, which seeks to modify this process at NR2+, has been submitted to the PDA for approval and comments have been
received. Following subsequent discussion with PDA it has been agreed that version A of CCN 232 will be raised and will be
supplemented by sample PPD text - this is scheduled for early June.

Forecast closure - July 1998

Closed Since Last Report
ABED Issues - Increase in Cash Account Errors

Because it can take several weeks or indeed months for information to feed through from POCL Chesterfield, it will be still be
some time before the results of implementing the ‘lost transaction’ fix can be assessed in respect of the cash account errors.
No system time-out issues in April and thus fix deemed to be effective. Problem closed.

Frozen half screen

Some Post Offices experienced a loss of half their screen on 20 March. Generally the remedy was a simple reboot at the counter
effected by the user.

The root cause was a memory leakage issue and a fix has been applied to all counters. Problem closed.

Premature software distribution

A software distribution was accidentally distributed to Post Offices on the afternoon of 25 March, rather than waiting until the
evening. 11 Post Offices raised a call as the download had caused a blue screen problem.

4.5

Steps have been taken to ensure that accidental distribution cannot recur. Problem closed.

Printer firmware issue

Printers returning from the repair loop were not set up with the appropriate firmware settings. This had led to some postmasters
having to reset the printer, under advice from Horizon System Helpdesk.

The appropriate settings have now been confirmed to Ithaca (the printer supplier/repairer) and the problem will not recur. Problem
closed.

Stopped BES Transactions Reported to BA

Problems reconciling stopped BES transactions reported via the CBoS reports to BA against the actual confirmed stops sent back
to CAPS. When a stop is placed by the PCHL the AP record is deleted from PAS and reported as a stop on the main CBoS
reconciliation report. Only when the electronic confirmation is received from BA can we return the item to them as a ‘confirmed
stop’. This delay should only be for a period of 24 hours but in practice BA have been failing to send the stops confirmation to us
so we have been returning stops up to 1 or 2 months after they have been reported.

BA have set up a process to ensure that PCHL stops are actioned by themselves in a timely manner. However we have identified
the need to provide a daily stop reconciliation which compares to number and value of stops reported against the number and
value of stops received.

Pathway Business Support have put together a matrix of daily stops applied by PCHL and, for the duration of 1C, are sending this
to BA to ensure the required files are sent for reconciliation. At R2 this will be done automatically. Problem closed.

HELPDESK SERVICES
Overall Comments
PCHL call logging to be subject of a CP implementation to eliminate incorrect coding analysis. The CP implementation
required is now in place and will be available for analysis in the June Service Review.
“Invalid” PCHL calls have been significantly reduced due to the CP which was implemented on 7" April and is now at a level
of under 6% compared to the previous month’s level of 20%.

The significant reduction in the level of Advice and Guidance coded calls made by POCL to the Horizon System Helpdesk
during April, is as a direct result of the Horizon System HD call coding re-evaluation and scrutinisation. This also contributes
to the overall proportional increase in Service coded calls made by POCL to HSHD.

POCL Horizon System HD calls regarding Operations has remained reasonably high due to the number of Cash Account
problems reported.

IThe non-answered call time is no longer recorded due to the Service Review Forum’s agreement to the Answered Calls
service target for both PCHL and Horizon System Helpdesk.
Horizon System Helpdesk Level 2 call statistics are subject to final evaluation for issue post-April 1998.

Report Page Review Status
___5.1___I 20 __ Actual call volumes fell during the month of Apri,
5.2(a)&(b) 21. IPCHL call volumes are currently subject to research activities to ensure correct mapping of calls to

the functional areas. Pending research completion calls falling into this category are classified
“invalid” calls. Eventually, this “invalid” line will be eliminated.
5.5-5.6 23 __ISLA achieved.

5.7 23 First month of SLA achieved.
5.8 - 5.10 23 ICMS &PAS Level 1 Call Resolution remains below MAL, however, is continuing to steadily improve
This is due to the increased number of calls being handled that contain multiple customer sessions.
CP has been raised to eliminate the ‘skew’ being created on the SLA by these calls.

5.12 25 __IHorizon System Helpdesk are currently conducting extensive analysis of the call coding.
5.18 - 5.19 27 IHSHD Level 1 Resolution below MAL - still in the process of ratifying Level 1 call class. 10min

CALL TO RESOLUTION
Overall Comments

[The overall volume of calls raised has risen as a direct result of the implementation of Release 1C.

The increase in Hardware coded calls this month is as a direct result of the Horizon System Helpdesk’s re-
evaluation and scrutinisation of call coding. This was also contributed by 39 touch-screen problems
reported. One cause, which accounts for 25% of the calls, has been identified and resolution is currently
under investigation. Counter printer problems reported also increased, which were varied with no specific
cause found, but included some incidences of the known printer set-up problem which has now been
corrected.

Software call volumes remained high due to the 55 calls (out of 130) relating to the known half-screen
software problem for which a fix was successfully applied mid-April.

Network call volumes remain steady.
SLA’s relating to this section are listed. Reporting will commence progressively after evaluation of initial

results arising post- Release 1C implementation.
Call volumes include calls logged by Pathway.
