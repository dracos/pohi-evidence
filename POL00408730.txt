Mark, Lewis,

As discussed on the call this morning I attach a document containing our initial questions on the draft
Bramble Report.

Iâ€™d be grateful if you would let me know how long it is likely to take you to provide responses.

Feel free to give me a call if there is anything you'd like to discuss.

Kind regards

Jonny
