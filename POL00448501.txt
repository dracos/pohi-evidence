Proposed changes to Internal Audit governance arrangements
Dear Nick and Owen,

Thank you for your email dated 22 July responding to our letter dated 19 July (enclosed below for reference).

The response provided on 22 July did not directly address our concerns, explain the rationale for the
proposed changes to Internal Audit’s governance arrangements or explain why you consider the proposed
arrangements to be appropriate.

The purpose of this letter is to reiterate our request for an explanation of the rationale for the proposed
changes to Internal Audit’s governance arrangements and why you consider the arrangements to be
appropriate. I am seeking these explanations as we consider the impact that these proposed arrangements
will have on our ability to effectively discharge our responsibilities as your Internal Audit co-source service
provider.

In addition, we have written again to Simon Jeffreys as the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (ARCC)
Chair to request these explanations.

Yours sincerely

Carol Murray
Deloitte LLP
