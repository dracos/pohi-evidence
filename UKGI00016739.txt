Minutes of Shareholder Executive Board

Meeting held on Wednesday 16 January 2013 at 15.00

Members Patrick O’Sullivan (Chair) (PO’S) Attendees: Roger Lowe (Item 2-4) (RL)
present: Claudia Arney (CA)

Jeremy Pocklington (JP)

Tony Watson (TW) Secretary: Peter Batten

Lord Carter (LC)

Stephen Lovegrove (SL)

Anthony Odgers (AO) Apologies: Gerry Grimstone (GG)

Mark Russell (MR)

1. Stephen’s move to DECC

1.1.POS and SL held an unminuted session with the attending NEDs to discuss
SL’s recently announced promotion to DECC.

2. Apologies for absence, Chair’s welcome and introduction, minutes
from last meeting, declarations of interest

2.1.POS formally opened the meeting. Board noted GG’s amendment to
paragraph 2.1 of the November minutes, which will be updated.

3. Actions

3.1.SL provided an update to the Minister’s query about perceived barriers to

ShEx in Whitehall — noting that the Civil Service reform programme was
helpful. TW suggested an alternative question could have been what are the
areas where ShEx can assist, where it currently doesn’t? The Board
discussed various scenarios such as:

= OGDs outsourcing their corporate finance function to ShEx;

= ShEx acting as an advisor to OGDs; and

= Adopting a hub and spoke approach.

3.2.MR noted the need to avoid expansion to the detriment of ShEx’s agility and
ability, and suggested that specialist pockets of corporate finance talent
across Whitehall could be more desirable than a single centralised resource.

3.3.SL noted that he is due to speak to Francis Maude on the topic. JP noted
that HMT were conducting a review on Departments’ capability and capacity.
It was also noted that Lord Browne is undertaking a review of resource
allocation. SL noted that it was imperative that ShEx is involved. [action

4. Chief Executive’s Report

4.1. Introducing his report, SL provided an update on Royal Mail, noting the
company has appointed an industrial relations adviser, and appointed further
advisers on the transaction strategy. SL noted that the Royal Mail Board has
been strengthened by the recent appointment of John Allen as NED.

4.2.SL explained that following the Board’s concerns expressed in the November
meeting, ShEx had looked again at its advisers, and — aware of the likelihood
of scrutiny — is considering the need to appoint further advisers.

4.3. TW asked whether the number of advisers involved risked causing confusion
among potential investors. RL explained that ShEx is pushing the company
to get a firm grip on their planned spend on advisers.

4.4. [action] The Board requested an update on employee shares strategy. SL

noted that the Minister is aware of the importance of employee shares to the
workforce. JP explained that HMT recognises the practical benefits of
employee shares. [action] TW requested a note setting out Senior

Executive share options.

4.5.POS noted the potential risk to the transaction strategy of the forthcoming
year end figures, which are expected to show strong performance.

Post Office Ltd

That the Board notes:

Post Office Ltd’s (POL) programme of branch modernisation is
underway, and gathering pace after a slow start;

Recently announced proposals to franchise up to 70 Crown branches
are (alongside pay restraint) key to making sure the Crown network
reaches break-even by March 2015. These proposals may prompt
industrial action;

Progress is being made developing mutualisation proposals; and
POL expects to exceed its profit targets in the current financial year.

Branch modernisation

21

POL is introducing two new, 100% variable pay operating models, marking a
significant departure from the historic contract that sees subpostmasters
receive an element of fixed-pay regardless of the number of transactions
undertaken. Adoption of the new models is wholly voluntary, but opens the
door for public investment to modernise and improve the converting branch.
This programme is known as ‘Network Transformation’, national rollout began
in October 2012, and Government expects POL to convert 6,000 branches
(over half the network) by March 2015. To date (Friday 1 March) there are
437 branches operating the new models, and a further 580 have signed
contracts and await conversion. This is a slightly slower than expected start to
the programme, but POL is concentrating on building support among
subpostmasters and remains confident of meeting the target of 6,000
branches by 2015.

UKGI00016739
UKGI00016739

Crown office proposals

2.2

2.3

Of the 11,800 branches in the Post Office network, 373 “Crown” branches are
directly owned and operated by POL. They currently lose around £40m
annually and a key element of POL’s strategy is to eliminate these losses by
March 2015. This must be achieved whilst also maintaining the overall size
and accessibility to the network. Ensuring the Crown network breaks-even is
also key to securing the continued support of the National Federation of
SubPostmasters for the Network Transformation programme.

In early February, POL announced plans to franchise up to 70 Crown
branches that it believes it is unable to operate profitably. In addition, Crown
staff pay is well above comparative levels and is a key reason why the Crown
network has historically incurred heavy losses. Crown office employees are
directly employed by POL, and are heavily unionised — represented by the
CWU and CMA unions. The CWU is calling for a consolidated 3.5% pay rise
in each of the next three years. The cumulative impact would be £24m over
three years, and almost certainly prevent the Crown network from reaching
break-even in 2015. POL management has offered an unconsolidated award
based on — and funded by — out-performance against plan. CWU leaders
have rejected the offer (CMA has yet to decide) and are currently balloting
members (ballot closes 8 March). POL is anticipating support for industrial
action, most likely around Easter, and is preparing contingency plans. The
company is confident that surrounding branches (i.e. the remaining c11,500
branches which are not directly run) would be able to absorb Crown
customers on a short-term basis.

Mutualisation and future strategy

24

25

Having published the Government's response to the “Building a Mutual Post
Office” consultation in July 2012, POL has now commenced a number of
mutualisation workstreams. A Stakeholder Forum has been established which
brings together a diverse range of stakeholders to establish the definition of a
public benefit purpose of a mutual. This will be the foundation on which a
mutual can develop, and the forum marks the first time a number of
stakeholders have worked together in a collaborative way. The process did
not start smoothly but it is now advanced and we are optimistic around the
progress that has been made. Other workstreams (e.g. Cultural Change,
Finance and Governance) are progressing and work on these will accelerate
once the work of the Stakeholder Forum has developed further. POL expects
to run a public engagement process on the work of the Stakeholder Forum
over the summer.

No mutualisation will be possible without an independently viable business.
POL has recently started work on developing a new strategic plan to deliver
this, covering 2014/15 to 2019/20. This work is still at a preliminary stage
(having first been shared with POL’s Board at the end of February) and ShEx
is working closely with management on this. We expect the network to require
ongoing funding (albeit at a much lower and declining level than now) and are
feeding updated thinking on likely funding levels into the Department's
spending review preparations. We expect to agree funding for at least
FY15/16 (and preferably longer) by Christmas 2013. Mutualisation is only
going to be a realistic prospect with long-term clarity for the business.

10
Financial Performance

26

27

3

This year POL has performed well with sales ahead — and operating profit
materially ahead — of budget. Management now expect to deliver an
operating profit of £94 million (against the original budget of £84 million and
the £61 million that POL achieved in 2011/12). It should however be noted
that between 2011/12 and 2012/13, the Network Subsidy Payment received
by POL has increased by £30 million (from £180 million to £210 million) - this
explains much of the increase in operating profit. Management acknowledge
that the recent reforecast includes contingencies, and that full-year
performance could be higher than £94 million.

Group level performance masks a potentially significant change in POL’s
sales mix, which is different to what was expected at the start of the year.
Weaker Government Services performance (due to lower pricing and volumes
in certain key contracts) has been offset by stronger results in Mails and
Retail (due to higher volumes and prices in Mails, and lottery rollovers and a
Jubilee/Olympics benefit in retail) and Financial Services (due mainly to a
renegotiation of POL’s contract with the Bank of Ireland). POL’s Government
Services performance (which is expected to end the year below both budget
and prior year) raises questions since this segment was expected to be a key
growth driver for the business over the life of the current plan to 2014/15.

Royal Mail - ShEx Board 13 March 2013 (13)05

ShEx Board to note that:

= Anumber of critical transaction “enablers” have been confirmed in
the last two months: Strong Christmas trading, a business plan
refresh that appears positive and no “red flags” from initial investor
meetings.

= Based on our outline business case and VfM analysis, we have
received BIS Permanent Secretary and indicative Treasury approval
to our Outline Business Case for an IPO in autumn 2013 (whilst
doing all necessary work to retain the alternative options of a later
IPO (spring 2014) or a private sale).

= BIS and Treasury Ministers are being asked for approval currently to
proceed on this basis.

= There are a number of key transaction structure issues that have yet
to be resolved, including employee shares, the retail component and
outline capital structure; further work on these issues will follow
over the coming weeks, culminating in another sale strategy
submission and updated business case in early May.

*  Itis important to reemphasise that there remain significant risks and
it remains possible that a deal will not be achievable on acceptable
terms; we therefore continue to work on “hold” strategies should
this be the case.

Detail

1. In December 2012 ShEx officials put advice to Ministers and the ShEx Board
setting out the options for a sale and our initial assessment of feasibility. In that
briefing we set out our view that the only feasible sale options were IPO and
private sale, and said that we would revert in Feb/March with further advice on
recommended sale strategy following Christmas trading, the Business Plan
refresh and initial investor feedback.

2. In addition, over the last two months we have undertaken a full VM assessment
and developed an outline business case (OBC) to support a sale of shares.

3. On the basis of this work we are now in a position to recommend that:
= We should pursue a sale of shares.

= We should prepare for an IPO in autumn 2013. However, given remaining
uncertainty of execution we must continue to keep the private sale option
open by doing all required work to enable us to change to a private sale
track if necessary.

= There are a number of key blocks of the transaction structure (such as
employee shares, retail, outline capital structure and access to external
borrowing) that will require decisions in the coming weeks. Advice on

16
Key risks

UKGI00016739
UKGI00016739

these issues will come to you over the coming weeks and final decisions
will feed into the next iteration of the business case for a sale of shares
and will be put to ministers in early summer.

4. The key pieces of evidence described below currently support our
recommendation to pursue an IPO whilst retaining the flexibility to revert to a
private sale.

5. However, as described in our December advice, there are number of key building
blocks that must fall into place if we are to successfully execute a sale. Our
principal risks are around:

Industrial relations: a new pay deal has not yet been agreed, nor has
agreement been reached on the future of the RM pension scheme. The
CWU has also stepped up its campaign against privatisation, and we
expect this to ramp up as we approach the CWU Conference on 21st
April. This is a key area of concern for investors and we are making clear
to the company that we will need to have a framework agreement in place
by the summer. Moya Greene has indicated that her intention is to put in
place a framework by May. You now have a series of regular meetings
with Moya on this issue; ShEx will also continue to monitor industrial
relations and keep ministers updated. Officials are also considering an
additional ESO stake as a possible HMG lever to use in the event that IR
looks likely to derail a transaction

Financial performance: as described above, RM continues to out-perform
its business plan. We therefore feel that the risk of a near-term financial
shock is relatively low but will continue to monitor this and provide
ministers with monthly updates on business performance. We will also
have received and approved the updated RM Business Plan by the next
sale strategy submission in early May.

Investor appetite: RM will need to refine its equity story in light of early
investor feedback and continue the process of educating investors as to
what a good investment proposition the company is. The next full round of
investor meetings will be on the back of RM’s full-year results; this is likely
to be in the first week of June. There is little to gain from returning to
investors before the end-year results have been published and before RM
have made further progress on the industrial relations front. We will refine
our assessment of this risk as we go through the investor rounds and the
feedback will inform advice to you in June.

Market/economic conditions: we cannot predict market conditions but this
will form a key part of our analysis of feasibility of a sale at the
forthcoming sale strategy decision points closer to a sale (i.e. early May
and in the summer).

Regulation: investors have raised the need for regulatory certainty,
primarily on end-to-end competition but also on Ofcom’s broader
intentions for the regulatory framework in the future. Ofcom have put in
place a seven-year framework (of "light touch" regulation) offering
unprecedented certainty for a regulated sector; we therefore feel that
investors will have sufficient comfort on this point once it is understood.
On end-to-end, we expect Ofcom to publish their statement of approach at
the end of March and will be able to assess this risk more fully at that
point. On both of these issues Ofcom have signalled their willingness to
engage with analysts, and potentially investors directly.

17
UKGI00016739
UKGI00016739

6. These risks are significant and there remains a strong possibility that one or more
could materialise; we are continuing to assess contingency options should this be
the case. However, at this stage we (and UBS) remain of the view that a sale
should be feasible from autumn 2013.

7. We recently appointed an independent advisor (Lazard). We have asked them to
fully review our proposed strategy (i.e. to target an autumn IPO with private sale
fallback) and they will do this over the coming weeks. They have, however, noted
that their initial views are in agreement with the current strategy.

Outline business case and value for money

8. The OBC has been approved by Martin Donnelly and has been considered by a
Treasury Approval Point (TAP) panel. The TAP panel noted that there will be
further decision points in May and late June.

9. The OBC sets out the detailed strategic and economic (VfM) case for a sale of
shares. It also examines feasibility in terms of operational, legal and financial
risks to HMG. The principal conclusion is that the VfM and strategic analysis
within the OBC clearly supports a sale of shares.

10. In addition to this overall conclusion, the VfM analysis examines in detail the six
key dimensions of a potential sale structure and concludes that optimal VfM will
be secured by:

= An IPO-led strategy with a fallback to a private sale;
= An ‘early’ sale: i.e. targeting autumn 2013;

= A significant minority stake to be sold, though this conclusion will be
revisited before April and is highly sensitive to further assessment of
market conditions, as well as policy decisions to increase the size of the
stake sold to a majority in order to further de-risk the taxpayer;

= GLS to be sold as part of RM rather than sold separately;

= RM having access to external debt (this conclusion is dependent on
further work with HMT, focussing on public sector organisation borrowing
guidance in the event that HMG retains a majority interest following the
initial sale); and

= Employees receiving 10% of shares upfront for free (further detail
attached as annex to this paper).

11. Although the VfM analysis clearly supports these conclusions, there are number
of other policy and fiscal objectives that will need to be considered for the latter
four dimensions (employee shares in particular).

12. As such, at this stage the OBC (and this submission) seeks ministerial agreement
that we should pursue a sale and that the preferred strategy is an IPO in the
window autumn 2013 — spring 2014. The issues of stake size, access to external
debt and employee shares are identified as needing resolution over the coming
weeks.

13. Our next formal business case update and submission to ministers on the sale
strategy will come in early May, but we will be seeking decisions on the key
outstanding issues - particularly employee shares, the retail element, outline
capital structure and external borrowing - over coming weeks as these issues are
on the critical path for the transaction and will likely need iterative discussion and
advice.

18
UKGI00016739

UKGI00016739

14. Size of stake: although the current VfM conclusion is that we should sell a
significant minority stake, this is when compared to a full sell-down. There are
strong policy arguments to support the sale of a majority stake (short of full sell-
down), not least for the purposes of external borrowing (see para 16). We will
refine our position on size of stake over the coming weeks, but expect that we will
want to retain the flexibility to sell a majority stake if the market allows.

15. GLS: we have reached agreement at official-level (ShEx and HMT) that this
should be sold as part of RM.

16. External borrowing: with employees expected to receive a minimum of 10% of
shares, HMG would only need to sell 40% plus one share in order to hold less
than 50% of the company. HMT have informed us that this would result in RM no
longer being classified to the public sector, but we are engaging further with them
on this. Recent IPOs in the UK market have tended to sell an average of 38% of
shares (albeit within a range of 14%-73%), and precious privatisations having
been mostly 100% sales. As a result it is quite possible (but cannot be
guaranteed) that Government's holding will be less than 50% and thus RM will no
longer be classified as public sector.

17. \n addition, there are number of fiscal issues that will need resolution in the
coming months, principally around funding cover for the employee share scheme
and transaction costs. The BIS position is that we should fulfil our previous
commitment to contribute £43m to employee shares and transaction costs, but
that the remainder of the costs should be recovered from proceeds. The
Secretary of State will shortly write to the CST setting out this position and the
issue will now be resolved through ministerial channels.

18. Now that the OBC has received indicative formal approval from the TAP panel it
will be submitted by HMT officials to HMT ministers in support of a formal
recommendation that the project should proceed.

Pre-IPO placement option

19. We previously noted the possible option of a pre-IPO placement i.e. a small stake
sale to financial investors ahead of a subsequent IPO, providing some
momentum towards the core transaction. We have assessed this further,
including analysis of specific options such as a straight equity investment or a
convertible bond. We, and UBS, have concluded that a pre-placement deal prior
to a late 2013/early 2014 IPO is neither feasible or desirable because:

* We could not identify a structure that delivered our transaction objectives,
notably VfM and a permanent sale of equity and transfer of risk. The
majority of potential structures would require HMG to commit to redeem
the shares (i.e. buy them back) if we didn’t proceed with the full IPO in an
agreed timeframe; it is therefore questionable whether this would achieve
real transfer of risk. The redemption price would also likely need to
include a high rate of return which would make this particularly bad VfM
for HMG.

= The timing, of only 4-5 months ahead of an IPO, is also atypical and
would not fit straightforwardly with a main autumn transaction. A pre-
placement would really only be feasible and appropriate with a spring 14
IPO which does not fit with our strategy of maximising our chances of
success by aiming for the largest possible transaction window.

= We do not believe RM could be ready for a pre-placement transaction in
the required time frame and preparations could well negatively impact our
core transaction streams for an autumn IPO.

24.

Business Plan Refresh: We expect the company to share a board approved
refresh of their business plan in the near future. This plan is expected to result in
a similar target level of profitability (of c.7% PBIT margin) but crucially delivers the
step up to this level more quickly. This is clearly an improvement on the previous
plan as we will now have a stronger financial track record this year. At the same
time, the company will include a number of additional investment programmes for
packets which result in a moderately lower level of forward cashflow, but which
appear sensible in underpinning its forward parcels growth (and do not impact the
ability to pay dividends in the plan).

We will review the plan of the basis on earning quality, forward dividend certainty
and the need for the plan to be sufficiently stretching. Initial analysis does not
suggest any substantial issues for our sale strategy. UBS have advised that
“subject to clarity on the cashflow profile of the new business plan, on a
profitability level (supported by this year’s Christmas trading outperformance)
there are no red flags which would detract from a Q4-2013 IPO”.

Financial performance: December-& January: Group performance in December
and January, including the crucial Christmas trading period, has exceeded the
refreshed plan, with PBIT ahead by +22.8% (£178m vs £145m), and revenue by
+1.8% (£1,751m vs £1,720m) in this period . Within this, UKPIL has
outperformed on revenue by +1.4% (£1,507m vs. £1,486) and PBIT by +34.4%
(£164m vs. £122m), whilst GLS is ahead on revenue +6.6% (£244m vs. £229m)
and in line at the PBIT level.

On a year to date basis (10 months to end-January), RM are performing strongly,
with PBIT and cash flow exceeding the reforecast by +20% (£453m vs. £376m)
and +48% (££471m vs. £318m) respectively. Group PBIT margins year-to-date
are now at 5.8% vs. 2.5% last year (expected to decline at FY to c.5% due to
seasonality) and a FY 15/16 target of 7.4% (i.e. RM continues to make significant
progress towards their long term targets).

Our view is that this outperformance continues to support an IPO-led
strategy in Q4 2013.

Investor Feedback

25.

26.

27.

Royal Mail met with 29 major institutional investors between December 2012 and
March 2013 in London and Edinburgh.

There has been positive initial feedback from investors with highlights of the
investment case being the operational momentum within the business and the
high quality management team.

Investor concerns focussed primarily on industrial relations and a new agreement
with the unions, a better understanding of the Ofcom regulatory construct and
clarity over pensions going forward. All of these concerns were already a key
focus for HMG and we are not surprised that they have been raised by investors.
We have not seen any feedback to suggest that we should not proceed with
our preferred strategy of preparing for an IPO in autumn 2013.

20
UKGI00016739
UKGI00016739

28. Investor sentiment will be monitored going forward. The next set of meetings will
be in the United States in late March (San Francisco, the Mid-West, New York
and Boston). In addition, RM management will conduct a further round of
meetings with investors following the publication of the preliminary financial
results at the end of May. It is important that management can demonstrate
progress in terms of addressing some of the key investor concerns (e.g. industrial
relations) by these next meetings.

Next steps & forthcoming decisions

29. As described above, following this initial decision to continue preparation for a
sale and to target an autumn IPO, our intention is for ministers to take sequenced
decisions to refine down our sale strategy and agree the key dimensions of the
transaction structure.

30. The expected timeline of formal sale strategy decisions and supporting evidence
to support those decisions is as follows (noting that advice on individual issues
may come up earlier in preparation for these big decision points):

Annex — Employee Shares update

Current Position

1.

" Note under the IPO scenario, under current plans, 10% of shares would be transferred in to
a holding vehicle on day one, with that vehicle allocating a 5% stake to employees shortly
thereafter, with 2.5% being allocated on the subsequent two anniversaries. These stakes
would have a 3-5 year holding period. The phasing of transfer, combined with the holding
period, helps us balance longevity with financial reward in a reasonable timeframe.
