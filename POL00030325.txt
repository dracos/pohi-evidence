Symptoms

Critical event on counter:<br>"An unexpected error occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout
occurred waiting for lock (0xC1090003)"<br><br>This single event occurred just after midnight during LFSEndOfDay
processing.<br><br>Sometimes a storm of these events occurs - see KEL KEL <a

Problem

Possibly caused by an outstanding lock on the run table, which is cleared subsequently when ClearDesk runs. <br>The
problem is known to have affected at least 129 counters. <br><br>KEL <a
href="http://SSCWEBSERV01/SSC/SSC_KEL/kel_view_kel.jsp?KELRef=JBallantyne5245k">JBallantyne5245k</a></kel>
documents the same event where there were multiple occurrences of the error, and errors in declarations.<br><br>The event
storms probably have the same underlying cause as the events documented in <kel><a

PC0086212 is with development for problems balancing while these events are occurring.

Solution - Helpdesk
A single event can be ignored.
Evidence

Do not pass further instances to SSC unless there appear to be side effects.
