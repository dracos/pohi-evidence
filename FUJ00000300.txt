EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:

This CCN reflects the conclusion of detailed discussions and exchange of
correspondence regarding training and is based on principles established in CCN105

(in particular in document Horizon Training Programme Proposal, reference PATH-30-
007, dated 30/10/97).

It is raised to confirm the detail of training courses to be provided by ICL Pathway to
POCL and to confirm training information to be provided to the DSS.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: _-HIGH / MEDIUM /LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:

CCN105 established the principles whereby the half day training programme described
in the Solution to R915 be replaced by all-day training estimated to cost an additional
7.8m based on agreed parameters in return for a four month extension of contract. In
addition CR P67 was raised to increase the number of POCL Users being trained and
CR P68b requests the removal of Requirement 515.

Following submission of CCN286a POCL requested an increase in the limit of courses
to be provided by ICL Pathway. As a result of this ICL Pathway has increased the
limit of courses to be provided to a maximum of 12,600 Within this limit, the number
of one day Counter Assistants Courses to be provided has increased from 5,185 to a
maximum of 5,504. In addition the number of one and half day Managers Courses to
be provided has increased from 6,596 to a maximum of 7,004.

CCN286b was submitted to reflect these changes. Subsequently, comments were
received from the Joint Contracts Team on 06/01/99 and from POCL on 19/01/99
which were addressed in CCN286c. CCN286d incorporates further comments from
the Joint Contracts Team on 31 March 1999.

ensure quality and competence levels are maintained both by
non CONTRACTOR trainers and their delegates.

The CONTRACTOR will be responsible for designing and
developing course materials/training event to POCL’s approval.
Any updates to training or additional supporting documentation
will be supplied by the CONTRACTOR and approved by the
AUTHORITIES. This will be provided for new Outlets of the
Horizon platform as part of national Rollout. Style and layout of
training workbooks and supporting materials are documented in
the Training and User Awareness Style Guide, reference
PATH/PUBS/001.

Specific Responsibilities

POCL will mandate training for Users i.e. Outlet managers,
subpostmasters and counter assistants in accordance with
POCL’s Policy for Releasing Individuals to Attend Training
(CAR response number 531.000.03), document reference
BP/PRD/007.

It is not envisaged that “day to day” development of training
materials will be required although ongoing quality assessment
and maintenance will be undertaken by the CONTRACTOR.

The CONTRACTOR will ensure that all nominated parties are
advised of training activities. Such periods of notification,
content thereof and identification of nominated parties shall be
the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility prior to contract award.

Management of training will be the responsibility of the

the CONTRACTOR. Information passed to POCL shall be
defined by the AUTHORITIES and subject to Change Control
Procedures.

Attendance of regular training review meetings will be the
responsibility of the CONTRACTOR and will be part of the
overall implementation review process. Training is an
integrated part of the implementation and Roll-Out programme
therefore it is not envisaged that the training will be isolated
from project reviews.

Agreement and sign off by the CONTRACTOR will be part of
the implementation plan.

FUJ00000300
FUJ00000300

e.g. 90% for knowledge related areas for transactions of the
automated platform relevant to a specific Outlet.

Training will be offered to Users, who do not make up the ratio
for minimum training compliance, up to individual site
acceptance and during the Horizon Field Support Officer visit.
This will be offered on an exception basis at the time of training
invitations i.e. 4 weeks from installation. Remedial training will
also be offered to Users during this period who fail a
competency test and who do not make up the ratio for minimum
training compliance. Thereafter all outstanding or ongoing
Horizon training will be the responsibility of the AUTHORITIES.
This training will be delivered to either new or existing Outlet
Users. Update training or New Release 2+ training on existing
Users of the Horizon platform will be the responsibility of the
AUTHORITIES. New Release 2+ training for new Outlets and
Users, who do not have Horizon, will be trained by ICL Pathway
as part of the standard national Rollout training programme.
Subsequent updates and new product training will be the
responsibility of the AUTHORITIES unless the CONTRACTOR
takes on this responsibility in accordance with the agreed
Change Control Procedure.

Contingency/disaster recovery

Notification of course cancellations by the AUTHORITIES must
be issued within an agreed timescale between the
CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES. A minimum of 48
hours notice must be provided for 98% of cases. The same will
apply if the CONTRACTOR cancels a course with notification of
an alternative date.

The CONTRACTOR shall not cancel more than 2% of the
scheduled courses in accordance with the implementation Roll-
Out plan. However if an installation is cancelled due to POCL
changes then this is the responsibility of the AUTHORITIES and
should not be included in the 2% targeted for the
CONTRACTOR.

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to reschedule
alternative training venues if a site becomes inoperative at no
extra cost to the AUTHORITIES unless a POCL venue has been
agreed and an alternative is required.

Data Accuracy and integrity
There will be no reduction in system performance as a result of
training mode being used. Training mode will be used in the

same way as live mode with the exception of “training” stock
data.

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to ensure there are no
factual errors at the time of acceptance and release.

3.6 Competence levels

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to meet the agreed
objectives/competence level of the course and for delegates to
demonstrate this capability as part of an end of course review.
A competence test will be carried out at the training event to
meet the agreed competence level of 90% for knowledge
related areas for transactions of the automated platform.

The CONTRACTOR shall agree competence matrices with the
AUTHORITIES prior to contract award. The CONTRACTOR
shall ensure 90% compliance with the matrices as measured
through a competence test.

The CONTRACTOR has the responsibility to meet level 1 of the
standard Kirkpatrick model. This will be achieved by the end of
course review/appraisal. Level 2 of the standard Kirkpatrick
model will be met by the end of course competence test.

Communication

It is the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility to provide agreed format on
performance criteria along with written permission from franchise
Outlets that assessments can be carried out on their staff. For POCL
staff, subpostmasters and assistants ICL Pathway will notify Users that
data will be gathered on individual performance and distributed to
POCL for analysis.

It is also the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility to certify that managers of
franchise, sub-Post Offices, POCL offices and multiple franchise
Outlets, ensure competency of their staff, and to further ensure that
their staff apply due diligence and professional standards of care to
ICL Pathway systems and services.

Distribution and format for providing this information shall be agreed
between the CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES prior to contract
award.

POCL Regional reports will be defined by the AUTHORITIES and
agreed with the CONTRACTOR. Reports will be provided by the
CONTRACTOR in a timely manner to a nominated contact. These
Reports will be distributed within 5 working days for each Region at the
end of each month. 24 hour competency failure reports will be
supplied to the AUTHORITIES by the CONTRACTOR for immediate
action by POCL. Response by POCL will be within 24 hours or the
next working day. This is detailed in ICL Pathway’s Training

detailed in ICL Pathway’s Training Scheduling and Minimum Training
Compliance document reference IM/REQ/014.

5. Monitoring Training Services

Monitoring of training Services will be carried out as part of the
implementation programme. It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to
supply information to the AUTHORITIES in an agreed format and to
agreed measures. This format will be subject to Change Control
Procedure.

6. Training Review Meetings
It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to hold regular management
meetings to review progress and performance. This will be carried out

on a regular basis and to an agreed timetable.

Regular review meetings regarding implementation should be the
responsibility of both the CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES.

7. Escalation Procedures
Failures in Service Levels will be the responsibility of the
CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES’ nominated SLA manager to
resolve.
Issues or actions which fail to be rectified will be passed to the agreed
CONTRACTOR and AUTHORITIES service management team for
escalation.

8. Change Management

Training Services

2.1 General
The CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES shall agree
acceptable standards of competencies in the use of the
automated platform. The CONTRACTOR will be responsible for

training POCL and agency trainers to an acceptable standard.
However it will be the responsibility of the AUTHORITIES to

Page: 35 of 1
2.2

FUJ00000300

FUJ00000300

ensure quality and competence levels are maintained both by
non CONTRACTOR trainers and their delegates.

The CONTRACTOR will be responsible for designing and
developing course materials/training event to POCL’s approval.
Any updates to training or additional supporting documentation
will be supplied by the CONTRACTOR and approved by the
AUTHORITIES. This will be provided for new Outlets of the
Horizon platform as part of national Rollout. Style and layout of
training workbooks and supporting materials are documented in
the Training and User Awareness Style Guide, reference
PATH/PUBS/001.

Specific Responsibilities

POCL will mandate training for Users i.e. Outlet Managers,
Subpostmasters and Counter Assistants or Counter Clerks in
accordance with POCL’s Policy for Releasing Individuals to
Attend Training (CAR response number 531.000.03), document
reference BP/PRD/007.

It is not envisaged that “day to day” development of training
materials will be required although ongoing quality assessment
and maintenance will be undertaken by the CONTRACTOR.

The CONTRACTOR will ensure that all nominated parties are
advised of training activities. Such periods of notification,
content thereof and identification of nominated parties shall be
the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility prior to contract award.

Management of training will be the responsibility of the
CONTRACTOR in liaison with the AUTHORITIES. However
training invitations, site selection/preparation and provision of
equipment will be the responsibility of the CONTRACTOR.

Management information (training) will be the responsibility of
the CONTRACTOR. Information passed to POCL shall be
defined by the AUTHORITIES and subject to Change Control
Procedures.

Attendance of regular training review meetings will be the
responsibility of the CONTRACTOR and will be part of the
overall implementation review process. Training is an
integrated part of the implementation and Roll-Out programme
therefore it is not envisaged that the training will be isolated
from project reviews.

Agreement and sign off by the CONTRACTOR will be part of
the implementation plan.

Page: 36 of 1
FUJ00000300

FUJ00000300

Monitoring and review of performance will be jointly undertaken
by the CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES. This will be via
standard and agreed report formats within agreed timescales

Identification of improvements to the training programme will be
part of an approved quality process and is part of the
CONTRACTOR's responsibility.

3. Key Measurables

3.1

3.2

3.3

Timeliness

The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that training is delivered in
accordance with the Roll-Out of the automated platform. Such
training will be completed no more than 5 working days before
live usage, and be complete no less than 1 working day before
live usage.

Quality

Course delegates will be requested to complete a questionnaire
on the training environment, and the CONTRACTOR shall
achieve not less than 85% satisfaction. Details of processes
and procedures to support ICL Pathway training environments
are documented in the Training Venue Administration document
reference PATH/PRO/0004.

The CONTRACTOR shall not be responsible for adverse
comments/user dissatisfaction relating to AUTHORITIES’
premises.

The CONTRACTOR shall agree positive training matrices with
the AUTHORITIES prior to contract award. The CONTRACTOR
shall ensure 95% compliance with these matrices as measured
through satisfaction questionnaires as defined in ICL Pathway’s
Training Evaluation paper reference SU/TRN/005S.

Cycle Time

Training should take no longer than a period of 1.5 days for
Outlet managers, subpostmasters and 1.0 day for counter
assistants or Counter Clerks. This will be a continuous event
held during the day and off site. All trainees are to achieve the
minimum standard of competence as described in POCL’s
document reference BP/PRD/006. It is the CONTRACTOR’s
responsibility to achieve the overall agreed level of competence
e.g. 90% for knowledge related areas for transactions of the
automated platform relevant to a specific Outlet.

Page: 37 of I
3.4

3.5

FUJ00000300
FUJ00000300

Training will be offered to Users, who do not make up the ratio
for minimum training compliance, up to individual site
acceptance and during the Horizon Field Support Officer visit.
This will be offered on an exception basis at the time of training
invitations i.e. 4 weeks from installation. Remedial training will
also be offered to Users during this period who fail a
competency test and who do not make up the ratio for minimum
training compliance. Thereafter all outstanding or ongoing
Horizon training will be the responsibility of the AUTHORITIES.
This training will be delivered to either new or existing Outlet
Users. Update training or New Release 2+ training on existing
Users of the Horizon platform will be the responsibility of the
AUTHORITIES. New Release 2+ training for new Outlets and
Users, who do not have Horizon, will be trained by ICL Pathway
as part of the standard national Rollout training programme.
Subsequent updates and new product training will be the
responsibility of the AUTHORITIES unless the CONTRACTOR
takes on this responsibility in accordance with the agreed
Change Control Procedure.

Contingency/disaster recovery

Notification of course cancellations by the AUTHORITIES must
be issued within an agreed timescale between the
CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES. A minimum of 48
hours notice must be provided for 98% of cases. The same will
apply if the CONTRACTOR cancels a course with notification of
an alternative date.

The CONTRACTOR shall not cancel more than 2% of the
scheduled courses in accordance with the implementation Roll-
Out plan. However if an installation is cancelled due to POCL
changes then this is the responsibility of the AUTHORITIES and
should not be included in the 2% targeted for the
CONTRACTOR.

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to reschedule
alternative training venues if a site becomes inoperative at no
extra cost to the AUTHORITIES unless a POCL venue has been
agreed and an alternative is required.

Data Accuracy and integrity
There will be no reduction in system performance as a result of
training mode being used. Training mode will be used in the

same way as live mode with the exception of “training” stock
data.

Page: 38 of 1
FUJ00000300

FUJ00000300

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to ensure there are no
factual errors at the time of acceptance and release.

3.6 Competence levels

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to meet the agreed
objectives/competence level of the course and for delegates to
demonstrate this capability as part of an end of course review.
A competence test will be carried out at the training event to
meet the agreed competence level of 90% for knowledge
related areas for transactions of the automated platform.

The CONTRACTOR shall agree competence matrices with the
AUTHORITIES prior to contract award. The CONTRACTOR
shall ensure 90% compliance with the matrices as measured
through a competence test. The CONTRACTOR has the
responsibility to meet level 1 of the standard Kirkpatrick model.
This will be achieved by the end of course review/appraisal.
Level 2 of the standard Kirkpatrick model will be met by the end
of course competence test.

Communication

It is the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility to provide agreed format on
performance criteria along with written permission from franchise
Outlets that assessments can be carried out on their staff. For POCL
staff, subpostmasters and assistants ICL Pathway will notify Users that
data will be gathered on individual performance and distributed to
POCL for analysis.

It is also the AUTHORITIES’ responsibility to certify that managers of
franchise, Sub-Post Offices, POCL offices and multiple franchise
Outlets, ensure competency of their staff, and to further ensure that
their staff apply due diligence and professional standards of care to
ICL Pathway systems and services.

Distribution and format for providing this information shall be agreed
between the CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES prior to contract
award.

POCL Regional reports will be defined by the AUTHORITIES and
agreed with the CONTRACTOR. Reports will be provided by the
CONTRACTOR in a timely manner to a nominated contact. These
Reports be distributed within 5 working days for each Region at the
end of each month. 24 hour competency failure reports will be
supplied to the AUTHORITIES by the CONTRACTOR for immediate
action by POCL. Response by POCL will be within 24 hours or the
next working day. This is detailed in ICL Pathway’s Training

Page: 39 of I
FUJ00000300
FUJ00000300

Scheduling and Minimum Training Compliance document reference
IM/REQ/014.

It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to provide training invitations
to a nominated contact within the Outlet 4 weeks prior to the proposed
training event. It is also the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to confirm
attendance in writing at least 1 week prior to the training event. This is
detailed in ICL Pathway’s Training Scheduling and Minimum Training
Compliance document reference IMP/REQ/014.

5. Monitoring Training Services

Monitoring of training Services will be carried out as part of the
implementation programme. It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to
supply information to the AUTHORITIES in an agreed format and to
agreed measures. This format will be subject to Change Control
Procedure.

6. Training Review Meetings
It is the CONTRACTOR’s responsibility to hold regular management
meetings to review progress and performance. This will be carried out

on a regular basis and to an agreed timetable.

Regular review meetings regarding implementation should be the
responsibility of both the CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES.

7. Escalation Procedures
Failures in Service Levels will be the responsibility of the
CONTRACTOR and the AUTHORITIES’ nominated SLA manager to
resolve.
Issues or actions which fail to be rectified will be passed to the agreed
CONTRACTOR and AUTHORITIES service management team for
escalation.

8. Change Management
Progressing (through the standard Change Control Procedure)
permanent variations to the agreed Service Levels and/or the training
Services provided will be managed as part of the implementation
programme and will be the responsibility of the CONTRACTOR.
