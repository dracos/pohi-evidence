Gareth,

Thanks for the response.

My understanding is that what we are doing here is POL independent, is not intended to be generally shared with POL,
and should not be referring to how we would support any legal cases, hence would suggest the following:

This document has been prepared to enable KPMG to propose how they may undertake an independent

assessment of data integrity controls around Horizon OnLine.andis-at breittedto Post Office fi

Stephen/Gavin — please correct me here if I have misunderstood the brief?

Our legal counsel on this is Ed Phillips, who I have copied in and who has a copy of the original document issued earlier
this week. Ed and I will support at the joint session.

Ideally, I would like to get this in the diary for later next week. I can help chase up on the mandatory reviews and sign
off’s — Torstein, Amit lan as a minimum. lan— who else should be on this?

Subject: KPMG HNGxX Integrity Review

Hi Gareth,
FUJ00243333
FUJ00243333

Stephen Long and Gavin Bell have approached me to coordinate the project to engage KPMG to provide an independent
integrity review with HNGX.

I know that lan Howard has come back to you in recent days requesting a number of updates/amendments to the
“Horizon Online Date Integrity” document that you pulled together.

The plan would be to issue this to KPMG and then to follow this up with a meeting with them to enable them to prod us
with a view to them proposing a scoping document.

A couple of things I need to do/understand:

1. Set some expectations as to when the document will be ready for distribution to KPMG
a. When do you anticipate the revised document being ready?
[GU] I have made the changes suggested, though am still targeting doc at POL as well as KPMG. I have reworded the
first para to read:

This document has been prepared for KPMG to enable scoping for an independent assessment of data integrity
controls and is also submitted to Post Office Ltd for information purposes only and without prejudice. In the
event that Post Office Ltd requires information in support of a legal case Fujitsu will issue a formal statement.

I have asked lan Howard to suggest any updates to the dlist and as soon as I have those I can send the document out
for review. If you can supply that info then fine. I have added you and Gavin to the current dlist and I suggest
someone from legal is added — do you have a name? Is it still David Jones?

b. Has this been through the mandatory reviews and necessary sign offs? Would suggest Torstein also gets

a view of this.

[GU] No. That is the process I would need to kick off. I would send it out for a 1 week review cycle to try and speed
things up. The normal problem is getting responses back from Mandatory Reviewers. Torstein has seen it and is
happy with it.

I have lined up legal to guide us through this process and to align, if and as necessary, with Post Office.

2. Ineed to pencil in a session with KPMG to enable them to probe us to enable them to raise their proposal. In
your view, who needs to be at this meeting? I would like to keep numbers this to a minimum wherever possible
~ the more people KPMG see, the more they will feel that they will need to consult....+ charge!!

[GU] Technically, probably just me. However I would appreciate some sort of Management / legal guidance in any
meeting to make sure I don’t say too much!

Could you please get back to me on these areas ASAP in order I can start setting some expectations.

Many thanks,

Mike Deaton
