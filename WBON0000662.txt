T&A
My changes attached.

From a privilege perspective, it is easier to maintain privilege over an advice note to PO that is being shared with
UKGI, rather than a note to UKGI. The problem with a note to UKGI is they are not the lawyer's (Jane's) client and so
legal advice privilege does not apply. I think this would be a document prepared for the purpose of litigation, and
therefore attract litigation privilege, but it's not 100% clear cut.

So I've added Jane's name to the note to make clear that this is a lawyer's advice note. I've also added an intro para
to make the document provenance clear.

When it is sent to UKGI, it should be sent subject to the protocol and under an email that says something like...

The attached note and any associated communications contain privileged legal advice. They are being shared with
UKGI subject to litigation privilege and without waiving any right to assert legal privilege over these communications
against any other party.

And yes, privilege always trumps FOI.

Subject: FW: Postmaster Litigation - CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE

Andy, TB
Attached is POL's proposed briefing to UKGI (shareholder) on the litigation.
TB - Dave is happy with this but given the importance please could give it a once over?

Andy - Ben B has raised a privilege query "/ know there's a framework around information sharing with UKGI —-my
immediate thought concerns the status of this document when it goes across in terms of privilege and restrictions from
subsequent disclosure by them under FO/?"

Would the framework protect the privilege over this document (some kind of commonijoint privilege)? Or does the
document become obtainable under a FOI?

Thank you both

Amy

Patrick, Mark, Amy

Please see attached first draft of the ‘more detailed’ briefing to go to UKGI (legal and shareholder teams)
tomorrow and on the detail of the judgement. I have plagiarised (sorry Amy) large sections of the advice
from last weekend from WBD.

Please let me know if there is anything else we should say, or say differently?

Ben(s), Zoe — for information only, although I thought it might help with some context ...

Thanks,

Jane
