POL has received
notification of a total
of five (5) claims from
former subpostmasters
(SPMs). Each has alleged
wrongful termination of
contract (based on (1)
alleged defects in POL’s
internal processes and
(2) alleged defects with
the Horizon system). Each
is seeking damages in the
sum of c.£150,000.

Despite reports in the
media that Shoosmiths
have consulted on a
further 85 cases, POL has
not been notified of any
additional claims.

A third party fraud
investigator is to be
appointed (following
consultation with various
MPs) to review up to 10
cases where Horizon is
alleged to have caused
the losses. It is
anticipated that no
further court action will

In respect of four of the
five claims, Shoosmiths have
not taken any further action
to date to progress the
claim, There is no
litigation in progress.

POL has been successful in
having the fifth claim
struck out and is currently
seeking costs from the

An individual has made
claims under the Equity
Act and under the Human
nts Act alleging
ability and age
iscrimination against
Shieldex Limited (the
franchisee of the branch)
and POL. Damages are
claimed, but the amount
is not specified. The
estimated potential
exposure (if the claim
succeeds) is likely to be
in the region of £6,000
to £18,000 plus costs.

If POL is found to be a
service provider under
the Equality Act and,
therefore, liable to make
reasonable adjustments,
this is likely to have
implications across the
Network.

A defence to the claim has
been filed on behalf of POL.
The franchisee (who is the
rst Defendant) has also
now filed a defence.

POL has made a “Part 20
claim” in the proceedings
against the First Defendant
under the contractual
indemnity set out in the
franchise agreement
governing the operation of
the branch. This gives POL
the option of recovering
from the First Defendant any
damages which POL is
ultimately ordered by the
Court to pay to the claimant
as a result of the First
Defendant’s actions.

A strategy to achieve early
settlement is currently
being put together with Bond
Pearce. This may potentially
involve a site visit at the
branch premises and/or
mediation. An early
settlement would be
advantageous for the
business as it will reduce
costs and remove the
litigation risk posed by
