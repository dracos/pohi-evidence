Dear Gareth,

I think you should put this in your statement. If we can show a steady rise in false inflations in the period of the
logs it will show that there was an increasing hole in the accounts that cannot be put down to the alleged thefts
by other employees.

Warwick,

I've now got a chart that shows how the Cash on Hand and In Pouches has varied during the 13 month period:

It isn’t particularly conclusive, but it does show in particular the Cash in Pouches (which includes Foreign Currency)
increasing.

I've also spotted that £3,930.07 of Euros was packed in a pouch on 7" July and there is no sign of that pouch having

been despatched from the Branch or the pouch being reversed. This accounts for some of the increase in Cash in
Pouches at TP 4.

I also have details of a few pouches which were packed before the Branch was balanced and the reversed after the
Balance was complete:

1. A Pouch for £15,000 packed on 10" October in TP 6 and Reversed on 22" October in TP 7
2. A Pouch for £18,000 packed on 14" November in TP 7 and reversed on 19" November in TP 8

I can also see that over the 13 month period that £49,120 more of Sterling was packed into a Pouch than was
despatched from the Branch. However it isn't easy to identify exactly which transactions match up and how this ties
together. Note that this includes the benefit of a Transaction Correction for £19,260 (the difference would have been
£68,380 otherwise).

Is this worth including in the Statement?

I've also received the latest copy of Charles's report, but haven't looked at it yet. I assume that you have it by now,
but can forward it if not.

Regards

Gareth

All,

It was good to meet you last night and put some faces to names and voices. Following that I've now
attempted to draft a Witness Statement as discussed.

<<0a06.Witness statement Gareth Jenkinsv0.1.doc>>

Here is a first draft, and I'd appreciate feedback as to whether I have captured your requirements as to style
and approach. I appreciate that you probably cannot comment on the factual content.

As agreed, I need to do two further pieces of analysis and I’ve indicated with highlighted comments in boxes
where I should include these. However I thought it was worth getting a first draft of the witness statement to
you before doing that so you have a chance to review the Witness Statement in parallel.

I've heard nothing further from Charles McLachlan regarding an updated version of his Report. Clearly,
should such a report appear, I may well need to update the Witness Statement to reflect any changes.
Regards

Gareth
