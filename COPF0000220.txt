Mr Lazzarin

The statement on the Tape Transcripts is an error on my part. Both statements
form part of an internal report submitted to Line Management and should have
been removed prior to submission to yourselves. The transcripts are then
submitted as productions.

These will be submitted to you with all statements.

When you ask for them to be submitted electronically are you requesting by
email or through the SRA Website where the original submission was made?
Regards

Robert
