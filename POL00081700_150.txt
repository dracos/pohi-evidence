Thank you for returning to me the amended statement. I have had a telephone conversation with Counsel
today who has suggested some further amendments for clarification purposes. Accordingly, I enclose:

1. Two clean amended copies of the witness statement for you to approve, sign it and date; and

2. A marked up version showing the changes that have been made.

Provided that you are absolutely happy with the statement, please can you sign and date it and return it

to me, retaining a copy for yourself.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible and thank you in anticipation of your assistance.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
