Hi

Thanks for forwarding on the file. Can you help me with another point please? The former agent below
has stated in her letter of complaint that she was “interviewed under caution and your investigating officer
found no evidence of any wrong doing...” . Unfortunately she has given me no more information than
that, in terms of dates, names or places. I was hoping there may have been interview transcripts in the
file but that’s not the case. I need to establish if Mrs McKnight was interviewed and if any record of that
interview exists.

Can you confirm if an interview took place please?

Regards
Wendy

Hi

Can I have the electronic investigation file for the former agent, Mrs Susan McKnight of Appley Bridge Post
Office 270 406. Her contract was terminated on 28 October 2009, if this helps?

Many Thanks

Wendy
