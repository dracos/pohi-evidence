Martin

I've read through the advice on M029. In a couple of places Harry has indicated that we should not state that. when
this case is compared to POL's current practi things would have been done differently. From the meeting with
you and Simon, my understanding was that t! ype of approach would be acceptable. Could you confirm whether
POL may proceed on this basis or whether it needs to do things differently?

This may be easier to discuss — I'm around before 10am tomorrow and then after about 3pm.

Kind regards
Andy
