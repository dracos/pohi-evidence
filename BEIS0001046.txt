In the above table:

© percentages are rounded the nearest whole number, therefore totals may not
sum due to rounding

e a full claim is defined as a claim which DBT considers, with advice from its
legal advisors, does not need any further evidence in order to assess every
element of the claim. Should the Department consider further evidence is
needed in order to make a full assessment, the 40-working day target will not
start until such time that the required evidence is received from the claimant
or any other source
