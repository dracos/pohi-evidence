Comparison SR1.docx

All
Please find attached the re-drafted spot reviews for your comment.
SRs 11, 12 and 13 have been amended as discussed at our meeting.

SR1 is largely as per Gareth's first draft. I've attached a comparison document showing my changes. My key
amendments have been to:

e Insert an executive summary at the beginning.
e  Re-draft the final section on provision of raw Horizon data
e A few changes to section 5 to reinforce our key points.

Front pages

I've added a front cover page to each SR so we can track versions and make sure that each SR is properly signed off
before submission to Second Sight. I've added a list of people who need to approve each submission — happy to amend
this list if you think a different people should be included.

Comment process
All comments on the SRs are welcomed. I suggest that any comments are fed in as follows:

e Please send any comments/mark-ups of the responses directly to me (only copying the wider group if absolutely
necessary — this should help with version control, prevent flooding everyone's inboxes and most importantly
make it easier to assert that every draft is legally privileged)

e I'd be grateful if any changes to the documents are marked as "track changes" just to make them easier to
follow.

e Please provide your comments/amendments by close on Thursday 25 April (Simon — does this date work with
the wider timetable?)

e I will then collate all amendments and comments into final versions and re-circulate for approval.

Kind regards
Andy
