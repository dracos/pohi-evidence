Hi Angela
For info..

Today I have received the ARQ logs from fujitsu for Lepton. I can clearly see the recovery entry on the
events logs. Please let me know if you need sight of these, although it only mirrors what Gareth sent in an
earlier email.

I have emailed Gareth to see if this information is always visible to us in our ARQ requests or if it is
something he has requested to be added on separately for me following our various emails.

My biggest concern for my role is not what has happened, as I am sure that horizon has corrected a
connection failure as it should, but is the fact that we cannot see this in credence. Or even more worrying
the recovery session is showing as a normal existing reversal rather than a system recovery reversal on the
data we can see.

It certainly has been an eye-opener for me as I was confident from what I could see that this was reversed
at the office (which is what our credence data indicated) and I would appreciate being kept involved in this
case to the end purely for experience and knowledge.

Many thanks
