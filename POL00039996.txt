Andy — we received a letter from the CRCC yesterday which I have asked Cartwright King to review......their advice feels
odd to me as if given on a take it or leave it basis and I am not comfortable that’s particularly useful in this

context. Could we discuss, I am happy to go to another firm that specialises in Criminal law or a barrister, somehow it
feels as if there is a conflict here which I am not sure I understand.

Thanks
