Subject: TELEPHONE CONFERENCE WITH BAQC

‘Parsons, Andrew'; Rodric Williams

Andy/Gavin/Rodric

During the conference call with BAQC yesterday.

The advice of Counsel Simon Clarke was discussed. I note that BAQC confirmed that Simons advice was entirely
correct and that he observed Anthony Hooper’s was simply wrong. Applicants for mediation do not require anonymity
and should not be disclosed in every case through the opening of warehouse doors. Disclosure decisions are made on
case by case basis .

BAQC agreed that CK should receive on mediation

1.Applications

2.Questionaires

3.Draft responses

4.POL summary-- CK on review to decide whether they require any further information on case by case basis.

5.BAQC —Also advised that Criminal Lawyer needs to be part of the Mediation team.

Also debate was had with regards to the information held by second sight(SS). It had previously been understood that
SS held information that may be useful to the defendants in
POL00146859
POL00146859

general and I explained the need for POL to obtain and review that information as quickly as possible. BAQC initially
agreed with that stance. Prospect of sending a letter to SS was discussed. BAQC agreed this would be sensible
approach. However on further discussion it transpired that ,Lawyers from BD may will have misunderstood SS and
might will have been restricted to one case only in the mediation process. In those circumstances BAQC decided he
would want to see the originals minute of the meeting before advising further.
