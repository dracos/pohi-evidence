Lucy,
Attached is the scan of the witness statement signed by Andy Dunks, and the same in Word format.

Just to clarify, Andy just confirmed to me that the first retrieval was supplied to WBD on CD, and to Gareth by loading
to a laptop; the second request was supplied to Gareth on a CD, but not to WBD. So factually the statement is correct
in both cases.

Lucy,

Section now reads as follows (and as attached)

ete. newsomer

FUJ00160649

FUJ00160649

Is it correct that a CD was produced

1. A request was received on 3rd Oct 2018 and asked for information in connection with the Post Offices at

Caddington, Spencefield, Newport and Fleckney. A further request was received on 29 October for information

in connection with the Post Offices at Sandsacre, Cottingley, Lenzie, Barkham and Charlton. I undertook

extractions of data held on the Horizon System and followed the procedure outlined above.

I produced a CD

containing the required data. No data was provided for Alan Bates as this information was too old to have been

retained, and in the case of Mohammad Sabir, the issues related to the Cottingley branch and therefore the

information provided was specifically in relation to this branch only.

Does it need to be signed today, or can that be done on Monday?

Hi Matthew,
That looks fine — can you add the following to your suggested paragraph:

No data was provided for Alan Bates as this information was too old and in the case of Mohammad Sabir, the issues
related to the Cottingley branch and therefore information provided was specifically in relation to this branch.

Thanks,

Lucy,
Apologies, to include the second request suggest insertion of the following highlighted sentence:

7. A request was received on 3rd Oct 2018 and asked for information in connection with the Post Offices at

I undertook extractions of
FUJ00160649

data held on the Horizon System and followed the procedure outlined above. I produced a CD containing the required
data.

Nothing was provided for Craig-y-Don (Bates) as it was too old. In the case of Sabir, the issues all related to
Cottingley, so nothing was provided for Crossflats.

Request 1:
Caddington (Latif)
Spencefield (Patney)

Request 2:

Sandsacre (Stockdale)

Matthew,

I attach an updated witness statement from Andy Dunks, which we have put into our house style and removed some of
the background sections on Horizon. I note we also asked for this to cover the ARQ data extracted for the lead
claimants (Bates, Stubbs etc.) and this has not been covered in the attached. Please can wording be added ASAP to
deal with this.

_} Lenton,

Hi Jason,
Matthew Lenton (copied) provided us with a CD of ARQ data relating to the following Subpostmasters:

1. Anup Patny — Spencefield ~ Fad: 515217
. Adrees Latif - Caddington — Fad: 0561347
3. Angela Burke — Newport (note: she alleges she was a Branch Assistant at Newport and that her husband,
Chris Burke, was the Subpostmaster (he is not a claimant)) — Fad: 216321
4, Jayesh Tank — Fleckney — Fad: 197217

Data on Setpal Singh was not provided as it was too old. This has been loaded onto our High Q site. Let me know if
you need access to this or whether Matthew can provide you with the material.

We are chasing down the information on the lead claimants.
Kind regards,

Lucy

We can supply witness statements but I need to be clear on exactly which set of data it relates

I need to know the FAD codes, date range(s) of the data ans when and to who it was supplied to

please.
I need this level of detail so it can be included in the witness statements.

Dave,

As you may recall, Torstein described the process by which audit data is retrieved in paragraphs 30 to 33 of his first
witness statement (attached).

We need a witness statement from the person or persons that retrieved the ARQ Data in relation to the Lead
Claimants (Bates, Stubbs etc.) and the Subpostmaster Evidence (Singh, Tank, Burke etc.) so that they can confirm
that none of the integrity checks described by Torstein revealed any issues when the ARQ Data was pulled. Can you
let me know who can speak to this please? It is very unlikely that they will be called as a witness at the trial due to the
brevity of their statement.

Feel free to give me a call to discuss.

Kind regards
Jonny
