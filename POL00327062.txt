Dear Laura,
I have heard back from Dr Dulay, who has booked a meeting room in room 554, Huxley Building.
Building 13 on the following map.

If Mr Clarke and Mr Smith head to the reception of the Huxley Building, there will be somebody there who
can assist them.

Please feel free to pass on my telephone number below to Mr Clarke or Mr Smith in case they encounter any
delays whilst travelling. If they would prefer, I would be more than happy to meet with them beforehand,
and walk with them to the meeting location. Please let me know.

Best wishes,
Rosemary

Hello Rosemary

That’s excellent news. Would 11.30am on the 234 suit Dr Dulay? Mr Clarke and Mr Smith
are travelling from the Midlands and so would be able to accommodate any time from
11.30 onwards.

I will inform Mr Clarke as to Prof Wolfe’s unavailability and will check whether that
causes any issue. It might be that all matters can be resolved at the meeting with Dr Dulay
on the 23" in any event. Thank you for letting me know.

Kind regards

Subject: Meeting Request

Dear Rosemary

Thank you once again for providing the CVs of Professor Wolfe and Dr Dulay. I have been
asked by senior counsel instructed in this matter, Mr Simon Clarke, whether Professor
Wolfe and Dr Dulay would be available for a meeting in the near future so that he can
discuss the nature of the instruction in more detail? My colleague, Martin Smith who is the
lead solicitor in this case will also be in attendance.

POL00327062
POL00327062

As eluded to previously, the instruction is on behalf of a major public institution in a case
that has and will continue to attract national coverage. The remit for the instruction is
potentially very extensive and time consuming. We therefore would like the opportunity
to have a face to face meeting with both experts to discuss the potential way forward.

Mr Clarke and Mr Smith are very happy to attend at the Imperial campus for the sake of
convenience. Both Mr Clarke and Mr Smith would be available Monday 23" September if
this would be a suitable date to Professor Wolfe and Dr Dulay. I would therefore be
grateful if you could confirm whether Professor Wolfe and Dr Dulay are happy to meet
and, if so, if this date is convenient. If this would not be suitable for either or both experts
please could you advise of alternative dates in September.

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to give me a call should you
wish to discuss further.

Kind regards

Laura
