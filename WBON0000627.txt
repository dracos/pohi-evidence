I'm using Katie for everything new.

Michael is updating the plan (current version attached). Work is currently allocated as follows:-

Angela vd B — Ed/Katie/me;
Steve Parker — me;
Torstein — Lucy;

Catherine Hamilton — Katie;
Paul Smith — Lucy;

Dave Johnson 2 — Emma;

Alison B —- Emma.

Emma is busy with something that she's working on with RDC, but otherwise I'd say this is top priority.

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Thanks

Have you got all the help you need?

Is the Horizon evidence number 1 priority for everyone?

My feeling is that the team should be near full-time on this for the next 2 weeks? Is that happening? If not, how can I
make that happen?

Katie has loads of capacity so use her for everything.
