Angela

Please find attached the latest draft of your statement. All comments welcomed. This has been restructured from the
last version you saw, added a number of new sections and have cut out some material to make it shorter / where we
have considered material to be to far over the line of admissibility.

Rod — your comments also welcomed. In particular, there are some comments marked in green for your attention.

Kind regards
Andy
