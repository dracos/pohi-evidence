Introduction

1. On the first day of Ms Vennells’ oral evidence, Counsel to the Inquiry (“CTI”) asked her
why she had not known about the bugs and defects in Horizon before 2018. When it was
suggested that she ought to have been able to work out the truth from the documents

which POL held, Ms Vennells candidly accepted:

“You're right and I didn’t. There is an issue of unknown unknowns. If you don’t
know something exists, it’s difficult to ask questions about it. That is why the
importance of governance, particularly around corporate memory on bad things,
rather than good things... is important to have. I simply didn’t have that

information.

2. Throughout Ms Vennells’ written and oral evidence, borne out through the documents
and evidence of others which have been adduced during the Inquiry, there has been
nothing to show that she acted in bad faith. Ms Vennells wanted to do right by the sub-
postmasters, whose “contribution to the continued turnaround of the Post Office cannot

be overstated”?

3. Ms Vennells accepts that she did not manage to uncover the truth about the matters before
the Inquiry, because she herself was not told about issues which may have allowed her

to do so. As she said in evidence:

“T worked as hard as I could and to the best of my ability, and I am very sorry that
I was not able to find out what the Inquiry has found out. I don't know today how
much wasn't told to me. I do know information that I didn't get and I don't know,
in some cases, why it didn't reach me. But my only motivation was for the best for
the Post Office, and for the hundreds of postmasters that I met, and I regret deeply
that I let these people down.”

4. Ms Vennells apologises unreservedly to all those who are affected by the matters which

this Inquiry is investigating.

5. These written submissions do not seek to address every matter with which Ms Vennells
was involved and on which the Inquiry has heard evidence; Ms Vennells gave two written
statements totalling 888 pages, and even those could not purport to be a complete account

of all of Ms Vennells’ work in respect of Horizon. Instead, these submissions address

2 (POL00256015)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

matters where, on behalf of Ms Vennells, we consider the evidence is particularly
nuanced or requires a close reading of documents rather than a reliance on witness

accounts. The submissions are broadly arranged in chronological order.

6. Before turning to those submissions on the chronology of Ms Vennells’ involvement, Ms

Vennells makes some submissions of general application.
Role of the CEO

7. The Inquiry’s Governance experts described fourteen ways in which a CEO is

accountable to the Board. Three of those responsibi

b) Running the Company and its business, providing operational leadership,
management and oversight of all functions departments and delegations;

c) Creating an organisation structure, and as appropriate restructure, which is fit
for purpose for the business, reflecting strategy, priorities and risk, so that
appropriate operational oversight and direct management is secured and
maintained;

d) Ensuring an organisation structure in which all employees know to whom
they are accountable, with ultimate Executive accountability resting with the
CEO.

8. Ms Vennells agrees with these principles. She does not seek to avoid the reality that, as
CEO, she was the holder of w/timate Executive accountability but that should not be
confused with an obligation on Ms Vennells to make every decision personally, or even
to make every key decision personally, or even to be briefed in detail on the basis for

every key decision taken under some delegated authority.

9. Throughout the matters addressed in these submissions, Ms Vennells relied appropriately
on briefings, reports and advice from her senior colleagues. Ms Vennells relied on IT
specialists, reporting directly to her, to brief her on matters relating to Horizon integrity
issues (see eg [29], [192] — [194] below); she relied on her general counsel (see [107],
[120], [291], [297] below); she relied on the Company Secretary, particularly in her
dealings with Second Sight, and was entitled to expect material information to be passed

back to her (see [203] below); she relied on the professional opinion of the team of

3 (EXPG0000006/28)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

specialists tasked with addressing the Spot Reviews within the Working Group (see [154]

below).

10. That the information passed to Ms Vennells was incomplete or wrong, or that information
was not passed to Ms Vennells at all, does not equate, without more, to a failure on Ms

Vennells’ part.
Evidence
Witnesses

11. Although not binding on the Inquiry (but nonetheless highly persuasive given the context
of the Inquiry), CPR PD 57AC on Trial witne.

tatements in the Business and Property
Courts says this about the approach of a Tribunal to assessing witness evidence at

Appendix 1.3:

1.3 Witnesses of fact and those assisting them to provide a trial witness statement
should understand that when assessing witness evidence the approach of the
court is that human memory:

(1) is not a simple mental record of a witnessed event that is fixed at the time of
the experience and fades over time, but

(2) is a fluid and malleable state of perception concerning an individual’s past
experiences, and therefore

(3) is vulnerable to being altered by a range of influences, such that the
individual may or may not be conscious of the alteration.

12. This reflects some of the principles set out by Leggatt J in Gestmin SGPS S.A v Credit
Suisse [2013] EWCA 3650 (Comm). Leggatt J warned that tribunals ought:

[22] “... to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence
in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based recollection provides any
reliable guide to the truth.”

13. Leggatt J instead expressed the view that “the best approach for a judge to adopt in the
trial of a commercial case”: was “to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses’
recollection of what was said in meetings and conversations and to base factual findings

on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts.”

6
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Given the subject matter of this Inquiry, and the volume of contemporaneous
documentation, particularly insofar as Phases 5, 6 and 7 are concerned, these principles

are of direct application.
Documents

14. Throughout the Inquiry, CTI have shown a preference, appropriately, for the evidence of
contemporaneous documents* rather than witness accounts of events which are one or
two decades old. That contemporaneous documents are the primary source of reliable
evidence in this Inquiry should be borne in mind, in two regards, when considering

evidence concerning Ms Vennells.

a. First, as Ms Vennells recognised in her written statement, it is unrealistic that she
might remember specific conversations and meetings during her time at POL,
however weighty the subject matter. Ms Vennells’ evidence was significantly
based upon the documents which had been disclosed to her and which she had spent
much time considering before preparing her written evidence and giving her oral

evidence.

b. Second, when witnesses have given evidence of matters relevant to Ms Vennells
without there being support in contemporaneous documents, this evidence should
be approached cautiously. It is inevitable, having regard to the very human desire
for self-preservation, that witnesses will now seek to distance themselves from Ms
Vennells (whether deliberately or unconsciously), given her portrayal in the media

as being responsible for the failings of POL. For example:

i Ms Swinson said in her oral evidence that Ms Vennells “knew about the
Clarke Advice”.© When questioned on behalf of Ms Vennells, Ms Swinson
conceded that this assertion was based on a single email,’ which Ms Swinson
had not seen at the time.* That email does not withstand the weight which Ms

Swinson seeks to load upon it.

In her oral evidence, Dame Moya Greene discussed a text message she sent
to Ms Vennells on 31 January 2024 stating: “I don’t know what to say. I think
you knew...” (PVEN00000532). Dame Moya gave an unclear answer as to
what she believed Ms Vennells knew. This comment was based solely on
what she believed had come out during the Inquiry: 19 July 2024 189:1-
189:25 (INQ00001178). A subsequent text message Dame Moya sent to Ms
Vennells on 2 February 2024 (PVEN00000531) suggests that her 31 January
text message may have been sent in the heat of a moment and did not reflect
her view of Ms Vennells: "I am listening to the closing statements. So wrong...
so many people ruined. So many liars. What I will always say ..is you were
a fabulous person ..When I could not get people paid, I called you and asked
you to keep post offices open so we could get checks in hand. You did not

hesitate.. you always helped.”

As discussed in paragraph [250] below, Lesley Sewell claims that she was
angry when she discovered from the Deloitte assurance work in 2014 that
Fujitsu had used a Balancing Transaction procedure to insert a transaction
into branch accounts and that she escalated the matter to Ms Vennells, the
GC, and Fujitsu. There is no evidence of this. What the documentary
evidence does show, is that Ms Sewell was the co-author (with the GC, Mr
Aujard) of an email to the Board which did not mention the Balancing
Transaction function and mentioned only the helpful and positive aspects of

Deloitte’s conclusions.

In 966 of his witness statement (WITN00420100) Ian Henderson of Second
Sight stated that, in 2013, Ms Vennells “was increasingly attempting to steer
us away from considering the safety of convictions”. When Mr Henderson
was asked about this comment in his oral evidence, he stated that he could
not remember precisely what Ms Vennells did to steer Second Sight away
from considering the safety of convictions: 18 June 2024: 87:11-87:25
(INQ00001162). Mr Henderson made a similar comment at {142 of his
witness statement that Ms Vennells “frequently and consistently attempted
to steer Second Sight away from investigating potential miscarriages of

justice.” When Mr Henderson was asked “In what context did Ms Vennells
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

frequently and consistently attempt to steer Second Sight away from

investigating potential miscarriages of justice?” he answered:

“The first thing I'd say is we had relatively little direct contact with Paula. I mean,
she certainly took part in some of the telephone calls, conference calls. The words
that I'd quoted were made in evidence to the Select Committee but, through
Angela van den Bogerd, and so on, and through their actions, in terms of making
documents available, there was clearly a problem in Post Office's mind with the
mediation of criminal convictions.”

The documentary evidence does not support the assertion in Mr Henderson’s

witness statement.

v. (POL00101367) is an email Ms Vennells sent to Mr Aujard and others on 17
September 2014, in which she summarised what she clearly viewed as a
constructive conversation she had had with Kay Linnell of the JFSA. Ms
Vennells and Ms Linnell had met by chance in Bonn airport, and the email
appears to have been written on the day of the conversation. In §§91-96 of
her witness statement (WITN00550100) Ms Linnell states that the email
contains statements which are “absolute rubbish” and that the email shows
that Ms Vennells “recorded conversations in a completely fabricated way.”
These comments are based on Ms Linnell’s reaction to seeing a record of a
conversation that had occurred 10 years previously. Ms Vennells’ email on
the other hand is contemporaneous. It is submitted that the vitriol with which
Ms Linnell has attacked Ms Vennells is likely to be driven by hindsight,

rather than Ms Linnell’s actual recollection of the conversation.

vi. In his witness statement at 61 (WITN11130100), Mr Young stated that,
shortly before he left POL in 2012, he became concerned by the number of
complaints by SPMs and concluded that there should be a review of the
quality of the Horizon code. There is no documentary evidence that he shared
his alleged concern, or the need for a review of the software code, with Ms
Vennells or the Board. Indeed, his witness statement tacitly suggests that he
did not: he states in §61 that “I was expecting to sit down with both Tait and

Vennells to inform them that we needed to review the quality of the Horizon

° 18 June 2024 88:24-89:10 (INQ00001162)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Online code; however, we never met before I left POL.” The last document
relating to Horizon that Mr Young authored before he left POL is a draft
noting paper on Horizon to the Board dating from March 2012
(POL00142856). The document focussed on system outages and service
level deficiencies. It does not mention that Mr Young was concerned that

SPM complaints might be linked to problems in the Horizon software.

vii. Sir Anthony Hooper stated in his evidence that he told Ms Vennells and, he
believed, Ms Perkins, that it was unlikely that the cause of the losses suffered
by POL was theft by SPMs'” He also said!': “My view, and by the middle of
2014, was there was likely to have been serious miscarriages of justice. My
initial view was that it was very unlikely that these people had stolen money
remained.” These comments are not supported by documentary evidence and
in some ways are inconsistent with the documents, as addressed below at
4[259]. It is probable that if, by the middle of 2014, Sir Anthony had been of
the view that there had been serious miscarriages of justice, he would have

made that position clear to those at POL, Second Sight and the JFSA.

15. It is submitted that where there is a dispute in respect of witnesses’ recollections, the

evidence from contemporaneous documents is likely to be of most assistance to the

Inquiry.
Experts

16. The Governance expert evidence is helpful to the Inquiry in identifying and explaining
guidance on governance and what the experts regard as reasonable practice in

governance, management, and leadership.

17. It was not the role of the experts to establish matters of fact, and they were not instructed
to do so: 12 November 2024 16:17-17:5 (INQ00001206). Their Second Governance
Report, including their appraisals of the three case studies, was based on the experts’
selection of evidence from the material to which they had been given access, including
witness statements, transcripts of oral evidence and some of the underlying

contemporaneous material: 12 November 2024 17:23-18:3 (INQ00001206). In

‘© 10 April 2024 134:12-135:6 (INQ00001127)
‘110 April 2024: 174:11 — 174:14 (INQ00001127)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

paragraph 8 of their Second Governance Report, the experts made the fair statement that:
“Through our selection of evidence and cases we aim to illustrate the way board
governance and executive leadership impacts matters with which the Inquiry is engaged.
In being selective of themes and evidence, we appreciate there may be additional or
alternative constructions based on the body of evidence before the Inquiry which we have
not considered.” In her oral evidence, Dame Sandra Dawson stated that the experts could
not know whether they had conducted an exhaustive examination of the material in

relation to the three case studies: 12 November 2024 18:19-19:7 (INQ00001206).

18. The experts were formally appointed on 1 December 2023, since which time a further
154,872 documents have been disclosed to Core Participants. Since they produced their
first report on 26 March 2024, 89,835 documents have been disclosed. When the experts
prepared their reports, and gave oral evidence to the Inquiry, they did not have the benefit
of a detailed forensic analysis of (a) all of the information that was known or available to
Ms Vennells; (b) the advice that Ms Vennells received from lawyers and other specialist
advisors; or (c) what Ms Vennells did on the basis of that knowledge and advice. They
were not therefore in a position to identify or opine on any alleged failings by Ms

Vennells or other individuals at POL.

Disclosure to the Inquiry

19. Ms Vennells has extended all possible assistance to the Inquiry, transparently and in a

straightforward way.

20. On 21 July 2022, the solicitor for Ms Vennells wrote to the Inquiry, stating that Ms
Vennells was in possession of relevant documents which she wished to disclose pursuant
to the Inquiry's Protocol on the disclosure of documents issued under the authority of the
Chair on 28 July 2021 (“Disclosure Protocol”). The correspondence stated that “rather
than await a Rule 9 request, our client wishes to proactively disclose all relevant

documents in her possession, custody or control pursuant to paragraph 5 of the

Disclosure Protocol.” As part of this proposed disclosure, the solicitor informed the
Inquiry that they had obtained an image of Ms Vennells’ mobile telephone and had
obtained all emails held from her personal email account for the period 1 January 2007

to the time of writing. The letter provided the Inquiry with a list of proposed keyword
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

search terms which the solicitor intended to use to interrogate that data, in order to

identify material, which it was anticipated the Inquiry would wish to receive.

21. The Inquiry indicated that it did not wish to receive disclosure save in response to Rule

9 requests and did not ask for any data from Ms Vennells’ electronic devices.

22. No Rule 9 request has ever been received specifically for data from Ms Vennells’
electronic devices. Nonetheless, Ms Vennells disclosed a series of electronic documents
to the Inquiry with her written witness evidence, where the documents were considered
to be of relevance to the questions raised in that Rule 9 request for evidence (first doing
so by list and giving the Inquiry the opportunity to identify which copies it wished to

receive).

23. On 19 April 2024, the Inquiry disclosed the witness statement of Ms Sewell. !? Ms Sewell
mentioned, at §{§778-80, communications with Ms Vennells. This prompted Ms Vennells’
solicitor to carry out additional targeted keyword searches against the data from Ms
Vennells’ devices, and further material was offered to the Inquiry. She has disclosed
further batches of electronic documents, mainly communications with personal and

professional associates, on a voluntary basis.

24. The Inquiry has disclosed almost 1,000 of Ms Vennells’ personal documents to Core

Participants. She has been transparent with the Inquiry throughout.

Beds And Remote Access — Network Period

25. In this section, Ms Vennells addresses the key incidents which shed light, or have been
alleged to shed light, on her knowledge of BEDs, Horizon integrity, and remote access
during her time as Network Director (January 2007 to April 2010) and COO (April to
October 2010).

26. Ms Vennells’ responsibilities as Network Director did not include POL’s IT systems.
This was the role of the Operations Director. As shown on pages 26 to 35 of an
organisation chart created in 2009 (POL00043805), POL’s IT managers and staff,

including technical IT specialists, reported directly or indirectly to the then Operations

2 (WITN00840100)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Director, Mike Young. He reported directly to the MD, Alan Cook. Mr Young has
confirmed that it was his responsibility to ensure that IT-related issues were resolved and
that the Board was notified of IT issues which required its input or oversight.'* Although
Mr Young’s title changed over time, he remained the most senior manager with

responsibility for IT until he left POL in March 2012.'4

27. Mr Young said that he was only ever aware of two BEDs in Legacy Horizon (Blue Screen
errors and ISDN errors).'* The only BEDs he was aware of in relation to HNGX were
BEDs which affected the Oracle database during the test and the pilot rollout of HNGX.'°
He said he had no knowledge of any BEDs that would have caused transaction or
reconciliation errors in branch accounts.'” The only occasion mentioned in his witness
statement on which he escalated concerns about Horizon integrity to the Board or the ET
was when he alerted Mr Cook and the ET about the Computer Weekly article in May
2009.'8

28. Mr Young made and supported comments which asserted that Horizon was reliable. For

example:

a. Mr Young said that he was contacted by Computer Weekly prior to the publication
of the article in May 2009. He recalls providing a comment to the effect that
Horizon was a reliable system and that there were no issues — a comment which
Computer Weekly quoted in the article.'? The only comment from POL in the
article (POL00041564), which must therefore be the comment from Mr Young,

states as follows:

“Horizon is an extremely robust system which operates over our entire Post
Office network and successfully records millions of transactions every day.
There is no evidence that points to any fault with the technology. We would

always look into and investigate any issues raised by sub-postmasters.

b. During his oral evidence, it was put to Mr Young that he supported the “robust
lines” given to Parliament in 2011 in support of Horizon: 15 October 2024 123:5-
123:21 (INQ00001196). The document to which Mr Young was taken during this
part of his evidence (POL00295067) shows that, on 18 November 2011, Mr Young
approved the “approach and wording” of a draft letter from Ms Vennells (as the

MD) in response to parliamentary questions by Mike Weir MP (POL00295066).

c. The letter from Ms Vennells that was sent to Mr Weir MP on I December 2011
(POL00001976) stated that Horizon had been “rigorously tested” and that “there
is no evidence at all that the Horizon system has in some way been at fault with
respect to any financial irregularities discovered in a subpostmaster’s account and

no cases have been abandoned for reason of any doubt about that system”.

29. Ms Vennells refers to these documents, not to single out Mr Young but to illustrate a
fundamental point about her position in relation to IT, both as Network Director and in
her subsequent roles. Ms Vennells had no background in IT and was never employed by
POL in an IT role. POL had an IT department, which included IT technical specialists,
and senior managers (e.g. Mr Young and later Ms Sewell) whose role was to keep the
Board and the ET informed of important IT matters. Ms Vennells relied, and submits that
she was entitled to rely, on POL’s IT function to provide accurate information to her, to

the Board, and to the ET, in relation to the Horizon integrity issues.

The Computer Weekly article in May 2009

30. Ms Vennells has said that she was not aware of allegations that Horizon contained BEDs
or lacked integrity until the publication of the Computer Weekly article in May 2009.°
Although a document disclosed after she made her first witness statement shows that Ms
Vennells was informed in April 2009 that three MPs had challenged Horizon in
correspondence, the evidence shows that Ms Vennells is correct that she was not aware

of allegations of Horizon integrity until around the time of the Computer Weekly article:

a. Two documents written by senior POL managers strongly suggest that allegations
about Horizon integrity had little prominence in the business between 2007 and

mid-2009. In 2009, David Smith wrote that the success of POL’s claim against Lee

2° PV WS 1 {112 (WITN01020100)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Castleton in January 2007 had “‘killed’ the noise” until the Computer Weekly
article appeared in May 2009 (POL00090575). An email by Alan Cook on 15
October 2009 (POL00165911) suggests that he regarded concerns about Horizon
integrity as a recent development: “For some strange reason there is a steadily
building nervousness about the accuracy of the Horizon system and the press are
on it as well now. It is the more strange in that the system has been stable and
reliable for many years now and there is absolutely no logical reason why these

fears should now develop.”

b. There appear to be no records of the Board or the ET discussing allegations about
BEDs or Horizon integrity between January 2007 and mid-2009. It is Mr Young’s
evidence that he was not aware of concems about Horizon integrity until he was
contacted by Computer Weekly shortly before the publication of the article in May
2009.7!

c. The first indication in the documents of Ms Vennells being made aware of concerns
about Horizon integrity is a comment in the Network Functional Report for April
2009 (POL00095533) that: “We have had our 3“ request in the past few months
from individual MPs on behalf of subpostmasters relating to Horizon integrity
(Legal advice is that we have no reason to doubt the system’s integrity and this has

been tested in the courts).”

d.  Anemail dated 15 April 2009 from Mark Wright to Ms Vennells (POL00378170)
contains answers to questions from Ms Vennells about the April 2009 board pack.
While Ms Vennells’ questions do not appear in disclosure, Mr Wright’s email
contains an explanation of what was meant by “Horizon integrity”: “this involves
cases where a small number of MP's (3) have sought to challenge on behalf of
suspended subpostmasters the integrity of Horizon on the back of losses /

accounting issues."

31. Mr Wright’s email suggests that Ms Vennells had queried the comment about Horizon

integrity in the Network Functional Report because she was unfamiliar with the issue.

32. The Computer Weekly article was published on 11 May 2009 (POL00041564). The
article was based on case studies of seven SPMs (including Alan Bates, Lee Castleton
and Jo Hamilton) who claimed that the Horizon system had caused the shortfalls for
which POL had pursued them for repayment. As mentioned above, it included a comment

from POL which can only have come from Mr Young:

“Horizon is an extremely robust system which operates over our entire Post
Office network and successfully records millions of transactions every day.
There is no evidence that points to any fault with the technology. We would
always look into and investigate any issues raised by sub-postmasters.””

33. Ms Vennells does not remember reading the Computer Weekly article in 2009 but
believes that she did so, as it was usual to circulate media clippings to the ET.” She
recalls that Mr Young discussed the article at an ET meeting and that he gave assurances
that the article was not a cause for concern and that there was nothing wrong with the

system.?>

34. Mr Young agrees with Ms Vennells that he spoke about the article at an ET meeting.
Though his recollection differs as to how he characterised Computer Weekly at the
meeting”, he does not appear to deny stating words to the effect that there was nothing
wrong with the system. It is likely that he did so. Since the Computer Weekly article was
the first significant public challenge to the Horizon system in years, and the first that Mr
Young was aware of, it would have been odd if Mr Young had not given the ET his view
on the validity of the allegations. Furthermore, Mr Young had vouched for the reliability

of Horizon in his comment to Computer Weekly.

The Porteous correspondence in May 2009

35. Shortly before the publication of the article, Mr Cook was asked by Robert Porteous,
Private Secretary to the Minister for Employment and Postal Affairs, to look into
allegations that Rebecca Thomson, the author of the Computer Weekly article, had raised
with her MP, Brian Binley:

2 PV WS1 115 (WITN01020100)
2 PV WS 113-115 (WITN01020100)

16
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. On 10 February 2009, Ms Thomson sent an email to Mr Binley MP
(POL00027890) stating that she had talked to several current and former SPMs
“who say that random flaws in the IT are causing deficits in their weekly accounts”
and that “instead of listening to their problems and investigating the software or
equipment [POL] is making them pay back this money without any investigation

into what is going wrong.”

b. On 24 February 2009, Mr Binley MP wrote to the minister, Pat McFadden MP,
enclosing a copy of Ms Thomson’s email (POL00027890) and asking the minister
to address the points she had raised. Mr Porteous wrote to Mr Cook on 30 April
2009 enclosing Mr Binley MP’s letter and Ms Thomson’s email (POL00027890).
He asked Mr Cook to look into the matters raised by Ms Thomson and to reply to
Mr Binley MP directly. The letter was stamped as received by Mr Cook’s office on
7 May 2009.

c. On 7 May 2009, Michele Graves (POL Executive Correspondence Manager)
emailed Mr Porteous’s letter to Andy McLean (the Head of Service Delivery in the
Operations department), stating that she was keen to have a “robust response” given
the potential for publicity (POL00114930). Subsequent emails in the chain at
POL00114930 show that it was intended that Mr Mclean would work on POL’s
reply to Mr Binley MP with assistance from POL and RMG legal. Ms Vennells is
not copied into the chain and is not mentioned in it. There is no evidence that she
saw the letter from Mr Porteous, or that she was consulted about or saw POL’s

response.

d. Mr Cook wrote to Mr Binley MP on 22 May 2009 (POL00130687). He stated that
“No evidence...has been found that shows the Horizon system has caused the
errors to occur” and that “I am satisfied that there is no evidence to doubt the

integrity of the Horizon system and that it is robust and fit for purpose.”

36. Mr Cook stated in his witness statement that Ms Vennells and Mr McLean were fully
aware and supportive of POL’s response to the letter from Mr Porteous, though he

conceded that he could not remember what POL’s response to the letter was.?° It is

°5 Alan Cook WS 483 (WITN00190100)
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

submitted that little weight should be placed on this comment, made 15 years after the

events with no evidence to support it.

37. Mr Cook gave generally unreliable evidence about Ms Vennells’ role. He suggested in
his oral evidence that it is likely that Ms Vennells authorised POL’s legal expenditure for
its claim against Mr Castleton in 2006: 12 April 2024 104:7-105:14 (INQ00001129).
This is impossible: Ms Vennells did not join POL until January 2007, by which time the
trial in the Castleton case had almost concluded.”® Mr Cook also seems to have believed
or assumed, erroneously, that Ms Vennells worked in Operations and, therefore, that it
was part of her role to alert the Board to the existence of BEDs: see 12 April 2024
176:12-176:19 (INQ00001129).”’ It is clear from the documents that the task of putting
together a response to the Porteous letter was allocated to Mr McLean, who was a senior

IT manager. There is no evidence that Ms Vennells was involved.

38. Whether or not Horizon had integrity was beyond Ms Vennells’ managerial role and
expertise. To the extent that Ms Vennells was explicitly supportive of POL’s response to
Mr Binley MP (for which there is no documentary evidence) it could only have been on
the basis that POL believed that its statements about the reliability of Horizon were

accurate.

The Ismay Report

39. On 10 August 2010, Rod Ismay (head of P&BA) produced a report entitled “Horizon —
Response to Challenges Regarding Systems integrity” (POL00090574) (the “Ismay
Report”). The executive summary to the Ismay Report asserted that POL could be

confident in the integrity of Horizon:

“The allegations to which we are responding follow on from cases where
thousands of pounds were missing at audit. We remain satisfied that this money
was missing due to theft in the branch - we do not believe the account balances
against which the audits were conducted were corrupt.

26 The hearing dates in the trial were 6th, 8th, 11th, 12th, 13th December 2006; 11th January 2007. Judgment was
handed down on 22 January 2007.

27 Mr Cook stated “...the Operations Team, whether that was David Miller, Ric Francis or Paula Vennells, they
attended lots of different meetings. I do not recall them doing that, [drawing his attention to BEDs] no.” Mr Miller
was the former COO of POL who retired in 2006, before Ms Vennells joined in 2007. Mr Francis was Mr Young’s
predecessor as Operations Director.

18
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

POL has extensive controls spanning systems, processes, training and support.
Horizon is robust, but like any system depends on the quality of entries by the
users. Horizon Online builds on this and brings benefits to running costs and
change management. It is not being done because of any doubt about the
integrity of Horizon.

The integrity of Horizon is founded on its tamper proof logs, its real time back
ups and the absence of “backdoors” so that all data entry or acceptance is at
branch level and is tagged against the log on ID of the user. This means that
ownership of the accounting is truly at branch level.”

40. The Ismay Report was commissioned by Dave Smith, the MD. * The essence of Mr
Smith’s instruction to Mr Ismay (which was not recorded in writing) was to compile
reasons that gave reassurance about Horizon. Mr Ismay was not asked to investigate the
allegations about Horizon and based the Ismay Report on what he was told by others,
including Mr Jenkins of Fujitsu.?? Mr Ismay accepted that he had not, as he had stated in
the Ismay Report, conducted an “objective, internal review” and that it should be

characterised as a “summary of existing conclusions”.*°

41. Ms Vennells was not involved in commissioning the Ismay Report and Mr Ismay did not
consult her during its preparation. She was not included in the distribution list for the
Ismay Report. She cannot recall seeing it at the time of its production and there is no
documentary evidence to suggest that she or the wider ET received a copy.*! Mr Young,
who did see the report, states that, at the time, it solidified his view that there was not a
technical problem with Horizon.*? He states that he recalls discussing the Ismay Report
at an ET meeting “which at the time, provided us with comfort that there was not an IT
issue.”** Although there are no documents which record this discussion, it is plain from
Mr Young’s evidence that he recalls discussing the Ismay Report with the ET as a
document which gave comfort to the business that there were no technical problems with

the Horizon system.

The Receipts and Payments Mismatch Bug

42. The Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug in HNGX was discovered in September 2010,
shortly before Ms Vennells became MD. It affected up to 62 branches, with two branches

being impacted twice.

43. POL00028838 is a paper prepared by Fujitsu dated 29 September 2010 for a meeting
with POL to discuss the Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug (the “Receipts and
Payments Mismatch Paper”). The Fujitsu staff at the meeting were Mike Stewart, John
Simpkins, Gareth Jenkins, and Mark Wright. The attendees from POL identified in the
paper include Alan Simpson (Security); Julia Marwood (Network); Ian Trundell (IT),
and Andrew Winn (P&BA).

44. The Receipts and Payments Mismatch Paper described the effect and impact of the bug

as follows:

“Discrepancies showing at the Horizon counter disappear when the branch
follows certain process steps, but will still show within the back end branch
account. This is currently impacting circa 40 Branches since migration onto
Horizon Online, with an overall cash value of circa £20k loss. This issue will
only occur if a branch cancels the completion of the trading period, but within
the same session continues to roll into a new balance period.

* The branch has appeared to have balanced, whereas in fact they could have a
loss or a gain. * Our accounting systems will be out of syne with what is recorded
at the branch * If widely known could cause a loss of confidence in the Horizon
System by branches ¢ Potential impact upon ongoing legal cases where branches
are disputing the integrity of Horizon’ Data * It could provide branches
ammunition to blame ‘Horizon for future discrepancies.”

45. Ms Vennells says that she was not told about the existence of the bug until May 2013
Her position is supported by the evidence. No witness at the Inquiry has claimed to have
escalated knowledge of the bug to Ms Vennells, the Board or the ET, prior to May 2013,
nor is there any documentary evidence showing that anyone did so. Mr Young and Ms
Sewell accepted during their evidence that they did not escalate their knowledge of the

bug when they first became aware of it.

20
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

46. Mr Young agreed that he was first informed about the bug in February 2011, several
months after its discovery: 15 October 2024 61:18-62:20 (INQ00001196). Mr Young
also accepted that he did not tell the Board about the bug. His explanation was that he
believed that the bug had been detected during the pilot of HNGX and not in the live
system: 15 October 2024 65:15-73:3 (INQ00001196).

47. Ms Sewell was aware of the bug by 4 March 2011 (POL00029611). On 25 June 2013,
Ron Warmington of Second Sight asked POL for clarification of whether anyone at
Board level had been informed of the existence of the bug in 2010 (POL00029618). Ms

Sewell replied to Simon Baker and Alwen Lyons on the same day that:

“T don’t know if it went higher than Mike, Andy M also managed the service at
the time, and if I remember correctly Mark Burley was also involved. I can’t say
whether we said anything to the press. Other points, our Board at the time would
have been Royal Mail as we didn’t have an independent Board. Paula would
have been Network Director at the time with Dave Smith as MD.”

48. Itis clear from this email that Ms Sewell did not tell Ms Vennells about the bug in 2011.
Indeed, Ms Sewell stated in her oral evidence that she did not escalate her knowledge of
the bug at all: she explained that her reporting line for the management of faults was to
Mr Young, via Mr McLean, and Mr Young already knew about the problem: 16 May
2024 48:25-49:12 (INQ00001148).

Remote access 2007-2011
49. The evidence before the Inquiry establishes that:

a. Between 2008 and 2010 a number of POL managers, including Andrew Winn
(P&BA), Mr Ismay (the head of P&BA), and Angela Van Den Bogerd (then a
senior Network manager), were made aware that Fujitsu had the power, or a
potential power, to change branch accounts remotely without the authority or
knowledge of the affected SPMs.

b. This information was not passed on to the Board or to Ms Vennells.

c. On the contrary, as set out below, the message given internally to POL’s senior
management was that it was not possible to make changes to branch accounts

without the knowledge or consent of the relevant SPM.

21
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

50. The Receipts and Payments Mismatch Paper revealed that Fujitsu had the ability, and
was prepared in principle, to use remote access powers to adjust branch accounts without
the knowledge or consent of SPMs. The first of three proposed solutions in the Paper to

remove the impact of the bug was as follows:

“SOLUTION ONE - Alter the Horizon Branch figure at the counter to show the
discrepancy. Fujitsu would have to manually write an entry value to the local
branch account.

IMPACT - When the branch comes to complete next Trading Period they would
have a discrepancy, which they would have to bring to account.

RISK- This has significant data integrity concerns and could lead to questions
of "tampering" with the branch system and could generate questions around how
the discrepancy was caused. This solution could have moral implications of Post
Office changing branch data without informing the branch.”

51. One of the POL recipients of the Receipts and Payments Mismatch Paper, Mr Winn
(P&BA), was already aware by October 2010 that Fujitsu could adjust branch accounts
remotely. On 15 October 2008, Andrew Lusher (Network) had emailed Mr Winn about
asuspended SPM named Graham Ward (POL00029710). Mr Ward had claimed that “on
a number of occasions figures have appeared in the cheques line of his account. He
suspects that these have been input to his account electronically without his knowledge

or consent”.
52. Mr Winn responded on 23 October 2008:

“The only way POL can impact branch accounts remotely is via the transaction
correction process. These have to be accepted by the branch in the same way that
in/out remittances are I guess. If we were able to do this, the integrity of the
system would be flawed. Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via
the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in place to prevent
adjustments being made without prior authorisation — within POL and Fujitsu.
These controls form the core of our court defence if we get to that stage. He
makes a casual accusation that is extremely serious to the business— as usual he
should either produce the evidence for this or withdraw the accusation.”

53. Mr Winn gave evidence to the Inquiry on 3 March 2023 that he imagined that he had
asked Fujitsu about remote access after he received Mr Lusher’s email and that

information from Fujitsu formed the basis of his response to Mr Lusher on 23 October

22
54.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

2008: 3 March 2023: 117:3-117:8 (INQ00001059). However, Mr Winn did not satisfy
himself as to the security of the Fujitsu access controls to which he referred in his email
to Mr Lusher and he agreed with CTI that he could not be satisfied that the controls were
effectively monitored by Fujitsu: 3 March 2023 117:9-117:14 (INQ00001059). Mr
Winn accepted that he should have carried out an investigation into Mr Ward’s claims,
but agreed with CTI that there is no evidence that he did so: 3 March 2023 119:1-119:15
(INQ00001059). He said he was unaware that Fujitsu’s third line support routinely used
their ability to go into Horizon in a way which Richard Roll (the Fujitsu whistleblower)
described as “off piste”: 3 March 2023 117:15 to 117:25 (INQ00001059). Overall, Mr
Winn said that he was unhappy with how he had dealt with Mr Ward’s claims that his
branch accounts had been changed remotely: 3 March 2023 121:10 to 121:18
(INQ00001059).

Mr Winn stated that, when the Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug came to light in
2010, he did not draw a link between Solution One in the Receipts and payments
Mismatch Paper and Mr Ward’s claim in 2008 that his branch data could be altered
without his knowledge: “I think there’s a difference between entering data to resolve a
problem rather than what implication was for Mr Ward of somebody introducing cheques
for no apparent reason.” Accordingly, Mr Winn did not conduct any investigation into
Mr Ward’s situation after he saw the Receipts and Payments Mismatch Paper: 3 March
2023 135:5 to 135:22 (INQ00001059).

The Receipts and Payments Mismatch Paper led to an email discussion about remote
access in November and December 2010: POL00088956. The context of the thread is
that, in November-December 2010, POL was in communication with the Department for
Business Innovation and Skills (“BIS”) concerning the JFSA’s complaints about

Horizon:

a. In the first email in the chain, at 17:31 on 17 November 2010, Mike Granville
(Head of Regulatory Strategy) sent Mr Ismay and Ms Hobbs (Network) a “response
note” to follow up on a meeting with Mike Whitehead (a BIS official) about the

JFSA and asked them for comments.

b. The second email is from Ms Hobbs to John Breedon on 3 December 2010 at 18:16.

Ms Hobbs forwarded to Mr Breedon the first email in the chain and copied into her

23
56.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

email what she described as “My reply to Mike [Granville] and Rod [Ismay]”. This
stated:

“T ...have just one observation.

I found out this week that Fujitsu can actually put an entry into a branch account
remotely. It came up when we were exploring solutions around a problem
generated by the system following migration to HNGX. This issue was quickly
identified and a fix put in place but it impacted around 60 branches and meant a
loss/gain incurred in a particular week in effect disappeared from the system.

One solution, quickly discounted because of the implications around integrity
was for Fujitsu to remotely enter a value into a branch account to reintroduce the
missing loss/gain. So POL can’t do this but Fujitsu can.”

c. Ms Hobbs added in her email to Mr Breedon:

“This is the last email exchange I had with Mike Granville about the BIS
meeting. The attached documents were what Mike was proposing to send to
Mike about the whole ‘remote access to Horizon’ issue. This was being looked
into by Andy McLean and Mark Burley. The view being expressed was that
whilst this may be possible it’s not something we have asked Fujitsu to provide.
I don’t know what the outcome was.”

d. On 5 December 2010 at 21:50, Mr Breedon forwarded the entire thread to Ms Van
Den Bogerd (cc. Sue Huggins, Tracy Marshall, Lin Norbury, Andy Bayfield, and
Mike Granville) with the comment: “Further to my voicemail message on Friday
please find below the email I have received from Lynn Hobbs”. Mr Breedon

attached a copy of the Ismay Report to his email to Ms Van Den Bogerd.

POL00294728 is an email dated 5 January 2011 from Ms Marshall to Kevin Gilliand,
Ms Van Den Bogerd and Helen Rose re: “Horizon system issues”. Ms Marshall had
talked to Mr Maclean and Dave Hulbert and “made progress with the outstanding
questions raised.” The second question was whether “POL or Fujitsu having remote

access to individual horizon systems”. Ms Marshall’s answer was as follows:

“POL cannot remotely access systems and make changes to specific stock units
etc. Fujitsu can remotely access systems and they do this on numerous occasions
on a network wide basis in order to remedy glitches in the system created as a
result of new software upgrades.

SUBS0000071

“Technically, Fujitsu could access an individual branch remotely and move
money around however this has never happened yet. The authority process
required and the audit process are robust enough to prevent this activity from
being undertaken fraudulently. The authority process itself would take several
days and would require a number of representatives from the business to provide
concurrence to the activity (including Head of Network Services). If a change
were made remotely and to an individual branch it would be flagged on the
business’ data ledgers and would appear as a ‘mismatch’ in P & BA in
chesterfield. P & BA would then investigate to determine whether the mismatch
was authorised internally or not. So although changes can be made remotely,
they would be spotted and the person making the change would be identified."

These documents show that, by 5 January 2011, a substantial number of POL managers
had been made aware that Fujitsu had an ability to change branch accounts remotely and
could do so without the knowledge or consent of the SPM. There is no evidence that any
of these managers escalated their knowledge to the Board or the ET. It is clear from the
oral evidence of two of the most senior managers involved — Mr Ismay and Ms Van Den

Bogerd — that they did not escalate their knowledge.

Mr Ismay accepted that he should have revisited the statements in the Ismay Report that
there were no “back doors” in Horizon in light of Ms Hobbs’ message to him in
November/December 2010: 11 May 2023 181:2-184:4 (INQ00001063). He offered no
explanation for his failure to do so, other than that he could not recall receiving the

message from Ms Hobbs.

Ms Van Den Bogerd gave the following evidence about her knowledge of remote access

in 2010/2011:

a. 419 of her witness statement (WITN09900100) states that she did not recall
receiving the email from Mr Breedon on 5 December 2010 and that she had no
knowledge that Fujitsu had remote access powers prior to 2011: 25 April 2024
34:1 to 36:5 (INQ00001136).

b. Ms Van Den Bogerd appeared to accept that she was aware of the contents of Ms
Marshall’s email dated 5 January 2011 from when she received it. On 6 January
2011, Ms Van Den Bogerd and Mr Gilliland (who was also copied into Ms
Marshall’s 5 January email) interviewed a SPM called Rachpal Athwal:
POL00294743. During the interview, Mrs Athwal’s husband asked whether POL

25
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

could manipulate the figures on Horizon “behind the scenes”. Mr Gilliland and Ms
Van Den Bogerd told him that it was not possible for POL to do this. They did not

mention that they knew that Fujitsu had this power.

c. Ms Van Den Bogerd told the Inquiry that she did not volunteer the information
about remote access from Ms Marshall’s email to Mr Athwal because she did not
understand the technical aspects and Mr Gilliland was the more senior person: 25
April 2024 73:12 to 74:7 (INQ00001136).

d. Ms Van Den Bogerd accepted that the email from Mr Breedon on 5 December 2010
was inconsistent with the statements in the Ismay Report that there were no
‘backdoors’ into Horizon: 25 April 2024 41:5 to 43:14 (INQ00001136). However,
whatever the Inquiry makes of Ms Van Den Bogerd’s evidence that she has no
recollection of Mr Breedon’s email, it is obvious that she did nothing to escalate

what she knew about Fujitsu’s remote access powers to the Board or the ET.

60. On 26 November 2010, Mr Granville sent the email at (POL00120561) to, among others,
Ms Vennells (now the MD), Mr Young and Mr Ismay. Mr Granville stated that following
a meeting between Ed Davey MP, a minister in BIS, and the JFSA, Mike Whitehead (a
senior ShEX manager with responsibility for POL) had met Mr Ismay, Ms Hobbs and
Mr Granville. Mr Granville attached to the email a briefing document for BIS with the
file name “JFSA response issues for BIS2.doc” which he described as a draft that he

intended to send to BIS “to go back to Mike on some of the points that were raised”. **

61. On page 9 of (POL00120561), which is within the attachment, there is a response from
POL to the allegation that: “POL can access the system remotely and make changes to

it.”

“The system is based on a user log in, and all actions have to be endorsed by the
user. POL cannot remotely control a branches system. Any technical changes by
Fujitsu that impact the system have to go through the clearance processes which

31 It is highly likely, given the timing, the file name of the attachment, and Mr Granville’s description of the
attachment, that the attachment to Mr Granville’s email on 26 November 2010 is either the same document or a
later draft of the document that Mr Granville emailed to Mr Ismay and Ms Hobbs in 17 November 2010 in the
email chain at POL00088956 (“further to the meeting with Mike Whitehead about the JFSA — I am aiming to
send this broad response note...”).

26
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

would prevent any amendment to existing data. The independent audit file is in
place and can show all the system activity in a particular branch.”

62. Ms Vennells states that she does not recall this document.*> However, it gives no
impression of what some POL managers knew about remote access by 26 November
2010. It states that “all actions have to be endorsed by the user” and Fujitsu is mentioned
only in relation to “technical changes”. No-one reading the document would have
understood that, in fact, Fujitsu had the ability to change branch accounting data remotely

without the knowledge of SPMs.

63. Ms Vennells further submits that, as a result of the failure of Mr Ismay, Ms Van Den
Bogerd and others to escalate their knowledge, she was not made aware that Fujitsu could
alter branch accounts using remote access and do so without the knowledge or consent

of an affected SPM.

The 2010/2011 E&Y Audit Of The Fujitsu Control Environment For Horizon

64. E&Y’s audit of the control environment at Fujitsu for the financial year ended 27 March
2011 was a first and a last in several respects. It was the first audit of a full accounting
year following the migration to HNGX and the first audit following Ms Vennells’
appointment as MD in October 2010. It was also the last pre-separation audit in which
E&Y audited POL’s accounts and the Horizon controls as part of their audit of Royal
Mail Group Holdings PLC. It was therefore the last occasion on which the results of

E&Y’s audit of POL were formally presented to RMG, as opposed to POL.

65. E&Y’s letter to POL management on internal control matters (POL00030217) reported
weaknesses in the IT governance and control framework, particularly in relation to
Fujitsu and Horizon, and made recommendations for improvements. The executive
summary of the letter broke these down into four categories: (a) improvements to the
governance of outsourced applications; (b) improvements to the segregation of duties in
the software change management process; (c) the need to strengthen the change

management process; and (d) the need to strengthen the review of privileged access.

55 PV WS 1 41272 (WITN01020100)
27
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

66. E&Y’s detailed observations included, on page 33 of the management letter, that “there
are inappropriate system privileges assigned to the APPSUP role and the
SYSTEM_MANAGER role at the Oracle database level on the Branch Database served
(BDB) supporting HNGX.” The risk associated with this weakness was that
“Unrestricted access to privileged IT functions increases the risk of
inappropriate/unauthorised access which may lead to the processing of unauthorised or
erroneous transactions.” Ms Vennells was aware that E&Y had identified control

weaknesses around Horizon and made recommendations for improvement:

a. Ms Vennells received a briefing document on the E&Y audit (FUJ00086922)
which appears to have been prepared by Fujitsu in April 2011 with input from Ms

Sewell.*°

Although Ms Vennells does not recall reading the briefing, she believes
that she did so.*7 E&Y’s audit findings and recommendations were summarised in
Appendix A of the briefing. These included that a “review of privileged access for

administration and technical resources” was a high priority.

b. The minutes of the POL Board meeting on 27 May 2011(POL00021499) record
that the auditors had raised concerns about access controls and that POL had
commenced work to remedy the issues raised in the audit, including by establishing
what the minutes describe as the “POL Audit & Control Board.” Ms Vennells has
described the role and the work of what is more accurately called the IT Steering

Group in PV WS 1 §§172-174 (WITNO01020100).

c. Although she can only recall some of the topics discussed, Ms Vennells discussed
the audit with Mr Young and Ms Sewell.**

67. The mention of the APPSUP role in E&Y’s management letter has significance viewed
from the perspective of today, since Fraser J found in the Horizon Issues Judgment that
Fujitsu used this privilege to make changes to branch accounts without the knowledge of
the affected SPMs. Ms Vennells’ evidence is that she did not know, because she was not

told, that the existence of the APPSUP role created this risk to the integrity of the

36 The briefing was emailed by Don Burgess to Bill Membery and Mark Amold, all of Fujitsu, on 28 April 2011

(FUJ00086923). Mr Burgess stated in the email that "following revision with Lesley, this has been expanded to
provide Paula Vennells with enough information to handle questions that may arise from RMG regarding the
audit. to support this more non-technical description and examples have been included".

accounting data held in the system. It is submitted that the Inquiry should accept Ms

Vennells’ evidence:

a. The audit was discussed at the RMG Audit and Risk Committee (the “RMG
ARC’) on 20 May 2011 (RMG00000005). Ms Vennells was not a member of the
RMG ARC and was not therefore present at the meeting. Ms Sewell, Mr Young,
and Alison Duncan from E&Y joined the meeting for the discussion about the IT
audit of Horizon. Ms Duncan spoke about the control weaknesses identified during
the audit, and the need for improvement by Fujitsu and a change of approach by
POL to the management of the Fujitsu contract. Ms Duncan also stated that Fujitsu
had caused the audit to be unduly lengthy, unpredictable and inefficient. Mr Young
is recorded as noting that the recent re-negotiation of the contract had offered POL
costs and efficiency savings, though he accepted that POL had not demanded
SAS70-quality evidence from Fujitsu.

b. There was a further discussion of the audit at the meeting of the RMG ARC on 8
December 2011. The minutes (RMG00000003) record that the meeting was
attended by Mr Day, Ms Sewell, Mr Ismay, and Mr Meadows from POL and three
attendees from E&Y. The summary of the update to the RMG ARC on Horizon

controls and the relationship with Fujitsu records that:

“A number of IT control issues were identified during the 2010-2011 year end
audit, which were largely centred on Fujitsu. Overall EY was satisfied that the
control systems were reliable but they had to perform additional audit work to
make this conclusion and they made certain recommendations in the
management letter following the audit for improvements which have been
implemented. The IT control issues identified during the audit did not relate to
the integrity of accounting data in the system. Rather, EY made
recommendations about the documentation and authorisation of changes to
systems and about opportunities for streamlined assurance.”

c. The minutes do not record who made these comments. It is likely they were made
by E&Y or by one of the POL attendees. There is no hint in the documents that
anyone at E&Y or POL dissented from or questioned the opinion stated at the

meeting that the audit issues did not relate to the integrity of the accounting data.

d. Ms Vennells says that she understood that the control issues at Fujitsu did not

compromise the accounting data. She recalls Mr Young telling her at some point

29
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

that while Fujitsu had not got all of the control documentation right, and that these
matters needed to be improved, the audit was not a major crisis.*? The Inquiry
should accept this evidence. It is highly likely that Ms Vennells was given the same
headline messages about the audit that the RMG ARC was given at its meetings on
20 May and 8 December 2011 (at which she had not been present).

e. The Inquiry should treat with scepticism Mr Young’s recollection that he was
concemed at the time that inadequate controls over privileged access had
implications for the integrity of the accounting data: 15 October 2024 85:23-86:1
(INQ00001196). Mr Young attended the meeting of the RMG ARC on 8 December
2011 at which it was told that the audit findings did not relate to the integrity of the
data. If he had believed that the RMG ARC was being misled or misinformed, he
should have alerted the RMG ARC and the POL Board. There is no documentary
evidence that he did so. Indeed, Mr Young did not claim in his written and oral

evidence that he escalated his concerns to the Board or the ET.

f. Ms Vennells gave oral evidence that it is unlikely that she would have understood
at the time — without advice from an IT expert — that E&Y’s comments about the
APPSUP role showed that Fujitsu could make changes to branch accounts without
the authorisation of SPMs: 22 May 2024 156:10-159:7 (INQ00001151). The
Inquiry should accept this evidence.

g. The Inquiry can also be confident that Ms Vennells is right that she was not told
that the APPSUP role could potentially be used to make unauthorised changes to
branch accounts.*” There is no evidence that she was told. It is clear from Mr
Young's evidence why he did not tell Ms Vennells. He knew that, as with most IT
systems, it was possible to gain access to the system remotely and that Fujitsu could
make changes to branch accounts with SPMs’ consent. However, he had “no belief,
understanding or even inkling” that Fujitsu made changes to branch accounts

without the authorisation of SPMs."!

°° PV WS1 4168 (WITN01020100)

4° Dame Moya Greene, then the CEO of RMG, stated in her oral evidence that she was not told in any detail in
2011/2012 about Fujitsu’s ability to access Horizon remotely: 19 July 2024 151:8-152:3 (INQ00001178).

4! MY WS §53 (WITN11130100). Simon Baker, who reported to Ms Vennells as part of the team working on the
Second Sight review in 2012-2013 gives similar evidence in his witness statement at (31; 71 (WITN04730100).

30
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

h. Accordingly, Ms Vennells was not told that there was a risk that Fujitsu could use
its APPSUP privileges to tamper with branch data because Mr Young did not

himself appreciate that this was a real risk.

Advice On Prosecutions

68. Ms Crichton was appointed as POL’s first Head of Legal in January 2010, eight months
before Ms Vennells became MD in September 2010: Crichton WS 410
(WITN00220100). Prior to separation from RMG, prosecutions and civil claims brought
in the name of POL had been managed by RMG legal and been subject to the oversight
of the RMG GC. Ms Crichton had no role in overseeing prosecutions in the pre-
separation period (WS §§39-40 (WITN00220100); 24 April 2024 1:20-2:20
(INQ00001135)).”

69. Ms Crichton had no recollection of the Board discussing prosecutions prior to separation
(WS $40) (WITN00220100). She said that, between 2010 and early 2012, information
about POL prosecutions and civil cases against SPMs was “not ordinarily” provided to
the Board (WS $47) (WITN00220100). There is no evidence that the ET or the Board
discussed prosecution policies, the conduct of prosecutions and civil claims, or any
individual criminal or civil cases prior to the run up to separation in late 2011 and early
2012. The Board was not given any formal briefing on POL’s prosecutorial role when
POL took over responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions from RMG upon separation:
see the evidence of Ms Lyons on 21 May 2024 30:22- 32:13 (INQ00001150).

70. The Board started to receive Significant Litigation Reports from Ms Crichton in
December 2011 in preparation for POL’s separation from RMG: 24 April 2024 51:12-
51:25 (INQ00001135). The Report for the December 2011 Board meeting
(WITN00740125), discussed four letters before action from former SPMs alleging
“wrongful termination of contract (based on alleged failings in POL’s processes and
computer systems).” The Report advised that “The considered legal view is that the
claimants are unlikely to succeed”. Nevertheless, Richard Morgan QC had advised that
if a large number of similar claims were issued in County Courts, “the quality of the

judges would be unpredictable making it more likely that one or two cases might be lost.”

This was a quotation from a Bond Pearce file note of a conference with Mr Morgan QC
on 26 October 2011 attended by three RMG lawyers and two solicitors from Bond Pearce
(POL00107695). Ms Crichton did not provide the Board with a copy of the file note: AP
WS {103 (WITN00740100); PV WS1 4215 (WITN01020100). Ms Crichton says that
RMG legal and Bond Pearce were dealing with the Shoosmiths cases and that she did not
know the details of Mr Morgan QC’s advice: SC WS $106 (WITN00220100).

At the January 2012 Board meeting, Les Owen, one of the NEDs, asked for assurance
that there was no substance to claims brought by SPMs which had featured in Private
Eye (POL00021503). The minutes of the meeting record that Ms Crichton explained
that:

“*..the subpostmasters were challenging the integrity of the Horizon system.
However the system had been audited by RMG Internal Audit with the reports
reviewed by Deloittes. The audit report was very positive. The Business has also

won every criminal prosecution in which it has used evidence based on the

Horizon system’s integrity.”

Ms Crichton said that Mr Singh and Mr Wilson had told her that POL had won every
prosecution and that it did not cross her mind to be suspicious: “if people are making that
very absolute statement and they're lawyers and, again, this is with hindsight, you tend
to think ‘Well, actually, they've been in the business a long time, they must know what
they’re talking about”: 24 April 2024 7:12-8:15 (INQ00001135). Ms Vennells submits

that a non-lawyer would be entitled to reach the same conclusion.

The information that Ms Crichton gave to the Board at its January 2012 meeting was set
out in similar form in a letter from Ms Vennells to Mike Weir MP dated 1 December
2011 (POL00001976). The letter responded to parliamentary questions Mr Weir MP had
put to the Secretary of State for BIS in November 2011 (POL00295066). These included
details of how many prosecutions or investigations of SPMs instigated as a result of
financial irregularities in the Horizon system had been abandoned. The email from Mr
Granville to Mr Young dated 18 November 2011 (POL00338494) shows that the final
draft of the letter was to be approved by “Group...Legal”, i.e. RMG’s legal department.
The relevant part of Ms Vennells’ letter (POL00001976) stated:

32
75.

76.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

“There have been a limited number of cases where Court action has been taken
over missing sums of public money. In some of these cases, the subpostmaster
has made allegations against the Horizon system... The Courts have consistently
upheld [POL’s] position that the Horizon system is accurate and reliable....In
some cases, the subpostmaster pleaded guilty; in others [POL] had to provide
robust evidence. A criminal Court will only convict an individual if it considers
that the evidence has shown, beyond reasonable doubt, that the individual is
guilty of the offences...”

Although, the Board was not given a briefing on POL’s prosecutorial role in the run up
to separation, Ms Crichton gave evidence that she recalled speaking to Ms Vennells in
early 2012 about “the fact we prosecuted and that the Board needed to be involved to
understand that” but that she (Ms Crichton) had probably put this issue on the backburner
while she awaited the outcome of the Second Sight Review, which started in 2012: 24
April 2024 4:24-5:10 (INQ00001135).

Ms Vennells also recalls speaking to Ms Crichton about prosecutions in early 2012. In
paragraph 47 of her second witness statement, Ms Vennells confirmed, as she had stated
in a letter to the BEIS Select Committee on 24 June 2020, that she discussed prosecutions
with Ms Crichton shortly after she became CEO and was told that POL approached
prosecutions with the same rigour as the CPS, applying the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 and the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The documentary evidence that Ms
Vennells has seen since she wrote to the Committee in June 2020 supports her
recollection that she was given assurances that POL conducted prosecutions responsibly

through a structured and professional legal process:

a. Page 9 of (POL00413669) is a handwritten note by Ms Perkins. It was included in
a pack of documents that Glenda Hansen sent to Ms Perkins on 19 March 2012 in
relation to a dinner with Ms Vennells at the Zetter Hotel to discuss a meeting with
Lord Arbuthnot on 28 March 2012. Ms Perkins was unable to say with any certainty
whether the note recorded statements by Ms Vennells: 5 June 2024 60:13 -62:19
(INQ00001156). Regardless of whether Ms Vennells was the immediate source of
the information in the note, the note indicates that Ms Perkins was told that POL

conducted prosecutions responsibly and to a high standard of proof:

“1. We do not like prosecuting. sub postmasters We are one of v. few public
bodies who are allowed to bring our own prosecutions. Not something we take
lightly — our lawyers want a v. high standard of proof. [ + no-one [unclear] take

33
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

lightly the decision to plead guilty to a criminal charge.] We have taken a number
of cases to the criminal court and we have never lost.”

77. A speaking note prepared in May 2012 for Ms Vennells to use when speaking to Lord
Arbuthnot (POL00096628) states that:

“Suspect offenders would be interviewed under the auspices of PACE (Police
and Criminal Evidence Act) and cases passed for advice to lawyers.

The lawyers internal initially then external would apply the “prosecutor’
guidelines” (in reality CPS checks and balances) to the matters in hand and
advise prosecution, or not, accordingly dependent on the available evidence.

Once it has been decided that there is sufficient evidence to launch a prosecution
there is an additional test which considers whether such a prosecution is in the
public interest. In the cases that we have public interest factors would include
breach of trust and the nature of the offences. In addition it is thought that
convictions will act as a deterrence and help protect public money.”

a. The speaking note that Ms Vennells and Ms Perkins received for a meeting with
Lord Arbuthnot on 3 July 2013, at the end of the Second Sight Review
(POL00115924) stated: “For criminal prosecutions we treat each matter on a case
by case basis, with a detailed investigation and legal review (generally involving

external lawyers).”

78. While it is fair to say that Lord Arbuthnot remained concerned about POL prosecutions
throughout the Second Sight Review, Ms Vennells was not given any indication by the
POL legal team, which was aware of Lord Arbuthnot’s concerns, that they had reason to
believe or suspect that POL had prosecuted SPMs inappropriately. On the contrary: she
was informed at both the beginning and at the end of the Second Sight review that POL
brought prosecutions following detailed investigations of the facts and the law. In an
email from Ms Crichton to Mr Edwards, cc Mr Flemington on 3 July 2013
(POL00371762), Ms Crichton said “Nothing has emerged from the interim findings
given to us by SS which would point to specific convictions being unsafe. Cases have
been through the judicial process and the Court considers all relevant evidence not just
that relating to the Horizon computer system.” This is characteristic of the messaging
that Ms Vennells had been and continued to receive from the GC, and which it is

submitted she was entitled to rely upon.

POL’s use of expert evidence and its disclosure duties

79. The documents show that Cartwright King (“CK”) advised POL about its disclosure
duties and its use of Mr Jenkins as an expert witness piecemeal between 3 July 2013 and
17 July 2013:

a. Mr Clarke of CK recorded in his advice dated 15 July 2013 on “the use of expert
evidence relating to the integrity of the Fujitsu Services Ltd Horizon System” (the
“Clarke Expert Evidence Advice”) (POL00040000) that CK was first contacted
by POL in relation to bugs in Horizon on 27 June 2013. POL told CK: (a) that the
SSIR would indicate that Horizon was not “bug free”; (b) it appeared that some
within POL had been aware of bugs that affected up to 30 branches; and (c) Mr
Singh had not known about the bugs and did not know how long POL had been

aware of them or who within POL had been aware of them.

b. Mr Clarke also recorded in the Advice that, on 28 June 2013, he and Mr Smith of
CK spoke to Mr Jenkins, who confirmed that he had told Second Sight about two
bugs in Horizon. The transcript of the call (POL00142322) shows that Mr Jenkins
confirmed his knowledge of two bugs in HNGX and stated that he was confident
that the audit trail that POL would be using in the upcoming prosecution in the
Samra case, in which Mr Clarke was instructed by POL, was not compromised b y
those bugs. Mr Clarke said in evidence that this conversation led him to review
previous witness statements by Mr Jenkins, which contained no mention of his

knowledge of the bugs: 9 May 2024 25:2-25:7 (INQ00001144).

ec. On3 July 2013, Mr Clarke gave advice to P9 MaOL in conference. There does not
appear to be any note or minute of the conference in the disclosure to date.
However, Mr Clarke’s written advice dated 2 August 2013 (the “Shredding
Advice”) (POL00006799) states that the conference was “to consider issues
relating to the Horizon computer system and the prosecution of criminal offences
committed against POL by sub-Postmasters and clerks.” Mr Clarke advised on at

least the following issues at the conference:

i. The need for POL to set up a central depository of information about Horizon

issues (including bugs and complaints), to provide a future expert witness,

35
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

and those responsible for POL’s criminal disclosure duties, with a single

source of information: see paragraph 2 of the Shredding Advice.

ii. That POL would be obliged to carry out a case-by-case review of
prosecutions to comply with its disclosure duties. This appears to have been

preliminary advice pending CK’s review of the, as yet unpublished, SSIR:

i. At 20:50 on 3 July 2013, Mr Williams emailed Mr Smith and Mr Clarke
(cc. Mr Flemington and Mr Singh) stating “During our con, you
explained prosecuting counsel’s duty of disclosure (i.e. that we know of
an issue which might be relevant to criminal

proceedings)...(POL00145145).

ii. The following day, Mr Flemington emailed Mr Clarke and Mr Smith (cc.
Ms Crichton, Rodric Williams and others) a “first rough draft from SS of
one half of the Interim Report” (POL00145201) and asked for CK’s

“material & significant concerns on this first thing tomorrow morning.”

iii. I Mr Smith replied to all on 5 July 2013 at 9:59 that “our advice overall in
relation to disclosure has not changed” (POL00145201) but that
disclosure of a partial report would not comply with POL’s duties and
CK were unable to advise properly until they had seen all of the relevant
material. However, Mr Smith identified paragraphs of the draft SSIR that

CK was concerned about.

iv. On the same day, Mr Williams replied to the POL individuals in the chain
to summarise his understanding of CK’s advice (POL00145201). 1. “No
change in advice, i.e. need to do case-by-case review. 2. CK have flagged
the same para's we've identified as troublesome re; our disclosure to SS
and SS's conclusions 3. CK haven't articulated what their concerns are 4.
No comment on how the Interim Report could be used by [disgruntled]
SPMs (I've already gone back to them on this)”.

d. Mr Clarke gave oral evidence that he raised concerns about Mr Jenkins’ reliability
as an expert witness at the conference on 3 July 2013 (9 May 2024 46:11-46:25
(INQ00001144)), however there is no documentary evidence of what he said. The

36
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

documents, and Mr Clarke’s evidence, suggest that the advice at this stage was that
POL could no longer use Mr Jenkins as an expert witness due to concerns about

his failure to disclose his knowledge of the bugs.

e. By the moming of 8 July 2013, POL was clearly aware that it needed a new Horizon
expert, and this advice can only have come from Mr Clarke. At 10:18 on 8 July
2013, Mr Flemington emailed Mr Clarke (cc. Ms Crichton, Mr Williams, Mr Scott
and Mr Singh) an “Action List” (POL00323832) including requests for CK to

provide:

i. Immediate, same day, written advice on “what we say to FJ to get a new

expert different to GJ”; and

ii. A later piece of advice on “the impact of the SS Indep Review and the

Bugs/GJ WS issues”.

f. On the same day, Mr Clarke sent POL a note entitled “General Advice”
(POL00006365):

i. Mr Clarke suggested that Fujitsu should be told in relation to Mr Jenkins that:
“Counsel has advised POL that there ought now to be at least one degree of
separation between any expert witness called in support of a POL prosecution

and the SS process.”

ii. He advised that POL should inform RMG that the SSIR fell squarely within
POL’s obligation to give disclosure of information which might be
considered capable of undermining prosecutions and that POL had instructed
CK to conduct a review of POL prosecutions to ensure compliance with this
duty. The SSIR would be disclosed to defendants where this was required
under CPIA 1996.

g. The reason why Mr Flemington requested urgent advice on what POL should tell

Fujitsu about Mr Jenkins is shown by Mr Flemington’s email at 12:52 on 8 July

37
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

2013 to Ms Sewell (cc. Ms Crichton, Mr Williams, and Mr Singh), asking for her

help in finding a new Fujitsu Horizon expert for imminent criminal hearings.

h. — Mr Clarke explained in his oral evidence that, while he had formed the view by 8
July 2013 that Mr Jenkins could not and should not be used as witness in the future,
he had not yet formed the more trenchant views about Mr Jenkins that he expressed
in the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice: 9 May 2024 180:21-181:23
(INQ00001144).

i. On 10 July 2013, Ms Crichton and Mr Flemington met Simon Richardson of Bond
Dickinson. Mr Richardson’s file note of the meeting (POL00407582) records that
“The real worry was around the Fujitsu expert who appeared to have known of
some of the problems but not referred to them in his report or statement even though
they could be dismissed. There are non-disclosure issues here. They are looking at

replacing that expert with somebody else.”

j. On 11 July 2013, in response to an email from Mr Williams, Martin Smith advised
Ms Crichton, Mr Singh, Mr Williams and Mr Flemington that the Helen Rose
Report was disclosable in criminal proceedings, including in past prosecutions on
two grounds: (a) it showed that the data used by POL did not distinguish between
reversals initiated by the SPM and reversals initiated by the system; and (b)
comments in the report by Ms Rose indicated that Mr Jenkins was aware of issues

relating to the integrity of Horizon (POL00066789).

k. On 12 July 2013 at 11:44, Mr Smith of CK emailed Mr Williams (cc. Ms Crichton,
Mr Flemington, Mr Singh and Mr Clarke) attaching “Simon’s Bullet Points re GJ
for use in discussions with FJ.” (POL00191966). The attachment is
(POL00191967), which stated:

i. “A full report which considers Fujitsu and Gareth Jenkins’ provision of

expert evidence is being prepared;

“4 The first line of Mr Flemington’s email was a near verbatim quote from Mr Clarke’s General Advice: “Our
criminal lawyers have advised us that there now ought to be at least one degree of separation between any expert
witness called in support of a POL prosecution and the Second Sight process.” (POL00191461)

38
iii.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

The initial view seems to be that statements and evidence provided by Gareth

Jenkins did not contain all that they should have done;

In particular there seems to have been a reluctance to deal with known

Horizon issues in the statements/evidence; and

As a consequence it has been necessary to conduct a review of cases so as to
determine whether or not any particular defendant has been prejudiced by the

absence of information."

Mr Clarke explained that the provisional and tentative nature of these bullet points
reflected the fact that he had not yet completed his review of Mr Jenkins’ expert
evidence and that he was not yet prepared to progress in his advice from expressing
concems to stating that Mr Jenkins had misled the court: 9 May 2024 72:5-73:16
(INQ00001144).

At 17:13 on 12 July 2013, Mr Williams forwarded (POL00191967) to Mr Parsons
of Bond Dickinson (cc. Ms Crichton, Mr Flemington and others), stating that “a
more detailed note should arrive on Monday”. This is almost certainly a reference
to the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice. Mr Williams asked Mr Parsons to draft an

email to put Fujitsu on notice of the issue with Mr Jenkins.

An email from Mr Williams to Ms Crichton and Mr Flemington on 13 July 2013
(POL00297710) contained an “overview of where we are on the Horizon/Second

Sight matter, and who is doing what.” These included:
“Current and historic criminal case review — Cartwright King
- Review is now considering pre-Separation cases

- CK notifying POL of cases where further disclosure is required (e.g. of the SS
Interim Report) as they are identified

- Next conference call on progress is set for Wednesday 17.07.13 — CK has

Hugh emailed new Fujitsu contact — Torstein Godeseth — to CK on 10.07.13
CKto arrange to meet TG

Andy Parsons, BD progressing new independent expert.”

o. The Clarke Expert Evidence Advice (POL00040000) is dated 15 July 2013. Mr
Clarke advised that:

di There were convicted and current defendants to whom POL was obliged to
disclose (i) the two bugs in HNGX; and (ii) the Helen Rose Report under its
disclosure duty as prosecutor. POL would need to carry out a review to ensure

that these disclosure failings were rectified.

ii. Mr Jenkins’ failure to disclose the bugs in his expert evidence was a breach
by him of his duty as an expert witness and a breach by POL of its duty as a

prosecutor.

p. CK sent the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice to POL on 17 July 2013. It was first
emailed by Martin Smith to Ms Crichton (cc. Mr Flemington) at 08:23 with the
message “Please find attached Simon Clarke’s advice concerning Gareth Jenkins.”
(POL00039999, POL00192249). At 10:40, Ms Crichton forwarded the advice to
Mr Williams and Andrew Parsons (cc. Mr Flemington) with the message “I haven’t
read this yet.” (POL00039999) (POL00192249); (WBON0000770). At 11:14, Mr
Williams forwarded the advice to Mr Parsons (cc. Hugh Flemington) with the
message: “Andy — this is the advice note from Cartwright King which can be used

to form an approach to Fujitsu about this specific issue and Horizon generally (see

40

SUBS0000071

one of my emails to you on Friday night)”. (POL00039999); (POL00192249)
(WBON0000770).

This chronology shows that the advice about disclosure and Mr Jenkins was given
piecemeal against the background of a rapidly moving situation. Ms Vennells submits

that:

a. It is likely that Mr Clarke is correct that he did not advise POL about Mr Jenkins’
and POL’s breaches of duty until he produced the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice
on 15 July 2013. There is no documentary evidence that he did so and, indeed, the

documents, as a whole, suggest that he did not:

i. Although Mr Clarke is likely to have raised Mr Jenkins at the conference on
3 July 2013, the documents which have a bearing on what was said at the
conference suggest the conference focussed on POL’s disclosure duties. Mr
Clarke stated in his witness statement that he was concemed at the time that
POL did not understand its duties in relation to disclosure, including the need
to retain and disseminate information known within the business to the legal
team: WS §43-44 (WITN08130100).

ii. The advice requested by Mr Flemington on 8 July 2013 concerning what
POL should tell Fujitsu about Mr Jenkins, was to assist POL in obtaining a
new, but short-term, Horizon expert from Fujitsu for imminent court

hearings.

iii. The documents strongly suggest that the purpose of the second piece of
written advice requested by Flemington, to address “the impact of the SS
Indep Review and the Bugs/GJ WS issues”, was to equip POL with

information to notify Fujitsu of the situation with Mr Jenkins.

iv. CK sent Mr Flemington Mr Clarke’s bullet point thoughts on Mr Jenkins on
12 July 2013 as a preview of Mr Clarke’s formal advice, i.e. the Clarke
Expert Evidence Advice, which was not yet complete. As can be seen, the
bullet points are less stark than the final written advice and do not contain the
conclusion that Mr Jenkins and POL had breached their duties
(POL00191967). The document is consistent with Mr Clarke’s evidence that

4l
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

he did not reach those conclusions until shortly before he completed the

Clarke Expert Evidence Advice.

b. The circulation of the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice was limited to Ms Crichton,
Mr Williams, Mr Flemington and Mr Parsons of Bond Dickinson. Ms Crichton

accepted that the document was not sent to the Board.

c. Ms Crichton said that she cannot remember reading the Clarke Expert Evidence
Advice at the time, but that the contents of the advice “had previously formed part
of the face to face discussion I had with CK when we agreed on their disclosure

proposal.”

d. Ms Crichton appeared to state here that the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice was a
written record of the advice given in conference on 3 July 2013. This must be
inaccurate. The conference on 3 July 2013 focussed on POL’s disclosure duties,
including its obligation to retain potentially disclosable material. There is no
evidence that Mr Clarke advised on the Helen Rose Report until 11 July 2013. The
evidence suggests that Mr Clarke did not advise POL that Mr Jenkins and POL had
breached their duties until 17 July 2013, when CK sent the Clarke Expert Evidence
Advice to POL.

e. It is plausible that Ms Crichton did not pay much attention to the Clarke Expert
Evidence Advice when it was received. She does not recall reading it and, on her
own evidence, she was more concerned at this time with the progress of the
prosecution case review. It is possible that Ms Crichton assumed that the written
advice added nothing to what she had already been told, particularly since Mr
Flemington sought the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice, not to obtain further legal
guidance on POL’s disclosure duties and the case review, but to set a position that

could be communicated to Fujitsu.

f. The best evidence of Ms Crichton’s state of knowledge about Mr Jenkins in July
2013 is the passage in Mr Richardson’s file note of a meeting with Ms Crichton on
10 July 2013 which records: “The real worry was around the Fujitsu expert who

appeared to have known of some of the problems but not referred to them in his

“8 This appears to be a reference to the conference on 3 July 2013.

42

82.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

report or statement even though they could be dismissed. There are non-disclosure
issues here.” (POL00407582)

g. What this appears to be suggesting is that, although Mr Jenkins failed to disclose
problems in his reports and statements, “they could be dismissed”, i.e. the problems
he failed to mention were not relevant to the cases in which he was instructed. This
is most likely to have meant, in the context of non-disclosure in POL prosecutions
for theft and false accounting, that the problems did not cause the shortfalls that Mr

Jenkins had addressed in his reports.

Before POL received the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice on 17 July 2013, Ms Crichton
prepared a document for the Board, dated 12 July 2013, entitled “Update following the
publication of the Interim Report on Horizon” (the Board Paper) (POL00006546), which
the Board discussed at its meeting on 16 July 2013. This was the first document prepared
for the Board which contained any explanation from Ms Crichton, or anyone else in POL

legal, about the review of past prosecutions. The document stated that:

a. POL was reviewing ongoing and new prosecutions to determine whether they

should be adjourned, or other action taken in light of the SSIR (paragraph 3.6).

b. On the advice of external criminal lawyers, POL had immediately begun a review
of criminal cases conducted since separation on 1 April 2012 and that more details

about the review were set out in Annex I to the document (paragraph 3.7).

Ms Crichton did not attend the Board meeting on 16 July 2013 to present her update
paper. The decision to exclude Ms Crichton from the meeting was made by Ms Perkins:
5 June 2024 135:6-138:14 (INQ00001156). Ms Vennells has stated in her evidence that
she was not given any notice of this decision and that “I explained to Alice that Susan
would find it hard to take, as she had prepared her update for the POL Board; plus, there
would undoubtedly be questions from the POL Board, which I may not be able to
answer”: 41035 PV WS1 (WITN01020100) Ms Perkins did not give any evidence to

suggest that Ms Vennells’ recollection is wrong.
Paragraph I of Annex I of the Board Paper stated that:

"Post Office have been advised by our external criminal lawyers to undertake a
review of all cases going back to the time of the migration from Old Horizon to

43
83.

84.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Horizon Online (aka HNGX) - Ist January 2010 - and this has already begun.
They are essentially looking at whether or not anything in the SS interim report
should be drawn to the attention of any defendants (current or past) and if so
they will be writing to the relevant defendants providing them with a copy of the
interim report. We have a continuing legal duty as the prosecutors to do this."

The remainder of Annex I stated that:

a. It was believed that POL had undertaken about 55 prosecutions a year for the last
10 years, although there was difficulty in obtaining historic files from RMG. The
external lawyers had advised that POL would need to disclose the additional
evidence in 5% of cases and then it would be up to the defence lawyers to consider

the evidence and apply to the Court of Appeal.

b. Each individual would need to seek leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal if
they wanted to overturn their conviction. The Court of Appeal would look at each
case on its merits and consider the evidence that the person was convicted on. For
example, there might be Horizon evidence but also other paper trail evidence or
even admissions of guilt. It was by no means clear that each appeal would be

successful.
c. POL might also face civil suits for wrongful convictions.

A number of points can be made about this document. First, Ms Crichton stated in her
oral evidence (though not in her witness statement) that she told Ms Vennells about the

risks set out in an earlier version of the document (POL00191681).

a. These included, at paragraph 3.4.1 of (POL00191681), that “Our external lawyers
have advised us that they believe there will be around 5-10% of these [appeals]
which may be successfully overturned and the convictions quashed”: 23 April

2024 104:5-105:3 (INQ00001134).

b. This earlier version of the document was emailed to Ms Crichton on 10 July 2013
by Mr Flemington with the message “This is where I got to” (POL00191680). Ms
Crichton was vague as to when she may have told Ms Vennells about the risks
outlined in (POL00191681). She stated that it “would have been” around 12 July
2013 but that it “might have been a bit later than that”: 23 April 2024 104:19-105:3
(INQ00001134).

44
85.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

This evidence makes little sense in light of Ms Crichton’s subsequent evidence on the
same day of her oral evidence that she amended the draft document to remove the
reference to 5-10% of the potential appeals being successful as a result of discussions
with CK, who gave her “revised information”. She said that, in making the changes, she
was “just stating the facts, I suppose” and that she was “guided by [CK] who were
undertaking the review”: 23 April 2024 109:2-110:20 (INQ00001134). Ms Crichton had
made this change by 12 July 2013: see the version of the document at (POL00145426).
In other words, the amended version of the document (i.e. the version that went to the
Board) accurately reflected the advice Ms Crichton had obtained from CK. It is highly
unlikely that Ms Crichton briefed Ms Vennells about the earlier version on or around 12
July 2013 or afterwards, because by this point, Ms Crichton understood that the advice

from CK was not that 5-10% of appeals were likely to succeed.

Second, at paragraph 4.6 of the annex to the update to the Board, Ms Crichton
recommended that POL should take a “reactive approach” to criminal appeals: “[POL
should wait for those to be overturned by the Court of Appeal and for claims for
compensation to be made. We then decide whether to settle or fight these cases on a case
by case basis.” Ms Crichton believed that CK had advised POL to take this approach (23
April 2024 105:18-105:20 (INQ00001134)) and explained the rationale in her oral
evidence: “I thought it was very important to start that disclosure process and, as we see
through the other documents, we then ask for that disclosure to be validated and further
advice came from Mr Altman and, frankly, I think that, after Post Office got through that
stage, then there should have been a step back to say And what next?’”: 23 April 2024
105:9-105:17 (INQ00001134). Ms Vennells submits that it was a matter for the lawyers
to advise what additional steps POL should take in light of the outcome of the disclosure

exercise and Mr Altman KC’s advice.

Third, the paper did not ask the Board to make any decisions about the review of past
cases. It summarised the advice from external specialist lawyers as to the appropriate
course of action, i.e. to conduct a review of past cases, which was already being

implemented.

Fourth, the document does not mention Mr Jenkins, either by name or by reference to his

role as an expert witness. It also does not state that CK’s main areas of concern in relation

45
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

to disclosure were the two bugs in HNGX and the Helen Rose Report. Ms Crichton

explained the omission of any mention of Mr Jenkins in her written and oral evidence:

a. Ms Crichton stated in her witness statement that her update to the Board for its July
2013 meeting “would have focussed on the disclosure exercise that was by then
underway, rather than the possibility of finding a new expert witness. From my
perspective, this was because establishing POL's disclosure requirements and
complying with these requirements was more of a pressing, long-term issue at this
time. I felt that finding another expert witness could wait until the disclosure issue
had been resolved, and could then form part of Mr [Altman] KC's Board
presentation once he had completed his review in October 2013.” (WS 4260)
(WITN00220100).

b. — Ms Crichton gave similar oral evidence when she was asked whether Mr Clarke’s
evidence about Mr Jenkins was one of the matters in her knowledge that should

have been raised at Board level:

“T think the outcome of those were raised, in the sense of we then had to review
the prosecutions, look for new expert evidence, but I'm not sure, I can't fully
remember and, again, it would have been something I might have discussed
rather than written down, about the fact that Gareth Williams (sic) was an expert
we could no longer use, and to explain why that was so important to the Board.”
24 April 2024 9:7-9:15 (INQ00001135).

In these parts of her evidence, Ms Crichton framed the issue with Mr Jenkins as being
that POL could no longer use him as an expert and needed to find a replacement.
Although not contemporaneous, this evidence supports the possibility that Ms Crichton
may not have been familiar with the contents of the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice at
the time. It also shows that Ms Crichton’s focus in her communications with the Board

focussed on what POL needed to do operationally, rather than why it needed to do it.

In her oral evidence, Ms Crichton stated that, while she could not remember doing so, it
was likely that she told Ms Vennells that there had been an expert whose evidence was
unreliable and which was used in criminal prosecutions: 24 April 2024 10:7-10:13
(INQ00001135). Ms Vennells agrees that she became aware of an issue with an expert
witness, but there are issues as to the content and the timing of Ms Vennells’

understanding.

46
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

90. Ms Vennells believes that she became aware of an issue with expert evidence from a
conversation with Ms Sewell. Ms Sewell said that POL’s expert witness from Fujitsu had
been stood down because he had not revealed bugs during the prosecution of Ms Misra.
Ms Sewell was unhappy about this, because she said the bugs were irrelevant to the case:
23 May 2024 75:14- 76:23 (INQ00001152); PV WS1 9563 (WITN01020100). This was
followed by a discussion with Ms Crichton, who explained that there was a duty of
disclosure, and that POL would need to review cases in which the expert had given
evidence: 22 May 2024: 41:2-17 (INQ00001151). Ms Vennells cannot recall precisely
when these conversations occurred.*° She was not however told about the contents of the
Clarke Expert Evidence Advice, or that there had been a breach of duty by the expert or
by POL as prosecutor.

91. Mr Jenkins was mentioned at a meeting on 22 July 2013 attended by, among others, Ms
Vennells, Ms Crichton and Second Sight, to discuss the completion of the investigation
of the cases within the Second Sight Review (SSL0000108). Mr Warmington stated that
Second Sight had been assisted during their review to date by “incredibly high quality
material put together by [Mr Jenkins], who obviously knows the system like the back of
his hand, and do I get the sense that he’s coming up to retirement? That could be quite a
problem for us if he’s about to leave.” Ms Crichton responded “To be honest, Ron....
Let’s take that offline I think.” Mr Warmington’s comment about Mr Jenkins was picked

up later in the conversation by Ms Vennells:

“... [think 2 things: one is we need to go back to FJ with some specifics around
turnaround times..... Secondly, this guy Gareth, whether he’s replaced or in fact
whether we might want to use him in the same way if he does leave Fujitsu, is
in the process, if he’s a good quality individual...”

92. On 22 July 2013 at 18:57, Ms Lyons sent a note of the meeting to Ms Crichton. At 21:36,
Ms Crichton replied with her comments in capital letters (POL00192725). Ms Lyons
recorded a comment from Second Sight that “It was thought that Gareth Jenkins produced
high quality (sic.) and he may be able to help the process”, i.e. the continuing

investigation of the cases. Ms Crichton did not comment on this statement, despite her

4° Ms Vennells stated in her oral evidence on 24 May 2022 that she believed that the conversations occurred at
least a month before 27 September 2022: 24 May 2024 34:25-35:10 (INQ00001153).

47

knowledge by 22 July 2013 that there were doubts about the reliability of Mr Jenkins’

evidence in relation to Horizon.

Ms Vennells submits that the discussion at the meeting and the email exchange between
Ms Lyons and Ms Crichton strongly suggest that, as of 22 July 2013, she had been told

nothing at all about any concerns with Mr Jenkins.

The first indication in the documents that Ms Vennells was aware of any issue with expert
evidence is contained in an email exchange between Ms Vennells and Ms Crichton
between 23 and 28 August 2013 (POL00108065). The email in the chain from Ms
Crichton to Ms Vennells on 27 August 2013 contains the text of Ms Crichton’s initial
email to Ms Vennells, Ms Vennells’ queries on the email, and Ms Crichton’s replies. It

includes the following exchange on the issue of expert evidence:

“ [SC] We are urgently working with our external firms to identify an
independent expert to provide evidence on the Horizon system. [PV]
PREVIOUSLY THIS WAS PROVIDED BY FUJITSU? WHY MOVE FROM
THIS? DO WE HAVE TO VALIDATE FUJITSU? [SC] We are concerned that
this needs to be independent rather than FJ verifying its own system. Happy to
explain rationale further at our steering board meeting this week.”

The exchange suggests that Ms Vennells had not been fully informed about the legal
issues around expert evidence and Mr Jenkins in late August 2013.*” The first document
created for the use of the Sparrow Steering Group which mentioned that POL was seeking
anew independent expert was a presentation prepared for the Steering Group meeting on
29 August 2013. It did not explain why POL needed a new expert (POL00139111). The
first document sent to the Board which referred to the instruction of an independent
expert was the Significant Litigation Report for the September 2013 meeting
(POL00027528), which reported that POL was not issuing any new criminal cases
pending the instruction of a new independent expert who could give evidence to support
the Horizon system. Again, however, it did not explain the rationale for the instruction
of a new expert. The documents suggest that Ms Crichton was following the sequencing

of the provision of information she described in her oral evidence, namely, that the

47 See Ms Vennells’ oral evidence about this document on 24 May 2024 36:18-38:8 (INQ00001153).

48
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

instruction of a new expert was less important than ensuring progress in the prosecution

case review.

96. On 21 October 2013, Ms Vennells sent an email to Ms Perkins to update her on various
matters before she left on holiday (POL00382001). These included:

“My concern re Sparrow currently is our obligations of disclosure re., an unsafe
witness. (The representative from Fujitsu made statements about no bugs, which
later could be seen to have been undermined by the SS Report.) We do not think
it material but it could be high profile. Martin E is briefed if you want more
detail. This is just in case.”

97. Since the document was disclosed after Ms Vennells gave evidence, she had no

opportunity to give evidence about it. Ms Vennells makes the following submissions:

iti.

There is a similarity between Ms Vennells’ description of the issue to Ms Perkins
and the reference in Mr Richardson’s file note of his meeting with Ms Crichton and
Mr Flemington on 10 July 2013 to a “Fujitsu expert who appeared to have known
of some of the problems but not referred to them in his report or statement even

though they could be dismissed.” (POL00407582):

In both descriptions, the expert’s omission to mention problems or bugs is
followed by a qualification. In Mr Richardson’s file note, the qualification is
that “they”, meaning the problems the expert failed to disclose, “could be
dismissed”. In Ms Vennells’ email, the qualification is that “we do not think
it material”. “It” in that sentence clearly means the statements by the expert
that were undermined by the SSIR. The statements in the file note and in Ms
Vennells’ email appear to mean much the same thing, namely, that the
failings of the expert did not or do not have a significant impact on the safety

of prosecutions.

The statement in Mr Richardson’s file note is also echoed in Ms Vennells’
recollection that Ms Sewell stated that the expert had been stood down even

though the bugs he failed to disclose were irrelevant in the case.

Ms Vennells could not have taken the information in her email to Ms Perkins
from any document disclosed by the Inquiry. There are no documents sent to

Ms Vennells before 21 October 2013 which refer to an unsafe witness. The

49
98.

99:

100.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

content of the email can only have come from POL legal, and it positions the

expert evidence issue in a way which downplays its seriousness.

b. Ms Vennells’ description of the unsafe witness as a “current” concern suggests that

this concern was a relatively recent development in October 2013.

c. Ms Vennells shared what she knew with Ms Perkins and directed her to Mr
Edwards if she required any more information. There is no evidence that Ms

Perkins followed up on Ms Vennells’ email.

Ms Vennells submits that this evidence suggests that the advice about Mr Jenkins and its
relationship to disclosure was given to Ms Vennells in an unstructured and piecemeal
manner. Even then, what Ms Vennells was told did not properly capture the gravity of
the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice and, indeed, downplayed its gravity. However, Ms
Vennells was told, and told repeatedly, that POL was taking the necessary and
appropriate steps by conducting a review of past prosecution cases, that this task was in
the hands of specialist external criminal lawyers, and that their work was being reviewed
by a senior and experienced criminal barrister, Mr Altman KC. As a non-lawyer, and
based on what she knew, Ms Vennells was entitled to accept that POL was acting

appropriately on specialist legal advice.

Ms Crichton accepted in her evidence that it was her responsibility to put in place a
process which ensured that the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice be brought to the attention
of the Board, and that she had not discharged this responsibility: 24 April 2024 13:13-
14:5 (INQ00001135).

Mr Aujard also failed to bring the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice to the attention of the
Board: 24 April 2024 99:19-99:23 (INQ00001135). He accepted that he received a copy
of the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice as an annex to a CK briefing note on the legal
issues raised in relation to POL prosecutions when he started as Interim GC in October
2013 (POL00108136): 24 April 2024: 74:15-74:19; 78:9-78:21 (INQ00001135). He
claimed not to recall whether he read it in detail: he suggested that his view at the time
was that it was a “historic detail” that was being dealt with through the case review
process: 24 April 2024: 79:21-80:2 (INQ00001135). He stated that he did not know
whether the Board had been told that Mr Jenkins had breached his duties as an expert and

50
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

assumed that he would have been informed if the Board had not been told: 24 April 2024
91:8-91:24 (INQ00001135).

101. Ms Crichton has not said, in her written or oral evidence, that she told Ms Vennells about
the Helen Rose Report and its significance to POL’s disclosure duties. Ms Vennells

submits that it is highly unlikely that she was told anything in this regard:

a. There is no documentary or witness evidence that she was told, and Ms Vennells
cannot recall being briefed about the Helen Rose Report and the issues arising from
it: PV WS1 49379; 708-714 (WITN01020100).

b. Mr Aujard stated that he did not tell the Board about the Helen Rose Report: 24
April 2024 99:19-99:23 (INQ00001135).

c. (POL00108163) is an email chain dating from 23-24 October 2013 in which Mr
Williams and Mr Edwards decided not to mention the Helen Rose Report in Ms
Vennells’ CEO report for the October 2013 Board meeting, which they were
engaged in drafting. Mr Edwards stated in his oral evidence that he did this because
“I was quite concerned about putting in information into a report going out in
Paula's name when she wasn't familiar with this issue. It felt inappropriate to put
something in a report in her name before she'd been properly briefed”: 26 July
2024: 152:6-152:10 (INQ00001182). Although Mr Edwards stated that he
intended that a briefing session for Ms Vennells would be arranged before the
October 2013 Board meeting, he was not present at any briefing, as he was about
to go on leave: 26 July 2024: 152:11-152:22 (INQ00001182). There is no
evidence that Ms Vennells was briefed about the Helen Rose report before the

October 2013 Board meeting.

Conduct of the prosecution case review

102. The Board was provided with additional information about the review of criminal cases
in a paper dated 26 July 2013 (POL00006590) entitled “Update on the work programme
arising from the Horizon report”. The “Prosecution Case Review” was addressed in
section (ii), which provided the following information, although again, it omitted any

mention of Mr Jenkins or expert evidence:

51
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. POL had a continuing duty to act properly and fairly in prosecutions, which
required POL to disclose to the defence any information that undermined the
prosecution. This assessment was made on a case-by-case basis. POL was
complying with this duty by engaging CK to review past and present prosecutions
to identify any cases where the SSIR should be disclosed. It was then up to the
defendant to decide whether to seek permission to appeal their conviction from the

Court of Appeal.
b. As of 22 July 2013, CK had reviewed 124 cases, with the following outcomes:

* "the prosecution has been discontinued in three cases as not being in the public
interest;

* disclosure to the defence has been provided in 6 cases;
+ in all cases, the recommendation is that we oppose any attempt to appeal; and

*"it is not believed that any of the cases would satisfy the test for compensation
from the Government for a miscarriage of justice under the Criminal Justice
Act."

c. The next stage of the Sift Review was to "review pre-separation case files held by

Royal Mail, initially dating back to the start of 2010".

d. POL was "consulting Brian Altman KC, a leading barrister ... to provide additional
advice and independent oversight on this case review process and any wider
criminal law questions that arise (for example questions from the [CCRC] about
how we are handling this matter)". The scope of Mr Altman KC’s work would also
include recommendations about POL's future prosecutions strategy, to inform
POL's thinking.

103. This paper was not written by Ms Crichton. It was suggested to her in her oral evidence
that the author may have been Ms Vennells: 23 April 2024 128:7-128:18
(INQ00001134). This is incorrect. Mr Edwards said in his evidence that he prepared the
paper with input from SMEs (meaning subject matter experts) on the content relating to
the CK review of past prosecutions. Mr Edwards shared a draft of the paper with Ms
Crichton and Ms Vennells on the moming of 26 July 2013, stating that he would be

grateful for any comments: see (POL00192884). The content of the note in relation to

52
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

prosecutions (regardless of who drafted it) could only have come from the POL legal
department.

104. During August and September 2013, Ms Crichton provided further updates on the

progress of the review of past prosecutions and the role of Mr Altman KC.

a. On2 August 2013, Mr Altman KC produced his “Interim Review” of CK’s process
for reviewing criminal cases for disclosure (POL00006801). Ms Vennells and the
Board were not shown the “Interim Review”. However, on 9 August 2013,

(POL00381490) Ms Crichton reported to Ms Vennells (cc. Mr Day and Mr Baker):

“Criminal process is on going with three cases being discontinued following
review as no longer being in the public interest, there are approximately 50 files
which still need to be reviewed with 37 to come from RMG. As yet we have not
received any notice of appeal or any queries from the defence lawyers.

Brian Altman QC has been asked to review the process being undertaken but
[sic] Cartright King (our external criminal lawyers) and found that the current
process CK have adopted is broadly fine. He raises some issues and we have
given the report to CK and they are preparing a written response with a view to
a face to face meeting in late August when Brian Altman is back from holiday.

Terms of reference for the review by Brian Altman has been drafted and needs
to be agreed by end of August when he is back from holiday..."

b. In an email on 30 August 2013 (POL00108087) Ms Crichton informed Ms
Vennells that:

Meeting was held with our external law firm who have been completing the
criminal case review on Friday

The issues that we want Brian Altman QC to advice [sic] on were agreed, final
sign off of review process; and advice on prosecutions going forward.

Conference agreed for 9th September where the focus will be on our
prosecutorial obligations of disclosure of any information which may be of
assistance to the defence. After this conference we will finalise the terms of
reference for Brian Altman's review; this will include, amongst other things a
consideration of POL's position re criminal prosecutions."

SUBS0000071

c. Ms Crichton gave Ms Vennells an update on the conference with Mr Altman KC
on 9 September 2013 in an email dated 13 September 2013 (POL00027667):
“.,.overall his opinion in conference was that the work that had already been
completed was fine and along the right lines taking into account [POL’s]
prosecutorial duties to disclose evidence/information to the defence; he confirmed
that this duty was ongoing and continued after conviction. We have agreed the TOR
for his review which should be completed in October and will include advice on

whether Post Office should bring prosecutions.”

d. On 18 September 2013 Ms Crichton prepared an update for the Board on what was
now known as Project Sparrow (POL00027134):

i. CK had completed three sift reviews, discontinued four prosecutions, and

given disclosure of the SSIR in nine cases.

ii. A meeting had been held with Mr Altman KC on 9 September 2013. Mr
Altman KC had received CK’s protocol for the Sift Review and looked at a
sample of the cases within the Review which had been completed by CK.
“He agreed with the approach taken by our external lawyers and confirmed
that the protocol was well thought through being correctly applied in the
cases he reviewed. After discussion he also understood the logic of 1“
January 2010 being the start date for the review on the basis that this was
implementation date for [HNGX] and that branches had been audited on

transition.”

iii. Mr Altman KC would be engaged going forward to advise POL and its

external solicitors on POL’s continuing disclosure obligations.

iv. The terms of reference for his review would be agreed and include an opinion

on POL’s “position as a public prosecutor and its prosecutions policy.”

105. Mr Altman KC produced his “General Review” of the prosecution case review on 15
October 2013 (POL00006581). Again, this was not shown to Ms Vennells, nor to the
Board. Ms Vennells’ CEO report for the October 2013 Board meeting (which was
prepared for her by Mr Edwards and Mr Williams) stated that:

54
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

“Our extemal firm of criminal solicitors, Cartwright King (CK), has now
completed a review of 301 cases subject to past prosecution to identify whether
we have a duty to disclose the findings of the Second Sight report and associated
issues. CK has concluded that disclosure is appropriate in 10 of these cases, and
a short letter has therefore been sent to each of the defence teams to bring their
attention to the report....In view of the potential interest from the Criminal Cases
Review Commission, we have also asked our criminal barrister, Brian Altman
QC, to conduct an independent review of the overall process we have taken to
review past cases, reaching the conclusion that our approach is ‘fundamentally
sound’.

106. Similarly, a paper on prosecutions policy prepared by Mr Aujard for the ARC on 8
November 2013 stated that the headline conclusions of Mr Altman KC’s “backward
looking report” (i.e. his “General Review”) were that the review of past prosecutions was
“fundamentally sound” and that no “systemic or fundamental flaws in the review
process” had been detected. Mr Altman KC had also made a number of relatively small

procedural recommendations, such as in relation to document retention (POL00027501).
107. Ms Vennells submits that:

a She received information about the case review but was not consulted about, and
had no involvement in, directing the structure of the review, deciding which
lawyers to engage, or decisions about what documents should be disclosed and to
whom. The review was an operational legal project, which could only be carried
out by specialist lawyers subject to the oversight of the GCs. This was also the
rationale for entrusting to the GC the responsibility to manage POL’s responses to
the CCRC: PV WS 41557 (WITN01020100).

b. The documents summarised above, individually and cumulatively, would have
given any reasonable person in Ms Vennells’ position reassurance that the review
process was being carried out competently and in a professional manner by
specialist criminal solicitors and that their approach had been endorsed by Mr
Altman KC. This was also Ms Perkins’ position at the time. She stated in her
written evidence that, as a non-executive director without operational control, “one
of the things you are keen to determine is that that critical issues are being
appropriately resourced and that the right external advisors and experts are being
engaged to ensure that the company is receiving the best advice. I think that at this

point in July 2013, I would have felt confident that this was happening with regard

55
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

to the legal review.” (WS §263) (WITN00740100). Ms Perkins derived confidence
from the subsequent reports received about the advice from CK and Mr Altman

KC (WS§303.3) (WITN00740100).

c. Ms Perkins made the point in her evidence that the summaries of the external legal
advice presented to the Board were inadequate. They failed to alert the Board to,
among other matters: (a) the conclusions of the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice;
(b) the existence and the significance of the Helen Rose report; (c) Mr Altman KC’s
view in his October 2013 General Advice that Mr Jenkins was tainted and that his
future role as a witness was untenable; (d) the statement in Mr Altman KC’s
General Advice that he was left unclear about whether POL had challenged Mr
Jenkins about his non-disclosures; (e) Mr Altman KC’s criticisms of the disorder
of POL’s prosecution policies and past prosecutions; and (f) the possibility that CK
were conflicted due to their role in past prosecutions, including those in which Mr

Jenkins had given evidence.

d. However, at the time, none of the Board members asked to see copies of the
external advice or to meet CK or Mr Altman KC. There was an assumption on the
part of the Board that the GCs were complying with their core responsibilities to
alert the Board to legal risks, and to provide accurate and complete summaries of
external legal advice. That is the only way to understand Ms Perkins’ evidence that
the omissions from the summaries were “shocking” and “extraordinary”: WS 82;

276 (WITN00740100).

e. It is Mr Aujard’s evidence that he made no attempt to draw Ms Vennells’ attention
to the Clarke Expert Evidence Advice, or the Helen Rose Report. On the one
occasion when Ms Vennells became aware by word of mouth of a piece of
information about past prosecutions, i.e. that POL had used an unsafe witness from

Fujitsu, she informed Ms Perkins.

108. The evidence before the Inquiry has shown that there were misjudgements, mistakes, and
lines of inquiry not followed by the lawyers engaged in the review of prosecution cases

and in the legal advice obtained by POL at this time. These included:

a. Mr Altman KC did not consider the procedure by which Mr Jenkins had been

instructed as an expert witness because no-one at POL told him that Mr Jenkins

56
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

had not been properly instructed. He stated, however, that, looking back, this was
something that he should have queried: 8 May 2024: 38:12-39:15
(INQ00001143). Mr Altman KC agreed that, if he had been informed that Mr
Jenkins may not have been properly instructed, or properly informed about his
duties as an expert witness, this may have led to inquiries into broader failings by
CK as prosecuting lawyers and whether CK had a conflict of interest in advising
POL on past prosecutions in which CK had acted as prosecuting lawyers: 8 May
2024: 40:4-40:7 (INQ00001143). When it was put to Mr Altman KC that if “this
thread had been pulled, i.e., who has instructed, Gareth Jenkins, and how, that may
have been revelatory of disclosure failings but also of misconduct by prosecutors,
mightn't it?”, he indicated that that was potentially correct, and that he agreed that
this went to “the issue of how deep into the organisation and how close to the

lawyers the problem is.” 8 May 2024: 41:8-41:17 (INQ00001143).

Mr Altman KC accepted in his evidence that, with the benefit of hindsight, the fact
that Mr Jenkins had withheld information about bugs in Horizon in his expert
evidence should have been considered for disclosure and disclosed in appropriate
cases: 8 May 2024: 52:22-53:15; 172:6-172:13 (INQ00001143).

Mr Altman KC was not told by POL that the Receipts and Payments Mismatch
bug (a) was known to the POL IT department and a POL operational team in
September 2010; and (b) was known to three POL lawyers, Mr Wilson, Ms
McFarlane, and Mr Singh, by 29 September 2010: 8 May 2024: 36:22-37:11
(INQ00001143). He also did not know that POL had been informed about the bug
the working day before the start of Ms Misra’s trial: 37:18-37:23 (INQ00001143).

Mr Clarke agreed in his oral evidence that he accepted that there was a view that
CK’s review of past prosecutions “probably wasn’t as independent as it ought to
have been” (9 May 2024 68: 21 — 69:9 (INQ00001144)) and that CK’s review
may have become less rigorous and observant of potential trends or themes in the
cases as the review progressed: 9 May 2024 69:11-70:8 (INQ00001144). When
he was asked whether CK may have become case-hardened during the review, he

said: “That's exactly what I'm referring to. That's the point I'm making: that

ST
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

because you become slightly cynical, jaded, as inevitably is going to be the case,

then you do miss things. Yes, I accept that.”

e. Mr Clarke also accepted that he was wrong not to have recommended disclosure
following his review of Ms Misra’s case: 9 May 2024: 129:11-134:5
(INQ00001144).

109. As stated above, Ms Vennells was told that the prosecution case review was the
appropriate legal step for POL to take and that it was being conducted by specialist
lawyers and subject to review by Mr Altman KC. If the lawyers engaged in the task made
mistakes, failed to ask questions, failed to provide information, and became jaded and
hardened to the SPM cases over time, it is difficult to identify what Ms Vennells, as a

non-lawyer, could have done which would have achieved a better outcome.

The review of POL’s prosecutorial role

110. In his paper for the ARC meeting on 19 November 2013 (POL00027501), Mr Aujard
stated that Mr Altman KC had produced a report making recommendations as to the
future approach to the conduct of prosecutions (which he termed the “forward looking
report” to distinguish it from the “backward looking report” which had looked at the

conduct of the CK review). Mr Aujard stated in paragraph 2.4 of the paper that:

“The forward looking report is similarly positive in tone, with Brian Altman
commenting that he had seen no evidence to suggest that Post Office Ltd
exercises its investigations and prosecution function in anything other than a
well-organised, structured and efficient manner, through an expert and dedicated
team of in-house investigators and lawyers, supported by Cartwright King
solicitors and their in-house counsel. That said, it was noted that Post Office
Ltd's prosecution role is perhaps anachronistic, and that POL is the only
commercial organisation (albeit Government owned) I can think of (apart from
RMG who retains a residual prosecuting function) that has a prosecution role,
and it is, to that extent, exceptional if not unique.”

111. The paper asked for the ARC’s directional views on potential changes to POL’s
prosecution policy and on further proposed work before a recommendation was made to
the Board. The paper explained the rationale for POL’s existing approach to prosecutions
and the factors in favour of change. The Paper identified four options for the way

forward:

58
112.

TIS:

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. Preserving the status quo, i.e. retaining a prosecutorial capability and continuing

with a prosecutions policy similar to the present one.

b. Pursuing a prosecution policy focused only on high value cases and cases involving

vulnerable members of society.

c.  Ceasing all prosecutorial activities but instead actively involving the Police and

CPS where it was felt they were likely to take matters forward; and

d. — Ceasing all prosecutorial activities “at an appropriate point in time” (see paragraph
5.1), but coupled with work to include gathering better management information
("MI") from the Network, improving the overall control framework around the
branch network, providing more support to sub-postmasters, and an analysis of the
ways in which civil proceedings could be used more effectively to reduce the
financial impact once POL ceased to use the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover
misappropriated money. This final option was closest to that adopted by banks and

other organisations at risk of loss due to fraud and criminal activity.

In paragraph 5.1, Mr Aujard recommended option (d) and asked the ARC to consider the

proposals for further work.

The ARC considered the paper at its meeting on 19 November 2013 (POL00021427).
The minutes, and a subsequent paper by Mr Aujard dated 5 February 2014,
(POL00100193) record that:

a. Mr Aujard stated that he was seeking the ARC’s views on potential changes to
POL’s prosecution policy and that further work was required before any formal

recommendation could be made to implement any changes.

b. I The ARC raised two concerns: (a) a timing point about the potential influence of a
change of approach on the Mediation Scheme; and (b) a substantive concern that

the current policy acted as a deterrent.

e: Ms Vennells stated that the business was not stating that it would never bring
prosecutions, but that it would be more circumspect in the cases it chose to take

and there were other means of deterrence.

59
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

d. ‘It was agreed that before any firm decision could be made, further work was
required (a) to determine the financial consequences of amending POL’s
prosecution policy such that fewer cases would be sent to the criminal courts; (b)
to enable the Committee to understand the work being done as part of the Business
Improvement Programme to improve the early detection of losses; and (c) to
understand how banks and other large companies dealt with criminal losses caused

by employees.

e. The ARC directed that the decision on POL’s prosecution policy should be taken
to the January 2014 Board meeting.

114. Ms Vennells submits as follows in relation to this meeting:

a. There was no suggestion in Mr Aujard’s paper that POL should discontinue
prosecutions because of there being any reason to suspect that its past conduct of
prosecutions had been inappropriate. The starting point of Mr Aujard’s analysis
was that Mr Altman KC had not identified anything during his review of POL’s
prosecutorial role to suggest that POL’s approach to prosecutions had been

anything other than “well-organised, structured and efficient.”

b. Mr Marnoch, then the chair of the ARC, reviewed the minutes in the course of
preparing his witness statement and has said that he was not surprised that the ARC

declined to make a decision without exploring the implications of the options
further: WS §60 (WITN11570100).

c. Ms Vennells was attempting during the meeting to identify a compromise that
would allay the concerns of the ARC that POL would lose its ability to deter theft
if it abandoned prosecutions altogether. It is clear from the minute that Ms Vennells

was not proposing that POL should continue its current approach to prosecutions.

115. Mr Aujard’s paper dated 5 February 2014 (POL00100193) set out three options for the

future of POL’s prosecution policy:

a. Preserving the status quo i.e. retaining prosecutorial capability and continuing with
a prosecutions policy which is substantially the same as that which has been used

in the past.

60
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

b. Pursuing a prosecutions policy more focused on more egregious misconduct - e.g.
higher value cases/cases involving vulnerable members of society/cases of
involving particularly wilful wrongdoing, and engaging with the police in relation

to other matters;

c.  Ceasing all prosecutorial activities but instead actively involving the police/CPS

etc where it is felt that they are likely to take matters forward.

116. He recommended option (b) on the basis that (a) did not gain a large degree of support at
the November 2013 ARC meeting and (c) was not discussed in any detail because POL
had been advised that budgetary constraints meant that the CPS was unlikely to prosecute
any but the most serious cases. For option (b), Mr Aujard proposed that POL’s
prosecution policy should apply financial and fact-based filters to focus on high value

crimes involving egregious conduct.

117. The proposal was discussed by the ARC by email on 8 and 9 February 2013
(UKGI00043711, POL00104233, POL00027687, POL00100224). Opinion was
divided between Ms Perkins and Ms Storey, who favoured option (c), and Mr Marnoch,
Mr McCausland, and Ms Vennells, who favoured option (b). As Mr Marnoch correctly
observes in his witness statement, none of the members of the ARC favoured the status
quo: WS 462 (WITN11570100). The debate was limited to whether POL should retain
a scaled back role for prosecutions for the purposes of deterrence. The POL Board
approved option (b) at its meeting on 26 February 2014 (POL00021522). It is submitted
that this was not an unreasonable decision to make, having regard to the factors set out

for consideration by Mr Aujard.

The Second Sight Review In 2012-2013 And The SSIR

118. This section addresses key themes in relation to the Second Sight Review in 2012 and
2013 and the SSIR published on 8 July 2013.

Statements to MPs in May and June 2012

119. The evidence in the Inquiry has shown that statements in the briefing documents provided
to Ms Vennells for the meetings with MPs on 17 May and 18 June 2012, and statements

that Ms Vennells was recorded as making at the meeting with MPs on 18 June 2012

6l
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

(JARBO0000001), were incorrect as a matter of fact, or inappropriate. Ms Vennells was

asked about two of these statements during the course of her evidence:

“Every case taken to prosecution...has found in favour of [POL].” At the time, Ms
Vennells believed this statement to be true because Ms Crichton, the GC, had made
the same statement at the Board meeting in January 2012: (POL00021503); 22
May 2024 47:18-47:24; 53:10-55:6; 56:11-57:7 (INQ00001151). Ms Vennells

explained: “...if you’re given information by the highest lawyers in the
organisation, you take it completely as the truth...”** Ms Vennells submits that she
was entitled to rely on an unequivocal statement by the GC to the Board for its

factual accuracy.

“Temptation is an issue”. Ms Vennells apologised for this statement and explained
that it was an assumption based on two recollections. First, there were examples of
cases where she had been told that this had occurred, at least in theory. Second, she
had been told by Mr Thomson of the NFSP that, on rare occasions, SPMs might

borrow cash from their branch to fund purchases, albeit with the intention of putting

it back: 22 May 2024 57:10-59:1 (INQ00001151).

120. Ms Vennells set out in {ff 262 to 286 of PV WS1 (WITN01020100) how she prepared

for the meetings with MPs. The briefing documents and the pre-meeting discussions were

fed into by senior managers with specialist knowledge of IT (Ms Sewell) and legal

matters (Ms Crichton). Ms Vennells submits that she was entitled to rely on them to

provide accurate information and professional opinions about the matters within their

areas of management responsibility.

The decision to instruct forensic accountants

121. On21 May 2012, Ms Lyons sent Ms Vennells (cc. Ms Crichton) an email which recorded

Ms Perkins’ recollection of what POL had agreed with Lord Arbuthnot at the meeting on

17 May 2012 (POL00105491). It stated that POL would find “a forensic accountant with

good people skills and ask them to look at each case, talk to the subpostmaster, see the

records and files, and look at how the software is validated.” In her evidence, Ms Perkins

said that the decision to engage a forensic accountant rather than Deloitte was dictated

48 Ms Crichton also believed that the statement was true: 24 April 2024: 7:12-8:15 (INQ00001135).

62
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

by Lord Arbuthnot’s opposition to the involvement of a large organisation: Perkins WS
4149 (WITN00740100); 5 June 2024 74:7-75:15 (INQ00001156). Ms Vennells says
that she thought that using one of the Big Four firms may have come across as too
corporate and that they wouldn’t have had an understanding of running a Post Office

branch or a small retail business: 23 May 2024 4:8-4:15 (INQ00001152).

122. It is possible that it was Lord Arbuthnot’s idea that POL should engage, specifically,
forensic accountants to review MPs’ constituency cases. On 18 July 2012, in an email
update to MPs about his discussions with POL (POL00096937) Lord Arbuthnot stated:
“The last time I was in touch we were discussing how the matter might be resolved with
senior management at the Post Office. I suggested to them that they should put in place
forensic accountants who would investigate the cases.”*? Lord Arbuthnot’s interest in
who was appointed to the investigation is shown by an email on 19 June 2012 to Mr
Channer of Shoosmiths (POL00096665) in which he stated that the plan was “for [POL]
to appoint an independent forensic accountant (to be chosen in consultation with me)
who will examine each case individually in order to establish exactly what has

happened.”

123. Ms Crichton recalled that Ms Perkins asked her to find a forensic accountant “who might
be able to help in a different way to that described in the Deloitte report, Deloitte
proposal” who “shouldn't be one of the big four; had to be somebody who would be able
to carry out the review; would be somebody who would be credible to the MPs, James
Arbuthnot, Justice for Subpostmasters; and would be able to have to conversation with
subpostmasters”: 23 April 2024 23 52:17-53:20 (INQ00001134). Ms Crichton obtained
a proposal from Second Sight on I July 2012 (POL00180209) and could not remember
whether the possibility of instructing Deloitte instead of Second Sight, or engaging
Deloitte to conduct an audit as an additional exercise was discussed at a meeting on 7
July 2012: 23 April 2024 57:4-58:3 (INQ00001134). She did recall that Ms Perkins’
objective was to satisfy the MPs, and that a review by Second Sight of their constituency

cases was more likely to achieve that than a review by Deloitte.

124. Ms Perkins said that Second Sight were not preferred over Deloitte because the proposed

Second Sight review was narrower in scope, i.e. a review of individual cases, rather than

* Tt was reported to the Board on 23 May 2012 that “The business had also agreed to use a forensic accountant to
investigate the system and give further comfort to those concerned about these cases.” (POL00099520)

63
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a forensic audit of the system. Second Sight were chosen due to Lord Arbuthnot’s
opposition to an organisation such as Deloitte: 5 June 2024: 78:14-79:7
(INQ00001156).

125. For the reasons stated above, Ms Vennells submits that the decision to instruct Second
Sight was not a means to evade a review of the system by Deloitte. The engagement of
forensic accountants to review MPs’ cases was a practical solution, led by the Chair, to

the concerns raised by Lord Arbuthnot. This is a reasonable approach to have taken.

Richard Morgan KC’s advice on 12 June 2012

126. On 12 June 2012, Ms Crichton, Mr Flemington and Gavin Matthews (Bond Pearce)
attended a conference with Richard Morgan KC. According to Ms Crichton, the
conference was arranged after she had asked Bond Pearce for help in drafting Second
Sight’s terms of reference: SC WS 4135 (WITN00220100); 23 April 2024 50:7-50:16
(INQ00001134). A file note by Bond Pearce (POL00006484) records Mr Morgan KC’s

advice at the conference:

a. The instruction of an independent expert to prepare a report on Horizon was the
highest risk response to concerns about the system. “What will it achieve? It will
not be able to address any of the civil/criminal cases dealt with under “Old

Horizon”. Will it seek to review particular cases? If so, which ones?”

b. POL would be “damned if they do and damned if they don’t”: if the findings of an
independent review were positive, they would be seen as a whitewash, and if they

were negative, they would open the floodgates to damages claims.

c. A less risky approach would be to take the relevant MPs privately through

particular cases in which they were interested.

127. Ms Crichton cannot recall the conference and there is no evidence that she briefed the
Board about the advice: in paragraph 154 of her witness statement, Ms Crichton seems
to accept that she did not brief the Board. Her only recollection of communicating the
advice within POL is that she understood Mr Morgan KC’s point of view that POL was
damned either way if it instructed an independent investigator “in that POL was under

pressure from different sides. I recollect that I flagged this to Ms Perkins and Ms Vennells

64
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

in a meeting following the conference” (SC WS 4151-154) (WITN00220100). There is
no evidence that Ms Perkins or Ms Vennells saw the file note or a document summarising
Mr Morgan KC’s advice. Ms Perkins said that she did not know about Mr Morgan KC’s
advice at the time: Perkins WS 9155 (WITN00740100); 5 June 2024 170:17-171:3
(INQ00001156). That was also Ms Vennells’ evidence: PV WSI1 4309
(WITN01020100): 23 May 2024 15:5-15:23 (INQ00001152).

. Even if Ms Crichton did tell Ms Perkins and Ms Vennells about the “damned if you do,
damned if you don’t” point of view, Mr Morgan KC’s advice had no relevance to POL’s

approach to the Second Sight Review:

a. Ms Crichton said that she did not believe that the advice influenced POL’s decision
to engage Second Sight rather than Deloitte: 23 April 2024 53:21-53:24
(INQ00001134). It would be odd if it had: by the time Mr Morgan KC gave his
advice on 12 June 2012, POL was already progressing the appointment of Second
Sight.

b. Far from following Mr Morgan KC’s advice, the package of measures forming the

Second Sight Review was designed to maximise participation:

i. The final agreed remit of the Inquiry imposed no limitation on who could ask
for an investigation by Second Sight: it was open to all former and current

Horizon users.

ii. To encourage Horizon users to come forward, and at the suggestion of the
JFSA, POL agreed with the JFSA that no-one who presented a case for
investigation would be subject to any detriment, unless the case was
presented in bad faith or dishonestly, or disclosed criminal conduct: PV WS1
9317-319 (WITN01020100).

iii. POL agreed that the JFSA, as well as MPs, could refer cases for investigation:
PV WS1 4321 (WITN01020100).

iv. POL publicised the Second Sight Review via Subspace (the branch Network
magazine) and at NFSP meetings: PV WS1 §321 (WITN01020100).

65
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Conduct of the Second Sight Review

129. In an email to Ms Walker and Mr Warmington on 25 January 2013 (POL00097402), Mr
Henderson stated that Second Sight wished to prioritise cases which had real potential to
show whether there were problems with Horizon. This idea became Second Sight’s
primary methodology for their review leading to the SSIR. Rather than investigating each
case individually, Second Sight decided to consider specific problems reported in cases

and provide the evidence and their conclusions to POL in “Spot Reviews”.

130. As of March 2013, POL expected Second Sight to produce up to 30 Spot Reviews: see
the POL briefing note dated 11 March 2013 at (POL00097589). In addition to the Spot
Reviews, Second Sight intended to investigate themes or problems which they had

identified in multiple cases:
"s Transaction anomalies following communications or power failure
+ Transactions not entered by SPMR or staff

* Missing or duplicated transactions associated with Postage Labels, Phone
Cards, GIRO payments, ATMs or Cheques

* POL team at Bracknell

+ Loss of Audit Trail

+ Accounting issues at end of trading period.”

131. Ms Lyons reported to Ms Vennells in an email on 11 March 2013 (POL00097592) that

POL had two teams working on the Review.

132. The first team consisted of Ms Lyons, Ms Crichton, Mr Baker, Ms Van Den Bogerd, Ms
Renner and Mr Ismay, who were having regular meetings with Second Sight. Within this

team:

a. Ms Crichton was the “owner” and leader of the Second Sight Review within POL.

66
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

b. Mr Baker was a senior POL IT manager who reported directly to Ms Sewell: Baker
WS 415 (WITN04730100). He had worked on the Second Sight Review since its
earliest stages in 2012. His Second Sight-facing role included liaising with Second
Sight and co-ordinating their information, document, and data requests: Baker WS
417 (WITN04730100).

c. Ms Van Den Bogerd was a senior manager in Network. She helped obtain
information for Second Sight and says that she later became a “go to” person for

information for the Spot Reviews: Van Den Bogerd WS1 §66 (WITN09900100).

d. Mr Ismay, as Head of P&BA, led the teams which managed branch accounts and

dealt with SPMs’ queries and complaints.

133. The second team was called the Working Group. Its role was to consider the evidence
presented by Second Sight in the Spot Reviews and produce POL’s response. The
briefing note attached to Ms Lyons’ email to Ms Vennells on 11 March 2013
(POL00097589) stated that this team comprised representatives of P&BA, Network,

Legal, IT, Security, and Fujitsu (for data extraction and technical assistance).

134. The membership of the Working Group can be seen from Mr Baker’s email on 20
February 2013 at (POL00097507). It included Ms Crichton, Ms Van Den Bogerd, Ms
Lyons, Mr Posnett (POL security), Ms Bolsover (a senior debt recovery manager in
P&BA), and Mr Jenkins of Fujitsu. The group met regularly (see e.g. (POL00097550);
(POL00186580); (POL00099262)) and produced and reviewed POL’s draft responses
to the Spot Reviews see for example (POL00097612); (POL00097693);
(POL00097736); (POL00097938). (POL00186602) and (POL00098145) show that
POL’s responses to Spot Reviews could not be released to Second Sight until they had

been approved by Ms Crichton, Ms Lyons and Ms Van Den Bogerd.

135. Ms Vennells did not attend the Working Group meetings. She had no role in directing or
deciding what information POL would provide to Second Sight, and she was not involved
in or consulted about POL’s substantive responses to the Spot Reviews. These were
operational matters which required the specialist know-how of the teams which were
dealing with Second Sight. Mr Baker states in his witness statement (WITN04730100)
at §17 that Ms Vennells was part of a “Core Team”, together with Ms Perkins, Ms Lyons,

and Ms Van Den Bogerd, which met monthly to receive oral and written updates on the

67
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Second Sight Review. Ms Vennells does not recognise the term “Core Team”, or the
arrangements that Mr Baker describes. There is no evidence of the organisation of
monthly meetings involving the participants named by Mr Baker. The monthly written
briefings that Mr Baker claims to have prepared do not appear to be in the disclosure.
The evidence indicates that Ms Vennells received oral and written updates, mainly from
Ms Lyons and Ms Crichton, to report on the progress of the review and to prepare her for
meetings with stakeholders: see for example (POL00097589); (POL00098159);
(POL00186962); (POL00098789).

136. One matter on which Ms Vennells did need visibility was whether Second Sight or the
POL teams engaged in the project had identified problems with the Horizon IT system.
The information she received during the Review was that neither Second Sight nor POL

had identified any problems with the IT system:

a. On7 March 2013, Lord Arbuthnot wrote to Ms Perkins to notify her that he was to
host a meeting on 25 March 2013 at which Second Sight would make a presentation
to MPs and the JFSA (POL00097588). On the second page of the letter, Lord
Arbuthnot stated that:

"In my discussions with Ron and Ian, I gather that questions have been raised
over the absolute integrity of Horizon, though without their being so
fundamental as to say that the system is not fit for purpose. Since it is a system
that remains in current use, there is the risk that existing SubPostmasters and
mistresses may find themselves in exactly the same position as those whose
cases are being investigated. I know that definitive results are not yet available,
but I hope the Post office would be ready to address this issue.”

b. Ms Lyons emailed Ms Vennells a copy of this letter on 11 March 2013
(POL00097587) and she replied on the same day (POL00097592):

"Now to my biggest concern - we are taking big decisions on IT currently and
irrespective of the independence of the SS work, which it is critical to protect,
I/we should be aware asap if there are emerging issues with Horizon. Who from
IT is in the loop, do you know? And do you know if we have a view as to how
robust the SS findings are - ie., there may be similarities of accounts from Spmrs
- but are they being born out by analysis of what actually happened within the
system itself?”

68
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

c. At 17:07 on 19 March 2013, Ms Lyons reported to Ms Perkins (cc. Ms Vennells)
that she and Ms Crichton had held a meeting with Second Sight (POL00097704)
and the upshot was that: “... SS were surprised James now felt there was harder
evidence against the system. They used the phrases: no evidence of widespread
systemic failure; the number of cases we are seeing is small; the pattern aligns with
the themes which are already in the public domain.” At 17:30, Ms Crichton emailed
Ms Vennells about the same meeting (POL00097719). Ms Crichton said that
Second Sight had confirmed during the meeting that “there is no evidence of
widespread systemic failure of the Horizon system from the work that they have

already completed”.

d. A briefing for Ms Vennells to use on a call with Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013
(POL00098317) stated at paragraph 2.6 that the investigation had been running for

a year and to date no evidence of systemic failures had been found.

e. _ A briefing sent to Ms Perkins and Ms Vennells in advance of the Board call on 1
July 2013 (POL00098878) stated that POL understood that Second Sight had not

identified any systemic issues with the Horizon system.

The decision that Second Sight would produce an interim report

137.

138.

POL’s expectation when Second Sight were engaged was that the Review would be
complete by the summer of 2013: see the Chair’s update in the January 2013 Board
minutes at (POL00021510). However, in an email on 13 March 2013, Ms Lyons reported
to Ms Vennells that Second Sight did not expect to finish by the parliamentary summer
recess and that the costs of the exercise had risen significantly (POL00097600). Ms
Lyons suggested that POL could ask Lord Arbuthnot to help prevent further slippage and

budget overruns.

In a letter to Mr Bates on 16 April 2013 (page 21 of (POL00090358) Lord Arbuthnot
referred to a suggestion he had made to Second Sight that they should focus on the two
cases most likely to reveal systemic problems, and give the MPs the results, if only

preliminary, by the summer. Ms Vennells spoke to Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013 and

69
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

proposed that Second Sight should produce a report considering two or three cases before

the parliamentary recess, followed by a final report in October 2013.°°

139. POL’s note of the call on 23 May 2013 (POL00098377) records that Lord Arbuthnot did
not understand the confusion because there had been emails with Second Sight, who had
not indicated that they were not progressing the top two or three themes. In an email on
4 June 2013 (POL00095434), Lord Arbuthnot asked Second Sight to consider producing
an interim report before recess on 18 July 2013, as the MPs had been promised a report
by then. The interim report should concentrate on a few of the strongest complaints about
POL and consider whether there were any flaws in Horizon or in POL’s processes or
training. On 13 July 2013, Ms Walker informed Ms Lyons that Second Sight had agreed
to present an interim report to MPs at a meeting on 8 July 2013 (POL00098534).

140. Ms Vennells was asked on 23 May 2024 why the scope of what became the SSIR was
narrowed to a small number of cases. Her answer was to the effect that it was because of
the commitment made to MPs about the timescale in which they would be given a report:
23 May 2024 24:11-24:18 (INQ00001152). The documents show that this answer was
correct: in fact, Lord Arbuthnot had proposed a preliminary report dealing with two MP

cases by the summer of 2013 before the idea had occurred to POL.

> Tt was suggested to Ms Vennells during her oral evidence on 23 May 2024 that she wanted to persuade Lord
Arbuthnot “to wind their investigation up on the basis of two to three MP cases, answering the question ‘Have
system defects in Horizon resulted in the wrongful conviction of subpostmasters’”?: 23 May 2024: 44:10-44:16
(INQ00001152). The document that Ms Vennells was taken to in this part of her evidence (POL00098317) was
a briefing note in preparation for her call with Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013. This document proposed a
“preliminary report” on two to three MP cases by July 2013, and left open for discussion the appropriate way to
deal with the remainder of the MP cases. It therefore did not propose that the “preliminary report” would conclude
the investigations. Ms Vennells received a further briefing note for the call with Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013
(POL00115880; POL00115881). This contemplated that Second Sight would produce a preliminary report by
July 2013 and a final report by October 2013 dealing with those MP cases where there was sufficient evidence for
Second Sight to investigate. This referred to the fact that, as Lord Arbuthnot stated at a meeting on 22 July 2013,
there were a number of cases referred to Second Sight through the MPs “who had provided no evidence”: see
page 4 of the transcript of the meeting at (SSL0000108). These were proposals to achieve closure on the cases
which was something that both Lord Arbuthnot and POL wanted: see his email to Second Sight on4 June 2013 at
(POL00095434). In any event, the mechanism that was put in place to continue the investigation— the Mediation
Scheme — was open to all former SPMs and counter clerks who believed they had suffered a loss or been treated
unfairly as a result of Horizon.

70

SUBS0000071

The weeks before publication of the SSIR

141. As 8 July 2013 drew closer, POL still had little clarity from Second Sight as to what the
SSIR would say, and they appeared to be running out of time to produce a complete

report in time for POL to consider it and prepare its response:

a. Ms Lyons updated Ms Vennells on 21 June 2013 after a call with Second Sight
(POL00098655). Ms Lyons’ took from her conversation with Second Sight that:
“There are still risks with what the report will say. Not around the System but
around the wider issues eg training and support (which SS are counting as part of
the Horizon operating model).” Ms Lyons had put in place calls with Second Sight

every day from the following Tuesday until the report was finalised.

b. POL had known since around 4 June 2013 that the Rudkin case would be one of
the Spot Review cases featured in the SSIR (POL00029590). On 27 June 2013, Mr
Warmington told Ms Crichton that Second Sight were still trying to bottom this
case out and that it would “go to the wire” (POL00189210).

c. At 13:13 on 28 June 2013, Ms Lyons reported to Ms Vennells that some of Second
Sight’s case studies for the SSIR were still incomplete (POL00098789). Ms Lyons
emailed Ms Vennells again at 17:27 (POL00371707), following a meeting with
Second Sight, with an update on the status of the four Spot Reviews that Second
Sight intended to attach to the SSIR:

“*’..we pushed them hard to come off the fence and call things by the evidence
they have been given. I now think they will now call at least one case in our
favour, Rudkin and the comms failure. Although Rudkin is real our word against
his. The stamps case they are waiting for the spm to respond to them. I do not
think she will suddenly admit a mistake so my frustration here is they will not
resort to the evidence. The 4th case the scratch cards they have only just started
looking at.”

d. There was a related concern that Second Sight were not properly interrogating the
evidence that POL had supplied to them. This concern was articulated by Ms Lyons
in an email to Ms Perkins on 1 July 2013: “...they are only concluding a case if the
spmr accepts the Post office's evidence, they are not using the base forensic data to

come to their own verdict and putting that to the spmr. Because of this they could

71
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

be presenting cases on the 8th which are incomplete and saying they haven't got
enough evidence.” (POL00189722).

e. This concern was also mentioned in the briefing note sent to Ms Perkins (cc. Ms
Vennells) for the Board call on 1 July 2013 (POL00098878):

“They haven’t (yet) reviewed all the evidence we have given them, and hence
may not be in a position to set out definitive conclusion on all four cases.

It appears that they are not focussing on empirical evidence.....in the way we
would expect forensic accountants to — instead they have a tendency to rely on
the spms’ interpretation / recollection of events (and in some cases they appear
to have ‘led the witness’)”

142. While Ms Vennells was concerned with the lateness and incompleteness of the SSIR, her

143.

view was that POL should not be heavy-handed with Second Sight. Her opinion, as set
out in an email to Mr Edwards on 27 June 2013 (POL00098777), was that POL should
seek to persuade Lord Arbuthnot that the SSIR should not be published until Second
Sight had completed its work:

“We also need to be very careful not to overplay our hand with SS - they could
turn out to be quite dangerous if we threaten them with legal action or attempt
to replace them with another firm. Easy for this to be portrayed in the media as
heavy handed tactics because we don't like their findings (it plays directly into
the existing perceptions we're trying to counteract). So I think we're stuck with
the softer option of explaining to JA calmly but firmly why he cannot allow SS
to disseminate a misleading interim report - it either needs to be delayed or
repositioned as a very neutral status update (with more detail on the one case
that has been resolved)."

Ms Vennells reported to Ms Perkins in writing (it is probable that there were also
discussions between them) that this would be POL’s approach at 13:14 on 28 June 2013,
when she sent Ms Perkins an email from Ms Lyons setting out the steps that were being
taken to prepare for the publication of the SSIR (POL00371699). The steps Ms Lyons

set out included:

“We have a call with SS this afternoon and we will run through the individual
cases to see how far they will have got by next Tuesday’s briefing with [Lord
Arbuthnot] and the meeting date on the 9th, this will inform my conversation
with [Ms Walker] on Monday.

72
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

I am going to spend time with Janet at 0900 on Monday morning, she says she
can give me as long as it takes. My approach will be to try to get to understand
the status of the review and the risk to James and us of an incomplete interim
report. I will share the fact that SS are not using all the evidence they are being
given and our concern is that there [sic] approach to try and keep everyone happy
is not how we would expect a forensic accountant to behave.”

144. Ms Perkins supported the approach. She replied to Ms Vennells at 14:50
(POL00098797): “(Keep aiming high here! That is for the goal of no interim / no
meeting. But I recognise that this is not within our control.)” However, when Ms Lyons
spoke to Ms Walker on I July 2013, Ms Walker stated that she was sure that Lord
Arbuthnot would want the meeting on 8 July 2013 to go ahead: see Ms Lyons’ report of
the conversation to Ms Perkins at 2pm on I July 2013 (POL00189722).

145. A draft briefing note on the SSIR, dated 1 July 2013, records that Ms Crichton, Ms
Sewell, Ms Lyons, and Mr Baker would meet Second Sight that afternoon “when we aim
to get a clearer picture of the timing for delivery”: see paragraph 8 of (POL00029625).
Ms Vennells, having talked to Ms Crichton, emailed Ms Perkins about the outcome of
the meeting at 22:17 on I July 2013: (POL00098887):

“I caught up with Susan this evening after we finished. She had finished her
meeting with SS and was of the view that they do now understand the risk of
being caught up in something bigger and more sensitive. She is hoping their
report will be more balanced, should say they have found no evidence of
systemic Horizon (computer) issues but will confirm shortcomings in support
processes and systems. And that PO has already identified and corrected a
number of these. I hope when they speak to James tomorrow they will confirm
all this. They will also want to say their work is not finished and therefore still
not conclusive.”

146. The reference in this email to Second Sight being involved in something “bigger and
more sensitive” was most likely, in Ms Vennells’ view to be a reference to a point made
in several POL documents from this time, including in a draft letter from Ms Vennells to

Lord Arbuthnot following the publication of the SSIR (POL00029649):

“We also discussed the vital importance of drawing a clear distinction between (i)
systemic issues with the Horizon computer system — of which it is our understanding
that none have been found — and (ii) the wider support systems. Confusion about this
distinction could have a serious impact for the Post Office, sub-postmasters and our
customers. It is therefore essential that this distinction is clearly applied and followed
in the Second Sight report and all associated communications.”

73
147. Ms Vennells has explained this concern in her first witness statement at ]460:

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. POL wanted to ensure that media reporting of the Interim Report was as accurate and
proportionate as it could be. A major area of POL's concem with the Interim Report was
that Second Sight had defined "Horizon" to mean not only the software, but the
surrounding infrastructure and processes, including training and support. Second Sight's
view of their remit was not itself the concern: I agreed with them that training and support

fell within their terms of reference.

b. However, there was a real danger that public and network confidence in Horizon would
be undermined unfairly if stakeholder comments and media reports failed to capture the
distinction between Second Sight's findings about the software and their findings m other
aspects of what they defined in the Interim Report as the "system", such as training and

support.

(oM Relatedly, we wanted to ensure that public statements and media reports described
accurately what we understood to be the broad thrust of the Interim Report, namely, that
while Second Sight had identified no systemic faults in the Horizon IT system, therewould

be criticisms of POL's training and support for SPMs.

d. There are references in the documents from this time to POL's "reputation". To me, this
did not mean POL's reputation as a company or the reputation of anyone who worked for
it. Reputation in that sense was not my concern. My overriding concern was that the public
should not lose confidence that their local Post Office would be able to carry out their
transactions (many of which were very personal to them, such as pension payments)
honestly and accurately and they could trust the Post Office with their affars. If this
confidence was undermined by inaccurate or unfair reporting of the Interim Report, it

would be a huge disservice to the general public.

148. Many of POL’s internal communications during the period leading up to the publication

of the SSIR on 8 July 2013 were concerned with POL’s external communications about

the SSIR and its approach to Lord Arbuthnot rather than the substance of the issues tha t

the SSIR would address. However: (1) as at 1 July 2013, POL was still seeking to

establish from Second Sight what, broadly, the SSIR would say; and (2) in circumstances

where the SSIR would be presented to MPs a week later on 8 July 2013, it was sensible

and appropriate for POL to develop a communication plan.

The Board call on 1 July 2013

149. During a Board call at 17:15 on 1 July 2013, Ms Vennells gave the Board an update on

the Second Sight Review and the SSIR (POL00021515):

“a. The CEO apologised for the short notice in keeping the Board updated but
explained that issues had arisen over the last couple of days. She gave an update

74
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

on the Horizon review which was being undertaken by SS and their interim
report which was to be presented at a meeting for MPs on the 8th July. The
investigation to date had found no systemic issues with the Horizon computer
system but had highlighted areas for improvement in support areas such as
training.

b. The CEO explained that the Horizon, like any large computer system, would
occasionally have anomalies and two were know[n] of over recent years. The
Business has dealt with these anomalies to ensure no sub postmaster was out of
pocket and these anomalies had not affected any of the cases which Second Sight
had reviewed. Second Sight had been told of these anomalies and they would
include them in their report.

c. The CEO was concerned that the report from the independent forensic
accountants was not as factual as expected and could lead to loose language at
the MP meeting.”

150. Ms Vennells makes the following observations about the Board call:

a. Ms Vennells shared with the Board no more and no less than she herself knew
about the likely contents of the SSIR as of 1 July 2013. It was correct, based on
what Ms Vennells had been told (see paragraph 136 a) — e) above), that the
investigation to date had found no systemic issues. The phrase “to date” was an
accurate qualification, because no-one at POL knew at this stage whether Second
Sight would or would not make a finding in the SSIR that they had identified

systemic problems.

b. The SSIR was not on the agenda for the Board call. The reason for this was as

follows:

i. On the recommendation of Mr Edwards and Ms Lyons (POL00098321), Ms
Vennells’ CEO report for the May 2013 Board meeting on 21 May 2013 did
not include an update on the Second Sight Review, which Mr Edwards and
Ms Lyons felt would be premature. At that stage, Ms Vennells was due to
speak to Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013 to discuss the future conduct of the
Review. The Board asked at the meeting on 21 May 2013 for a note to update

on the position with the Second Sight Review.

75
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

ii. On 30 June 2013, Ms Perkins emailed Ms Vennells, Mr Edwards, Ms Lyons,
and Ms Crichton (POL00098816) stating: "I think we will have to tell the
Board about SS as there is a danger that we could be in a difficult situation
in the midst of all this before we have another opportunity to tell them. And
we do owe them an update". Ms Vennells replied (POL00098816) stating
that “we” (i.e. the individuals to whom Ms Perkins had sent her email) had
decided to do exactly that, and rather than send the Board a written brief at
this stage, it was thought better to wait to hear from Ms Lyons about her
meeting with Ms Walker on 1 July 2013. Ms Perkins did not disagree with
this approach.

Ms Vennells’ reaction to the SSIR

151. How Ms Vennells reacted to the SSIR was inevitably and properly influenced by what
she was told about the SSIR by the internal teams that had worked on the Second Sight

Review project.

152. Ms Vennells received two main forms of feedback on the SSIR. (POL00099096) is a
commentary on the SSIR which criticised some of Second Sight’s language, the
incompleteness of Second Sight’s conclusions, and their characterisation of POL’s
responses to the Spot Reviews as being too technical for SPMRs, (POL’s point being that
they were intended to be read by Second Sight as forensic accountants). However, the

more important feedback concerned the substance of the investigation.

153. A briefing note on the SSIR was sent to Ms Vennells on 3 July 2013 (POL00113369).
This was produced before Second Sight had begun to circulate drafts of the SSIR and

was therefore based on the work that POL had carried out during the review:

a. It stated at paragraph 4 that POL, with assistance from Fujitsu, had provided
Second Sight with branch files and transaction data, and had provided detailed

responses on specific issues.

b. Paragraph 16 stated that POL believed that Second Sight had not found evidence
of systemic problems with the Horizon IT system, either in the four cases that they
would profile in the SSIR, or in any of the other six cases which had been the

subject of Spot Reviews, or otherwise in its review.

76
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

c. The section on page seven under the heading “Post Office Activities” set out the
ways in which POL had supported Second Sight and responded to all ten Spot
Reviews produced by Second Sight. This included:

i. Each Spot Review had been thoroughly reviewed through the leadership of

senior management.

ii. Senior personnel within POL had been consulted on the issues raised by each

Spot Review.

iii. POL had liaised closely with Fujitsu to ensure that POL’s responses were

supported by its technical expertise.

iv. POL had collated and interrogated transaction records in those instances

where Second Sight had identified particular transactions for investigation.

d. The section on page 8 under the heading “Overview of Post Office’s responses”
stated that all ten Spot Reviews had been fully addressed by POL and that none of

them had revealed any error in Horizon.

e. Annex 2 to the briefing note set out POL’s responses to the four Spot Reviews that
the SSIR was expected to address. POL’s response to Mr Rudkin’s case is
discussed in the section of these submissions on BEDs and remote access. As
regards the other Spot Reviews, Annex 2 recorded that POL had investigated the
allegations by the SPMs using technical data and specialist IT knowledge and had

concluded that they were wrong.

154. Ms Vennells submits that she was entitled to rely on the professional opinion of the team
of specialists which had been tasked with addressing the Spot Reviews within the
structure of the Working Group. The four Spot Reviews raised technical and IT issues,

and she had no reason to question the accuracy or professionalism of their conclusions.

155. Ms Vennells discusses below the key aspects of her reaction to the SSIR
(POL00029650).

77
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Ms Vennells’ understanding of the phrase “no systemic issues”

156. Paragraph 8.2 (a) of the SSIR stated that one of Second Sight’s preliminary conclusions
was that “We have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with

the Horizon software.”

157. Second Sight were not required to include this conclusion in the SSIR. They chose to
include it, and a person reading the SSIR was entitled to assume that it represented
Second Sight’s full and professional opinion on that issue. Mr Henderson stated in his
live evidence that paragraph 8.2 (a) of the SSIR was based solely on Second Sight’s
review of the four Spot Reviews attached to the SSIR, one of which (Mr Rudkin’s case)
was incomplete: 18 June 2024 128:18-129:11 (INQ00001162).

158. However, this limitation was not mentioned in the SSIR, nor in any communication from
Second Sight to POL at the time. Indeed, the impression given by Section 2 of the SSIR
was that Second Sight had carried out considerable, though not yet completed, work on
the 47 cases that had been referred to them for investigation. In particular, paragraph 2.7
stated that:

“2.7. After examining all of the available documents and in some cases the
Horizon computer data relating to each case, Second Sight has been making
contact with each SPMR in order to obtain, through telephone calls and faceto-
face interviews, the SPMR’s version of events. Second Sight then summarised
the SPMR's assertions into one or more 'Spot Reviews’. To date, 29 Spot
Reviews have been created by Second Sight and other Spot Reviews are planned.
Ten Spot Reviews have been sent to POL and a formal response received.
Nineteen Spot Reviews are currently ‘work in progress.

159. Ms Vennells submits that a reasonable reader of the SSIR as a whole would not have
understood that the conclusion in paragraph 8.2 (a) was based solely on the four Spot
Reviews, as opposed to the totality of the investigatory work carried out by Second Sight
which they described in Section 2 of the SSIR. The limitation described by Mr Henderson
on the scope of the phrase “systemic issues’ was discussed with Ms Vennells on 23 May
2013. She stated that Second Sight had been working on the review for ten months and
had not examined just two or three cases: 23 May 2024: 34:14-34:25 (INQ00001152).

This was a reasonable viewpoint.

78
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

160. Furthermore, Ms Vennells’ written briefing (POL00113369) stated that POL understood
that Second Sight had not identified any systemic issues in the four Spot Reviews to be
attached to the SSIR, nor in the other six Spot Reviews sent to POL, nor otherwise during
its investigation. This document had been prepared by reference to the work of the POL
team, including senior IT managers, which had worked on the Second Sight review. As
she has stated in her written evidence, it was not a matter within Ms Vennells’
competence to determine whether an IT issue was systemic or otherwise: PV WS1 9418

(WITN01020100).

161. In short, Ms Vennells was told both by Second Sight and POL’s internal team of
specialists that no systemic issues had been found during the investigation. Ms Vennells
submits that she was entitled to rely on what she was told and that, based on what she
was told, it was not a limited or misleading description of one of the main conclusions of
the SSIR.

The measures announced by POL on publication of the SSIR

162. Ms Vennells sets out in paragraphs 459 to 492 PV WS1 (WITNO01020100), her
discussions with Lord Arbuthnot, Mr Bates, and internally at POL which led to the

announcement of three measures in response to the SSIR (POL00099129). These were:

a. The creation of a working party to complete the review of the cases brought
forward for investigation by MPs and the JFSA. The working group would examine
the themes identified by Second Sight in the Interim Report together with any new
themes that emerged from the individual cases. The JFSA had been invited to join

this working group.

b. A review, chaired by an independent figure, to determine how an independent
safety net might be introduced to adjudicate disputed cases in the future. Again, the

JFSA had been invited to participate in the process; and

c. A new Branch User Forum to enable SPMRs to provide feedback on training and

support processes to senior management on an ongoing basis.

163. The thinking behind each element was as follows:

79
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. The investigation to date had developed in a piecemeal fashion without any
structure, oversight, or clear lines of communication between the key stakeholders.
The working group was intended to fill these gaps by creating a formal structure
for the key stakeholders to collaborate and to give direction to the ongoing

investigation of the cases.

b. A review to consider creating a mechanism for resolving future disputes was an
idea proposed by the JFSA and agreed by POL.

c. The Branch User Forum created a formal structure for SPMRs to raise concerns

directly with POL management.

164. Ms Vennells submits that the proposed measures constituted a reasonable response to the

SSIR and the position as she understood it to be.

165. In his witness statement*!, Mr Kevin Gilliland refers to a number of documents which

show that Ms Vennells is not and was not indifferent or resistant to change:

a. (POL00099179) On 11 July 2013, Ms Vennells received an email and an attached
note from a Scottish SPM, David Woodrow, who said he had been suspended for
retaining £2,000 in lieu of a rates issue which was specific to Scotland, and which
was partly due to poor support for SPMs from POL. Ms Vennells forwarded the email
to Mr Gilliland and Ms Crichton (cc. Mr Davies and Mr Edwards) on 12 July 2013
and asked them to read the SPM’s email and the note. It is worth quoting Ms

Vennells’ reaction to the SPM’s complaint:

“To be very clear, I am not saying we should abandon disciplinary action. But his
note repeats some of what we hear in the SS review: an overbearing/impersonal
process, one that is not proportionate to the record or the case in hand, and one that
penalises the cashflow/costs of a small business less able to bear those in the short-
term. In a case like this, perhaps a formal written warning might have been better
as an initial stake in the ground, while we explored the issues — it would be more
understanding of Spmr colleagues situations, it would diffuse any angst on the part
of PO colleagues trying to understand the confusion, and certainly would be less
costly for us: the cost of public funds deployed [sic] this case already outweighs the
cost of the error/missing funds which if I have understood correctly are/will not be
missing.

51 (WITN10040100)
80
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

I would like an answer by this pm as to whether there is any good reason why we
cannot just clear this up now. This is a chance for us to move at pace, email Mr
Woodrow and the MPs and show that the new PO has common sense and can act
quickly but not ignore the risks to the business.”

b. The email chain at (POL00145419) shows that Ms Vennells spoke to Mr Woodrow
by telephone on 12 July 2013 and arranged for him to speak to Ms Crichton and Mr
Gilliland. Mr Gilliland states in his witness statement (WITN10040100) at 133 that
Mr Woodrow’s case led to an increase in the financial threshold for suspensions, and
increased oversight and involvement by more senior managers in suspension

decisions.

c. At §§134-138 of his witness statement, Mr Gilliland discusses the Branch Support
Programme, which was established in in July 2013 with terms of reference to
“understand the current business processes, operational procedures and ways of
working which are in place to support branches, identify the gaps and produce
recommendations to rectify the issues” (POL00089711). The Branch Support
Programme was renamed the Business Improvement Programme in 2014 and given
an expanded mandate “to ensure that the required cultural change was to be
embedded within the business as usual with the Post Office.” (POL00148920).

d. The scope of the work of the Business Improvement Programme can be seen from
the programme update paper dated 25 June 2014 at (POL00407939). This included:
(a) reforms to disciplinary procedures; (b) new training systems; (c) the Branch
Support Team had begun proactively to call branches which called the NBSC helpline
most often to understand what extra support could be offered and whether changes
needed to be made to training; (d) calls to the NBSC had been reviewed to identify
the areas which accounted for the most calls and a root cause analysis would be
conducted; and (e) changes to Horizon transaction procedures. The programme had
obtained c. £8.6 million in funding to invest in areas including SPM recruitment,

training, and IT.

The protection of POL’s reputation

166. Ms Vennells submits that the protection of a company’s reputation is a legitimate

objective of a CEO. It is clear from the documents that Ms Vennells saw no conflict

81
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

between the protection of POL’s reputation and positive engagement with the SSIR. As

she informed the Board in an email on 4 July 2013 (POL00099016):

"To summarise very briefly, we have taken the view that the best way to
minimise the reputational risks associated with the review and to do the right
thing for the business and the people is to welcome the broad thrust of the report
and commit to acting on its key findings in relation to the need for improvements
in our support and training processes. This is entirely consistent with the broader
imperative for cultural change across the organisation which the Board has
discussed in recent months."

167. Accordingly, Ms Vennells saw the implementation of the SSIR’s recommendations on
support and training as the primary means of preserving POL’s reputation. In
circumstances where Ms Vennells was being told that the Horizon IT system was reliable,
but there were areas for improvement in training, support, and culture, it is
understandable why she took the approach that she did - to emphasise POL’s confidence
in the IT system while accepting that it should proactively identify and improve culture,

training, and support.

Royal Mail Prospectus

168. During her oral evidence on 24 May 2024, Ms Vennells was asked about her role in 2013
in seeking the removal of a section on Horizon and the SSIR from the IT risks section of
the Royal Mail share prospectus. Ms Vennells’ evidence was that there were two reasons
to ask for this section to be removed. First, POL and Royal Mail were now separate
businesses and the prospectus was about Royal Mail. Second, there was “the challenge
of managing potential misinterpretation in the media of facts that were not always

necessarily understood”: 24 May 2024 33:4-33:17 (INQ00001153).
169. The documents show that these were indeed Ms Vennells’ concerns:

a. On 20 September 2013, Ms Vennells emailed Jon Millidge, the company secretary
of Royal Mail (POL00146462) and set out the then current draft of the prospectus
language referring to Horizon: “In July 2013, an interim report was published into
alleged problems with POL’s “Horizon” computer system, which is used to record
transactions in its branch network. The report confirms that no system wide

problems had been found in relation to the “Horizon” software, but suggests that

82
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

POL should examine its training and support processes for sub-postmasters.” Ms
Vennells then stated:

“Our challenge is that this is not a risk to RM and is particularly misleading in
the IT risks section. As your para states, the findings of the interim report related
to Spmr training and support not IT faults. Can you get this para removed?...So
sorry to bother you with this. And I recognise that the para makes it clear that
there isn’t an IT fault. But its presence in an IT risk section potentially opens up
a sensitive and politically high profile situation.”

b. — Mr Millidge replied on the same day stating that he thought the risk only repeated
the contents of a press release, i.e. POL’s press release when it published the SSIR.
Ms Vennells replied that, while that was correct it was “just odd therefore that it

features in an IT risk section” (POL00146462).

c. When Mr Millidge suggested that it could be mentioned under a section on
contracts, Ms Vennells stated that it was not a Royal Mail “contract risk” either and

reiterated that it should be removed altogether (POL00146462).

170. There are two clear messages in Ms Vennells’ emails. The first was that Horizon and the
SSIR was not a Royal Mail risk at all. That was also the view of Mr Edwards, who was
also involved in seeking changes to the prospectus: 26 July 2024 134:9-135:12
(INQ00001182). Second, as Ms Vennells has stated in her first witness statement at §460,
she was concerned that public and network confidence in Horizon would be undermined
if media reports and public statements failed to distinguish between Second Sight’s
findings about the Horizon software and their findings about training and support. It is
clear that she was concerned that the inclusion of the SSIR as an “IT risk” did not

accurately reflect the findings of the SSIR.

BEDs and remote access issues during the Second Sight review (2012-2013)

171. There were two significant developments in relation to BEDs and remote access in 2013:

a. Ms Vennells became aware for the first time of two bugs in HNGX (the Receipts
and Payments Mismatch bug and the Suspense bug) and the Callendar
Square/Falkirk bug in Legacy Horizon.

83
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

b. Second Sight and POL considered the case of Michael Rudkin, which raised issues

of remote access.

Bugs in HNGX and Legacy Horizon

172. Ms Vennells believes that she became aware of the Receipts and Payments Mismatch
bug (which impacted 62 branches in 2010) and the Suspense Account bug (which
impacted 14 branches in 2012 and 2013) between 9 and 16 May 2013. This is supported

by the evidence.

173. The Local Suspense bug was diagnosed by Fujitsu in February 2013. The first person
who was liaising with Ms Vennells about the Second Sight review to be told about the
bug appears to have been Mr Baker, who was sent two summaries of the bug by Mr Winn
on 9 May 2013 (POL00098186); (POL00098185). Mr Baker (who was not involved
when the bug was detected in 2010) knew about the Receipts and Payments Mismatch
bug shortly before 16 May 2013, when Mr Jenkins emailed him a note about the bug in
advance of "tomorrow's meeting with Lesley" (POL00098283).

174. On the same day, Ms Lyons prepared a speaking note for Ms Vennells to talk to Ms
Perkins about the discovery of bugs in Horizon (POL00029587). While Ms Vennells
cannot recall precisely when or how she was told about the bugs in HNGX, this sequence
of events makes it highly likely that she was told about them at some point between 9

May and 16 May 2013.

175. Ms Vennells addresses the key themes relating to the bugs below.

Communication of the bugs to Second Sight

176. Itis clear, contrary to suggestions made during the Inquiry, that POL did not conceal the
bugs from Second Sight. The evidence shows that it was Mr Baker of POL, and not Mr
Jenkins of Fujitsu, who first informed Second Sight that two bugs had been detected in
HNGX:

a. On 19 June 2013, Mr Warmington of Second Sight emailed Mr Baker with the
subject “Defects in Horizon” (POL00178034).

“Simon: you mentioned to me, about three weeks ago, two system defects or
bugs. You said they had affected about 64 SPMRs as I recall. One had led to

84
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a£9,000 or so shortfall that had to be investigated by Andy Winn and, as I
understand you to say, that amount had been written off and then later discovered
to have been caused by the defect/bug.

Now here’s the point: Ian and I agree that those two defects need to be
mentioned in the Interim Report. POL is going to have to disclose them.

What we will need therefore is a short, clear, report on what happened. We will
need to cover the matter in the Interim Report and the July 8" meeting.”

The first line of Mr Warmington’s email dates the initial conversation with Mr
Baker about the bugs to late May or early June 2013 — only about three weeks after
Mr Baker became aware of the Local Suspense Bug on 9 May 2013. The obvious
inference from the email is that Mr Warmington was told about the bugs for the

first time during this conversation.

On 21 June 2013, Mr Baker emailed Mr Warmington and Mr Henderson (cc. Ms
Sewell, Ms Lyons and Ms Crichton) attaching (a) a zip file with documents relating
to the Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug; and (b) a note by Mr Jenkins on the
Local Suspense bug (POL00130321).

Mr Henderson’s oral evidence on 18 June 2024 107:22-108:13 (INQ00001162)
was that the information about the bugs in the SSIR was disclosed by Mr Baker
and that Second Sight were previously unaware of the bugs:

A. Ido recall that, shortly before we published our Interim Report, Simon Baker,

again on behalf of Post Office, did disclose some late information to us that--of
certainly two, if not three, types of bug that were previously unaware of.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Was that disclosure by Mr Baker done orally or did he
send you a document setting it out, so to speak?

A. He sent us -- I mean, it was both. We had a lot of telephone contact with him
but he also disclosed those documents to us and we referred to them in our report.

It is also Mr Baker’s evidence that he informed Second Sight about the bugs: see

paragraph 86 of his witness statement.

In addition to the two bugs in HNGX, POL informed Second Sight about the
Falkirk bug in Legacy Horizon. The email chain between Second Sight and Simon

85
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Baker at (POL00144918) indicates that Mr Baker informed Second Sight about
the bug on or around 28 June 2013. The email in the chain from Ron Warmington
to Mr Baker at 17:26 on 28 June 2013 shows that Second Sight had been given a

copy of one of Mr Jenkins’ witness statements from the Misra criminal case.

177. The statements by POL managers to Ms Vennells that POL had disclosed the bugs to
Second Sight, as set out in Ms Vennells’ statement (at PV WS1 §373) (WITN01020100)

were not, therefore, chicanery. They were correct.

Communication of the bugs to Lord Arbuthnot and Ms Lyons’ email dated 23 May
2013

178. Ms Vennells decided to discuss the bugs with Lord Arbuthnot in person. As she explains
in PV WS1 4390 (WITN01020100), she felt that if the bugs were not explained clearly,
there was a risk that people might draw conclusions about their significance for the
reliability of the system which she and POL did not consider justified. She raised the
bugs with him for the first time on 3 July 2013, at their first face-to-face meeting after

Ms Vennells became aware of them in mid-May.

179. Ms Vennells was scheduled to speak to Lord Arbuthnot in a call on 23 May 2013 and
was sent briefing notes on 20 and 22 May 2013. On the day of the call, Ms Lyons
emailed Ms Vennells (cc. Ms Crichton, Mr, and Mr Davies) (POL00105632) stating:

“Paula the only things that is not in the brief for James is our move away from
‘there are no bugs in Horizon' to 'there are known bugs in every computer system
this size by they are found and put right and no subpostmaster is disadvantaged
by them' it would be good to be able to go on and say 'or has been wrongly
suspended or prosecuted’.

I do not think that is a phone call conversation but needs to be aired at some time
with James, I would suggest at your meeting.”

180. Ms Vennells makes the following points in relation to the email:

a. The final sentence of the email (“I do not think that is a phone call...”) makes clear

Ms Lyons was not suggesting that Ms Vennells should raise the bugs with Lord

* PV WS1 (WITN01020100) 4381-383.
86
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Arbuthnot on the call on 23 May 2013. Ms Lyons anticipated that Ms Vennells

would discuss the bugs with Lord Arbuthnot at a meeting.

b. Ms Vennells did not believe that the move away from “there are no bugs in
Horizon” was an attempt to pre-empt findings about the bugs in the SSIR: 23 May
2024 100:4-100:18 (INQ00001152).

c. Ms Vennells has no recollection of what Ms Lyons characterised as a “move away

from ‘there are no bugs in Horizon’” being discussed as a line to take in
communications, but simply as recognition of the reality that bugs had now been
found in the system and that any statements to the contrary should be corrected: 23

May 2024 101:1-101:15 (INQ00001152).

Communication of the bugs to Ms Perkins and the Board

181.

182.

There should also be no suggestion that Ms Vennells attempted to conceal or delay in

revealing the bugs to Ms Perkins and the Board.

Ms Perkins appeared to assent when it was put to her by CTI that she was not informed
about the bugs until around 3 July 2013: 6 June 2024 103:11-105:5 (INQ00001157).
However, the email chain at (POL00098797) shows that Ms Perkins was already familiar
with the bugs by 28 June 2013:

a. In the first email in the chain, at 13:12 on 28 June 2013, Alwen Lyons emailed Ms
Vennells a bullet point list of next steps on the Horizon issues. The first bullet point
was that Mr Ismay and Ms Sewell were working “on the details of the two bugs, to
understand them and then get them into language that was clear and could be

communicated”.

b. Ms Vennells forwarded Ms Lyons’ email to Ms Perkins at 13:14: “You will see

below Alwen’s proposed next steps. It covers all the ground at present.”

c. Ms Perkins replied to Ms Vennells at 14:50: “Thanks for the updates. I am glad we
have the best people on this.” Ms Perkins’ reference to the “best people” clearly
refers to the individuals identified in Ms Lyons’ email who were working on the

next steps.

87
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

183. Clearly, Ms Perkins did not learn about the bugs for the first time by reading Ms Lyons’
email. The obvious inference from the fact that Ms Vennells forwarded Mr Lyons’
message to Ms Perkins without any explanation of “the bugs” is that no explanation was
needed because Ms Perkins already knew about them. Similarly, Ms Perkins’ reply to
Ms Vennells contains no surprise or alarm at the mention of “the bugs” and she does not
ask for information about them. The email chain suggests that Ms Perkins had been given

details about the bugs prior to 28 June 2013.°°

184. Itis plausible that Ms Perkins was informed about the bugs on 16 May 2013. On 16 May
2013 at 7:48, Ms Vennells emailed Ms Perkins that "one other issue arose overnight,
which I may need to brief you on over the next couple of days, so will try to get a phone
slot" (POL00098278). Ms Perkins replied at 8:17 that she was unexpectedly free that
afternoon. At 13:05, Ms Lyons emailed herself the text of a speaking note for Ms
Vennells to use “for your call with Alice this afternoon” which referred to instances
“coming to light where there is evidence that there are bugs in Horizon” (POL00029587).
In PV WS1 §360 (WITN01020100), Ms Vennells mistakenly described (POL00029587)
as an email to her from Ms Lyons, and there is no evidence that the note was sent to Ms
Vennells in electronic form. However, the evidence of preparations to tell Ms Perkins
about the bugs makes 16 May 2013 a plausible date on which Ms Perkins was informed

of their existence.

185. Ms Vennells informed the Board about the two bugs in HNGX during a Board call on 1
July 2013. The minutes (POL00021515) record that Ms Vennells stated as follows as
part of an update about the SSIR:

“The CEO explained that the Horizon, like any large computer system, would
occasionally have anomalies and two were know[n] of over recent years. The
Business has dealt with these anomalies to ensure no sub postmaster was out of
pocket and these anomalies had not affected any of the cases which Second Sight
had reviewed. Second Sight had been told of these anomalies and they would
include them in their report.”

186. The timing of the update to the Board is addressed in the section on the SSIR. It has been

noted that Ms Vennells’ update mentioned only two anomalies in the update. The reason

53 Ms Lyons stated that there was a conversation with Ms Perkins about the bugs “before the [SSIR]” but she
could not remember the date: 21 May 2024 78:18-78:22 (INQ00001150).

88
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

for this is that Ms Vennells had not been told about the Falkirk bug prior to the Board

call:

a. At 15:58 on 1 July 2013, Mr Edwards emailed a speaking note for the Board to Ms
Perkins, (cc. Ms Vennells, Ms Lyons, Ms Crichton and others) (POL00189739).
The speaking note (POL00098878) mentioned that POL had disclosed two

anomalies in Horizon to Second Sight.

b. At 19:48 on 1 July 2013, Mr Williams emailed Ms Lyons and Ms Crichton a draft
of a briefing note for Ms Vennells on the SSIR: Covering email at (POL00029626);
briefing note at (POL00029625). The briefing note contained a section on the
“Falkirk Anomaly”, which “was resolved in March 2006 and is therefore a different

anomaly to either the 14 Branch or the 62 Branch Anomaly.”

c. Ms Lyons replied at 20:07, stating “this is the first I’ve heard that Falkirk is
different to the 64 we had assumed it was the same so do we have 3 anomalies.

That’s not good we have told the Board and Janet 2 we knew of!” (POL00029626).

d. The briefing for the Board call had therefore been prepared on the erroneous basis
that the Callender Square/Falkirk bug and the Receipts and Payments Mismatch

bug were one and the same bug. Ms Lyons only realised this after the Board call.

187. There is no evidence that Ms Lyons took any active steps to correct the Board’s, Ms
Perkins’ and Ms Vennells’ understanding that only two bugs had been detected in
Horizon. The first document that was sent to Ms Vennells or Ms Perkins which referred
to the Falkirk bug was the briefing note on the SSIR (POL00113369). This document
was emailed to Ms Vennells and Ms Perkins by Mr Edwards at around 2 a.m. on 3 July
2013 in advance of their meeting with Lord Arbuthnot at 9 am at Portcullis House
(POL00115923). Mr Edwards also attached to the email a speaking note for the meeting
(POL00115924). Ms Vennells does not remember whether she noticed that while the
speaking note referred to two bugs, the briefing note identified three. She also does not

recall whether she mentioned the Falkirk bug to Lord Arbuthnot during the meeting.**

“PV WS1 4433 (WITN01020100)
89
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

188. If she did not mention the Falkirk bug, it was not deliberate.** It would have been futile
to attempt to conceal the bug. It had been known to Second Sight since June 2013, and it
was mentioned, though not by name, in paragraph 6.10 of the SSIR (POL00029650).

Use of the terms “exceptions” and anomalies”

189. Ms Vennells accepts that it was a mistake by POL and by Ms Vennells personally to have
called bugs “exceptions” or “anomalies”. They were bugs and should have been referred

to as such.

190. Ms Vennells explained that she and others at POL were trying to find a non or less
emotive word than “bug” to describe what she understood at the time to be two rare
occurrences with limited impact and which she believed had been resolved without any
loss to the affected SPMs. Ms Vennells accepts that this was a mistake: 23 May 2024
192:19-196:10 (INQ00001152).

Ms Vennells’ understanding of the bugs

191. Ms Vennells was not an IT specialist and relied on POL’s IT specialists for information
about the bugs and their implications for the reliability of the system. Two IT specialists
reported to Ms Vennells at the relevant time: Ms Sewell and Mr Baker. It is important to
identify what Ms Sewell and Mr Baker thought and said about the bugs at the relevant

time:

a. Ms Sewell stated in her witness statement that the first software fault she was aware
of was the Receipts and Payments Mismatch bug. She also had a clear recollection
of the Local Suspense bug, which she became aware of in June 2013: Sewell WS
{17 (WITN00840100); 16 May 2024 66:7-66:10 (INQ00001148). These appear
to have been the only bugs or defects in HNGX which, to Ms Sewell’s knowledge,
had impacted branch accounts. Paragraph 86 of Mr Baker’s witness statement

indicates that the only bugs he was aware of were the three mentioned in the SSIR.

b. Ms Sewell stated that her view as an IT professional is that “there are faults in any
computer systems and its important how you deal with them.” 16 May 2024 71:9-
71:13 (INQ00001148). While Ms Sewell acknowledged in her oral evidence that

55 PV WS1 4434 (WITN01020100)
90
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

“it wasn’t good” that the Local Suspense bug was diagnosed as a system defect a
year after a SPM had first reported a discrepancy to POL, she said her main concern
at the time “would have been to ensure that the branch was not disadvantaged,

which they weren’t.” 16 May 2024: 66:13-66:19 (INQ00001148).

Similarly, Mr Baker’s evidence is that he did not understand why Second Sight
viewed the BEDs detailed in the SSIR as a problem, given that they were contained
to a small number of branches and had been resolved: WS 986 (WITN04730100).
Writing to Mr Warmington about the Local Suspense bug on 21 June 2013
(POL00130321), Mr Baker said:

“To me the important point is that the incidents were detected, resolved, and we
communicated the problem to sub postmasters. The other reassuring thing to me
is that before we understood there was a defect, our support people took the view
to write off the losses (in the cases where there were losses) as they didn’t have
any concrete evidence that the branch had done anything wrong.”

In paragraph 73 of his witness statement, Mr Baker said that in early 2013, he
believed it was unlikely that the IT defects in Horizon were severe or widespread
enough to account for the cash shortfalls in the branches and that, since he was then
managing the POL test team, he had confidence in the thoroughness of POL’s
testing process. He does not suggest in his witness statement that his work on the

Second Sight review caused him to change this opinion.

On 28 June and 2 July 2013, Ms Sewell sent Ms Vennells updates on the steps POL
and Fujitsu had taken to address the Local Suspense bug (POL00190016). These
included: (a) Fujitsu had interrogated Local Suspense data and had found only 14
cases of the bug; (b) a system change was planned for 8 October to monitor local
accounts for data which should have been deleted; and (c) letters to the affected

SPMs were under review by POL legal and P&BA.

Ms Sewell’s updates gave the impression that the Local Suspense bug had been

identified without difficulty through POL’s standard procedures:

The timeline for the bug in Ms Sewell’s 28 June 2013 update was that the
issue was first raised to the NBSC on 25 February 2013, diagnosed by Fujitsu

91
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

on 28 February 2013, and that Fujitsu provided details of the affected
accounts on 25 March 2013.

Ms Sewell’s 2 July 2013 update stated that: “A problem was identified by
P&BA earlier this year due to aged items in the Local Suspense, this was
further supported by the two large amounts detailed below that had been
raised by the SPMR. At this point P&BA raised through their usual process

to Fujitsu as detailed below for investigation”.

A number of other documents to which Ms Sewell contributed asserted that both
bugs had been identified by POL or the Horizon system and that the existence of

the bugs should not undermine confidence in the system. For example:

Ms Sewell accepted that when she provided comments on a draft POL press
statement about the bugs (POL00189881) she did not correct an assertion in
the draft that they “were picked up by the Horizon system”: 16 May 2024
80:14-82:23 (INQ00001148).

(POL00029652) is an email by Ruth Barker containing the text of a Q&A
about the bugs. Ms Barker stated that she had run the Q&A past Ms Sewell,

who was happy with it. The Q&A contained the following statements:

i. That, “with a system the scale of Horizon, processing over 6 million
transactions a day, it is not material that these anomalies have occurred.
What is important is that we have systems in place to identify and rectify
them and have ensured that these instances were communicated to the
subpostmasters involved. We have been fully transparent in informing
the sub postmasters involved and in volunteering this information to be

part of the independent review.”

ii. That “both of these anomalies were found by [POL] and voluntarily
communicated to [Second Sight]. Modifications were made to rectify
these issues and all sub postmasters involved have been informed of
this...none of the subpostmasters involved have been prosecuted, nor did

this lead to any financial disadvantage for them.”

92
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

iii. As regards the delay in diagnosing the Local Suspense bug “The
important thing is that the 14 transactions involved in this anomaly were
identified and rectified and that the subpostmasters involved were
informed. We have been fully transparent in informing the
subpostmasters and in volunteering this information to be part of the

review.”

iii. Ms Sewell contributed to the briefing note on the SSIR which was emailed
to Ms Vennells and Ms Perkins on 3 July 2013 (POL00113369).°° This was
the first document sent to Ms Vennells, or Ms Perkins, in which POL
acknowledged that that it had taken a year to diagnose the Local Suspense
problem after its first occurrence in 2012: see paragraph 20 (i). However, this
was presented as a delay in diagnosing the root cause of a problem that POL
was aware of from 2012. It gave no impression that POL had failed to
escalate the problem to Fujitsu when its symptoms were reported by SPMs
in January 2012, or that POL did nothing to investigate the root cause of the

symptoms until the bug reoccurred in January 2013.

iv. The briefing note went on to state that the two bugs in HNGX “were found
by [POL] and voluntarily communicated to SS” and set out the following

headline messages about them:

“a. We found the anomalies and, so as to be completely open, told SS (i.e. SS
didn’t find them).

b. The anomalies were detected, resolved, and we communicated the problem to
sub postmasters.

c. No [POL] prosecutions relate to these bugs.
d. say we have addressed the problem (but acknowledge it has taken time).”

v. Similarly, Ms Vennells’ and Ms Perkins’ speaking note for the meeting with
Lord Arbuthnot on 3 July 2013 (POL00115924) stated that the “key point to

note is that in both cases our processes picked up these issues, appropriate

SUBS0000071

remedial action has been taken and they did not lead to any disciplinary

proceedings against the affected spmrs.”

192. Ms Vennells said that she relied on and was reassured by what she was told about the
bugs.*’ She submits that she relied, explicitly or implicitly, on the POL IT team, through
the interface of Mr Baker and Ms Sewell, in four main respects: (1) to obtain and inform
her of facts in relation to the bugs; (2) to provide their opinion on the significance of the
bugs to the reliability of the Horizon system; (3) to inform her of any other bugs or defects
of which they were aware which had impacted SPMs; and (4) to inform her if, in their
opinion, POL should carry out further investigations into whether there were or could be

other problems.
193. As to these four issues:

a. Ms Vennells was told that the bugs were detected by POL processes, that the
underlying technical problems were diagnosed and fixed, that POL had been
transparent with the affected SPMs, and that no SPM had been left out of pocket.

b. Ms Vennells was told by POL’s IT function that the bugs were normal occurrences
in a system the size of Horizon and did not indicate other or wider problems. What

was important was how POL had dealt with the bugs.

c. The messaging given to Ms Vennells was obviously premised on the two bugs
being the only bugs in HNGX which had impacted SPMs of which POL IT was

aware.
d. POLIT did not recommend a further investigation of possible defects in the system.

194. There is nothing to suggest that Mr Baker or Ms Sewell (who gave oral evidence)
deliberately withheld information from Ms Vennells or gave her anything other than their
honest opinions about the bugs. Furthermore, there is a reason why Ms Vennells did not
commission an investigation of the system in July 2013. Ms Perkins and Ms Vennells
were given the same briefing on the SSIR and the same speaking note for the meeting

with Lord Arburthnot on 3 July 2013 (POL00115924); (POL00113369). When Ms

94
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Perkins was asked whether it was a logical question for POL to ask whether there were

other discovered bugs, she answered:

“T think the impression that we were being given by the executives was that they
had, in fact -- that their processes had -- well, it says this here -- their processes
had identified these cases, in other words, these were things that had been found
within the Post Office system and, therefore, that was of -- it was of comfort that
those had been found -- that we were being told that those had been found by the
Post Office.” 5 June 2024: 107:16-107:23 (INQ00001156).

195. At the time, the bugs were presented to Ms Vennells and to Ms Perkins not as reasons to

be concemed about the system, but as reasons to be reassured.
Michael Rudkin and remote access

196. One of the 4 “spot reviews” attached to the SSIR concerned the case of Michael Rudkin.
Mr Rudkin gave Second Sight an account of his visit on 19 August 2008 to Fujitsu’s
facility in Bracknell. According to Mr Rudkin, he was shown into a basement room
containing Horizon terminals identical to those used in every branch in the POL network.
He met an individual in the basement “who demonstrated an ability to pass transactions
directly into the Horizon system and in so doing to alter, in real time or overnight, the
record holdings of Foreign Currency in POL Branch Offices”. Mr Rudkin also stated that
this person, after altering a branch’s cash balance remotely, had made light of it, saying:

“T’d better reverse that entry now or he’ll have a cash shortage tonight”.

197. POL’s position on Mr Rudkin’s case as of 3 July 2013 was explained in the briefing on
the SSIR which Ms Vennells received that day (POL00113369). In summary:

a. Fujitsu had been unable to verify that Mr Rudkin had visited its Bracknell facility
on 19 August 2008. Fujitsu had attempted to retrieve the visitor logs to the
Bracknell facility for 19 August 2008 but had found that these records had not been
retained. Fujitsu had also interrogated emails, documents, and archived information

but had been unable to establish Mr Rudkin’s visit.

b. _ Ithad been determined that, in August 2008, the basement of the Bracknell facility
contained a test environment that was not physically or technologically connected
to the live environment. It was therefore impossible for anyone in the basement to

adjust live transaction records.

95
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

198. The matter developed further between 3 July 2013 and the publication of the SSIR on 8
July 2013:

a. On 1 July 2013, Second Sight informed POL that Mr Rudkin had found an email
dated 1 August 2008 from Martin Rolfe (a POL test analyst) which confirmed that
Mr Rudkin was to visit the Bracknell facility that day (POL00060580).**

b. POL contacted Mr Rolfe. He confirmed that that the basement of the Bracknell
facility was a secure test environment where transaction methods were developed
and tested. The terminals that Mr Rudkin may have seen were used for test purposes
only and had never been connected to any live transaction data or used to alter
branch data remotely. Mr Rolfe also denied that he would even have pretended to
change branch data, assuming that he was the person who had shown Mr Rudkin
the test room. His explanations were set out in a draft witness statement, which was
sent to Second Sight by Mr Baker on 1 August 2013 (POL00216036) and again on
6 August 2013 after the correction of a typo (POL00193230). It is likely that the
version sent to Second Sight on 6 August 2013 was the version in disclosure at
(POL00060625), (POL00110541) and (WBON0000920), since this version does
not contain the “double negative” typo referred to in Mr Baker’s email dated 6
August 2013 (POL00193230).

c. POL received the final and signed version of the SSIR on 7 July 2013
(POL00099101). The concluding paragraph of Spot Review 4 on the Rudkin case
concluded that Second Sight was left with a conflict of evidence “and our enquiries
are continuing, particularly in the light of the new information confirming that the

meeting on 19th August 2008 did in fact occur”.

d. At 20:47 on 7 July 2013, Ms Sewell emailed her comments on the SSIR to Ms
Vennells and others (POL00099088):

“Rudkin: we and Fujitsu have provided evidence to SS that there was only
Testing systems in the basement in 2008. The equipment (hardware) and the
testing system were located in the basement. This has been a constant challenge
with SS as they contest that Rudkin has signed an affidavit and therefore there
is a conflict of evidence. There appears to be a lack of willingness to accept the
detail we have provided. We have also had the tester who Rudkin believes took

58 The email from Mr Rolfe is at (POL00021699).

96
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

him to the basement complete a witness statement. He has confirmed that there
was only a testing system in the basement. This has been a constant challenge
with SS and I’m not sure how this will get resolved.”

199. Accordingly, the message that was communicated to Ms Vennells in the documents was
that Mr Rudkin’s allegations had been investigated, and that POL was satisfied that they

had no substance.

200. However, the evidence of Mr Warmington of Second Sight and Mr Baker raises an issue
of whether Ms Vennells was given any further information that is not recorded in the

documents. As set out below, the evidence is that she was not.

201. Mr Henderson says in his witness statement that, in September 2012, he visited Fujitsu’s
facility in Bracknell and met Gareth Jenkins. Mr Jenkins told him that Fujitsu “routinely
used remote access branch terminals for various purposes”, including collecting log files,
and that members of his team could generate keystrokes that were indistinguishable from
a SPM accessing a terminal directly: Henderson WS §{43-44 (WITN00420100). Mr
Henderson says that he shared the information he had received from Mr Jenkins with Ms
Lyons and Ms Sewell, who told him very firmly that he was mistaken: Henderson WS
946 (WITN00420100).

202. However:

a. In paragraph 2.2 of his witness statement for the Group Litigation (FUJ00160042),
Mr Henderson gave a different and less detailed account of the meeting with Mr

Jenkins in September 2012:

“At the meeting on 13 September 2012, one of the matters discussed in the
meeting was remote access to terminal located in branches. Gareth Jenkins
confirmed to me that this capability existed and was occasionally used to
troubleshoot problems in the branch.”

b. In his oral evidence, Mr Henderson added the detail not found in either his witness
statement for the Group Litigation or his witness statement for the Inquiry, that Mr
Jenkins also told him that remote access took place out of hours and that Mr Jenkins
would often ask SPMs to leave their terminals switched on overnight to facilitate
remote access: 18 June 2024 70:5-70:12 (INQ00001162).

97
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

c. At the Inquiry, Mr Henderson was asked whether his witness statement for the
Horizon Issues Trial, which talked about the “occasional use” of remote access, or
his Inquiry witness statement, which talked about “routine use” was more likely to

be accurate.
d. Mr Henderson’s answer was that:

“T think you need to drill into the detail because, on reflection, I realised that
Gareth Jenkins was talking about a number of different things. At one level, he
was talking about direct access to physical sort of terminals, using things like
remote desktop protocol, where he was troubleshooting, it might be hardware
failures, connecting to a terminal in a subpostmaster's branch. But I'm also now
aware that remote access also extended to include back-end databases, and so
on. At the time that both these statements were made, I was probably unaware
of that level of detail.” 18 June 2024 69:14-69:24 (INQ00001162).

203. Mr Henderson appeared to be saying to the Inquiry in this answer that he understood the
conversation differently in light of what he had leamed about remote access since 2012.
Given that there is no contemporaneous record of the conversation, that Mr Henderson’s
description of it has varied and developed over time, and that - on his own evidence - his
understanding of the meaning of what Mr Jenkins said has changed since 2012, Ms
Vennells submits that it is difficult to draw a conclusion as to precisely what was said. It
is even more difficult to establish what, if anything, Mr Henderson reported about the
conversation to Ms Lyons and Ms Sewell. This issue was not discussed with them during
their live evidence, and there is no contemporaneous record that Mr Henderson raised
remote access with them in September 2013. There is also no evidence that Ms Lyons

and Ms Sewell reported any such conversation to Ms Vennells.

204. In paragraphs 30 and 31 of his witness statement (WITN04730100), Mr Baker says that,
at Second Sight’s request, he asked Fujitsu towards the end of 2012 about remote access
to HNGX. Mr Baker spoke to Mr Jenkins, who confirmed that Fujitsu could directly and
remotely update the SPM database and had good controls in place. Mr Baker claims that
he relayed this information first to Second Sight, and then to Ms Vennells at a meeting
of the core team working on the Second Sight review. According to Mr Baker, Ms
Vennells appeared “surprised by this information, based on her body language, which I
found puzzling since direct remote access was possible in any IT system and there must

be controls in place. I recall reassuring her that this was a standard feature in IT systems.”

98
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

205. It is clear from this that Mr Baker does not claim to have told Ms Vennells that Fujitsu
used remote access to make unauthorised changes to branch accounts. In any event, his
account is clearly a mis-recollection of events in 2013 in which Ms Vennells was not

involved.

206. First, it is highly unlikely that Mr Baker discussed remote access with Second Sight or
Gareth Jenkins in 2012. Mr Rudkin first contacted Second Sight about his visit to
Bracknell in February 2013.°? Second Sight notified POL of Mr Rudkin’s case and made
initial inquiries about remote access on 5 and 6 February 2013.°° On 20 March 2013, Mr
Allchorn emailed Mr Henderson with current action points to obtain documentation
about Fujitsu’s and POL’s Bracknell operations (POL00029577). This included a

ringfence on the emails of relevant employees since 2008.

207. On 22 May 2013, Mr Baker spoke by telephone to Mr Warmington and Mr Henderson,
who recorded part of the call. The transcript is at (SSL0000103). It shows that:

a. Mr Baker said that he asked Fujitsu and “apparently there is a process where — so
there is a technical avenue where you can technically do some form of adjustment,
you know, and - - but apparently its very carefully monitored, controlled, audited

stuff - - type stuff" (page 3).

b. — Mr Baker said that he told Ms Crichton and Ms Lyons that “there is a mechanism
and their faces dropped” (page 6). It is highly likely that this is the conversation

that Mr Baker has mis-recollected in his witness statement.

ec. Notonly had Mr Baker not told Ms Vennells, but he also had no intention of telling
her. He stated on page 8: “...1 told Alwyn about this and I’ve said, look, there’s a
chance you may raise it, so I’ve left it to her to make that call.” He stated on page

9: “I am going to leave that to Alwyn to brief Paula on the Bracknell issue."

d. After Mr Baker left the call, Mr Warmington stated: "they'd better not hold this

from the two top ladies very much longer" (page 11).

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

On the same day, Second Sight recorded what appears to be a subsequent call with Ms
Crichton and Ms Lyons. The transcript is at (SSL0000104). The discussion about the

Rudkin case begins at page 37. Two key points emerge from the transcript:

a. Ms Vennells had been informed about Mr Rudkin’s allegations, but not the details
of it (page 45).

b. Mr Warmington and Mr Henderson pressed POL to give Ms Vennells a more
detailed briefing in advance of a meeting with Lord Arbuthnot on 23 May 2013.
The key plank of Second Sight’s argument was that, although POL had stated that
the basement of the Bracknell facility was the place of work of a POL test team,
Second Sight had been given emails which showed the POL employees at
Bracknell, in Mr Henderson’s words, “getting instructions directly from the
Helpdesk saying ‘Look, we need this fixed...’” and “the responses going back,
“Yeah, it will be done in the overnight run tonight. We will change the balances or

whatever.’” (page 43).

There is no evidence that Ms Vennells was given any detailed briefing on the Rudkin
case before she spoke to Lord Arbuthnot. In June 2013 Mr Baker analysed the emails on
which Second Sight relied to suggest that the POL Bracknell team had been involved in
changing branch data. He concluded that the emails did not support Second Sight’s belief:

a. At 16:45 on 25 June 2013, Mr Baker emailed Mr Warmington and Mr Hendeson
(cc. Lesley Sewell) as follows (POL00188991):

In summary the emails fall into three categories
1. The email is referring to POLSAP, not horizon

2. The email is referring to reference data, this is managed by a different team,
with no connection to the test team, apart from the fact that some are based in
Bracknell (but a different part of the building)

3. The email is about testing TCs in the test environment as part of Horizon
release 5 which contained changes that required the TC process to be tested.

b. — Mr Baker then forwarded the email to Ms Sewell, adding:

100
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

“As a heads up Ron mentioned to today that he was going to quote one of the
emails in the preliminary report.

“He was going to quote “Although it is rarely done it is possible to journal from
branch cash accounts. There are possible P&BA concerns about how this would
be perceived and how disputes would be resolved”.

T hope I have convinced him otherwise, however he is being unpredictable right
now and I can’t guarantee where he will end up. This quote is clearly referring
to POLSAP and not horizon, he now understands that, but Ian and Ron are still
thinking through their position on whether to include it.

210. In conclusion (a) the Rudkin case was the first allegation of remote access which was

investigated by POL and reported to Ms Vennells; (b) that allegation was that Mr Rudkin
had personally witnessed POL or Fujitsu employees using remote access powers to alter
branch accounts; and (c) it was reported to Ms Vennells that the allegation had been
investigated and that Mr Rudkin was wrong that he had seen anyone accessing the live

system. Ms Vennells was entitled to rely on what she was told.

Ms Vennells’ conversation with Duncan Tait

211.

Ms Vennells recalls discussing remote access during a meeting with Duncan Tait, then
the CEO of Fujitsu Europe and has set out her recollection of the discussion at PV WS1
91299 (WITN01020100). Ms Vennells raised Mr Rudkin’s allegations with Mr Tait. She

recalls:

“I remember that Duncan was dismissive of Mr. Rudkin's claim that there was live
access to the system in the basement at Bracknell. I recall him saying something along
the lines that if Mr. Rudkin had seen the live environment, he had remembered it
"upside down", because the system was managed by a team working on the sixth floor
at Bracknell. I asked Duncan (and I remember feeling slightly embarrassed at my
implied lack of trust) if a Fujitsu colleague could alter branch accounts remotely
without a SPM knowing. I said I had been told by Lesley Sewell and others that it was
not possible and besides, there was no understandable reason why anyone would try to.
(The view of the POL team at the time was that the idea of an Fujitsu employee hacking
into a SPM account was too fanciful to be true. 'Why would they?’ was the phrase used.)
Duncan's response was no and we concurred it was an implausible scenario. Why
would a Fujitsu colleague try to hack into a branch's accounts? We couldn't find any
suitable explanation - there was no way they could benefit financially from such an
action. The only possible reason would be a malicious act by a disgruntled employee.
Duncan described the core of Horizon like a black box, ie., similar to an aircraft flight
recorder; he said that even if someone wanted to, it was not possible to alter or break

101
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

it. I had heard the black box description before. He described how secure the system
was - that even if someone had the motivation, it just wasn't possible - Horizon was
like Fort Knox.I found it reassuring that the CEO of Fujitsu confirmed that there was

no cause for concern and that the system could not be tampered with.”
212. (FUJ00174662) suggests that this discussion took place at a meeting between Ms
Vennells and Mr Tait on 10 June 2013. The document is Fujitsu’s briefing note to Mr
Tait for the meeting. Section 6 of the note (“Other points which may arise”) mentions an
allegation raised during the Second Sight review that “alterations to the branch database
holding sub-postmaster balances could be made on Fujitsu premises.” It is probable that

the discussion recalled by Ms Vennells and Mr Tait occurred at this meeting.
213. In his witness statement at {110 (WITN03570100), Mr Tait states that:

a. Ms Vennells asked him at a meeting, though he cannot remember when, “if the

system was secure”.

b. Since Ms Vennells had referred, before asking the question, to the sixth floor at
Bracknell where the Fujitsu software development team were located, he took her
question to be to be whether anyone outside of the Fujitsu's Post Office Account

team could physically enter the sixth floor and access the system.

c. He knew that the sixth floor was physically secured and protected by strong cyber

controls. On that basis, he told Ms Vennells that the system was “like Fort Knox”.

214. Given the similarities between the two accounts, it is likely that Ms Vennells and Mr Tait
are discussing the same conversation in their evidence. Mr Tait was aware of Ms
Vennells’ recollection of the “Fort Knox” conversation from the letter she sent to the
House of Commons BEIS Select Committee in June 2020: see his witness statement at

7109.

215. Ms Vennells submits that her account should be preferred: (1) POL never faced an
allegation that Fujitsu’s Bracknell facility was physically insecure: (2) on Mr Tait’s own
evidence, Ms Vennells asked about the security of “the system”, not the building or any
particular floor in the building; (3) POL did, however, face an allegation that individuals
at Bracknell had been seen making unauthorised changes to branch data and Mr Tait was
aware of this allegation from his briefing; (4) it is inherently probable that Ms Vennells

raised the security of the system with Mr Tait in the context of allegations of remote

102
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

access; (5) even if Mr Tait understood the question to be directed at physical and cyber
security it is understandable that Ms Vennells took him to mean that the system could
not be tampered with; (6) as set out in her witness statement Ms Vennells recalls it was

Mr Tait who mentioned the sixth floor at Bracknell.

The Mediation Scheme

216. The Mediation Scheme was announced on 26 August 2013 through POL’s internal
communication channels: see the announcement at page 113 of (POL00090358). The

structure of the Scheme was as follows:

a. The Scheme was open to former and current SPMs and counter clerks who believed
that they had suffered loss or been treated unfairly “as a result of the Horizon

system or any associated issues”.

b. Applicants registered their complaint by completing a case questionnaire review
(or CQR). POL then collated the evidence and produced an investigation report for
each case, known as a POIR. The POIRs, and the evidence, were handed to Second
Sight to produce a Case Review Report (CRR) for each complaint. The function of
aCRR was to identify the areas of common ground and disagreement between POL
and the applicant, to set out any findings by Second Sight, and to recommend
whether the case was appropriate for mediation. Applicants were given copies of

the POIR and the CRR in their case.

c. Second Sight were to produce “thematic” reports which would address in detail

common issues raised by multiple applicants.

d. There was a Working Group consisting of Second Sight, the JFSA and POL, with
the former Court of Appeal judge Sir Anthony Hooper as Chair. The remit of the
Working Group was to (a) determine the eligibility of applicants to participate in
the Scheme; (b) exercise oversight and give direction to the investigation; and (c)

decide whether individual cases should proceed to a mediation.

e. POL was to bear the full costs of the Mediation Scheme. It would provide a
contribution of up to £1,500 plus VAT, for applicants to engage a professional

adviser to help them gather documents, complete the CQR, and respond to any

103
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

questions from Second Sight. If an applicant’s case progressed to mediation POL
would provide up to £1,250 plus VAT of additional funding for the applicant to
engage an advisor to help them prepare for the mediation and to support them on

the day. POL engaged CEDR to run the mediations.

217. The use of mediation as a procedure for seeking resolution of cases was recommended
by Ms Crichton following discussions with Bond Dickinson: see the emails between Ms
Crichton and Mr Parsons concerning mediation on 12 July 2013 at (WBON0000767)
and Ms Vennells; email to Mark Davies (cc. Ms Crichton and Mr Edwards) on 16 July
2013 (POL00192088): “Susan and I discussed last evening with one of our experienced
extemal lawyers, and came up with a similar idea of a discussion and resolution Forum,
which could be chaired by a professional mediator.” The Mediation Scheme reflected
POL’s commitment, when it published the SSIR, to establish a working group to
complete the review of the cases and to investigate the themes identified in the SSIR. Ms
Vennells explains at {{608-637 of PV WS1 (WITN01020100) the factors which led to
the establishment of the Scheme. These included (a) the need to complete the
investigation of the cases referred to Second Sight;°' (b) Ms Vennells’ belief that the

JFSA should be involved in the review of the cases;

and (c) the need not only to
investigate but to seek to resolve disputed cases. Although some within POL believed
that Second Sight should have no further role in the investigation (23 May 2024: 71:12-
71:17 (INQ00001152)) Ms Vennells knew it was necessary for them to remain involved,
regardless of the reported criticisms of their work on the SSIR, because they had the
support and confidence of the MPs: 23 May 2024 72:4-72:11; 127:1-127:20

(INQ00001152).

218. On 19 July 2013, Bond Dickinson prepared a “Mediation proposal” paper
(POL00297858) which contained, under the heading “Workflow”, what is clearly an
early outline of what became the Mediation Scheme. On the same day, Mr Baker, Mr
Edwards, Ms Vennells, Mr Davies, Ms Crichton, and Ms Vennells attended a meeting to
discuss mediation (POL00117036). On 22 July 2013, Ms Vennells and Ms Crichton met
Second Sight and Lord Arbuthnot to discuss the proposal of mediation. Second Sight and

Lord Arbuthnot both supported the proposal (see pages 2-3 of the transcript of the call at
(SSL0000108) and Ms Lyons’ note of the meeting at (POL00099354). POL also
presented the proposal to the JFSA: see Ms Crichton’s WS 4135 (WITN00220100). Any
suggestion that Ms Vennells attempted to stop the investigation of the existing cases or
to prevent new cases coming forward for investigation is incorrect. Ms Vennells
specifically stated during the meeting on 22 July 2013, in response to Lord Arbuthnot’s
comment that “these [the existing cases] are not the only cases”, that “No, we understand
that, and that’s one of the things we were trying to address” and that “...this process
could be used, subject to it being successful, for other cases going forward...”:
(SSL0000108). As set out above, the Mediation Scheme was made available to the

broadest spectrum of former and current Horizon users.

219. The proposal for mediation was explained to the Board in a paper dated 26 July 2013
(POL00298004). As stated in the section on prosecutions, the paper appears to have been
written by Mr Edwards, who sent a draft to Ms Crichton for comments. Paragraph 7 of

the paper stated that:

“There are a number of possible outcomes to this resolution process, which will
have to be determined on a case by case basis. In some instances we may
conclude that we still believe that the [SPM] was at fault, and therefore no
specific redress should be offered. In other cases we may acknowledge that there
were shortcomings on our side or both sides, and commit to take action to
address these as part of the process improvements workstream. And of course
there is the clear risk that in some cases the sub-postmaster will argue that
financial compensation is appropriate, which again will have to be assessed
carefully on a case by case basis. We certainly do not believe that there are
grounds for a blanket compensation scheme, and will not be setting up the
process with this expectation.”

220. The statement that there were no grounds for a “blanket compensation scheme” appears
to have come from advice set out in the Bond Dickinson “Mediation proposal” paper
(POL00297858) that “At present, there is insufficient evidence to justify a blanket
compensation scheme for SPMRs. Each case needs to be considered on its individual

merits.”

221. Further details of the potential claims for compensation were set out in paragraph 25 of

the 26 July 2013 paper for the Board. This stated:

105
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

“The mediator would not be empowered to impose any form of financial
settlement, so it would be up to us to consider the most appropriate response,
which will have to be determined based on the individual merits of each case.
This assessment will need to take into account the risk that the [SPM] could
successfully secure compensation through the civil courts, alongside a
consideration of what we deem to be our moral responsibilities as a principled
business and our exposure to damaging reputational risks. Given the
uncertainties, at this stage it is not possible to provide any meaningful estimate
of the potential overall costs associated with compensation, although we will be
keeping this under close review.”

222. These documents give the context to Ms Vennells’ email to Ms Crichton on 27 August
2013 (POL00116218), to which Ms Vennells was taken in her oral evidence on 23 May
2024. Ms Vennells said that her understanding was that mediation would be a
conversation and while compensation could be paid where appropriate, POL was not
thinking about large scale compensation and should not set expectations for the
Mediation Scheme that it could not meet: 23 May 2024 164:2-164:11 (INQ00001152).
Ms Vennells’ evidence is reflected in the 23 July 2013 paper for the Board. The nuances
are clearer in the formal Board update than in Ms Vennells’ email, but they reflect the
same thinking, namely, that settlement would be approached on a case by case basis, and
that POL would need to take care to ensure that any monetary settlements were

appropriate.

223. The Board update also highlights that the proper approach to settlement and
compensation was necessarily a subject on which POL required legal advice. On 19
November 2013, Mr Aujard presented a paper to the Executive Committee on settlement
policy, accompanied by a draft settlement policy prepared by Bond Dickinson
(POL00027506). Mr Aujard noted at paragraph 4.2 of the paper that the Mediation
Scheme would be a success from POL’s perspective if “the cost...in terms of financial
settlements is not excessive, but proportionate and consistent with the proper use of
public money.” Ms Vennells submits that this was a legitimate objective of POL . It was
based upon what it had been told about the outcome of the Second Sight Review in 2012-
2013, namely, that the work carried by Second Sight and by a POL technical team had
not revealed any error in Horizon and that where problems had occurred, such as the bugs
in HNGX, they had been identified, investigated, and corrected: see the briefing at
(POL00113369) and the section of these submissions on BEDs.

106
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

224. Bond Dickinson’s draft settlement policy set a high bar for settlement. It stated that, in
cases in which it was claimed that branch losses were caused by technical defects in the
Horizon system or communication failures, POL should require very clear proof (i) of

the alleged technical defect and (ii) that the defect was the cause of the applicant’s loss.

225. Ms Vennells’ understanding at the time was that the investigation of the cases within the
Mediation Scheme would identify any BEDs in the system: PV WSI 640
(WITN01020100). She was not advised, by Second Sight, POL, or Bond Dickinson, that
there was a risk that the methodology of the investigation was insufficient to reveal
whether particular shortfalls were caused by BEDs. Mr Aujard has given evidence that
he considered the policy to be defensible at the time, given the investigations being
undertaken by POL and Second Sight: Aujard WS1 4150 (WITN00030100).

226. However, at times in his evidence, Mr Aujard attempted to distance himself from POL’s
approach to settlement: he stated that the principles set out in the Bond Dickinson paper
were decided before he became Interim GC and that he could not have changed them: 24
April 2024 173:1-18 (INQ00001135). This attitude would have been a dereliction of his
duties as GC. It was his function proactively to identify areas of legal risk 24 April 2024
62:18-63:16 (INQ00001135). Mr Aujard should have advised the Board if it was his
view that the settlement policy was wrong or required further investigation and thought.
In any event, when POL did take external legal advice on settlement from Linklaters, it

confirmed that POL’s approach was legally correct.
Notification of Insurers

227. The minutes of the Board meeting on 16 July 2013 (POL00027514) record that the Board
was concerned about claims against POL for wrongful conviction and asked the CFO,
Mr Day, “to look at the insurance position. He promised a note on this. He was also asked

to ensure RMG and the Business’ insurers were given notice of the review findings".

228. On 19 July 2013, Alwen Lyons sent an email to the Board (POL00099330) which
contained an explanation from Mr Day on the insurance position. Mr Day said that POL’s
insurance broker, Miller, thought that “whilst other insurance policies may be impacted
the most likely one is D&O — this has the added complication as it is the only policy we
share with RM....” In their replies on 19 July 2013, Ms Vennells (POL00434013) and
Mr Marnoch (POL00108034) stated that Mr Day’s explanation did not answer the

107
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

question raised by the Board of whether POL had insurance cover for claims by SPMs.
Mr Day replied on 20 July 2013 (POL00108034):

"Sorry if not clear; there are two points - firstly D + O appears to be the policy
which would cover this eventuality, and our understanding is the first 25k of any
claim is not covered (this is being verified).

Secondly, our broker (Miller) will meet with RM's (JLT) to determine the best
way to engage with D + O insurer/s which will enable us to understand the
possible impact on this (and possibly other) policy premia going forward.

The subtlety here is that we need to inform existing insurers of a potential new
risk (in hand) without 'scaring the horses' into immediately increasing future
costs, and this process is made more complex by being a joint policy with RM
(the only one that is configured in this way).

Will provide a fuller update when we have established all the facts, next week."

229. It appears that Ms Crichton first contacted Bond Dickinson for assistance in relation to a
notification to insurers on 24 July 2013: see her email to Mr Parsons at (POL00145716).
On 9 September 2013, JLT Speciality Limited gave a notification to POL’s D&O insurers
by an email accompanied by a note from Bond Dickinson dated 23 August 2013 entitled
“Horizon Risks” (POL00112856). The email stated that:

"The notice concerns challenges which have been made to the accounting system
used in the post office network to monitor Subpostoffices for any improper
behaviour. Indications of problems have led to private prosecutions by the post
office against Subpostmasters. A pressure group has been formed, Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance, in which the performance of the Horizon system is
called into doubt. The evidence produced by the Horizon system has formed the
factual basis of prosecutions against Subpostmasters. A review of the Horizon
system was undertaken and whilst recommendations were made for
improvements no systemic problems were revealed which would call into
question the charges previously made against Subpostmasters. It is of concern
to Post Office that the expert evidence of one prosecution witness, Dr Gareth
Jenkins of Fujitsu, may have failed to disclose certain problems in the Horizon
system potentially relevant to a case. In the event it is discovered that improper
prosecution was undertaken the risk exists of [a] claim being made against the
Post Office and Directors and Officers for Malicious prosecution, Breach of the
Data Protection Act, Defamation/malicious falsehood And Harassment. It is
unclear at this time the extent of possible exposure to the insured D & O and
would consider this notification to be made out of an excess of caution."

108
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

230. The Bond Dickinson note on “Horizon Risks” contained a section on “Risks to Post

Office”, the first of which was “Prosecutions and Convictions”:

“As noted above, where circumstances warrant, Post Office prosecutes
subpostmasters who have acted criminally. The basis of these prosecutions is
often found in the transaction records recorded in Horizon. As a result of Second
Sight's investigation/Interim Report, Post Office is reviewing all its criminal
prosecutions which have had a hearing since I January 2010.

Post Office has an obligation to consider whether further disclosure should be
made to defendants. It is of concern to Post Office that the expert evidence of
one prosecution witness, Dr Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu, may have failed to
disclose certain problems in the Horizon system potentially relevant to a case."

231. On 12 March 2014, Mr Parsons emailed a copy of the “Horizon Risks” document to Mr
Aujard and Mr Oliver, and explained: “This note has the dual purpose of advising the
board (its contents were later reflected in a board paper) and acting as a notification to
POL’s insurers — hence why this doesn’t look like a traditional piece of legal advice”
(POL00021991). When she was asked about the Horizon Risks document, Ms Perkins
stated that the paper itself was not presented to the Board and that she did not believe that
its contents were reflected in any Board paper: 5 June 2024: 178:19-180:4
(INQ00001156). In his oral evidence, Mr Parsons stated that he had looked at his 12
March 2014 email and that the sentence that the contents of the “Horizon Risks”
document were reflected in a Board paper was incorrect: 13 June 2024 66:9-66:13
(INQ00001160). It is not entirely clear that the Board was informed that the DD&O
insurers had been notified. The minutes of the Board meeting on 25 September 2013
(which was the first Board meeting after the July Board meeting) record that “The Board
asked for a noting paper to clarify if any claims on the Business from Horizon would be
covered by Professional Indemnity or Directors & Officers insurance and whether we
had alerted our underwriters. The CFO "would ensure the appropriate notifications were

made" (UKGI00016117).

The Linklaters and Deloitte work in 2014

232. Once applications began to be submitted, POL became concerned by what it called the
“Expectations Gap” — meaning the difference between the quantum of some of the claims

and the amounts that POL expected to pay in settlement:

109
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. Ms Vennells first reported the “Expectations Gap” to the ARC on 19 November
2013 (POL00021427), stating that a risk had arisen concerning “the compensation
that subpostmasters believed they were entitled to. It had become clear from the
applications for mediation that there was an expectation gap which the Business

needed to mitigate where possible”.

b. I Ms Crowe submitted a paper dated 20 February 2014 to the Board to update it on
the Mediation Scheme: (POL00026629 16). The paper stated that the
“expectations gap” was increasing: “Our current estimate is that we will receive
claims stated to be in the region of £100M. Applying the settlement policy, Bond

Dickinson has estimated the claims to be valued at £6M.”

c. Ata meeting with Ms Vennells and Mr Aujard on 24 February 2014, Sir Anthony
Hooper challenged POL’s belief, based on Bond Dickinson’s advice, that its
financial exposure to dismissed SPMs was limited to 3 months’ pay under the SPM

contract: (POL00100338).

233. In light of these developments, the Board directed POL at its meeting on 26 February
2014 to obtain further legal advice, in addition to the advice that it was receiving on the
individual cases. This was to be a piece of “generic legal advice on the overall level of
legal and financial exposure (taking account of the possibility of class actions)”
(POL00027337).

The Linklaters advice

234. POL instructed Linklaters to undertake this work, and they produced a report on 20
March 2014 (POL00006354). Paragraph 1.8 of the executive summary stated as follows
on the core issue of POL’s liability to SPMs:

“Tn summary, we think that, absent proof that Horizon is malfunctioning (either
generally or in the specific case) the Post Office has a right to recover losses
from SPMRs, the SPMRs have no right to compensation for such losses and the
circumstances in which there will be a consequential loss claim are limited to
those in which inadequate notice of termination was given, will depend on their
facts and should be limited. While we are not in a position to assess the facts of
the claims in the Scheme and the specific amounts sought in each of them, it
appears to us on the basis of the conclusions above that many of the claims are
likely to be over-ambitious and difficult to prove. Accordingly, the total amount

110
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

that could be successfully claimed in Court by Applicants may well be only a
fraction of the aggregate amount (approximately £100 million) which they have
claimed through the Scheme”.

235. The Linklaters report was sent to the Board under cover of a paper from Mr Aujard dated
20 March 2014 (POL00027431) in which he summarised the advice as follows: “In
preparing their advice Linklaters have, in effect, made the working assumption (which
we believe to be correct) that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with the Horizon system. On that
basis, the advice from Linklaters is that, in strict legal terms, many, if not all, of the claims

submitted under the Scheme would be unsuccessful if they were considered by a Court”.

236. Ms Band, the partner at Linklaters who led the preparation of the advice, attended the
Board meeting on 26 February 2014 to explain the advice (POL00006564). She
explained that, due to the terms of the contract between POL and SPMs, POL would not
be required to pay compensation and that if compensation payments were made to
Mediation Scheme applicants, this would not give SPMRs outside the Mediation Scheme
aright to similar payments. She also explained that English law did not permit claims for

distress, as claimed by many applicants.

237. The Linklaters advice appeared to confirm, among other matters, that (1) POL’s legal
and financial exposure to SPMs within the Mediation Scheme was in line with POL’s
expectations; (2) POL did not owe SPMs a relevant legal duty of care and the rights and
obligations of the parties were limited to the terms of the contract (para. 5.10); (3) the
burden was on SPMs to establish that Horizon did not accurately reflect the state of their
account with POL (paras. 5.37-5.39); (4) POL had a sound contractual basis to recover
losses from SPMs, which was supported, and in any event supplemented, by the laws of
agency (para. 5.48); (5) SPMs would not be entitled to consequential losses if POL had
claimed sums from them to which it was not entitled (paras. 5.69) and (6) claims based
on inadequate training and support would not affect POL’s ability to recover losses

evidenced by the accounts shown on Horizon (para. 1.7).

238. Linklaters’ advice on points of legal principle was shown to be wrong by the decision of
Fraser J in the Common Issues Judgment in the Group Litigation. Ms Vennells submits
that at the time, she was in no position to look behind or question their opinions on the

law. The report was an ostensibly thoughtful and well-rationalised piece of legal advice

111
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

by a top-tier law firm and it was submitted to the Board without any reservation by the
Gc.

The Deloitte assurance review

239. After Ms Band left the meeting on 26 February 2014, the Board agreed to commission a
piece of work, to complement the Linklaters advice, which would give them, and those
concerned outside the business, comfort about Horizon. The work should cover: (a) how
the system worked; (b) a review of the data integrity aspects of the system; (c) a reference
to all tests and audits performed on the system; and (d) a response to the most significant

thematic issues raised by Second Sight.

240. On 9 April 2014, POL engaged Deloitte to provide an independent summary of the
assurance and other work undertaken in relation to HNGX: see Deloitte’s engagement
letter at (POL00117611). The stated purpose of the engagement was to enable POL to
respond more effectively to allegations that Horizon was defective. The scope of the work
was a “desktop” review of documents which evidenced the design of the procedures and
controls for Horizon. Deloitte were not instructed to test whether Horizon had been

implemented or operated as designed, which was a potential second stage of the work.

241. The rationale for the exercise was discussed at the meeting of the Sparrow Sub-

Committee on 9 April 2014 which Ms Vennells attended (POL00006565):

“Tt was noted that Part 1 consisted of a largely desk-based exercise to assess the
control framework within which Horizon operates. As part of its business as
usual activity Post Office and Fujitsu undertake a range of assessments and
audits of Horizon/s operating environment. Deloittes will review those
assessments and audits and provide an assessment of the assurance landscape
and identify any gaps. The assessment will not consider the integrity of the
Horizon processing environment at implementation. That would form Part 2 of
the work.

“Although no system could be absolutely bullet proof, no issues had yet been
identified through the cases being investigated or any other route that has called
into question the integrity of Horizon. Nor have any wide-spread systemic faults
been identified since Horizon on-line was implemented. These two points, along
with the Part I work (depending on the results) should be sufficient to assure
Post Office that Horizon is fit for purpose.”

112
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

242. Mr Aujard stated in his oral evidence that the section of the discussion on Horizon would
have been formulated from contributions from a number of people, including Ms Sewell:
24 April 2024 118:18-118:25 (INQ00001135). In any event, Ms Vennells submits that
the Sub-Committee would have been entitled to assume that an important statement about

Horizon’s fitness for purpose, and how it was to be ass

sed, would represent the

professional opinion of POL’s IT specialists.

243. Gareth James, a partner of Deloitte, attended the Board meeting on 30 April 2014 to
present Deloitte’s interim conclusions (POL00021524). Mr James reported that all of the
work to date showed that HNGX had strong areas of control and that its testing and
implementation were in line with best practice. The only major caveat was that Deloitte
had yet to assure the controls and access at Fujitsu’s financial service centre. It was also
agreed that Mr James would produce and cost a proposal to conduct a similar exercise

for Legacy Horizon.

244. At the Board meeting, Mr Aujard had explained that several SPMs had made allegations
about “phantom” transactions which were non -traceable. At the meeting of the Sparrow
Sub-Committee on the same day, which Ms Vennells attended, (POL00006566) Mr
Aujard stated that he had told Mr James about the visibility of “Transaction Corrections”
in the transaction logs, and that Mr James had stated that this should enable Deloitte to

complete their assurance work much more quickly.

245. The Board did not see the draft reports prepared by Deloitte in connection with the
engagement: Mr Aujard was concerned that they were too long and technical to be
presented to the Board. He was unsure whether he had read Deloitte’s final draft report
in its entirety himself: 24 April 2024 129:5-129:20 (INQ00001135). Instead, Deloitte
was asked to prepare a shorter document with a summary of their conclusions to go to
the Board.

246. This was the Board Briefing document (POL00030159) which Ms Lyons sent to the
Board on 4 June 2014, as an attachment to an email in which she set out a message from
Mr Aujard and Ms Sewell (POL00029733). The message from Mr Aujard and Ms Sewell
stated that the briefing focused on those features of the Horizon system which operated

to provide SPMs with full ownership and visibility of their branch ledger, and which

© (POL00147961) shows that Ms Sewell had input into the terms of Deloitte’s engagement.

113
247.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

maintained a complete and accurate audit trail. It therefore helped to address allegations
by SPMs that branch losses were caused by “phantom” Horizon transactions. Although
they noted that the Board Briefing was heavily caveated and the limitations of the
“desktop” review were acknowledged, Deloitte’s key findings were said in the email to

include the following:

a. Deloitte had not become aware of anything to suggest that the system as designed
would not deliver the objectives of processing transactions and keeping copies of

them in the Audit Store with integrity.

b. _ Deloitte’s review of “extensive operational documentation” identified features in
Horizon “which, if implemented, would support the robust operation of the

system.”

f. Those features would operate to protect transaction data integrity from when it
enters the system in a Branch until stored in the Audit Store, and provide visibility

to SPMs of any centrally generated (i.e. non-Branch) transactions.

g. Those features were not impacted by the 2010 upgrade to the current day Horizon

Online system (and hence were not independently tested at the time).

h. POL had in place key controls over the day to day management of Horizon. These

had been independently tested and assured by E&Y since 2012.

However, the Board Briefing contained two pieces of information that were not

mentioned, or even hinted at, in the message from Mr Aujard and Ms Sewell. These were:

a. Database access privileges existed which would allow a Fujitsu user to delete or
amend a digitally signed basket from the Audit Store and to replace it with a fake
version. Deloitte had not identified any documented controls to prevent a person

with the necessary privilege from doing this.

b. All processes operated on the principle of full Sub-postmaster disclosure and
acceptance. An exception to this principle was a procedure known as a “Balancing
Transaction”. Deloitte reported that Balancing Transactions did not require

approval by the SPM and appeared to be an exceptional process which Fujitsu

114
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

asserted had been used only once, in 2010, between 2008 and May 2014. The usage

of the function prior to 2008 was unknown.

248. Ms Vennells stated in her written evidence (PV WS1 $885) (WITN01020100) and oral
evidence (on 22 May 2024 161:24-165:15; 168:24-170:18) (INQ00001151) that she
spoke to Ms Sewell about Balancing Transactions after she had read the Board Briefing.
Ms Vennells recalled that Ms Sewell told her that it was similar to a Transaction
Correction, that the procedure had been used on one occasion, and that permission was
sought from the SPM. Ms Vennells recalled a second conversation with Ms Sewell to
obtain confirmation that POL knew from documents that the procedure had been used

only once and she understood that this was correct.

249. Ms Vennells submits that her recollection is likely to be correct. Ms Sewell was one of
the authors of the email to the Board which stated in terms that Deloitte’s work helped
POL in relation to allegations of “phantom transactions”. Ms Vennells submits that this
is likely to have been Ms Sewell’s opinion at the time: it would have been extraordinary
for POL’s head of IT to state that opinion to the Board if she did not believe it to be true

or know that it required a significant qualification.

250. In this context, the Inquiry should treat with caution Ms Sewell’s evidence that she was
angry upon learning that Fujitsu had used a Balancing Transaction to insert a transaction
into branch accounts, and that she immediately escalated the issue to the CEO and the
GC: Sewell WS §65 (WITN00840100). There is no documentary evidence to support
this assertion. Deloitte’s findings in relation to Balancing Transactions are set out in
Deloitte’s draft report dated 23 May 2014 (POL00107160). Ms Sewell said in her oral
evidence that she reviewed the report when she received it: 16 May 2024 105:6-105:7
(INQ00001148). The first communication from Ms Sewell to the Board (or indeed
anyone) about the substance of Deloitte’s findings was the message sent to the Board on
6 June 2014. There is no subsequent communication from Ms Sewell in which she
highlighted the risks to POL of Balancing Transactions. If Ms Sewell genuinely believed
at the time that the Balancing Transaction issue was as serious as she now claims in her
witness statement, she should have notified the Board at the first opportunity. However,
it does not appear that she ever notified the Board about her alleged concerns. Nor is

there any evidence that Ms Sewell, as she claims, escalated the issue with Fujitsu.

115
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

251. Ms Sewell gave the impression in her evidence that she did not regard the reported ability
of Fujitsu to tamper with audit data as a real risk. She described it as a “theoretical
possibility” because a number of people at Fujitsu would have been required to collude
in any tampering: 16 May 2024 106:8-106:16 (INQ00001148). Ms Vennells submits
that it is more likely that Ms Sewell took a similar view of the Balancing Transaction
issue — that she accepted Fujitsu’s explanation that the procedure had been used only

once, and did not see Deloitte’s findings about Balancing Transactions as a serious risk.
What Ms Vennells was told about the merits of the cases in the Mediation Scheme

252. Ms Vennells was given two key messages in her briefings on the merits of the cases

within the Scheme:

a. The first was that the investigation of the cases had not revealed any faults with

Horizon. For example:

i. A paper prepared by Chris Aujard on 17 September 2014 to update the Board
on the progress of the Mediation Scheme (POL00027363) stated that “...we
have found nothing in the 73 cases investigated which has raised concerns
about faults with the Horizon system, the safety of convictions or [POL’s]

liability for the losses being claimed by applicants.

ii. A briefing note prepared by Mr Bourke for a call between Vennells and Lord
Arbuthnot on 28 October 2014 (POL00101484) stated that POL had now
investigated 80 cases and in not one of the cases had a fault been established

in the Horizon system.

iii. A briefing note prepared by Mr Bourke on 15 November 2014
(POL00116790) stated on page 4 that “POL has now investigated 106 case
(sic.) afresh — in none of these has a fault with Horizon been established or

been even close to establishing”.

iv. Ms Vennells’ CEO report for the January 2015 Board meeting
(POL00102048) stated that: We have now completed investigations for all
cases in the Scheme. To date, we have found no evidence, nor has any been

provided by either an Applicant or Second Sight, of either faults with the

116
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

Horizon system or unsafe convictions, and we are not aware that any

convictions have been appealed.”

v. Mr Aujard and Mr Davies prepared a paper for the Sparrow Sub-Committee
meeting on 12 January 2015 (POL00022293). This stated: “To date we have
found no evidence, nor has any been advanced by either an Applicant or
Second Sight of either faults with the Horizon system or unsafe convictions
(on the latter point, every case investigated has been scrutinised by our

external criminal lawyers) and no convictions have been appealed.”

b. The second theme, which is shown by the documents summarised above, is that
the cases in the Mediation Scheme had been reviewed by external criminal lawyers
who had concluded that there was no evidence of unsafe convictions within the

Mediation Scheme caseload.

253. Mr Bourke, who was involved in preparing some of the documents set out above, and
who drafted similar statements for POL’s response to the Westminster Hall debate
about Horizon in January 2015 (POL00040791) stated that these assurances were
derived from the work of Cartwright King (who were engaged to review the cases in
the Mediation Scheme from a criminal law perspective) and Bond Dickinson (whose
role included reviewing the POL and Second Sight reports to produce settlement
recommendations): Bourke WS §93 (WITN09830100).

254. Ms Vennells submits that she was entitled to rely on statements made by the GC and Mr
Bourke, a qualified solicitor, for their accuracy. She was also entitled to believe, and did
believe, that these statements were an honest and professional view based on the evidence
reviewed by POL. Ms Vennells was aware that Bond Dickinson had been engaged by
POL as its primary legal advisor in relation to the review, and that POL’s investigation
work included reviewing transaction data sourced from Fujitsu: PV WS1 41073
(WITN01020100). At the time, Ms Vennells had no basis to second guess what she was

told about POL’s view of the outcome of the investigation.

117
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

What Ms Vennells was told about the work of Second Sight

255. Those who reported to Ms Vennells were highly critical of the work of Second Sight.
She has given examples of this in her witness statement. At the Sparrow Sub-Committee
meeting on 9 April 2014 (POL00006565), it was reported that:

a. POL had passed around 20 POIRs to Second Sight for review. Second Sight had
produced three CRRs which had all been rejected by the Working Group as not

sufficient for mediation.

b. — Second Sight had also produced an early draft of their thematic report which Sir

Anthony Hooper had dismissed as not ready for Working Group discussion.

c. The Working Group has tasked POL and Second Sight to focus on the preparation
of 2 - 3 cases, which did not raise thematic issues, for discussion at the next face to
face Working Group on I May with a view to deciding whether those cases should

progress to mediation.

256. However, the thematic report was already considerably delayed by this point, and Second
Sight did not circulate a complete draft until August 2014: see Ms Vennells’ account at
PV WS1 99947-987 (WITN01020100). The feedback on the quality of the report was

wholly negative:

a. POL sent a copy of the thematic report to Mr Swil at Linklaters. He described the
report as "well below the standard we would expect of a firm of 'experienced
accountants’ engaged to prepare an independent, evidence-based report” and
considered that the draft failed to protect both POL and the applicants’ interests
(POL00021814).

b. It was reported to Ms Vennells on 15 August 2014 in a draft update to the Board
(POL00101176) that the report “is of a very poor quality. It lacks evidence and
analysis and is unhelpful to applicants and Post Office in terms of assisting a

resolution of applications."

257. To provide another example, on 26 October 2014, Mr Bourke prepared a note for Ms
Vennells in advance of a call with Lord Arbuthnot on 28 October 2014 (POL00101484).

He stated that the approach of Second Sight was invariably to recommend cases for

118
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

mediation regardless of the evidence. At paragraph 37 of his witness statement, Mr
Bourke has given examples of CRRs produced by Second Sight which gave cause for
concern about Second Sight’s approach: in each case, Second Sight concluded that the
SPM was, or was likely to have been, responsible for the shortfalls. However, Second
Sight recommended mediation in each of these cases. Mr Bourke stated that he came to
hold the view that Second Sight had lost objectivity, and this view was shared by others
at POL and Bond Dickinson: Bourke WS §38 (WITN09830100).

258. Ms Vennells submits that she was entitled to accept and rely on the opinions of the
members of the team who were close to the detail of the investigation about the

performance of Second Sight.

Sir Anthony Hooper’s evidence about SPMs’ guilt and miscarriages of justice.

259. Sir Anthony stated in his evidence that he had told Ms Vennells and, he believed, Ms
Perkins, that it was unlikely that that the cause of the losses suffered by POL was theft
by SPMs, a point that he repeated in his oral evidence: WS {6 (WITN00430100); 10
April 2024 134:12-135:6 (INQ00001127). Ms Vennells did not see Sir Anthony’s
witness statement before she made her own witness statements and was therefore not able
to comment on what he claims to have told her. However, there is no documentary
evidence that Sir Anthony said anything along these lines in any meeting with Ms
Vennells or Ms Perkins. Indeed, the documentary evidence of discussions between Ms
Vennells and Sir Anthony shows no trace of him giving an opinion on the likelihood that

losses were not caused by theft:

a. (POL00100338) is a file note of a meeting between Ms Vennells, Mr Aujard,
and Sir Anthony on 24 February 2014. In paragraph 7 of the note, he is
recorded as discussing the level of damages that could be payable by POL on
the hypothesis that “the evidence show[s] that POL had not acted properly.”
This was a challenge (which contributed to POL’s decision to commission the
advice from Linklaters) to POL’s assumption that its potential exposure to
damages claims was small. There is no record in the minute of Sir Anthony
expressing a view on the merits of past POL prosecutions or allegations of

theft against SPMs.

119
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

b. On 18 May 2014, Ms Vennells sent an email to Mr Aujard, Mr Davies, and
Mr Edwards to update them on a meeting with Sir Anthony (POL00116566).
The meeting was concerned with the progress of the Mediation Scheme.
Again, there is no hint in the email that Sir Anthony gave his views on past
prosecutions or miscarriages of justice. It records that “He is keen to retain his
independence and although happy to share off the record conversations, will
not give a view on hypothetical situations that he doesn’t yet need to consider.”
Ms Vennells also wrote that she “...gave him the opportunity to express any
views on PO performance and thanked him for helping to shape some of our
reports; to which he replied that really they had been good and he had only
asked us to be clearer in calling out where there was evidence of ‘hands in the
till’. He said the PO reports are thorough and name checked Angela but made

the point it had taken everyone by surprise how much work was involved...”

260. There is no evidence that Sir Anthony told POL's leadership that he believes losses were
not due to theft and that there may have been miscarriages of justice. A communication
from a figure such as Sir Anthony, on issues of such importance, should have been
recorded in writing — not least by Sir Anthony himself would have had a real impact on
Ms Vennells and the Board. The absence of a documentary record suggests that Sir
Anthony did not express himself to Ms Vennells or Ms Perkins in the way he now recalls.

Ms Vennells does not recall any such communication from Sir Anthony.

Provision of information to POL

261. Ithas been suggested during the Inquiry that POL was slow or obstructive in providing
documents and information to Second Sight. However, only three requests for
information and documents were escalated to Ms Vennells during the Mediation

Scheme. These were as follows.

262. Information about suspense accounts: Shortly after Mr Cameron joined POL in January

2015, he was asked by Mr Aujard for help in answering questions by Second Sight
about the operation of POL’s suspense accounts. Their questions focussed on whether
monies in POL’s suspense accounts were monies which could be due to SPMs:
Cameron WS 4159-160 (WITN09840100). Over the following weeks, Mr Cameron

familiarised himself with the concerns raised by Second Sight and the operation of the

120
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

suspense accounts: Cameron WS §§172-185 (WITN09840100). This workstream came
to Ms Vennells’ attention on 20 January 2015, when Ms Crowe informed her that
Second Sight were pressing for a meeting to discuss "suspense accounts" and that "there
is something of a history to this matter" (POL00109892). Ms Crowe stated that Mr
Cameron had been tasked with providing the information. Separately, on 29 January
2015, Mr Warmington emailed Ms Vennells with a list of possible discussion points,
including a "concern about the operation of Post Office's Suspense Account and the
possibility that Post Office may have benefitted from amounts charged to
Subpostmasters" (POL00109933). Ms Vennells states that she was ultimately briefed
by Mr Cameron that Second Sight had misunderstood the nature of the suspense
accounts, which held client money as opposed to unreconciled balances: PV WS1 4193
(WITN01020100). It is also Mr Cameron’s evidence that he became satisfied that there
were no grounds to be concerned about the operation of POL’s suspense accounts. He
states: “If there were unresolved credit transactions due to Postmasters stuck in
suspense, there would be a large balance of older items, however the two material
accounts we investigated had no balances over 6 months old. There also was no
evidence from the investigations undertaken by POL that significant credits were being
released from SAs to Profit & Loss.”: Cameron WS §185 (WITN09840100).

263. Prosecution files: The evidence strongly suggests that Ms Vennells was unaware that
Second Sight had requested access to POL prosecution files, including privileged
documents, before she attended the BEIS Select Committee to give evidence on 3
February 2015. In an email to Mr Richardson of Bond Dickinson on 5 February 2015
(POL00158202), Ms Vennells stated: "It was tough but I felt that other than the issue of
withholding prosecution files, which caught us completely by surprise, we did as you
said...” Further, an email from Ms Crowe to Mr Cameron, Mr Davies, Ms MacLeod and
Mr Aujard on 27 February 2015, which was copied to Ms Vennells (POL00102245)
states that a “clear major breakdown in communications between legal and the CEO

surfaced at the Select Committee on access to legal files.”

264. Ms Vennells appears to have been given an explanation for the disagreement between
POL and Second Sight for the first time in writing in an email from Mr Wechsler on 12
February 2015 (POL00102154). Although the explanation is framed as the lines that
POL intended to take if Second Sight continued to push for disclosure of privileged

121
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

information at the Working Group meeting on 13 February 2015, itis clear that POL was
resisting disclosure of privileged material (and only privileged material) from the files

on grounds of privilege.

265. This was followed by Ms Crowe’s email on 27 February 2015 (POL00102245) from
which it is again clear that POL was resisting disclosure of privileged material on the

grounds that POL had chosen not to waive privilege.

266. Bracknell emails: In his email on 12 February 2015 (POL00102154), Mr Wechsler
addressed Second Sight’s request for emails from staff based at Fujitsu’s facility in
Bracknell. This point was presented as a practical issue about the scope of a disclosure
request by Second Sight which POL considered should be clarified. In her update on 27
February 2015, Ms Crowe stated that she had asked Second Sight to identify the
questions that Second Sight were attempting to answer by reference to these emails.
Second Sight said that they were relevant to whether there was a test area in Bracknell in
2008 in which there was access to live data. Ms Vennells states in her second witness
statement that she was aware that Second Sight had requested further documentation in
relation to Bracknell in 2013, but she was not aware that this remained a live unresolved
issue in 2015: PV WS2 930 (WITN01020200). Ms Vennells submits that this appeared
to be an operational issue in which POL had questioned the scope of the request as

opposed to the principle of the request.
POL’s decision not to mediate criminal cases

267. On 10 March 2015, POL announced that it would agree to mediate all cases remaining
in the Mediation Scheme except for cases where the applicant had been the subject of a
court ruling (POL00387092). This decision was taken after serious deliberation and on

the basis of legal advice:

a. At paragraphs 5.54-5.55 of their March 2014 advice (POL00006354) Linklaters
discussed settlement with Mediation Scheme applicants who had criminal
convictions. They advised that “the only basis as a matter of law on which the Post
Office should entertain a claim for the repayment of sums claimed from the SPMR
is if it were to conclude that there were doubts about the evidence on which the

conviction was based”.

122
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

The approach to the investigation of cases where the applicant had been convicted
was discussed at the Sparrow Sub-Committee meeting on 9 April 2014
(POL00006565). The minutes state that POL did not anticipate mediation being
appropriate for cases which have gone through either the criminal or civil courts.

These cases accounted for approximately a third of the caseload.

Ata meeting on 17 November 2014, Mr Letwin MP proposed to POL that it should
apply a presumption that it would mediate all cases in which Second Sight had
recommended mediation: PV WS1 {1082 (WITN01020100). A speaking note
prepared by Mr Lambert to assist Ms Vennells in explaining the proposal to Ms
Perkins (POL00116824) pointed out that “’Pre-agreeing’ [to mediation] would
also force us to mediate in criminal cases where the legal processes have not been

exhausted. We have strong legal advice suggesting we should not take this course.”

On 11 February 2015, Ms MacLeod and Mr Day prepared a paper for the Sparrow
Sub-Committee on POL’s options in relation to the Mediation Scheme
(POL00102152). They recommended a fundamental change whereby POL would
adopt a presumption of mediation in all non-criminal cases. They proposed in

paragraph 3 that POL should:

“. Adopt a presumption that Post Office will mediate all non-criminal cases
currently in the Scheme.

- Make clear that we do not intend to mediate criminal cases, except to the extent

there are areas in a case which do not relate to those which led to conviction.
(Thus far we have seen no cases where the applicant has a criminal conviction
where mediation has been considered appropriate). However, should we receive
advice that it is safe to do so, we would also offer "structured discussion" to
applicants with criminal convictions, the purpose of which would be to explain
to the applicant.

- Release Second Sight from their engagement with Post Office, but make clear
that Post Office will meet its commitment to any applicant wishing to avail
themselves of a review by Second Sight of their case by providing the necessary
funding to do so on an individual case by case basis.

- Continue to engage with Second Sight pro tem on issues relating to individual
cases: including issues such as suspense accounts where they relate directly to
individual cases.”

123
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

e. Paragraph 3.7 of the paper stated that Ms MacLeod and Mr Day had ruled out
mediating all cases including criminal cases “on the basis of very strong legal
advice that this would expose POL to untenable risks in relation to convictions: we
could also be accused of bad faith as mediation cannot by its nature overturn
convictions.” Ms Vennells was not in a position to gainsay this advice. Further it
was her understanding that criminal cases would still be reviewed at the request of

the applicant, even if they did not go forward to mediation.

ia The Sparrow Sub-Committee met on 18 February 2015 (POL00006574). It agreed
that the criminal cases in the Mediation Scheme should not be put forward to
mediation. The Committee agreed that if all non-criminal cases went to mediation
there would be no future role for the Working Group which would therefore be
dissolved. Second Sight would continue to work with POL but only in reviewing
cases where the applicant wished them to do so. The Board was provided with a
copy of Ms MacLeod and Mr Day’s paper on 2 March 2015 (UKGI00003467) and
approved the Sparrow Sub-Committee’s recommendation by email on 3 March

2015 (UKGI00003501); (UKGI00003467).

g. On 10 March 2015, POL terminated its arrangements with Second Sight, save that
POL would fund Second Sight to produce CRRs for those applicants who requested
them, and that Second Sight was asked to continue work on a final thematic report

during the notice period (POL00000219).

268. The Mediation Scheme was not a sham. From Ms Vennells’ perspective the Mediation
Scheme was a good faith attempt to resolve the issues between POL and the SPMs and
large amounts of money and effort were invested to achieve that objective. Ms Vennells
acted at the time in reliance on the legal advice she received and the opinions of those
closest to the investigation about what the investigation had revealed about Horizon and

the merits of the claims.

Beds And Remote Access During The Mediation Scheme

269. Ms Vennells was not made aware of any BEDs in Horizon during the Mediation Scheme.
There were two incidents in relation to remote access. The first was the Deloitte

assurance work in 2014 (addressed above). The second occurred when Ms Vennells was

124
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

preparing to give live evidence to the BEIS Select Committee, scheduled for 3 February
2015.

270. On 30 January 2015, Ms Vennells sent the following email to Mr Davies and Ms Sewell
(POL00029812):

“1) “is it possible to access the system remotely? We are told it is." What is the
true answer? I hope it is that we know this is not possible and that we are able to
explain why that is. I need to say no it is not possible and that we are sure of this
because of xxx and that we know this because we have had the system assured.
2) "you have said this is such a vital system to the Post Office, what testing do
you do and how often? When was the last time?

Lesley, I need the facts on these- I know we have discussed before but I haven't
got the answer front of mind - too many facts to hold in my head! But this is an
important one and I want to be sure I do have it. And then Mark, to phrase the
facts into answers, plus a line to take the conversation back up a level - ie., to
one of our narrative boxes/rocks.”

271. The questions put to Ms Vennells about the email in her oral evidence focussed on the
phrase “I need to say no it is not possible...”: 22 May 2024 181:9-183:16
(INQ00001151). However, read as a whole, the email is a request for correct factual
information, as opposed to a convenient or agreed answer. In the first paragraph, Ms
Vennells asked, “what is the true answer?” and in the second, she made an explicit request

for “the facts”.

272. This is how Fraser J interpreted the email in the Horizon Issues Judgment
(UKGI00025444). He stated at paragraph 521 that: “Ms Vennells obviously needed to
know whether the answer matched her understanding, which was — as she put it, both ‘I
hope’ and ‘I need’ -- that it was not possible to access the system remotely.” He returned

to the email in paragraphs 524 and 525:

524. .... The question from Ms Vennells was very straightforward. It was as
follows, using her words, and separating out each clause of the enquiry:

1. “Is it possible to access the system remotely? We are told it is.”

2. “What is the true answer?”

125
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

525. Both of these are really very simple questions. Question I. means can it be
done, because Ms Vennells is being told it can be done. Question 2, “what is the
true answer?” means she is seeking the true answer to question 1. This is not
complicated, either in linguistic, computing or even business terms, nor is it
difficult to understand. She then expressed her aspirations in terms of what the
true answer might be. “I hope it is that we know this is not possible and that we
are able to explain why that is. I need to say no it is not possible.” (emphasis
added)”

273. Ms Vennells does not recall any oral briefing in response to her questions, and there is
no evidence that she received one: PV WS1 $1304 (WITN01020100). On 2 February
2015 at 17:54, Ms Vennells received an email from Ms Hill (POL00117096) attaching
an addendum to her briefing pack (POL00117097). The section on remote access in the
addendum appears to derive in large part from an email from Mr Lenihan to Ms Corfield
and Mr Underwood on 30 January 2015 in which he set out bullet point answers prepared
by James Davidson (POL00029812). Ms Vennells was not sent the email chain at
(POL00029812) and therefore did not see the technical details discussed by Mr
Underwood, Mr Davidson, and Mr Lenihan. Ms Vennells agreed that it is very likely that
she read the addendum, though she cannot recall doing so. However, she could not say

how much she took in: 22 May 2024 189:10-189:15 (INQ00001151).

274. Reading the document cold, without the benefit of hindsight, it is understandable why it
did not cause Ms Vennells to revise her belief that there was no functionality in Horizon
for either POL or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data once it had been
recorded in a branch’s accounts: PV WS2 §27 (WITN01020200). This very assertion
appears in the first set of bullet points under the heading “Remote tampering”. While the
structure of the document is unattractive, as Ms Vennells acknowledged, it is not obvious
that the assertion about the lack of functionality was, on the face of the document, an
untruth which was contradicted by the section on Balancing Transactions. Another
reading of the document is that the sections were intended to be consistent with each
other: therefore, the Balancing Transaction procedure should be understood as not
involving the editing, manipulation, or removal of branch data once it had been recorded
ina branch’s accounts. Ultimately, this was a technical issue which Ms Vennells was not
equipped to understand without expert assistance. She was given very little assistance by
this note. Ms Vennells submits that it does not establish that she knew that it was incorrect

that POL and Fujitsu lacked the ability to edit, manipulate, or remove transaction data.

126
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

The Parker Review

275. Ms Vennells was asked very few questions by CTI or core participants in respect of the
independent review commissioned in 2015 by Tim Parker in respect of Sparrow and
Horizon (the “Parker Review” or “Jonathan Swift QC’s report”). Her involvement in the
Review was minimal. This is because Mr Parker had agreed with Baroness Neville Rolfe
that he would look afresh at the way in which Sparrow and Horizon had been dealt with
by POL.

276. Mr Parker deliberately kept Ms Vennells out of the loop, ensuring that the Review was
independent from those who had been involved in Sparrow / Horizon at POL. She was
not copied into correspondence instructing Jonathan Swift QC and Christopher Knight,
nor consulted on the terms of the instructions. That is not a surprise, given that the
Chairman had undertaken to take a fresh look at the Post Office’s handling of the
Horizon-related complaints as a newcomer to the business“ and was an independent non-
executive chairman® conducting the review independently.© Ms Vennells did not see
the final review document at the time,” but was sent an email by Jane MacLeod
summarising counsel’s recommendations.’! She then addressed the Board on 22 January
2016”, based on the limited information she had as to what the recommendations were

likely to be, shortly before the Parker Review was finalised.”

The GLO Proceedings

277. In April 2016, Ms Vennells became aware that proceedings which would be pursued

under a Group Litigation Order had been issued against POL in the High Court (“GLO

Proceedings”)”* on 11 April 2016. The first substantive briefings given to Ms Vennells

regarding the GLO Proceedings were two papers prepared by Ms MacLeod and Mr

Williams”> for the May 2016 Group Executive and Board meetings respectively, the letter

of claim having been received by POL on 28 April.”

278. Strategic legal questions were identified immediately by Ms MacLeod and Mr Williams,
including whether POL should agree to the Claimants’ proposal of a GLO. As an
example, the advice contained in the briefing papers was that it was not possible for POL
to wait to see the pleadings before taking a position on this issue.’” Nothing in the paper
sought a decision from the Board on this question, nor on any matters. The Group

Executive was asked to endorse the “Claim Management proposal” .”*

279. On21 May 2016, Ms Vennells emailed Ms MacLeod and Mr Bourke with six numbered
questions arising from the papers.”” Ms Vennells recognised that some of these questions
built on “the GE discussions” but she wished to “have the answers documented”. Ms
Vennells carried out the role required of her through this correspondence: she sought to
establish that POL would “handle it well” and gave her staff her vote of confidence in
their ability to do so, whilst probing and digging to ensure that POL would “put on your
blackest hats and think through the worst outcomes”. Ms MacLeod responded with
written answers to the questions and an assurance that she would be in a position to
address the Board on these points at the next meeting on the following day. Ms MacLeod

did so.*°

280. Specifically, Ms Vennells asked Ms MacLeod about who it was proposed would handle
this litigation on behalf of POL:

2) who/what is our internal resource/governance?

The PO legal team (Rod Williams) and myself will work with BD. As set out in
the GE board paper, and as discussed and approved at the GE meeting on 13
May, Tom Moran will be the internal 'client' for these purposes and his role will
be to ensure that the overall strategy of the litigation protects PO, its network
and attractiveness to future agents/postmasters. Both in this and in the
management of the litigation, he will be supported by a Steering Group which
will comprise representatives from across the business. At GE we discussed the

following as proposed members: Tom Wechsler (representing you), Angela van

as well as Rod, myself, representatives from BD and when necessary, Tony
Robinson QC. Key/strategic decisions will be discussed at GE.

281. From the outset of the GLO Proceedings, Ms Vennells conducted her role in an
appropriate way. The Inquiry’s experts state that a CEO is accountable to the Board for
“running the Company, providing operational leadership, management and oversight of
all functions, departments and delegations” and “creating an organisation structure...
which is fit for purpose for the business, reflecting strategy, priorities and risks, so that
appropriate operational oversight and direct management is secured and maintained”
notwithstanding “ultimate Executive accountability resting with the CEO”.§! By
satisfying herself that POL had a team with appropriate experience and expertise taking
responsibility for the GLO Proceedings, with the facility for her to have input directly
through the Group Executive and indirectly through Tom Wechsler on the Steering
Group, Ms Vennells fulfilled the expectations which the Inquiry’s experts consider a

CEO should meet, at §2.2.31(b) and (c).

282. Itis not the role of the CEO to make every decision, however consequential, nor to know

the details of every decision which she has delegated. That would be unworkable.

283. Through the exchange with Ms MacLeod on 21 May 2016, Ms Vennells set her
expectations for POL’s handling of the GLO Proceedings, and tasked specific work to be
carried out which she considered would assist Ms MacLeod and her colleagues in making

appropriate decisions as the litigation progressed. That is the role of the CEO.

Management and oversight of the GLO.

284. As the Inquiry has heard, Ms Vennells had no prior experience of leading a company
which was the subject of serious or group litigation.*? That itself cannot be a failing; few
CEOs would have such experience. However, she had the benefit of what she understood
to be an experienced GC, a respected firm of solicitors and a team of highly qualified

specialist commercial barristers.

285. The only criticism which was put to Ms Vennells in oral questions directly about her
involvement in the GLO Proceedings was that she “set the tone” for POL’s approach to
the litigation.** Ms Vennells was not asked whether, for example, she accepted specific
criticisms of her decision-making or her management and oversight of the GLO. In

response to that one question Ms Vennells said (emphases added):

Q. 2017. The Post Office set about its strategy of fighting tooth and claw for its
own reputational interests over those claimants at the High Court, and adopted
this strategy, as the High Court judge identified. That happened under your
leadership, Ms Vennells: all of this did. You set the tone, didn’t you, Ms
Vennells, and the tone was “Let’s eliminate them. Let’s get rid of these bugs in
the system, the subpostmasters.” That’s what you set in place, wasn’t it, Ms
Vennells?”

A. Is that a question, because I'd like to answer it, if it was.

Q. Yes, the “wasn’t it, Ms Vennells” was the question, I think you may have
noticed.

A. I did not set a culture like that. I did not lead the litigation. I remember
reading this — well, actually, I don’t know if I saw this particular document
because I was not personally involved in the litigation steering committee.
There was a Board subcommittee of which I was one member. I had two
conversations with Jane MacLeod, and I’m disappointed — I don’t know the
reason and I’m making no other point then — I’m disappointed that she can’t
come and give evidence to the Inquiry because I think it is important that the
Inquiry understand more around the approach to the Group Litigation.

But I had two conversations with Jane that I remember clearly. They weren't
documented because a lot of the -- the way that you work as a Chief Executive
is you have conversations as you're going between meetings and things but,
specifically, I sat down with Jane twice on this to say that I was very
uncomfortable that the Post Office was going through this. The Post Office
didn't call the Group Litigation. It was set in place by the postmasters — and
I understand why and I'm very pleased that it was, so that we've got to
where we are today -- but it wasn't a policy that I put in place, and the
questions I asked of Jane on those two occasions were, "This feels
completely wrong to me, what can we do? We should not be in the process
where we are fighting in court with subpostmasters".

S24 May 2024 89:5 — 91:2 (INQ00001153)

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

And her first response, when I asked her the first time was that -- I think it was
that we hadn't got enough information at this stage but it was very likely that we
would try to settle. And the second time that I asked her, her view was -- and the
view of the leading counsel that we took -- that, actually, the only way to solve
this was to take it through.

So I regret hugely the Group Litigation and I've seen all of the paperwork
behind it and, in view of the judgments that were taken and where we are today,
it is unacceptable reading.

286. That response is set out in full in this Closing Statement because it describes Ms
Vennells’ position in her own words and with accuracy: Ms Vennells may have been the
leader of the organisation, but there is a material distinction between that and stating that

Ms Vennells led the organisation’s litigation.

287. Ms Vennells’ approach to the GLO Proceedings, her personal perspective and that which
she sought to instil in her staff are reflected in an email she sent to Ms MacLeod and Mr
Houghton (copied to Mr Davies, Mr Williams and Mr Cameron) on 14 February 2019 as
the Common Issues Trial approached.“ This email was sent in response to Ms MacLeod
arranging for Mr Rob Houghton, the CIO, to meet with the counsel team acting for POL
“to assist with the strategic positioning”’, particularly in respect of the Claimants’ expert

evidence. Ms Vennells described a conversation with Mr Houghton:

“T said to Rob earlier this week, whilst he can’t (and mustn’t) steer the legal
strategy, he should understand and be comfortable with the approach being taken
and feel that he has had the opportunity to feed in any thoughts or challenges.
That may or may not be welcome news to our legal advisers but it’s important
in two respects: managing internal board confidence and secondly, because he
knows what he’s talking about.

“The board have great confidence in both of you: we have to know that you have
worked well together and that we have had the opportunity to incorporate Rob’s
views into the process. If you disagree that is fine, and the final call must be
legal.”

288. This email is evidence of Ms Vennells:

* (POL00111672)
131
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

a. Encouraging a subject matter expert in POL to be open and frank with his views,
whatever they might be;

b. — Recognising the value in challenging and testing the legal advisers’ decisions;

c. Appreciating that the board should have confidence in the decisions being taken,
but that the board could not have that confidence without the knowledge that

decisions are being tested properly; and

d. Reflecting the reality that key decisions in the litigation would be taken by POL’s

legal team, and particularly its General Counsel.

289. The division of roles between Ms Vennells as CEO and Ms MacLeod as General Counsel
in practice is visible in the way that the Board was typically briefed in respect of the GLO
Proceedings. For example, Ms Vennells’ CEO Report for the 26 September 2017 Board
Meeting contains the following on the GLO Proceedings (emphasis added):**

Postmaster Litigation

On 19 October there will be a Case Management conference (CMC). At this
Court hearing, a Judge will decide on the strategic direction of the Group
Litigation for the next 6-24 months following representations from both parties.
We will provide an update on the implications at the Board.

290. The minutes of that meeting, which Ms Vennells attended, at POLB 17/68 include a

“Litigation Update” in these terms (emphasis added):

(a) The Board received a verbal update on the Postmaster Litigation from the
General Counsel, noting that the Case Management Conference would be
held on 19 October, and the outcome of the CMC would be directions given
by the Court as to the conduct of the case over the next 12-18 months. There
were key strategic issues to be decided as to the Post Office’s preferences
for the sequence in which legal arguments were to be addressed, and the Post
Office had receive legal advice as to the preferred sequence.

(b) The Board discussed the advice and its implications, and approved the
proposed strategy.

SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

291. This is an example of the typical way in which the Board received updates on the GLO
Proceedings and received legal advice for consideration. Although it was for Ms Vennells
to provide oversight of the GLO Proceedings, as with any of the business’s key activities,
it was not for Ms Vennells to give legal advice to the Board. It would also have been
unrealistic, and inefficient, for Ms Vennells to seek to have the same level of knowledge

of the proceedings as her General Counsel.

292. Ms Vennells did not see the Defence and Counterclaim in the generic proceedings before
they were filed on 18 July 2017* and did not approve the documents.*” These were the
delegated responsibility of the Steering Group, made up of subject matter experts ** who
had access to external advice from experienced lawyers and could raise factual questions
with Deloitte and Fujitsu as they considered appropriate.*? Ms Vennells attended a
conference with leading counsel on 29 September 2017, and took the opportunity to
ensure that she understood the pleadings.” Again, Ms Vennells delegated responsibility
across the business in a realistic and appropriate way, whilst ensuring that she maintained
an understanding of the GLO Proceedings. These actions are consistent with the Inquiry’s
Experts’ expectation that a CEO will engage in “Active management and reporting of

the corporate risk register, in light of changing circumstances.””!

293. During the course of the GLO Proceedings, Ms Vennells began and completed her exit

from the business.

294. Ms Vennells was not part of the Steering Group but had a representative, Tom Wechsler.
Ms Vennells was satisfied that the members of the steering group were the “right group
of people to manage the litigation” °? However, Ms Vennells recognised that she had an

important role to play in key decisions. For example, Ms Vennells spoke directly with

David Cavender KC about the “tone” of POL’s case ahead of the Common Issues trial”*

and ensured that the Board was briefed on the proceedings by the external legal team the

week before proceedings commenced.” Matters such as the “tone” of POL’s voice were

matters on which Ms Vennells, as a non-lawyer, could add value and where she
appropriately involved herself in the detail of decisions being taken. A CEO could not be
expected to add such value in relation to questions of law on which, quite properly, the

GC took the lead with Ms Vennells and the Board receiving appropriate briefings.

295. When Ms MacLeod was not available, Bond Dickinson and its instructed counsel
continued to run the proceedings. In advance of the 30 October 2018 Board meeting, Ms
Vennells wrote in an email to Board members “Jn Jane's absence, I have asked David
Cavender QC (lead counsel) and Andy Parsons (lead lawyer from WBD) to come to the
Board and brief us on the strike out judgement, ‘tone of voice’ challenge from the judge,
claimants’ draft CIT opening submission, and if we have time — Horizon trial
preparation.”®> This is an example of the reliance which the Board and Ms Vennells
placed on external lawyers as well as the GC and their team. Bond Dickinson had long
been trusted advisers to POL (see above at §{] 79.i; 79.m; 216; 217; 219; 222; 224; 225;
228; 229; 231; 252; 253; 256; 262).

296. As for Mr Wechsler, she “trusted him to use his judgment about whether any discussions
or decisions by the Steering Group should be brought to [her] attention” °° Ms Vennells
also received regular updates, at one-to-one meetings and ad hoc discussions, with Jane
MacLeod.” Ms MacLeod was the primary channel of communication to Ms Vennells,
which Ms Vennells understood to be because Ms MacLeod was taking careful measures
to ensure that POL’s legal professional privilege was retained throughout these

conversations.

PV’s knowledge of and involvement in disclosure; factual witness statements; and

expert evidence.

297. Ms Vennells played no material role in decisions regarding disclosure, or statements of
factual witnesses and experts, in the GLO Proceedings. She does not recall being asked
to be involved in decisions about disclosure,** and no questions were put to her in oral
evidence on this topic. Ms MacLeod, as General Counsel, took the view, set out in her

witness statement for this Inquiry, that in respect of whether or not to call somebody like

SUBS0000071

Mr Jenkins as a witness “my expectation was that this would have been decided by the
legal team”.” The Inquiry may, in fact, have been surprised if it had heard evidence that
Ms Vennells had personally made decisions regarding disclosure and witness evidence.
That is far from the role of the CEO.

Recusal application

298. Ms Vennells was aware that Lords Grabiner and Neuberger “were very strong that the

1 in respect of an application that the Judge should

Post Office had a very good case”
recuse himself, and in respect of the appeal. Lord Grabiner went as far as to say that there
was a “duty” on POL to seek recusal and that it was “essential”.!°! Ms Vennells was not

one of the members of staff at POL who took the decision to make the recusal application .

299. She considered that it was an extraordinarily difficult decision and candidly recognised
in her oral evidence that although she had not been involved in the conversation, she
would probably have arrived at the same conclusion as they did if she had been.” There
was clear legal advice from two exceptionally experienced lawyers (one with the full
gamut of judicial experience) that the recusal application ought to be made. These were
lawyers whom Ms MacLeod recognised and relied upon as “highly experienced litigators
and whose advice [she] trusted”. Ms Macleod does “not recall any instances where [she]

went against the legal advice” received from external lawyers as expert advisers.'°°

Post-Conviction Disclosure

300. In the Chair’s statement relating to Written Closing Submissions, he invited Core
Participants to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with his provisional view that
prosecutors were obliged to comply with the duty of disclosure as described in R (on the
application of Nunn) v Chief Constable of Suffolk Constabulary and another [2014]
UKSC 37 (‘Nunn’) from 1 January 2000 at the latest, despite the judgment in Nunn
articulating the duty in 2014..

SUBS0000071

301. Ms Vennells’ legal team agrees that the common law duties of disclosure, post-
conviction, as set out in Nunn, were in existence as of I January 2000. It is agreed that
prosecutors ought to have known of the existence of the duty during the period of time
under consideration by the Inquiry. Whether in fact they did know is a matter of fact for
the Chair.

302. Ms Vennells was not aware of the existence or scope of that duty, nor the manner in
which it should have been exercised. POL legal and external lawyers were responsible
for the discharge of that duty. Ms Vennells does not advance submissions as to whether
the advice (or substance of the advice) of Mr Simon Clarke dated 15 July 2013 should

have been disclosed to some or all of those convicted on the basis of Horizon data.
Culture

303. There are numerous documents which show that Ms Vennells was not complacent about
the need for cultural change at POL and to improve the support that POL gave to SPMs,
both before and after the publication of the SSIR. At the first Board meeting after the
publication of the SSIR, on 17 July 2013, Ms Vennells stated that the SSIR had identified
“cultural issues which had to be addressed to improve the support we gave to sub-
postmasters. The CEO stressed that this was now a catalyst to make changes in the
Business” (POL00021516). Ms Vennells’ personal objectives for 2013/2014
(POL00158097) included “in light of the Second Sight report and associated insights,
ensuring the culture and structure of our network intervention teams are re- orientated

around the needs of sub-postmasters and other agents..."

304. Ms Vennells initiated two significant initiatives to implement these changes. The first
was the Branch User Forum, which was established in 2013 to provide a structure through
which SPMs could raise concerns and ideas directly with POL management. The second
was the Branch Support Programme, and subsequently, the Business Improvement
Programme. It is not correct that Ms Vennells was dismissive of SPMs’ concerns. As can
be seen from the Board meeting on 17 July 2013, it was the explicit purpose of these
programmes to listen to and respond to the concerns reported in the SSIR. This approach
continued into the Mediation Scheme. (POL00213728) is an agenda item dated 11
December 2014 for a meeting of the team working on the Business Improvement

Programme. The objectives of the discussion were to ensure that POL had considered

136
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

and, where appropriate, put in place policy and process improvements in response to the

thematic issues identified by Second Sight and the individual SPM cases.

305. Ms Vennells accepted in her evidence that she was given information which was
incorrect and which CTI described as POL “folklore”. She was asked what it says about
an organisation that “folklore” was allowed to develop and perpetuate without anyone
checking the real facts. Ms Vennells stated that this was valid in hindsight but, at the
time, “I believed that I was getting information from the people who were employed to
give me the best advice because of their expertise. I didn't believe that any of it is
statements were folklore at all”: 22 May 2024: 153:11-154:25 (INQ00001151). This is
fundamental to Ms Vennells’ position at the time. The individuals who reported to her
had subject matter expertise in law, IT, and the detail of POL’s operations. She was
entitled to rely on them to provide her with correct information and their honest
professional opinions. There was no reason for her to disbelieve them. Ms Vennells acted
in good faith on what she was told. Based on what she was told, she understood that there
were cultural issues to address and process improvements to be made. The information
that she was given, and relied on, about the integrity of Horizon and the safety of past
prosecutions was incorrect, as the evidence before the Inquiry has shown. However, Ms
Vennells’ personal commitment to dealing with the issues that she understood had

emerged from the SSIR and the Mediation Scheme is evident from the documents.

Conclusion

306. Ms Vennells cannot, and does not, try to hide from the fact that whilst CEO she did not
manage to uncover the truth about the extent of the bugs, errors and defects in Horizon
as found by Fraser J. This is a matter of deep and constant personal regret to Ms Vennells,

as is the fact that the convictions of the SPMs were not overturned sooner.

307. Despite Ms Vennells repeatedly attempting to resolve concerns of the SPMs during her
leadership, she simply did not get the information which she ought to have been given
by her senior team, whom she trusted and to whom she delegated responsible roles. Ms
Vennells does not know why key information was not passed on to her. She believed her
senior team and GCs to be working hard and doing their best to investigate the SPMs’

complaints in good faith. She had faith in them and, as far as she was concerned, had

137
SUBS0000071
SUBS0000071

good working relationships with them. She is devastated by the fact that information was
not shared with her. She has no desire to point the finger at others, nor to speculate as to
why information was not shared. She trusts that the Chair and Panel will establish the

true extent of the information that was not shared and, perhaps, why it was not shared.

308. Notwithstanding that the evidence phase of this Inquiry has concluded, Ms Vennells will

continue to assist the Chair’s investigation in any way she can.
