For internal use

1 Introduction

The Branch Counter Refresh Project will update the existing Horizon counter application (HNG-X)
so that it can run on a modern PC running Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry Edition. This update
will be called Horizon Anywhere (HNG-A). Further details of the project can be found in section 2.

1.1 Document Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to define the overall test approach and govern how
testing will be managed for the Branch Counter Refresh Project. To ensure the primary purpose
is achieved this Test Strategy will:

Describe the test standards and principles that form the basis of the strategy

Provide a high level view of the project scope.

Outline what will be tested

Identify the stages and types of testing to be undertaken

Define the methods and processes of each test stage or type.

Outline test governance, including definition of the roles and responsibilities required to
undertake testing.

Describe the test environments and any tools required to support testing.

This is a living document and will be updated/reissued should it be required as the project
progresses.

1.2 Scope of the Document

The Test Strategy will influence supplier test plans and form the basis of the Atos-led test stages
(i.e. Systems Integration and User Acceptance Testing).

1.3 Test Standards

Test documentation will adhere to the IEEE 829 Software Test Documentation Standard.

It is expected that supplier test documentation will adhere to the supplier's documentation
standards.

1.3.1 The V Model
The testing approach being adopted is based on the industry-standard V model, in which:

« Each stage of the project delivery life-cycle has a corresponding test stage.
« Each test stage is split into
© preparation
o Designing and building tests and establishing the test environment
o Execution (e.g. running tests, identifying and resolving incidents) activities.
« The preparation activities for a given test stage are dependent on the overall test design
activity being complete rather than any specific preceding stage.
* The execution activities for a given test stage can start once the execution activities for the
preceding test stage have been completed. E.g. Quality gates for exit and entry criteria of
a test stage have been met.
« Entry and Exit criteria for all test stages will be documented and agreed.

« The progression from one test stage to another is controlled by means of a gate
review/sign-off. This is a formal review point which decides if the status of current stage is
sufficient to allow the project to proceed to the next testing stage.

« Each test stage has its own test plan and test specification/scripts. Where appropriate test
scenarios/scripts will be re-used from previous test stages.

The V model of testing is founded on the following principles:

« The earlier that faults are found, the cheaper they are to resolve, and so testing will focus
on finding the most significant faults at the earliest opportunity.
« Each test stage should have a clear basis:
o Unit tests are prepared from the detailed design/technical specification
o Systems Integration and User Acceptance Testing will be based on project
requirements
« Each test stage is controlled by a nominated person, the Test Manager.
« Risk-based decisions on the scope and depth of testing should be made by the Project.
Manager and the relevant stakeholders, based on the project’s objectives and the trade-
offs between timescale, cost and quality.

1.3.2 Test Principles

The following key principles will be adhered to throughout the testing stages:

« Collaborative Working - The Atos / POL / Fujitsu / Computacenter / Verizon project
team will work collaboratively with all incumbent suppliers throughout the project
lifecycle. During testing the project test team will work closely:

o Planned test scope for non-POL led test stages to ensure coverage is sufficient

o Validate supplier test results against pre-defined acceptance criteria

« Drive out duplication between test stages - This approach will ensure that all
participants have a full understanding of the purpose and objective each of the stages
and the test cases to be executed within them. This will also enable any gaps to be
identified early. Through reviewing test results and performing witness testing this will
reduce the risk of successfully completed tests from being repeated unnecessarily in later
stages.

« Risk-Based Prioritisation - A risk based approach should be utilised to ensure all
stakeholders understand the relative risk associated to each requirement/function.
Testing will be prioritised on this basis. Areas which are deemed the greatest risk from a
business and technical perspective will be given the highest priority.

« Test to verify requirements and test to mitigate risks as early as practicable

« Timely preparation for testing

« Capture and feedback lessons learned to benefit future testing

2 Project Scope

The current Horizon architecture is a thick-client application supported by a large datacentre
infrastructure. Over the last 15 years, several Point Of Sale systems have been integrated into
branch estate, utilising common branch communications and shared interfaces into back-end
systems. As a result the current branch estate is a complex network of infrastructure and
systems provided by several suppliers, as described in the simplified scope diagram below:

The Horizon POS application and the Counter PC that supports the application are provided by
Fujitsu Services. The Horizon application was refreshed in 2009 to the HNG-X variant. However,
the Counter PC is a Pentium II PC that has been in use since the original Horizon application was
rolled out in 1998. The Counter PC is approaching the end of its operational lifespan, and a
marked decrease in the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) has been noted. The Counter PC
also has a number of peripherals attached, including a PIN Pad, barcode scanner, tally roll printer
and weighscales. Some of these peripherals will be refreshed as part of the overall Branch
Counter Refresh whilst others will be retained, with attention being paid to the legacy RS232
connectors.

The Post Office is undertaking an IT transformation to a ‘tower’ based model of infrastructure,
applications and network provision. As part of this transformation, any Counter PC replacement
will be provided by the End User Computing (EUC) tower provider, Computacenter. To facilitate
this transition, Fujitsu have been tasked to modify the HNG-X application to ensure that it runs
on a modern PC and operating system, within a current and supportable run-time environment.
The modified application has been labelled Horizon Anywhere (or HNG-A). The branch network
facilities currently provided by Fujitsu will be transferred to a Network tower service provider,
Verizon. Verizon will be providing Network services going forward and will replace the in-branch
Sarian router with a Cisco router connecting to the Verizon central network, and then onwards
into the Fujitsu data centre. Eventually, the data centre elements will be transitioned to the Front
Office tower provider.

The Branch Counter Refresh Project is responsible for the development, testing and deployment
of the revised Fujitsu HNG-A application onto modern counter PC's, provided by Computacenter,
with networking provided by Verizon. Computacenter will also be responsible for replacing a
number of the counter peripherals (e.g. barcode scanner and Keyboard/Magnetic card reader).
Verizon will be responsible for replacing existing branch routers and switches.

The revised HNG-A application will share the same code base as HNG-X and the agents and data
centre transactional elements remain unchanged. To ease rollout and establish a common
baseline, HNG-X will be deployed at R13.05 across the estate so that HNG-A R13.05 can rollover
a branch and the branch will remain consistent on R13.05 of HNG.

4 Test Approach

With varying degrees of change occurring across multiple systems, each party will be responsible
for testing their own components. The test approach will be to test each component in isolation
followed by a stage of systems integration testing. Once integration of the HNG-A application
onto the Computacenter provided PC has been fundamentally proven, further stages of testing
will be undertaken to verify System Integration, perform external accreditation and conduct
UAT.

Replacing the legacy counter PC with a modern PC running HNG-A software could be seen as a
straightforward ‘lift-and-shift’ swapout. Component Integration testing between the
Computacenter PC and the various counter peripherals will be required, as will testing of systems
management and software deployment processes. However, the diagram in [Figure 2- Current
Horizon System] shows that there is also a complex network of branch, data centre and client
services that will also require regression testing to ensure that there is no degradation to the
overall Post Office service.

It is proposed that a number of test workstreams are put in place to ensure the initial transition
to HNG-A running on Computacenter-provided equipment, using both Fujitsu and Verizon for
branch connectivity. The following table summarises these workstreams with more detail
relating to each workstream provided in subsequent sections.

The following sections provide more detail on each test stage.

4.1

HNG-A Component Integration Testing

4.1.1 Purpose

Fujitsu will develop the HNG-A application along with several supporting packages to be installed
on the Computacenter-provided PC. Software developed for the HNG-A platform will be tested
initially within CIT using automated regression test facilities. Development will be responsible for
managing the packages that cover the core components required on the Horizon counter.
Initially the following packages will be provided:

CBA - the main Counter Business Application which will be updated to:
o Support new peripherals
o Relocate the install program and data to better match a typical windows program
o Runasaco-resident application that can share system resources with other
applications
o Format the screen to support larger screen sizes, resolutions and different aspect
ratios
o Introduce a start “splash box display” whilst the application is loading (rather
than a DOS script window)
JRE - a dedicated Java Runtime Environment used exclusively to run the CBA
WSPOS - a component on the counter which provides access to the pin pad. This will be
updated to allow access to the HNG-A CBA.
CNIM - a component on the counter that monitors network connectivity and provides
status to the CBA. Will be updated to distinguish between HNG-A and HNG-X and will only
provide QoS data to the HNG-X application.
CHS - Help file web service running on the Horizon Business Service (HBS)
Netcool - updated Tivoli agent package to continue to extract data from Windows logs to
help support and populate audit system for prosecution support
Cygwin - secure shell for command line support of the application

Fujitsu will undertake component testing to ensure each package functions as expected.

Atos to provide assurance of Fujitsu development testing via test plan/report review.

4.1.3 Process

Fujitsu development resources will undertake largely automated testing on HNG-A components
installed on representative equipment that may be standalone and not integrated with
Computacenter to functionally test HNG-A.

Tests will be documented in a series of Component Test Plans.
Any defects discovered will be raised in development defect tools such as Jira and / or Peak.

The outcome of testing, along with any defects to be transferred to later test stages, will be
documented in a series of Component Test Reports.

Atos will provide assurance of Test Plans and Reports issued.
4.1.4 Outputs

« HNG-A Application deliverable, in an MSI package, with associated Release Notes
describing installation and regression instructions.

« Proven hardware peripherals

« Underlying systems management services E.g. Alerting, eventing, auditing, archiving,

« Component Test Plans and Reports

4.1.5 Test Environment

The current CIT environment is a small scale replication of the live environment, with just enough
data centre components to allow a development testing of the counter component. The counter
and data centre elements of the CIT environment are located within Fujitsu Services site in
Bracknell.

Counter testing will use Computacenter provided equipment, but it is recognised that the build
may not be representative of live, e.g. not locked down into Kiosk mode. This is also referred to
as a Type A build.

There is no requirement for Fujitsu to Computacenter connectivity to support HNG-A CIT.
4.1.6 Test Data

Specific test data requirements will be documented within the Component Test Plans.

4.1.7 Responsibilities

Fujitsu development resources will be responsible for completing component testing, and will
produce Test Plans and Reports for each Component.

Atos will provide assurance of Test Plans and Reports issued.

4.2 System Testing
4.2.1 HNG-A System Testing
- Purpose

Fujitsu are expected to conduct system testing of their solution, covering functional and non-
functional aspects of HNG-A operation. Fujitsu have historically called this phase of testing
Solution Validation and Integration (SV&I) Testing.

Following a series of discovery workshops held between Atos, Fujitsu and Computacenter, a
number of gaps were identified between the HNG-A solution Fujitsu were committed to, and the
full solution required to support cross tower operation. These gaps were documented within a
Gap Analysis paper [4]. To address the gaps, Fujitsu split their development into two software
releases:
« Release 13.00 - the base release of HNG-A, demonstrating application functionality on
representative branch equipment, utilising the existing Fujitsu Branch Network
e Release 13.05 - modifications to the base release to allow HNG-A to be deployed onto.
target Computacenter terminals, and allow appropriate support for underlying Fujitsu
and Computacenter systems management software. To also enable the transition of
branch network from Fujitsu to Verizon

Release 13.00 System testing covered the following areas:
« Reference data download from the Horizon data centre:
o via the BRDB delivery mechanism for the HNG-A Counter
o MID/TID allocation for Merchant Acquirer services.
o To the CHS service running on HBS for Help file data content
« CBA operation:
o Validation of Engineer functions (i.e. Computacenter provided peripheral
calibration via the HNG-A application)
o User / Branch administration.
o Font resizing to accommodate larger screen display.
o Banking transactions (with no ‘offline indicator’ messages due to lack of CNIM2
service)
o Retail transactions (using new MID/TIDs allocated for HNG-A)
o Asylum Seekers Smart Card transactions (accessing the PIN Pad via an updated
WSPOS component)
« Help pages accessed from new Help file web service (CHS) running on the HBS

Fujitsu also covered regression testing of HNG-X including:
« Retained use of Utimaco VPN Services

Representative (Type A build) Computacenter PC’s from Computacenter (progressing from
Type A for R13.00 to Type C for R13.05)

Representative branch network facilities (provided by Fujitsu and Verizon).

Updates to Horizon Automation Framework to support HNG-A (if required)

- Process

Fujitsu test resources will undertake testing of HNG-A software packages manually installed on
Computacenter provided equipment, using a combination of manual and automated test
execution techniques.

Tests covering R13.00 have been documented in a Horizon Release (R13.00) System Test Plan.

A full regression test of Horizon functionality against both HNG-A and HNG-X applications will be
undertaken through execution of the existing automated regression test suite. A benchmark test
of performance of each application will be completed to prove the assumption within the Design
Proposal [2] that the performance of HNG-A on a new PC within an updated JRE will be
considerably better than the existing HNG-X solution.

A Performance test of the new Help file web service (CHS) will be undertaken.

Any defects discovered will be raised in Fujitsu-hosted defect tools such as Quality Centre and /
or Peak.

The outcome of testing, along with any defects to be transferred to later test stages, will be
documented in a Horizon Release (R13.00) System Test Report.

HNG-A System Test Plan and Report

- Test Environment

The existing Solution, Validation & Integration (SV&I) Test environment will be used to support
HNG-A system testing. This environment is a close match to the production environment in terms
of server availability. It currently has representative resilience provided by multiple instances of
high volume servers and load balancing. The SV&I environment currently has connectivity to a
number of third party systems. A live-like overnight schedule of file processing activities is run on
a daily basis. From a system testing perspective, the counter elements of the SV&I environment
is located within Fujitsu Services site in Bracknell.

It is anticipated that the counter testing will use Computacenter-sourced Windows 8 PC's and
replaced peripherals, however installation of these components may be undertaken manually by
Fujitsu rather than follow onsite engineer process.

At the introduction of R13.05, network connectivity to Computacenter and Verizon will be
required to allow Fujitsu to effectively test their components.

A number of HNG-X counters will be retained to support regression testing and ongoing testing of
HNG-X specific patches.

- Test Data

Specific test data requirements will be documented within the Fujitsu System Test Plan. As a
general principle, no live customer data will be used in testing activities.

- Responsibilities
Computacenter will be responsible for providing component PCs and peripherals.

Fujitsu test support resources will be responsible for installing Computacenter PC’s, peripherals
and Fujitsu software packages, using manual mechanisms if appropriate on the Type A builds.

As testing progresses, Computacenter test support resources will be responsible for installing
Computacenter PC’s, peripherals and Fujitsu software packages, using target mechanisms on the
Type C builds.

Fujitsu test resources will be responsible for completing system testing, and produce a Test Plan
and Test Report for review.

Following a series of discovery workshops held between Atos, Fujitsu and Computacenter, a
number of gaps were identified between Fujitsu HNG-A provision and thesolution
Computacenter were committed to. These gaps were documented within a Gap Analysis paper
[4]. To address the gaps, Computacenter have been requested to perform additional activity
over and above their initial contract response. Subject to Post Office agreement to the additional
activities and acceptance of the Computacenter High Level Design [5], the following specific
changes will be required:

4.4 HNG-A/Computacenter E2E Testing
4.4.1 Purpose

In order to demonstrate continued system integrity, Atos will undertake testing with third parties
that have a direct interface currently (but are not subject to accreditation), e.g.,

« Post office back end systems (POLSAP, Credence, MDM, HRSAP)

« Large clients (POCA, Santander, First Rate, NS&I)

As the interfaces to these clients and systems are not changing as a result of Computacenter /
HNG-A / Verizon implementation, no issues are expected. The purpose of this stage is to provide
the Post Office with assurance that the introduction of the new counter hardware and software
will not adversely impact day to day operation.

4.4.2 Inputs

« Proven and supported counter PC, operational with new/existing peripherals

« Proven connectivity / operation between counter PC running HNG-A and existing Horizon
data centre

« Proven connectivity between the Horizon data centre and the Post Office / Client systems

4.4.3 Process

A briefing on the changes required in support of Branch Counter Refresh has been circulated to
key stakeholders from the Post Office and its larger clients. This briefing outlined the changes
and sough confirmation from the stakeholders as to the level of assurance required, in order to
obtain their sign-off of the Branch Counter Refresh implementation plan.

As a result the following organisations need limited involvement in the E2E testing in the
following manner:
¢ Bank Of Ireland: confidence testing with transactions from HNG-X and HNG-A; they will be
using their existing test system connected to SV&I for this

At time of writing the following organisations are yet to confirm their E2E test requirements;
¢ Royal Mail

* Parcelforce

* DVLA

* Post Office Telecoms

Tests will be documented in an E2E System Test Plan.

Any defects discovered will be raised in an Atos overarching defect tool (HP Application Lifecycle
Management). Defects relating to Computacenter equipment will be transferred to
Computacenter test representatives for local logging and resolution. Defects relating to HNG-A
operation will be transferred to Fujitsu for logging and resolution. Defects relating to network will
be transferred to Verizon.

The outcome of testing, along with any defects to be transferred to later test stages, will be
documented in an E2E System Test Report.

4.4.5 Test Environment

The existing SV&I environment (as used for HNG-A System Integration Testing) will be used to
demonstrate E2E system integrity.

Where an existing interface to a client system already exists (e.g. from SV&I to the POCA test
environment) this will be utilised as part of the E2E test.

Connectivity to Post Office systems such as POLSAP or Credence is not in place, therefore a
disjointed E2E test will be conducted. I.e. transaction files will be generated by Horizon, but
instead of an automated FTP file transfer, the files will be emailed to the back end test team, for
manual loading on to the appropriate file-share and subsequent system processing.

organisations may determine that existing accreditation covers the revised branch solution, in
which case no testing is required, and continued accreditation will be confirmed in writing.
However if an accrediting organisation deems that the changes introduced by Branch Counter
Refresh invalidate any previous accreditation status, then a reaccreditation test exercise will be
required.

At the time of writing, the following organisations have confirmed that accreditation is not
required for the HNG-A/Computacenter hardware solution;

* Vocalink

The following accrediting organisations have yet to confirm their position on the HNG-
A/Computacenter hardware solution;

« Post Office Card Account (provided by HP/JPM)

« Santander online banking

« GlobalPay merchant services

« Epay mobile top ups

Accreditation usually takes the form of a set of defined tests with associated expected results,
data and physical media (e.g. Chip & PIN cards). Retailers are expected to undertake all tests
appropriate to their solution, and submit evidence to the accrediting authority. This evidence

may take the form of detailed system logs, or extracts from transaction reconciliation process.

PCI-compliance is assessed via system audit rather than transactional accreditation testing.
Therefore the SV&I environment will be made available to support any PCI audit requests. This
may include demonstration of PCI-compliant data storage and transmission. Specific PCI
requirements are to be discussed and agreed with Post Office stakeholders.

4.6.3 Process

Assurance of system usability needs to come from frontline users. As the PIN Pad is not changing
as a result of the Branch Counter Refresh project, the transition will be seamless to the branch
customer. However the clerks in Branch will see a difference and could potentially be impacted.
To measure this impact, the Post Office will be asked to nominate users to attend a
demonstration of the new equipment within the Atos test environment, which will be set up to
replicate branch conditions as closely as possible. Users are likely to be drawn from the following
impacted user groups:

« Post Office ‘Crown’ network staff

« The Federation of Subpostmasters

« Retail partners (e.g. WH Smiths)

« Counter Training staff

¢ Post Office Network & Communications teams.

A session will be held to demonstrate the new system, and users will be interviewed to gain
feedback on their views and opinions. The results from the interviews will be consolidated into a
report which will provide recommendations should any corrective action be identified. It should
be noted that corrective actions may need to be deferred to subsequent releases due to
sequence of UAT within the development cycle.

It is anticipated that Ergonomic\Equality experts will attend a similar awareness session and will
provide their own reports summarizing their findings - The User Acceptance Test stage will be
used to validate the implementation against these reports.

Any supporting operations guides or branch training material will be checked against the system
to validate the content and ensure that a robust support process is in place.

4.7 HNG-A Preproduction Testing
4.7.1 Purpose

Fujitsu current provide a Live System Test environment which is used to rehearse and
demonstrate the deployment activities required for major, minor and patch releases. This
environment currently focuses on both counter application updates and data centre component
updates.

Going forward, LST will retain its role to demonstrate releases to data centre components as
now. However, deployment of counter application updates will change as a result of the
introduction of Computacenter as hardware provider:

a) Whilst a HNG-X estate remains in operation, Fujitsu staff within LST will demonstrate
continued HNG-X gold build deployment. They will also demonstrate hot-fix/patch
deployment against the HNG-X variant.

b) As part of the live deployment of HNG-A, Fujitsu staff will work with Computacenter to
deploy the HNG-A gold build onto live-like (Type D) counter builds within the LST
environment. Upon successful completion of this test, Fujitsu will issue a Release Note to

confirm that HNG-A R13.05 is fit for live deployment. This release will then be transferred
from Fujitsu to Computacenter as a series of MSI’s, which will then be included in
Computacenter’s production process.

c) Patch updates to HNG-A are described in section 4.10
Regression/rollback of installed packages will be proven at this stage.

Demonstration of Fujitsu support teams ability to connect to each counter via a GUI or Command
Line interface will be undertaken at this stage. Computacenter support team access to SCCM
logs will also be covered, as will Verizon support of the Branch network.

preproduction testing. It will need to be extended to allow connectivity to the Computacenter
data centre in order for Fujitsu to deliver software packages to Computacenter, and return routes
from the Computacenter down to the test counters.

It is assumed that the ‘as-live’ hardened PC build will be exercised during this stage.

4.8 HNG-A/Computacenter/Verizon Pilot / Live Proving

Unsurprisingly, live proving occurs in the live environment, and is therefore out of scope of this
Branch Counter Refresh test strategy.

For completion, live proving is the migration of a small number of branches to demonstrate
capability in the live environment. Typically, the Model Office branch in the Post Office HQ in
central London is usually used as the first live office, as it allows for changes to be witnessed in a
controlled environment (i.e. not accessible to the general public), however there are plans to
introduce Model Office capability within the Atos test site in Winnersh. Other Model Offices
currently existing in the NBSC helpdesk in Dearne and within the Fujitsu Development site in
Bracknell.

The purpose of this stage is not to repeat previous test cycles, but instead to focus on elements
that cannot be adequately proven within the test environment, such as:

Live Active Directory changes

« Live network firewalls / routes

Live file permissions

« Live security certificates
The Post Office have retained responsibility for Model Office and Live Proving activities, therefore
Atos can only perform an advisory role, providing awareness of system changes and highlighting
any possible mitigation of issues found based on knowledge discovered during testing.

It is recommended that any live proving exercise is closely monitored by all impacted parties.
Any increases to the number of pilot branches should only occur once the live pilot has been
operational without issue for a substantial period (normally a number of weeks).

4.9 HNG-A/Computacenter/Verizon Post Go-Live Support

Once the Branch Counter Refresh Project commits to a wider rollout, issues may be discovered
that had not previously been encountered during testing. Issues in the live environment will be
monitored and resolution coordinated by the Atos service desk, so this stage is outside of the
scope of this Test Strategy. However, it makes sense to draw upon the knowledge and
experience gained through testing to help investigate and recreate live issues within the test
environment. This could lead to the testing and deployment of urgent fixes via a patch release,
which is described in the next section.

4.10 HNG-A/Computacenter/Verizon Hot-fix Security Patch
Testing

The initial version of the Branch Counter Refresh test strategy covers the stages of testing up to
the first release of the HNG-A application and the rollout of the Computacenter provided counter
PC and associated peripherals. However it is recognised that urgent fixes may be required from
any point once the HNG-A rollout has commenced. Examples of these ‘fixes’ could include:

« Updates to HNG-A and supporting counter packages - to resolve errors identified in live
operation
Updates to Antivirus definitions on Computacenter PC - to respond to new virus threats
Windows Updates on Computacenter PC - to close security vulnerabilities.
Peripheral firmware / device driver update - to improve performance or resolve issues.

To facilitate testing of urgent fixes, it is suggested that the following high level approach is
adopted:
« Fujitsu Component & System Test Stages will not be required for HNG-A patch releases.
« Computacenter System Testing will be required to verify other changes in isolation, and
provide documentary evidence to Atos in support
Atos will maintain the SIT configuration detailed in section 4.3.5, and will use live
deployment processes to maintain at least one test configuration in a ‘live-plus-one’
Position
E2E, Accreditation, and User Acceptance Testing, will not be required for patch testing.
Fujitsu Pre-production Testing will only be required to prove updates to HNG-A and
supporting packages. These will be delivered using as-live delivery mechanisms. Fujitsu
pre-production will also cover urgent fix testing of changes made to Fujitsu datacentre
components. Release Notes for each signed-off change will be provided to Atos in evidence
of testing.

It is assumed that an ongoing release strategy will be defined to elaborate on this process.

4.11 HNG-A/Computacenter/Verizon Minor Release Testing

Based on HNG-X experience, a frequent churn of minor releases can be expected, covering:
« Data Centre system updates
« Small / urgent HNG-A counter releases
« Potential for change to legacy HNG-X counter releases - as HNG-X will share the same
common R13.05 baseline, changes will be applied to both HNG-X and HNG-A variants

These minor releases are out of scope of this test strategy; however the following approach could
be adopted:
« Fujitsu Component & System Test Stages will be required to prove updates to HNG-A and
its supporting packages. It will also be required to prove and data centre system updates.

These will be delivered locally from Fujitsu’s Integration teams and will be installed
manually by Fujitsu test support

There may be minor release updates to the Computacenter platform, to maintain it in line
with vendor support levels therefore Computacenter System Testing will be required.
Atos will maintain the SIT configuration detailed in section 4.3.5, and will use live
deployment processes to maintain at least one test configuration in a position to test a
minor release to HNG-A and its supporting packages or the deployed Computacenter
platform.

The requirement for E2E, Accreditation, and User Acceptance Testing is dependent on the
content of the minor release, however it is assumed that any such testing will not be
required for minor release testing.

Fujitsu Pre-production Testing will only be required to prove updates to HNG-A and
supporting packages. These will be delivered using as-live delivery mechanisms. Fujitsu
pre-production will also test changes made to Fujitsu datacentre components by way of a
minor release.

It is assumed that an ongoing release strategy will be defined to elaborate on this process.

4.12 HNG-A/Computacenter/Verizon Major Release Testing

Based on HNG-X experience, at least one major release per year can be expected, covering:
« Data Centre system updates
« Large-scale HNG-A counter releases - delivery new components or new areas of
functionality
« Deployment of new applications to the Computacenter platform

As the HNG-X an HNG-A code base is shared if there were a major release it would be made to
the HNG counter application and update legacy HNG-X branches and the HNG-A branches during
the counter rollout period; when rollout is complete it will only affect HNG-A.

Major releases are out of scope of this test strategy; however the following approach could be
adopted:

« Fujitsu Component & System Test Stages will be required to prove updates to HNG-A and
its supporting packages. It will also be required to prove and data centre system updates.
These will be delivered locally from Fujitsu’s Integration teams and will be installed
manually by Fujitsu test support. Fujitsu testing of new applications on the Computacenter
PC is not required
Any new core applications to be installed on the Computacenter platform will be subjected
to Computacenter System Testing to confirm the correct packaging and installation, with
assurance provided by Atos. Deployment of tested applications onto specific Branch
machines is a core deployment function and will not be tested.

Atos will maintain the SIT configuration detailed in section 4.3.5, and will use live
deployment processes to maintain multiples test configurations in a position to test a
major release to HNG-A or the deployment of a new application on the counter.

The requirement for E2E, Accreditation, and User Acceptance Testing is likely as a result of
a major release. These will be subject to detailed planning as required.

Fujitsu Pre-production Testing will only be required to prove major releases of HNG-A and
supporting packages. These will be delivered using as-live delivery mechanisms. Fujitsu
pre-production will also test changes made to Fujitsu datacentre components by way of a
major release. Fujitsu Pre-production testing of new applications on the Computacenter PC
is not required, however the Fujitsu preproduction counter environment will be updated at
regular intervals to ensure the test environment adequately represents the live baseline of
applications.

It is assumed that an ongoing release strategy will be defined to elaborate on this process.

5 Non-Functional Testing
5.1 Performance Testing

In terms of the Horizon environment and HNG-A application, the Fujitsu Design Proposal [2]
assumes that a combination of new counter hardware and an updated JRE will result in
significant performance improvements but there are no requirements or metrics around this.
Therefore no performance testing of the HNG-A counter application will be required. However, a
comparison benchmark exercise will be undertaken during Fujitsu System Test using a defined
set of regression tests and the Horizon automation framework to validate this assumption.

In terms of Computacenter data centre performance, this will be covered within the
Computacenter Test strategy and evidence will be provided to Atos for assurance.

5.2 Volume Testing

The Design Proposal [2] states there will no changes in the message interactions between the
counter application and the data centre in respect of the introduction of the HNG-A counter
application. Therefore existing database capabilities already proven for HNG-X should still be
appropriate. As a result, volume testing of the Branch database or any other database within the
data centre is not required.

However, the CHS help page service is new and should undergo volume testing to ensure it can
handle peak load traffic as defined in an updated version of the Fujitsu performance specification
[PA/PER/033]. This test should be completed within the Fujitsu System Test Stage detailed in
section 4.2.1.

The new Bluecoat proxies and the personalisation will need to be monitored to confirm they will
scale, and metrics from the Self Service Kiosk which also uses these technologies will assist this.

In terms of Computacenter data centre volume capability, this will be covered within the
Computacenter Test strategy and evidence will be provided to Atos for assurance.

5.3 Application Concurrency

At the introduction of the Computacenter PC, HNG-A will be the only application running on the
PC. Therefore no compatibility testing will be undertaken to prove that the operation of the HNG-
A counter application is not compromised when run alongside other applications. Should a new
application be released, application concurrency will be proven during testing of the new
application as per section 4.12. I.e. concurrency will be proven at the introduction of each
application.

In terms of general Computacenter PC compatibility, this will be covered within the
Computacenter Test strategy and evidence will be provided to Atos for assurance.

5.4 Disaster Recovery Testing & Business Continuity

The HNG-X solution is subjected to an annual DR / BC test, whereby the production datacentre is
failed over to the standby site and regressed back after a period of Business Continuity
operation. The introduction of the HNG-A counter application running on the Computacenter PC is
assumed to not impact this failover process, and that no specific failover testing will be required
prior to Branch Counter Refresh go live - instead the next planned DR/BC event will reflect a
mixed estate of HNG-X and HNG-A counters.

In terms of Computacenter data centre DR/BC capabilities, this will be covered within the
Computacenter Test strategy and evidence will be provided to Atos for assurance.

5.5 Security / Penetration Testing

From a Fujitsu perspective the Horizon data centre is largely unchanged as a result of the
introduction of HNG-A. A new CHS application will be added to the existing Horizon Business
Service, which is already protected by Bluecoat reverse proxy. It is assumed that this protection
is sufficient and further penetration tests or security audit are not required.

In terms of general Computacenter PC security, this will be covered within the Computacenter
Test strategy and evidence will be provided to Atos for assurance. If the Computacenter PC is
provided in a hardened state; override mechanisms will be provided to gain access to the
operating system for test analysis and defect investigation purposes and installation of tools as
required.

6.5 Suspension and Resumption Criteria
6.5.1 Suspension Criteria

Testing may be suspended if unacceptable risks result from one or more of the following causes:

If the stability of the test environment is threatened and/or unacceptable risks are being
posed to other project co-resident in the same environment

TEST STRATEGY AtoS

version: 1.0f For internal use Ref: PPM-19550-TPDOO1

« If there is an exceptional concentration of defects in one area and it is believed that the
shorter defect turnaround time resulting from revision to an earlier test stage will reduce
execution timescales

¢ If the overall defect rate is such that it is unlikely that any new information will be gained
by proceeding.

Suspending a test stage implies a process failure, in either definition or execution. Should it be
invoked, the Business Sponsor shall be informed via the Project Manager. An investigation shall
be undertaken to identify the process related causes for the suspension and modify, or re-affirm
the applicable entry criteria to ensure that suspension will not be required again.

6.5.2 Resumption Criteria

Testing will be resumed when the criteria causing any suspension has significantly improved,
however this will be on the basis of any modified or re-affirmed entry criteria.

6.6 Readiness Reviews

Test readiness reviews will be held for System Test, System Integration Test and Preproduction
Testing. These will be joint meetings held between POL, Atos and the relevant suppliers.

6.7 Requirements Acceptance

The Branch Counter Refresh Project requirements detailed in the requirements catalogue [1] will
form the basis of Fujitsu solution acceptance. Each requirement within the catalogue has been
allocated a verification method:

« DR - Document Review

« DW - Design Walkthrough

« SOF - Statement Of Fact

« SOO - Statement Of Obligation

« TST - Testable

« MO - Monitoring [in live operation]
It is assumed that a similar requirements traceability matrix will be employed for requirements
assigned to Computacenter and Verizon.

The existing Horizon Requirements Acceptance process will be used as a basis to demonstrate
acceptance. The following activities will be required:

a) The requirements within the catalogue will be imported into the requirements module of
the Atos instance of Quality Centre (HP Application Lifecycle Management)

b) Any DR or DW requirements will be linked to test artefacts that represent documents or
design workshops. The test artefacts will be ‘passed’ when the document is produced or
the walkthrough held. The status of the associated requirements will be automatically
updated as a result.

c) SOF and SOO when met will not require any further traceability

d) TST requirements will be linked to appropriate tests until full coverage is achieved

e) Assessment of MO requirements is deferred until post go live.

f) Towards the completion of testing. Each Supply Chain Member will present a slide
presentation that summarises the requirements status and document via a formal
acceptance report. The slide pack and report will provide a view on summary status and
will provide further detail / mitigation for any requirements not met.

g) A Requirements Acceptance Board will be held between stakeholders from Post Office,
Atos and the Supply Chain Member to review the slide pack and report and decide if
acceptable requirements coverage has been achieved.

h) If suitable coverage has been achieved the acceptance of the Requirements Board could
be used to trigger stage payments to the Supply Chain Members.

i) If coverage is not suitable or requirements are deemed to have not been met, further
development, testing and Requirements Acceptance exercises will be held until coverage
is deemed acceptable, or the consequences of failed or missed requirements are
accepted.

The above approach has been used successfully in a single supplier acceptance model, it is
assumed that it can be applied to a multi-supplier model following the same principles

6.8 Release Authorisation

Successful completion of each test stage detailed in section 4 will enable an overarching Branch
Counter Refresh Project Test Summary Report to be issued by the Atos Test Manager. This
report will be used as evidence at the Post Office Gating forum in order to obtain approval to
deploy the Computacenter base configuration, associated peripherals and drivers, HNG-A
application and supporting software to live.

7 Environmental Considerations
7.1 Test Environment

The individual test stage environment requirements are documented in Section 4 of this
document.

The following /ogical diagram depicts the End to End test environment needed to prove the
Branch Counter Refresh activities. The area within the red dotted line indicates the established
test environment provided predominantly by Fujitsu. Elements outside of the red line are to be
provided, and are currently subject to agreement by Post Office.

Note; It is recognised that HNG-A counters can operate via the existing Sarian branch router
during migration; this scenario is depicted by the HNG-X element of the diagram below.

7.2 Test Tools

Computacenter and Fujitsu will use their own separate instance of HP ALM to manage their
System Testing stages. It is assumed that Verizon, NCR and 3M Cogent have similar test
repositories.

Atos will use the Post Office instance of the HP ALM tool to manage SIT and UAT including:

* Requirements

« All test scripts

« Traceability to requirements

* Testing Logs

« All defects raised, including any raised as a result of any formal static testing undertaken

9 Appendix A - Incident Classification Criteria

The Severity assigned to a defect will define the effect the defect can have on the business and the
impact if the defect occurred in production. The below standard severity criteria needs to be
applied to all test stages.

Severity Impact of the Defect
The Defect causes a system crash or unrecoverable data loss.

No workaround is possible. The Defect results in the failure of the complete system.

~ Critical

The Defect causes loss of critical system functions and no workaround solution exists.
E.g, the Solution’s functions do not work and no workaround is available.

A Defect that causes other critical system functionality to fail to meet the requirements.
E.g. Interface failure stops next step of process from being completed.

2 - Major

The Defect causes impairment of crucial system functions. The Defect does not result in
failure but causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent results.
E.g. the forecast upload does not work however a manual workaround exists, but a
workaround solution exists to achieve functionality objectives.

3 - Minor

The failure causes inconvenience or annoyance. Defects do not affect the system

4 - Cosmetic functionality.

The Priority assigned to a defect will define the impact on the ability to continue testing or the
impact on the testing team schedule. The below standard criteria needs to be applied to all test
stages.

I Timescale for Vendor's

Priority Impact of the defect I initial assessment of the
I defect

On Testing: Immediate Assessment required.
Incident stops all or a significant amount of further
1-Urgent I Acceptance Testing.

On Business:

Can/will cause financial penalties. E.g. Legal text wrong,

On Testing: Assessment required within 24hrs
Incident impacts one area of Acceptance Testing, other
areas can continue unaffected,

On Business:

Accessibility issues - users not being able to access the
system or critical areas of functionality within the system
On Testing: Assessment required within 48hrs
Incident has minimal impact on Acceptance Testing
progress

On Business:

Accessibility issues - users not being able to access areas
of functionality within the system

On Testing: Assessment required within 72hrs
Incident has no impact on Acceptance Testing progress.
Business:

Minor Visual Issues

Accessibility issues - users not being able to access
