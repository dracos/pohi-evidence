POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF
THOMAS KEITH TODD

|, THOMAS KEITH TODD, formerly Chief Executive Officer of International Computers
Limited ("ICL"), make this statement in response to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry’s

Request for Evidence, dated 1 June 2022.

Throughout this statement | refer to 6 documents (Exhibits WITN0388_01/01 — 03, 19
— 21), which | am providing to the Inquiry as exhibits to this statement. The remaining

documents referenced in this statement (Exhibits WITN0388_01/04 — 18 and 22 - 36)

have been provided to me by the Inquiry.

Within this statement | have endeavoured to answer the Inquiry's questions as fully as
possible and where helpful, provide background detail to aid understanding. | worked
for ICL (and later Pathway) from July 1987 to July 2000 and so my statement is limited
to relevant events that took place during this time period only. It is important to make
clear that due to the passage of over 22 years since | left ICL (and over 27 years since
| joined Pathway), much of the detail in my statement comes from my recent review of

documents provided by the Inquiry. Without access to the materials provided by the

Inquiry | would not now be able to recall many of the details | have been asked to

comment on in this statement.

Throughout this statement | make reference to the "Pathway Project", a term that | feel
best encompasses the contract to assist with the automation of the benefits payment
system for the Department of Social Security/Benefits Agency ("DSS") and Post Office
Counters Limited ("POCL"), and subsequently the contract that was in place solely
with POCL. | understand that in some of its questions the Inquiry has used the phrase
‘Horizon project’, however to avoid confusion | have used Pathway Project consistently

throughout the statement.

To assist the Inquiry, | have exhibited as WITN0388_01/01 a timeline of key dates and
events that | refer to in this statement, taken from documents provided to me by the
Inquiry. This covers the history of ICL and ICL's involvement in the procurement

process and subsequent contract with POCL and the DSS.

| would like to take the opportunity to express my immense sympathy to all those
affected by the Horizon scandal. | support wholeheartedly the work of the Inquiry and
its aims in understanding what happened to each sub-postmaster and their families. |

hope lessons will be learned by all those who were involved.

involvement with the Broadband Stake Holder Group, which drove the UK's

broadband agenda.

Please set out the background to your involvement in the Horizon project.

ICL was established in 1968 through the merger of a number of companies including
English Electric Computers and International Computers and Tabulators. The
creation of ICL was part of the push by the Labour Government of Harold Wilson to
support technological change through the Industrial Expansion Act 1968. ICL was
established to be the UK's answer to the market-leading US company IBM. ICL's

original focus was computer hardware and operating software systems.

In the early 1980s, ICL started collaborating with Fujitsu in order to develop a series
of new computers. This relationship became increasingly close and in July 1990,
Fujitsu acquired an 80% stake in ICL from Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd

("STC") at a cost of £740 million.

Over the years ahead the company developed its software and services as well as
its hardware business, including establishing a strong presence in government

systems and outsourcing.

ICL was a founder member of the consortium known as Camelot, which successfully
bid for the National Lottery franchise in May 1994. The consortium comprised 5
companies which were Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, Racal, GTECH Corporation
and ICL. The bid involved installing approximately 40,000 lottery terminals in retailers
nationwide. ICL provided a number of key services to Camelot including the roll out
of infrastructure and support of the nationwide service. A key part of the Camelot bid
was a guarantee to have 10,000 terminals ready for use on launch day (with a

significant penalty for failure). These targets were achieved and Camelot went on to

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

be a huge national success and commercial success. | was on the board of Camelot

throughout this time and until July 2000.

18. To provide some further background, in 1995, ICL was one of the world's leading
suppliers of retail points of sale ("POS") systems (the operating software that
supports retail hardware such as cash registers) and provided financial systems to
the financial services industry. ICL was a substantial company operating in over 40

countries globally and in 1995 had revenues of over £3.1 billion.’

19. In 1996, as CEO, | shifted ICL's focus primarily to software and services and oversaw
the demerger of ICL's personal computer and server business to Fujitsu. | was also
involved in the sale of |CL's manufacturing business. During this time there was also
a significant focus and investment on the emerging new digital age built around the

potential of the internet to transform society.

20. As part of this renewed focus on systems and software, from early 1995 | oversaw
ICL's bid for the Benefits Agency/Post Office Counters Limited ("POCL") contract to
computerise the payment of benefits in the UK. | undertook this role initially as CFO

and then as CEO from January 1996.

21. We were aware that the success of the National Lottery contract lay in the strong
consortium of companies that had been created for the bid. ICL felt that the most
compelling proposition for submitting a winning bid for the Pathway Project was to
run it not as an internal project but as an independent company with a consortium of

shareholder companies. We felt that creating a consortium was the best way to make

WITN03880100

the project a success and reduce risks, as each party had expertise in particular parts

of the project scope.

22. In preparing to bid for the Pathway Project, we assembled a consortium comprising
expert companies in various fields. This included ICL (software services and
computing technologies), Girobank (financial institutions), An Post (the Irish post
office which was already using the software that we were proposing) and De La Rue
(banking security). Employing a consortium enabled us to pool resources and create
a compelling team for the bid and provided a unique offering to the government
tender. This consortium became a special purpose vehicle, a company created for
that defined purpose, named ICL Pathway Limited ("Pathway") on 19 January 1995.
| was an original director of Pathway from early 1995. Sir Michael Butler, an

experienced public servant, was appointed as Chairman of Pathway.

Procurement

Q3. Please describe your involvement in the procurement process.

23. As set out in my answer to Q2 above, | was heavily involved in the success of the
Camelot bid for the National Lottery contract. As the CEO of ICL and director of both
Pathway and ICL, | was responsible for oversight of the ICL elements of the bid. |
was primarily involved with assisting the Pathway team in defining a strategy of how
to win and | leveraged my experience on the Camelot project and other bids to make

the procurement a success.

Q4. ‘Please set out what you understood the aims of the Horizon project to be.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 6 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

24. It was my understanding that the aims of the Horizon project were as follows: fraud
prevention, Post Office modernisation and infrastructure transformation. | will deal

with each in turn and how these matched up with the aims of ICL at that time.
Fraud Prevention

25. The government was determined to reduce fraud in the Department of Social Security
("DSS"). At the Conservative Party Conference in October 1995, the Secretary of
State for Social Security, Peter Lilley, announced new measures to help the DSS
combat benefit fraud. Benefit fraud was costly to the taxpayer and the system of
paying social security benefits (which was paper based) was seen to be vulnerable
to manipulation and counterfeiting. One of the measures that Peter Lilley announced
was a card-based system of payment for social security benefits, which formed the
original basis of the project. |CL already had experience in developing loyalty card
systems in the retail sector and was investing in a new generation of smart card
projects. ICL had previous experience working with DSS in the installation of
mainframe computers but as | recall had no experience of working with the Post

Office.

Post Office modernisation

26. As | understand the situation, in the early 1990s the Post Office was not performing
well in urban areas across the country. The number of working post offices was falling
significantly. The mainstream adoption of the internet and emerging smart card
technology offered a huge opportunity to stop this decline. It could modernise the
Post Office and automate some of its functions. | understood that a core aim of the

project was to provide the Post Office with a modern infrastructure that would enable

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 7 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

it to undertake greater commercial opportunities and ensure it remained a viable

operation in local communities.
Infrastructure transformation

27. The project was set to be a critical national infrastructure project, important for both
the UK government as part of its fraud prevention and modernisation strategy. This
was consistent with ICL’s new strategy to provide infrastructure and software services

to both government and commercial customers.

Q5. Please set out a brief history of the procurement process.

28. The following brief history is taken from my review of the materials provided to me by
the Inquiry, and in particular relies on the chronology within the National Audit Office
("NAO") report into the cancellation of the benefits payment card project
(WITNO388_01/03).2 Due to the passage of time | do not now have a direct

recollection of these specific details.

29. In May 1994, | understand that the Secretary of State Peter Lilley announced his
intention to automate the benefits payment system. ICL Pathway Limited - named the
Pathway consortium - was formed in January 1995 to tender for the contract. | was a

director of Pathway from 28 February 1995 until my resignation from ICL in July 2000.

30. By the end of August 1994, | understand that the DSS published its Invitation Notice
to invite potential bidders to express an interest in the contract. There were 92
expressions of interest in the contract. From the NAO report, | understand that five

shortlisted suppliers were announced in December 1994, one of which was Pathway.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 8 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

31. In early 1995, | understand that the DSS and POCL agreed a memorandum of
understanding ("MoU") for proceeding with the project. Statements of Service
Requirements were issued to shortlisted suppliers in April 1995. In June, Pathway
consortium became a special purpose vehicle comprising ICL, De La Rue and

Girobank. The Pathway bid was submitted on 8 June 1995.

32. By July 1995 the evaluation board had selected a shortlist of three potential bidders

(Pathway, IBM and Cardlink).

33. | understand that an Invitation to Tender was issued to the remaining three bidders
in February 1996. The three bids received were all priced above the level deemed
acceptable by the DSS/Post Office. On 16 April 1996, all three bidders received

Invitations to Retender.

34. On 15 May 1996, following a lengthy and competitive bid process, Pathway was
awarded the contract on the basis that the operational trial would be completed by
June 1997, and the full rollout of the project to 19,000 post offices would be completed

by 1999.

Q6. What were the main challenges in the procurement process?

35. DSS and POCL tendered the Pathway Project as a Private Finance Initiative ("PFI").
This meant that the successful bidder would take on the financial and logistical risk
of the project, but would in theory have the freedom to determine the design and
management of the project. We considered that this proposition would work for
Pathway as it would have revenue streams from services provided through the new
Post Office network to support the project. A crucial dependency for success was the

PFI which would give the consortium greater freedom over the running of the project.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

36. The Invitation to Tender ("ITT") for the PFI that Pathway received on 29 February
1996 was over 2000 pages long and was a much more extensive document than
originally indicated. Pathway and the other bidders undertook a lot of work in order
to clarify the requirements of the tender: 'Some 333 additional details and
clarifications to requirements were issued between November 1995 and the end of
January 1996.° The theory underpinning PFI was that high level requirements would
be provided by the customers (DSS and POCL), but how these requirements were
delivered would be up to the service provider. In practice, the customers had little or
no experience of PFI and treated the procurement as a classic design, specification
and operation project. As there were two customers to consult, many issues that
needed a resolution were significantly delayed both during the tender process and
the lifetime of the project. Due to the project running as a PFI, it was important to
Pathway that DSS and POCL provided any requirements and clarified any functional

requests in a timely manner.

37. Under the terms of the PFI, it was important to achieve live roll-out of the Pathway
Project as soon as possible to trigger the revenue stream under the contract and
deliver the project benefits. However, as set out in the Pathway Group Limited Board
Minutes of the Board Meeting held on 15 March 1996 (WITN0388_01/04), Pathway
had significant concerns regarding the lack of an achievable timetable for delivery.
Due to this concern, myself and others at Pathway felt that we could not submit a
fully compliant tender for the contract, but that we could submit a strong variant bid

based on a timetable that we felt was achievable and realistic. We knew it was

2 NAO Report dated 18 August 2000 "The Cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card project", page 58, para 3.6 (WITNO388_01/03)

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 10 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

important for the success of the project that Pathway did not commit to a timetable it

would be unable to meet and to ensure the timeframes were achievable.

38. This was a risky strategy as, under the terms of the ITT, the clients could have refused
to consider a variant bid. However, it was clear to us that if Pathway had continued
with its tender based on the ITT timetable, the contract would have been breached
almost immediately due to the 'mismatch on the view of the achievable timescale’ of
‘as much as six months’ between Pathway and the customers‘. Pathway understood
at the time that IBM, one of the three shortlisted bidders for the tender, also had

‘severe concerns® about the ITT and the delivery timetable in particular.

39. An additional challenge in the procurement process was the fact that we were
tendering for a contract that had two distinct clients. We had initially thought that the
requirements of POCL and DSS were aligned. However after the award of the
contract, it became clear that the two clients had separate and distinct management
ethos, business objectives and priorities, DSS was a government department and
POCL was a largely commercial operation owned by the Government; the two clients
did not have a unified position on the contract requirements or priorities.
Notwithstanding my comments above, if the Pathway group had believed that the
project would not be successful we would not have submitted a bid. By the time the
bid was submitted, we felt we had a sufficiently clear understanding of the
requirements as defined at that time. It was a complicated process with a variety of
players, but we felt that Pathway could deliver the project successfully, albeit on an

extended timeline to that which was proposed by POCL and DSS. This was

reinforced by virtue of the fact that when Pathway was awarded the contract based
on its re-tender document in April 1996, the new ITT had adopted the Pathway

timetable for the project.®

Q7. Please comment on how aligned the objectives of the main parties were.

40. During the negotiation of the bid, Pathway had concerns that POCL and the Benefits
Agency ("BA"), a subsidiary agency of the DSS, were not seeing eye-to-eye. In the
Pathway Group Limited Board Minutes of the Board Meeting held on October 1995

(WITNO388_01/06 p8), we noted as follows:

"Pressure is mounting from both contracting parties for timely decision. BA
are confident on their delivery of CAPS and want work on integration
testing with the chosen service provider in mid-March 1996. POCL are
increasingly impatient and want to get on with their ambitions to become a
powerful UK retailer. Also the "memorandum of understanding" between
BA and POCL is causing trouble in taking forward. In short something has
to give. Either a new faster procurement with a tighter focus on PFI, or a

cleaner separation between what BA and POCL want."

As well as the above section on timescales, in the Finance Director's report section
‘Highlights’ under a heading entitled ‘Not so good’, Commercial and Finance
Director Tony Oppenheim noted, "signs of dissent between POCL and BA - will
the joint procurement survive?" The relationship between POCL and BA was
considered to be a risk to the procurement and it was something that Pathway was

closely observing.

(WITN0388_01/05)

WITN03880100

41. However, by the time that we signed the contract on 15 May 1996, we believed that
the objectives, requirements and timescales of each of Pathway, DSS and POCL
were sufficiently aligned. We would have simply not proceeded with the project if we
had felt differently. Unfortunately, the subsequent reality evolved rapidly after
signature and it was clear that DSS and POCL were not aligned in their objectives or

priorities nor had an effective process to agree.

Q8. Please comment on how achievable you considered the project to be at this

stage.

42. ICL had a wide breadth of experience working for large clients across industries
including retail, banks and building societies. We had proven success in major UK
infrastructure projects including the Camelot lottery project and the automation of the

Ministry of Defence offices and many others.

43. ICL, through Pathway, engaged subcontractors to assist with the Pathway Project to
provide the additional relevant skills, knowledge and support. These included An Post
(advising on post office counter automation), British Telecom (network design and
provision), Alliance & Leicester (card and payment management), Hambros Bank
(PFI and commercial advice), Escher (a software company focused on post offices)
and original Pathway shareholders De La Rue and Girobank. Escher had
successfully partnered with An Post in 1993 to provide software and systems, in
particular the Riposte point of service software. All subcontractors had the requisite
expertise to fulfil their respective roles and we were confident that as a group,

Pathway could deliver on the contract.

44. Pathway was set up as a dedicated team to deliver the project and had the technical

ability, client networking skills, project management, partners and governance

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

structure to deliver the contracted service successfully. As set out above, at this initial
stage of the project and based on the available information, we considered that
meeting the aims of the project was achievable. If it had not been Pathway would not

have continued to bid.

Award of Contract

qs.

45.

46.

Please explain why you consider ICL Pathway was awarded the contract.

ICL Pathway was required to comply with a rigorous tender process. Although it is
clear from the March 1996 Pathway Board minutes’ that Pathway was concerned
about what our competitors would be offering in their bids, neither | nor Pathway had
detailed knowledge of the other bids involved in the tender at the time. However,
having reviewed the disclosure provided to me by the Inquiry in preparation for this
statement, it is clear that the tender process for the Pathway Project was highly
competitive. In particular, | have now seen the evaluation scorecard against which
each of the three competitors were marked®. This shows that Pathway had the best

proposition and value for money based on the public procurement selection criteria.

From our perspective, we felt that Pathway had a strong team assembled to deliver
the project. We had also embraced the Government's wish to finance the project
through the PFI, which at that time was a new frontier of public procurement and
since Pathway took on a lot of the risk through this, we felt it had made us an attractive

option for the DSS and POCL.

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

47. Pathway also had a clear governance structure in place to oversee the delivery of the
contract successfully. The Pathway executive team, under Managing Director John
Bennett was comprised of Commercial & Finance Director Anthony Oppenheim,
Quality and Risk Management Director Martyn Bennett, Business Development
Director Stephen Hodgkins, Technical Director John Dicks, Programmes Director
Michael Coombs and Operations Director Stephen Rowe. There was a requirement
for regular reporting on a monthly basis to the Board, set out in the Pathway
Programme Monthly Reports? (the "Monthly Report"), which was overseen and
approved by the Managing Director. These were also discussed in monthly Board
meetings chaired by Sir Michael Butler. As CEO of ICL, | had overall responsibility of
Pathway, which was first partly owned and then fully owned by ICL. To the best of
my knowledge, | attended Board meetings and made myself available to John
Bennett, the Managing Director of Pathway, for advice and support outside of Board

meetings.

48. Moreover, the formation of Pathway as a special purpose vehicle ("SPV") made our
bid unique and compelling. We were the only bidder proposing to run the project
through this method. The SPV initially had a number of shareholders who were also
key partners to the project. It had independent board representation to give an
impartial perspective but also to give confidence to the customers. The structure of
the contract as a PFI also meant that segregating the parties’ financial commitments

was easier within the SPV.

49. There were considerable risks borne by Pathway in its bid to deliver the system to

tight time scales. Pathway was relying on the customer performing their obligations;

1998 {FUJO00581 70} (WITNO388_01/07)

Q10.

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

if the customers did not perform their obligations to the correct timeframe and
specification, Pathway would be exposed to the risks of any delay incurred and would
have to seek recompense. However, Pathway would bear the risks of any of its own
delays and a failure to deliver on the project on time would result in an inevitable
delay in profitability for Pathway. Ultimately, | believe that Pathway was awarded the
contract because it was prepared to take risks to ensure the success of the project
and had the best value for money proposition of the competitors and skills to deliver
it. | did not have full visibility on the scoring and evaluation criteria for the tender until
recently. | anticipate that DSS and POCL would be best placed to explain further why

Pathway was awarded the contract.

Please explain whether you consider that ICL Pathway was the best

equipped to assist with the automation process.

50. As set out in my answers to Q8 and Q9 above, ICL had a proven track record in

51.

delivering large-scale national infrastructure projects. We had demonstrated our
ability to successfully manage multiple subcontractors and partners to produce a

cohesive project delivery team which would leverage the skills of the combined group.

We felt that the combined Pathway group, comprising both the third parties including
Girobank, De La Rue and Escher and the core ICL delivery team, had the skills
necessary to deliver the Pathway Project. We did not know precisely what our
competitors were bidding, but the government procurement process was rigorous,
and our success would suggest that we had the best proposition. Pathway was the

best-priced offer on the table and it was the only bid fully compliant with the PFI’°. It

WITN03880100

was for the clients to assess each bid and whether they regarded it as meeting the

ITT criteria.

Q11. Please set out any concerns that you had with regard to the original contract

at the time.

52. The Pathway Project was the biggest outsourcing contract that ICL had ever been
awarded. At the time we bid for and signed the contract, we believed that we could
deliver the project successfully. The delay in receiving the ITT, and subsequently
seeing the ITT's length and level of detail did cause us some concern. However, at
the time we considered that this was due to bureaucracy within the DSS as opposed
to any serious flaws with the project. With hindsight, perhaps it should have signalled
potential issues to come. We obviously considered that the project would be
challenging and that it would have its complexities, but we did not have concerns at

that time that aspects of the project could not be delivered successfully.
Initial Go live

Q12. Please explain what the Initial Go Live project involved.

53. As set out in the /CL Pathway Limited Board Minutes of a Board Meeting held on 2
September 1996 (WITN0388_01/08), the Initial Go Live ("IGL") project involved a
limited rollout of the original benefits payment card hardware and software to ten post
offices in Stroud, Gloucestershire in October 1996. Each post office had two counter
positions and in total 1500 individual social security benefits recipients were involved
in the IGL project. The initial rollout had limited functionality; the system only
supported the payment of child benefits and there was a limited volume of

transactions.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 17 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

54. We agreed the deployment of this limited project with POCL and DSS. It was rolled
out in accordance with the project plan and acted as a pilot for the wider project. The
staff of the ten post offices involved were all briefed that they would be in this initial
pilot stage and there was extensive involvement of Pathway, POCL and DSS in the

IGL project as reflected in the Pathway Monthly Reports.

Q13. Please set out the challenges and successes of the project.

55. The aim of the IGL project was to receive feedback before the wider rollout on a
number of key factors, including ease of deployment, the efficacy of the software
provided, and the adequacy of training for end-users (sub-postmasters). Large-scale
infrastructure projects such as these are almost always iterative: you run a pilot,
receive feedback and use that feedback to amend your product, processes and
training materials ready for a wider rollout. In this respect, IGL was a success as we
received feedback on many aspects of the project, including functional aspects of the

product, which fed into later changes.

56. There were inevitable challenges in the IGL meeting timescales and getting the
requisite resources released at the right time. Pilot projects such as IGL are likely to
have challenges as they represent the first time that the project defined in the contract
is physically and technically delivered. These challenges, however, gave us
opportunities to review resourcing and improve many aspects of the Pathway Project.
For example, in the /CL Pathway Limited Board Minutes of the Board Meeting held

on 25 November 1996 (WITNO388_01/09)'", under Programme Update it states:

"Mr Todd enquired whether Mr Austin had adequate resources and skills
available and Mr Austin said generally this was the case although he would like
more help from ICL's Windows NT Centre of Excellence. Mr Todd would follow

this up."

57. As illustrated from the above extract, my role was to help solve issues such as
resource problems and ensure we had sufficient access to skills that were not within
Pathway's direct control, for example from ICL or Fujitsu. A project of this scale and
complexity will likely have issues that need addressing, whether these issues relate
to software, infrastructure or training processes. The issues with Pathway were
addressed through appropriate governance processes internally and externally
including joint project meetings with the customer. Pathway faced what are normal
challenges in the course of a large-scale project and we dedicated significant time

and resource into finding solutions.

58. The success of the IGL project is evident from the fact that the key milestones were
achieved by their respective deadlines. Given the complexity of the project this was

a noteworthy achievement.

Subsequent Releases and Delays

Q14. Please set out what you understood to be the Releases that took place

during 1997-1998

59. The software functionality and integration developed by Pathway for the Pathway
Project was developed and updated throughout the life of the project, resulting in a
series of successive software releases. The process to develop and integrate
software was the responsibility of the Pathway team. Releases would be defined and

agreed with the customer project team and submitted to a normal test cycle including

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 19 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

customer acceptance tests. Issues identified would be logged and prioritised
internally and with the customers’ input. The processes deployed were consistent
with Pathway and the customers' normal business practices. As shown in the Monthly
Reports, an overview of the status of issues was shared and the process of tracking
the resolution of these issues was in place with appropriate quality assurance steps.
Final sign off of releases was the responsibility of the customers, POCL and DSS, as

documented in these reports.

60. Since between 22 and 27 years have passed since this time period, | have no
recollection of the specific releases or their timing. However, having reviewed the
disclosure documents provided by the Inquiry, my understanding is that it was clearly
anticipated that Release 1 would occur in phases throughout 1997, with Release 2
following in January 1998. It would appear from the documents that the timetable for
Release 2 slipped such that this release did not in in the end take place in 1998. The
documentary evidence is clear that Release 1 took place, at least in part, during the

period 1997-1998.

Q15. Please set out the challenges that the project faced during this period.

61. Please refer to my answer to Q16 below.

Q16. Please explain why the project was delayed, including who was responsible.

62. | believe that the challenges the project faced in 1997-1998 directly contributed to
the subsequent delays in delivering the project. Because of this, | have combined my

answers to Questions 15 and 16.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

63. In November 1997, DSS and POCL served on Pathway a formal notice of breach of
contract'*, which Pathway denied. In response, Pathway issued POCL and DSS with
a declaration, which stated that the programme in its current form was 'non-viable
commercially’ and that to compensate Pathway for the delays suffered, Pathway
required either a 30% price increase for the contract or a 5% price increase anda 5
year extension to the contract term.’? This resulted in a series of ongoing negotiations

over the future of the project.

64. In March 1998, | sent Peter Mathison, then-Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency,
a position paper’ that set out our formal position on these issues and described
clearly and firmly the challenges that we faced in trying to roll out the Pathway Project.
It was important that we had a clear statement of our position that could be shared
with the executive teams of each customer organisation, as well as any interested
parties from government. It was clear to us that we were going to struggle to reach a
resolution on these issues with the direct executive teams from POCL and DSS, but
we needed to ensure at least that all parties were aware of our position and that there

was no chance of it being misrepresented.

65. | have re-reviewed this paper as part of my preparation for producing my witness
statement and | maintain that it accurately describes the issues we faced at this time
and would refer the Inquiry to consider this in full. | have set out below the key
challenges that the project faced and the delays that they caused, and have

reproduced relevant extracts from the position paper.

Design Interference

66. One of the benefits of the PFI contract was that it was intended to allocate design
control solely to Pathway. However, when the contract was signed key parts of the
design specification had not been finalised.* As a result, the detailed design
requirements were instead refined during the course of the project. We felt at the time
that DSS and POCL both ‘interfered in the design process’ to such an extent that it

resulted in significant delays.

67. Under the PFI, Pathway was supposed to have autonomy over the project and the
customers should have been focused on what the outputs were (e.g. the actual
product in the post offices) as opposed to how those outputs were delivered.
However, we felt that the customers were treating the contract as a standard design
and build, specify and operate contract, and had frequent input on the design
process. The NAO Report also noted that the decision not to finalise the detailed
requirements before contract award was ‘a major contributor to the later problems of
the project'.’® The resulting enhancements to the design of the project had a ‘ripple
effect on the time and cost to build and operate the system’. Pathway was forced to
acquiesce to ‘avoid protracted negotiations and make as little use as possible of any
contractual protections that may involve conflict, in order to minimise delay.” We
were still at the start of the production line in terms of the Pathway Project and so
these issues would not have affected the eventual quality of the end-product, but they

did have the propensity to cause delay. We were keen to work to the projected

timeline agreed with the clients, and so we were reticent to make a stand which would

cause an inevitable delay to the rollout of the project.
CAPS

68. We believe a primary reason for the delay of the Pathway Project and the challenges
it faced was due to the DSS and the impact of its own internal technology delays,
particularly concerning CAPS (the Government's Customer Accounting Payment
System). CAPS was intended to feed benefits payment data to Pathway's Card
systems, and so it was important for the project that CAPS was available and
operational in line with the project timeline. The contract provided that the CAPS
payment programme would be available to Pathway in one single feed for integration
testing on 1 September 1996." As set out in the position paper, the CAPS computer
systems programme was not delivered in accordance with the timescales set out in
the Benefit Migration Plan. It was not until February 1997 that Pathway was notified
of the delay to the CAPS programme. The March 1997 Pathway Board meeting
minutes estimated a '£10m reduction in ICL Pathway’s revenue as a result of the

CAPS slippage.'9

69. The following passage is an extract from the /CL Pathway Limited Board Minutes of

the Board Meeting held on 25 November 1996 (WITN0388_01/13) :

"The Board noted with concern that CAPS performance - namely the benefit
rollout programme beyond child benefit - had been frozen by the DSS. This
could delay the live trial date of April and possibly the Go Live National Rollout

date of July 1997, and could have ramifications on Pathway revenues and also

some recrimination on causes which might involve Pathway and ICL. Mr Austin
subsequently said in the meeting that CAPS delays had been an underlying

problem all along for the customer."

70. The availability and implementation of CAPS was fundamental to the viability of the
Pathway Project. | stated in the position paper that ‘had Pathway known the true
position it is doubtful whether Pathway would have entered into the Contract’ and |
maintain this. However, | set out in further detail at paragraph 109 below the reasons
why we did not consider it prudent to sue for a breach of contract caused by these
delays. The issues we experienced with CAPS demonstrates the lack of transparency
exhibited by the DSS and the knock-on effect on Pathway's adherence to the
contractual terms of the tender. Had DSS informed us of the delay to the CAPS
programme, Pathway would have been relieved of ‘the coercive effect of the
aggressive timetable’, which ‘drove Pathway to minimise delay and absorb additional

cost without proper recourse. 2°

DSS/POCL relationship

71. In the position paper (WITNO388_01/11), | emphasised that Pathway entered into a
contract with what it understood was a unified client comprised of POCL and DSS. In
reality, we quickly realised after the project began that the clients’ core business
ethos, objectives and priorities were not aligned. This resulting conflict became ‘one
of the primary causes’ of the project's delay and was a considerable challenge to

the success of the project.

72. | acknowledge that Pathway must take responsibility for entering into a contract with
two distinct customers. With the benefit of hindsight, we should not have done this.
We did not fully anticipate the diverging priorities of what we thought were two aligned
government entities. Although we entered into the contract in good faith, it created
complexities that we did not expect, albeit perhaps we could have had greater

foresight as to the potential issues that could arise.
Post Office infrastructure

73. There were significant issues with the Post Office's own infrastructure. During
installation work, it became clear that many post office premises were not fit for
hardware installation and DSS/POCL did not factor this into the timeframe for

completion of the contract.

74. In the December 1997 Monthly Report, these issues were highlighted as ‘critical’ to
resolve. The report again noted the ‘difficulties within the Post Office estate’ regarding
‘the poor physical condition of the vast majority of the Post Offices’, and that ‘the
appetite to confront this head on within POCL has yet to be seen'2? By March 1998,
the Monthly Report stated that these issues had escalated into a ‘major dispute’: 'the
total cost for putting their estate into a fit purpose for automation is on the wrong side

of £40m'.23
75. In the same month, the issue was also set out clearly in the position paper:

"POCL could not reasonably have believed that the Post Office premises were

fit for automation and did not give Pathway a proper opportunity to investigate

the physical condition of the POCL premises for itself before entering into the
contract ... it would appear to be impossible to automate all post offices in

their current role."24

76. We felt that this was yet another issue which was not fully declared at the time of the

tender, but that resulted in a delay and additional costs beyond Pathway's control.

Bugs, defects and other issues

77. \nany IT project, there will be bugs, defects and other issues to resolve. These issues
become apparent through product testing and trial launches and are expected as part
of the product and service development process. This was no different on a major
national infrastructure project such as the Pathway Project. To deal with these issues
as they arose, Pathway had a clear process as part of its existing governance
structure. Each issue encountered was reviewed, prioritised according to severity and
then addressed by the team and all releases were ultimately signed off by POCL and

DSS

78. During the monthly board meetings we would have reviewed the total outstanding
number of bugs, their priority and also a general description of what they were. We
were assured through our governance and oversight processes that the fixes for
these were being handled appropriately. The technical team was experienced in both

diagnostics and resolving these issues.

79. The progress of these fixes was well documented in the Monthly Reports. By way of
example, the December 1997 monthly report set out the following issues: ‘ive

experience over the last few weeks of Release 1c has as expected thrown up a list

% Letter to Peter Mathison dated 6 March 1998 enclosing a Position Paper dated 5 March 1998, page 8 {POLO0031117}

of operational, procedural and minor software errors which require careful attention.
The total list is higher than expected and the pressure now falls on customer service
to manage the operational introduction of the various fixes’2° The January 1998
Monthly Report provided an update on these issues: 'Substantial progress has been
made with Release 1c over the last four weeks with a large number of major
operational issues successfully fixed. This system is now much more operationally

easy to use by the counter staff and this should help considerably...'26

ICL's own delays and development activities

80. There were some delays on the Pathway Project that resulted in adjustments to the
programme. For example, ICL suffered delays to the scheduled software releases
and greater-than-expected difficulty in supporting these new releases. In the
December 1997 Monthly Report, the Board noted that ‘considerable effort has been
expended in identifying the hardware required to support the NR2 plan... the majority
of this additional equipment must be purchased and installed within the next few
weeks otherwise serious delays will occur. This represents a considerable
challenge. 2’ These issues continued into 1998, where the Monthly Report for March
noted ‘severe problems with EPOSS testing within Pathway and linking through to
reference data within POCL have caused a delay of between three and five weeks to

the schedule... this area will remain extremely difficult for some time.?® Every time

that there were challenges like these they were addressed by the Pathway executive

team.

These issues had a knock-on effect on the timescales and, at times, contributed to the
project's delays. However, the ICL Board made it very clear that Pathway was not
limited to Pathway resources and that it could access ICL/Fujitsu resources as required
to make the project work. Although there was a plan and a budget for this project, we
were determined to make the project a success and so the use of additional resources
was encouraged and utilised. Providing additional resource takes some time in terms
of recruitment, training and familiarisation, and so our recruitment efforts would have

involved some delay.

Change of government

81. In May 1997, during the initial stages of the Pathway Project, the Labour party won
the general election and formed a government, taking over from the previous
Conservative government. The Conservative Secretary of State for Social Security,
Peter Lilley, had championed the upgrade of the benefits payment systems since the
Conservative Party Conference in 1994. However, following the general election we
felt that there was no longer a political champion of the project within the new
government. This contributed to further delays as there was no clear impetus to push

the project, particularly the smart card, forward from within DSS.

Q17. Please explain any concerns regarding profitability of the project at this

time.

82. At the time of the contract award, Pathway was aware of the risks of a PFI contract
and that we were accountable for those risks. We were conscious that the project

would not become profitable for Pathway until we had commenced rollout of the

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 28 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

project”9, and that this added a time pressure to the project. Unfortunately, a number
of factors including the delays suffered as a result of DSS delivering CAPS, the quality
of the Post Office estate, and the effect of customer indecision had a direct influence
on the project timeline and therein the profitability of the project for Pathway. As is

set out in Pathway's December 1997 Monthly Report:

"Given the lack of planned roll out activity in 1998, we have a duty to mitigate our
own costs and those of our subcontractors. That means battening down the

hatches and, in some cases, getting rid of people we will not need for 12 months.*°

83. Under the PFI contract, Pathway could not begin receiving revenue until the services
were operational and being used in post offices nationally. The financial issues

Pathway faced are explained in my March 1998 position paper:*"

"The global effect of all these issues is that Pathway is facing revenue loss and
increased costs which run into hundreds of millions of pounds... the plain truth is
that, despite all Pathway's efforts and achievements, Pathway will not be able to

earn its rightful revenue because CAPS is not available."

84. Under the terms of the PFI, Pathway secured loan facilities of £200 million®* to fund
the cost of performing the contract. A delay in rollout meant an inevitable delay in
revenue for Pathway and necessitated that Pathway draw against the loan at a much

faster rate than anticipated. These concerns were escalated to the Board of Directors

of ICL, as well as Pathway's shareholders. This is why Pathway engaged in a series

of discussions with the government on resetting the terms of the contract.

85. These discussions culminated with a formal declaration of our contractual position on
19 December 1997, set out in more detail at paragraph 63. My position paper of
March 1998* built upon this declaration, as set out in more detail in my responses to

Q15 and Q16 above.

86. In addition, all of the challenges that the Pathway Project faced that had the potential
to cause delay to the project (and which | have explained in my answers to Q15 and

Q16 above) had an impact on its profitability.

Renegotiation of the Pathway Project

Q18. What was your understanding of the reasons for DSS’s withdrawal from the

project?

87. My view at the time was that the DSS was struggling with its own technology projects
and had assessed that a clean break from the commitment to the benefit card system
would allow it to focus on its other priorities and would enable DSS to be disconnected
from the project as a primary contractor. As | mentioned in response to Q16 above,
the project did not have a DSS champion in the new Labour government. The DSS's
withdrawal aligned with the new political environment and avoided the optics of

Labour taking on responsibility for a prior Conservative government initiative.

88. It was also clear to the three parties at the time that the contractual arrangement was
not working effectively. The issues between the parties were frequently referenced in

the Monthly Reports. The December 1997 report noted that ‘three way or often four

way debates where gridlock prevents anything happening™4, and that ‘the alternative
to a new deal is termination, which means we sue them and they sue us, a press
bonanza, PFI fallout..."°°. The March 1998 report stated that there was ‘a harder
edge to almost all programme interactions with PDA and sponsors. *®® and that ‘some
of the tensions between the customers over not resolving contract issues are

visible'.37

Q19. What was your understanding of the assertion referred to in BEIS0000283

that ICL was in breach of contract and on what basis was this assertion rejected?

89. | understood that DSS believed Pathway to be in breach of contract due to the delays
suffered by the project and the impact that this had on the timescales for delivery.
However, we strongly rejected this accusation, as can be seen in Exhibit
WITN0388_01/18 (Letter from Keith Todd to Stephen Byers MP dated 16 September
1998). At that time, we felt that we were addressing all requirements of the contract

but that we were being frustrated in our delivery by the other parties to the contract.

90. This position is supported by a number of letters that | received from colleagues and
professional acquaintances at the time of the breakdown of the contract and once
news of the withdrawal of DSS was publicised. | have exhibited these letters to my

witness statement as Exhibits WITN0388_01/19 to WITN0388_01/21.

91. In Exhibit WITNO388_01/19, a letter from Sir David Hancock to me dated 3 June

1999, Sir David notes that ‘CL were very badly treated by the Benefits Agency and

the Post Office’. Sir David was a highly respected senior civil servant and it was telling
that an individual who had no economic benefit in Pathway believed we were being
very badly treated. Similarly, in Exhibit WITN0388_01/20, a letter from Sir Michael
Butler to me (the former chairman of Pathway and an experienced civil servant and
diplomat) dated 4 June 1999, Sir Michael states that 'it was an amazing achievement
to steer this wretched government machine home to port’. These letters exemplify
the difficulty experienced by ICL in negotiating with government, and the collective

frustration felt even by those who were indirectly involved with the project.

92. This frustration is set out most clearly in a letter dated 1 June 1999 from Tadashi
Sekizawa, then-Chairman of Fujitsu (Exhibit WITNO388_01/21). Mr Sekizawa stated
that he was 'fiercely enraged with the UK Government, that you had to spend so
much of your time, effort and costs in vain, all because of the irresponsibility of their
Departments, blaming it on each other.' Mr Sekizawa also acknowledged that ICL is
not much to blame regarding the failures of the project in the past' but ‘the actual

impact on our performance is significant.’

93. | believed — and still maintain — that Pathway had entered into the contract with the
intention to deliver it successfully and had not breached this. The issues we faced in
making the Pathway Project led to considerable pressure on our performance under

the contract.

Q20. Are you aware of the suggestion in BEIS0000255 that ICL was "set up as the
fall guy to take the blame for project delays"? What did you understand to be the

positions of the various parties in this respect?

94. | do not believe that the DSS set out to deliberately damage ICL or blame ICL for the

delays to the project. However, the damage to ICL was an inevitable by-product of

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 32 of 62

the DSS's reluctance to own up to the implications of its failings. | found it incredibly
frustrating that issues such as the delay to the CAPS programme were not properly

considered by the DSS to be a major factor in the breakdown of the contract.

95. It is clear from the documentary evidence that Pathway, DSS and POCL disagreed
significantly on the causes of the delays to the project. These disagreements led to
my writing the March 1998 position paper (WITN0388_01/11) to try to resolve the

issues we faced.

96. Ultimately, we felt that ICL, Fujitsu and POCL were all committed to finding a positive

solution. This is exemplified by Mr Sekizawa's sentiment in Exhibit WITN0388_01/21:

"it would be more beneficial for the Fujitsu Group to tolerantly negotiate
with the government, and keep our chance to try recover the past debt with
our own efforts. [...] We must learn from our experiences, and thus gather
all of the strengths within the Fujitsu Group to overwhelm our challenges,
and achieve profit for ICL in the total project... this should be an

outstanding infrastructure for the UK Government and the Post Office."

97. Attimes during the negotiation process, | felt that DSS were not committed to finding
a positive solution to the issues we faced. This lack of commitment, coupled with the
reluctance of DSS to acknowledge its own failings (particularly with CAPS), led to the

belief that ICL was being set up to bear the brunt of the blame.

Q21. What is your view of the NAO report on the cancellation of the Benefits

Payment Card?
98. | can see from the date of the NAO report that it was published around the time at

which | left ICL. However, | am not aware of the material that was provided to the

individuals such as Sir Michael Butler.

99. | do not recall being interviewed by anyone at the NAO nor being asked to provide
any comment on the report before its publication. | would have been happy to assist
the investigation. However, | have located a reference within the minutes of a
Pathway monthly board meeting dated 15 September 1999 (WITN0388_01/22), to
my seeing a "Mr Bourne of the National Audit Office" where | noted that "in this
process ICL had to retain credibility and try to avoid any criticism of its
position." However, due to the passage of time | am unable to provide any further
information on this meeting, or ICL's engagement with the NAO during the course of

its investigation.

100.1 did not read the report at the time it was published, but | have read it as part of my
preparation for this witness statement. | am surprised that the NAO did not consider
the CAPS issues to be a significant factor in the breakdown of the contract. The report
acknowledged that CAPS compounded ‘the complexity, challenges and risks of the
programme as a whole’ but that the NAO ‘found no evidence that from February 1997
onwards the releases of the CAPS software had delayed the implementation of the
Payment Card. | find this conclusion remarkable as the CAPS programme was

delayed and this directly affected Pathway's ability to earn revenue.

Q22. What is your response to the allegations in BEIS0000275 that (i) ICL were

fudging their financial reporting (ii) that you would lose your job should Horizon

“go down” and (iii) that Fujitsu would divest themselves of ICL?

101.1 have reviewed this document as part of my preparation for this witness statement,
but | do not recall Katherine Hathaway and | know that there was absolutely no
‘fudging’ of ICL's financial reporting. | am not clear what the basis for such a
suggestion is, but it may be that Ms Hathaway was referring to the accounts filing

date, which may have been delayed (although | cannot now recall this).

102. This period of renegotiation was tense at times and there were undoubtedly difficult
conversations with Fujitsu regarding the future of the project. However, at no point
did | fear that | would lose my job over the project. We were determined to find a path
forward that avoided a legal dispute with the government and Fujitsu supported us to
try and salvage the project and return it to profitability. | was most impressed with the

support and understanding Fujitsu provided.

103. There was a risk that Fujitsu might divest itself of ICL, not least owing to the fact that
the withdrawal of DSS cost ICL (and, inter alia, Fujitsu) £180 million, but | was
confident that we would find a resolution. As set out in WITN0388_01/23, a record of
my phone call to the British Ambassador to Japan in January 1999, | expressed my
concern that Fujitsu would consider selling ICL if the Pathway Project failed. We were
conscious that if we did not come to an agreement to progress with the Pathway
Project there might at best be an impact on future inward investment, and at worst
the break-up and sale of ICL. It is clear from this document that the ambassador
privately agreed with my assessment. It was critical that all in government understood
the severity of the situation for ICL and that the issues would be dealt with properly

and that we would not be brushed aside.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

104. The focal point of all conversations | had with Fujitsu were about how we could
negotiate a way forward that would enable the project to be successful for all parties.
The revised contract had POCL as the single contractor, eliminating the significant
issues that we faced with two customers. The new contract also converted the
agreement from a PFI to a more standard design, build and operate contract.
Through the negotiations, including my discussion with the Ambassador, my aim was
to try and get the government to act expeditiously and be more aware of the
seriousness of the situation, which would not have just affected the Pathway Project
but posed a risk to the UK as an investment location and as a pioneer of PFI. An
extended legal battle would have made the project inoperable and work would have
been suspended. This would have had an impact on ICL's planned float and was
another reason that ICL eventually accepted the £180 million hit. In the end, a

resolution was achieved in May 1999.

105. Ultimately, the Pathway Project may have been ICL's ‘argest and most significant?
contract, but it was not the only project on ICL's roster at that time. In May 1998, ICL
entered a three-year alliance with Microsoft as part of a ‘collaboration with software
products in four ‘go to market' areas (Retail, Education, Infrastructure and Public
Sector)#"; a deal which was expected to create 1000 new jobs over its lifetime. The
business was described in WITNO388_01/26 as ‘making good progress'‘’ despite the
‘huge drain on resources’ from the Pathway Project. | was confident that ICL could

leverage its other projects and continue on a positive trajectory.

Q23. What impact did the withdrawal of DSS have on the viability of the project?

WITN03880100

106. After the withdrawal of DSS, the Pathway Project was reset in an agreement with
POCL in May 1999. From that point onwards, the withdrawal of DSS had no further
impact on the project - the project was now the sole responsibility of POCL and
Pathway. The impact of the DSS's withdrawal was that the contract was simplified in

that Pathway now had one customer with one distinct aim.

107. The reset project was not renegotiated as a PFI contract. The proposal to replace the
PFI with a standard design, build and operate contract came from the Treasury
(whose involvement is explained in the following paragraphs) and was not requested
by Pathway. This meant that Pathway no longer carried the PFI revenue risks of the
project. DSS were still involved with the project to the extent that its systems were
linked with the banking service to support social security payments. These
arrangements were then POCL's responsibility. DSS was no longer a client of
Pathway and | felt that the dependency on DSS for the payment system did not cause

any further direct impacts on revenue.

Q24. What was the reaction from Fujitsu’s corporate leadership?

108. Fujitsu had full visibility on the progress of the Pathway Project. As we started
experiencing difficulties, there was concern from Fujitsu's leadership about ensuring
the project was delivered successfully. As set out in the letter from David Sibbick to
Secretary of State, Mr McCartney, dated 9 April 1999 (WITN0388_01/27), prior to the
formal decision to withdraw from the project, Fujitsu were preparing to make a
provision of £300 million in the ICL accounts for 1998-1999: ‘sufficient to make that
company insolvent.' This provision would also flow through to the Fujitsu consolidated

accounts. The success of the Pathway Project had clear commercial implications for

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 37 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

Fujitsu. This concern increased over time as the relationship between Pathway and

the customers started to deteriorate.

109. When we started having issues with the contract and the negotiations over the future
of the contract began in earnest, | had a long conversation with Michio Naruto, the
then-deputy chair of Fujitsu and ICL Chairman regarding our options. | explained that
we could not withdraw from the project without being in breach of the contract, and
as such our options were to sue the Government for breach of contract or look for a
compromise and engage constructively with negotiations. Suing the government
would have created significant complexities and delayed the intended float and | did
not consider it necessary — it was very much an option of last resort. As is evidenced
in Exhibit WITN0388_01/21, we came to the agreement to continue with negotiations

and find an amicable solution.

110.At all times | believe that Fujitsu were supportive of doing the right thing for the
customer as well as supporting ICL and Pathway's management, who they believed
were doing the best that they could in difficult circumstances. | was impressed with
the Pathway executive team who kept going through this very difficult time, trying to
deliver the project while the tension with the customers was ongoing and the

negotiations continued.

Q25. Please describe the discussions that took place with Her Majesty’s

Government at this time?

111.1 understand that this question relates to the discussions that took place in 1998-1999

resulting in the withdrawal of DSS from the Pathway Project.

112. There were approximately 18 months to two years' worth of discussions, taking place

either side of the general election in May 1997. We sought constructively to find a

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 38 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

solution that worked for each of the parties and our priority at all times was the
success of the Pathway Project. The discussions were extensive at both a political
and an executive level, including my phone call to the British Ambassador to Japan
in January 1999 (set out in more detail at paragraph 103 above). There was also a
visit from Mr Naruto and myself to Tony Blair in April 1999 to express our desire to
find an amicable solution to the issues the project faced. In March 1998, we clearly
articulated Pathway's position in writing in the position paper so that there would be

no ambiguity or misunderstanding for all of the parties involved.

113.POCL were supportive of reaching a resolution but DSS needed more
encouragement to get to that point. There was a lingering tension between the parties
during these discussions as the POCL management team felt aggrieved at how they
had been treated in the settlement. At times, discussions were fraught and neither
government department wanted to fund the solution. The involvement of the Treasury
finally helped to facilitate the solution. However, there was a consistent determination

from ICL and POCL to find a way forward to make the Pathway Project a success.

Q26. What was your understanding of the different positions within Government?

114. The objectives of the Pathway Project differed between government departments.
One of the issues we faced was that POCL was funded by the Department of Trade
and Industry ("DTI"), whereas DSS had its own funding from the Treasury. For POCL
and the DTI, the project was vital for reinventing and regenerating the Post Office for
the new millennium. For DSS and the Treasury, the aims were to reduce benefit fraud
and upgrade the existing infrastructure to pay benefits recipients in the most efficient

way.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 39 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

115.1 felt that the project issues, particularly from the DSS side, were compounded by the
election of a new government in May 1997, which did not want to be contaminated
by a problem that it could reasonably position as being created by its Conservative

predecessor.

116.Steve Robson, Second Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, was instrumental in
finding a solution. | recall his involvement was pragmatic and he was able to provide
new funding from the Treasury to support a resolution of the dispute, which took

pressure off DSS and POCL.

Q27. Overall, to what extent did the withdrawal of DSS have on the pressures

(time, financial and/or other pressures) to get Horizon in place and rolled out?

117. The withdrawal of DSS simplified the project by creating one single customer with
whom the revised baseline plan was agreed. | do not consider that the withdrawal of
DSS affected the pressures to roll out the Pathway Project. Moreover, once the
contract was renegotiated both parties knew what was required of them and had an

agreed timetable for rollout.

Q28. What impact did the decision to scrap the benefits payment card undermine

the fit of the product to the problem? Was the architecture still appropriate?

118. The payment card was just one aspect of the Pathway Project. It was separate from
the primary infrastructure of the project and we were able to restructure the project
to exclude the payment card. As such, | do not believe that the decision to scrap the
benefits payment card undermined the fit of the product for automation. The product
was still fit for purpose: the physical architecture, the software system and the

accounting behind it still worked with an alternative payment mechanism.

Q29. Please describe the process involved in reaching the codified agreement

with POCL.

119. The outline’? that POCL provided with its 24 May 1999 proposal document gave a
deadline of 16 July 1999 to agree a project plan. The work in agreeing a project plan
was undertaken by the Pathway executive team and approved by the Pathway board
and the POCL executive team in July 1999 as agreed. A huge amount of work went
into the realignment of that contract in order to make it into a project and plan that

would work for both ICL and POCL.

Q30. To what extent did POCL define the requirements of the project?

120. The requirements of the project were discussed with POCL and agreed between both
parties. These conversations fed into the new project plan and codified contract.
POCL was the primary customer and the driver of requirements and was involved in
all aspects of the revised plan. | recall that there were weekly meetings on various

aspects of the new plan involving POCL and Pathway.
Summer of 1999

Q31. Please describe the position with respect to the Horizon Project by the

summer of 1999?

121.In order to assist with my response to this question | have relied upon the documents
provided to me by the Inquiry, as due to the passage of time | do not now recall the

status of the Project at that time.

(WITNO388_01/28)

122. Following the signature of the codified agreement on 16 July 1999, by the summer of
1999, both ICL and POCL were working on implementation of the Pathway Project
as a priority. As set out in /CL Pathway Bringing Technology to Post Office Counters
& Benefit Payments - Monthly Progress Report, June 1999 (WITNO388_01/29),
POCL was still unhappy about the way it was treated by the government and DSS
and a lot of work was going into improving the relationship between Pathway and

POCL under the new contract.

123.The main priorities of Pathway at this time were decommissioning the benefits
payment card aspect of the project, setting up the live trial, and working towards
formal acceptance of the Pathway Project ("Acceptance"). Acceptance‘? indicated
the point at which POCL was content that Pathway had fulfilled its contractual
obligations in the development of the Pathway Project. POCL agreeing Acceptance
of the product would, under the terms of the contract, trigger the national rollout of

the Pathway Project and payment to Pathway.

124. From the documents provided to me by the Inquiry, | note that Acceptance would be
reached by POCL agreeing that Pathway had met a specific set of contractual
targets, which had to be successfully achieved within what was termed the
Acceptance Phase“+. These targets included the completion of a number of
‘acceptance tests’ and the expiry of both the 'Core Observation Period’ (to last 8
weeks from 31 May 1999) and ‘Operational Trial Review Period’ (beginning 3 weeks

immediately following the end of the Core Observation Period). The Acceptance

Phase had a deadline of 16 August 1999, following which national rollout was

scheduled to commence on 23 August 1999.

125.Within the Acceptance targets there was a maximum threshold for defects (or
‘incidents') raised by POCL in order for Acceptance to be achieved. The specification
stated that Acceptance would not be achieved if there were (i) one or more high
severity deficiencies or (ii) more than 20 medium severity deficiencies (‘category A’
and 'B' faults, respectively). There was also an absolute limit of 10 medium severity
deficiencies in respect of any one Acceptance Specification (as defined in Schedule

6 of WITN0388_01/30).

126. There were consequences for failing to achieve these targets: if Acceptance was not
reached by the end of the Operational Trial Review Period, Pathway would be entitled
to an additional three months to remedy the defaults and the project would undergo
additional testing (the "Second Acceptance Test"). If Acceptance was not achieved
at the end of the Second Acceptance Test, POCL would have the right to terminate
the agreement. There was no ‘de facto’ or deemed acceptance: POCL had to formally

agree that the project was sufficiently acceptable for it to be accepted and rolled out.

127.Under the new agreement, there was a final deadline for Acceptance of 15 November
199945. A payment of £68 million was due to be paid to Pathway upon Acceptance

and so it was a crucial part of the project for ICL.

Q32. What was your knowledge of any bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon

system at this time?

* Sch. 5 to the letter from Keith Baines to Bruce McNiven & Ors. Dated 11 June 1999, page 19 (WITN0388_01/30)

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

WITN03880100
WITN03880100

128.As set out in response to Q31, Acceptance was crucial to the project's success and
ICL took the Acceptance requirements very seriously. Each bug, error or defect
detected in the system (whether reported by end-users or the Pathway Project team)

was reviewed, prioritised according to its severity, and then scheduled to be fixed:

"All high-impact problems now have full Pathway-wide visibility and dedicated
Problem Managers. A weekly report is published which tracks the progress of each

of these. "46

129. By virtue of my role in ICL and my receipt of the Monthly Reports, | was aware that
there were bugs and errors within the Pathway system. In terms of specific issues, |
was aware at the time from reading these reports that there were recurring issues
with weekly balancing, printing and screen freezes.4” However, issues such as these
are part of the normal development process of any software project and we had full
visibility on the resolution of these issues. Updates on the resolution of these issues

were also provided in the Monthly Reports: '...a marked improvement in the sub-
postmasters’ satisfaction with the balancing process [...] the sub-postmasters
perception of the system and ourselves has improved this month, helped mainly by

the office visits and system changes implemented this month.’ 48

130. All issues were discussed with the POCL project representatives at regular meetings.
| was satisfied that both within Pathway and from the customer's side, there was a

proper process for resolving issues.

131.Moreover, ICL's £68 million Acceptance cash payment was dependent on our
meeting the Acceptance specification and therein resolving any deficiencies located
in the system. It was in Pathway's interest to resolve these bugs and issues

effectively.

Q33. What did you understand the ‘acceptance incident list’ and ‘hot list’ referred
to in FUJ00058149 to be? Do you know whether these issues persisted at the time

of the roll out of Horizon?

132.| have no specific recollection of these terms, however from reading the documents
provided to me by the Inquiry, | understand that the ‘acceptance incident list! was a
list comprising all of the incidents that we were working to resolve during the
Acceptance Phase. Acceptance Incidents were defined in the contract with POCL as
‘any unusual or undesirable occurrence, or request for advice and guidance, which
has been reported in writing by POCL to the Contractor for analysis in respect of an
Acceptance Test.'#9 Although we could achieve Acceptance as long as we had fewer
than 20 'medium' severity incidents still outstanding, it was beneficial to have a clear

overview of the issues being raised.

133.1 also understand from the documents provided to me that the ‘hot list’ was the
prioritisation of critical and mandatory fixes that we had to resolve during the

Acceptance Phase in order to achieve Acceptance.

134. As set out in my answer to Q32 above, the Monthly Reports provided regular updates

on these lists. All known issues were documented and prioritised in conjunction with

the POCL team. Acceptance was achieved on 24 September 1999° indicating that
these issues were resolved in line with POCL's Acceptance requirements at that point

in time.

Q34. What did you understand of the acceptance incident categorised as ‘High’

referred to on p.19 of FUJ00003633?

135.1 was on the Pathway board so | would have received a copy of the Board Report,
but | do not recall what | understood of this incident at the time (June 1999). Although
the incident was described as ‘serious’, the Update also sets out how this incident
was being addressed: ‘considerable effort is being applied to improve and simplify
the business process, the software, the documentation and to improve training.’ This
would suggest that the issue wasn't limited to a defect or software bug, but was also

an issue with end-user training and the business process itself.

136. Exhibit WITNO388_01/29, the Monthly Report from June 1999 also explains in detail

the measures we took to resolve this incident:

"...we will be adding a further new 24 Post Offices during the week
commencing 19% July. This group is there to check that all the changes we
have made concerning balancing, training, documentation and printing have
had the desired effect, and when introduced to brand new counter staff it does
allow them to deal with their business processes without a repetition of the early
difficulties. If following careful assessment this is successful it will pave the way

to remove the critical high severity acceptance incidents."5"

137.| understand that there may be other documents setting out the nature of this incident,
but | have only reviewed those provided to me by the Inquiry. The minutes and the
Monthly Report (WITN0388_01/29) reflect that this issue was being dealt with as a
priority in order to achieve Acceptance. In the end, Acceptance was delayed from the
original date of 16 August 1999 due to these incidents. As this incident was classed
as High, Acceptance could not be achieved until it had been resolved. Ultimately

Acceptance was achieved on 24 September 1999 after only a short delay.

Q35. What did you understand of the three high severity incidents that had not

been resolved referred to in FUJ00003631?

138.Due to the passage of time | am unable to recall the specifics of these incidents.
However, | anticipate that we would have discussed these incidents during the
monthly Board meetings, considering that by virtue of their classification as ‘high
severity’ they were a barrier to Acceptance. As set out in paragraph 125, we would
have dealt with high severity incidents as a priority. Pathway was sufficiently
comfortable with its position in respect of resolving these high severity incidents that
we were prepared to agree a £20 million indemnity, representing POCL's maximum
possible exposure in the event that these incidents were not resolved and this

delayed Acceptance.*°?

Q36. To what extent did you consider Horizon to be suitable to be rolled out in the

autumn and winter of 1999?

139.As | have noted above, Acceptance took place on 24 September 1999. This

represented POCL's final approval of the test stages of the Pathway Project and

CL Plc Board Minutes of the Board Meeting held on 15 September 1999, page 2, para 3(d) {FUJ00003631}(WITNO388_01/22)

WITN03880100

signalled that it was ready to be rolled out nationally and that any outstanding ‘high
severity’ incidents had been resolved and the threshold for other outstanding

acceptance incidents had not been exceeded.

140. Unlike with the previous PFI contract, ICL's financial reward for the project was not
tied to the number of payments made through the system once operational. We did
not need to rush the project through for it to be profitable and it was not in our interests
to do so. Ultimately, the decision to roll out the Pathway Project was POCL's and the

rollout taking place demonstrated an implicit acceptance of its suitability for rollout.

Q37. What was your understanding of POCL’s level of knowledge of issues with

Horizon at this time?

141. As set out above in my response to Q32, the categorisation and rectification of issues,
bugs and defects was an integral part of the Acceptance process of which POCL had
ultimate oversight. Acceptance could take place with fewer than 20 outstanding
medium or 'category B' faults, as long as a timetable had been agreed to resolve
these faults.5° There was no corresponding threshold for minor faults. This means
that POCL could grant Acceptance notwithstanding that issues remained in the
system to be resolved. As such, the review and rectification of issues continued
following formal Acceptance and into the rollout phase of the project with POCL's full
knowledge. It is very common on large scale implementation projects to have more

minor issues resolved at a later date.

142. As referred to in the documents provided to me by the Inquiry, the primary method of

recording issues following rollout was through the Horizon System Helpdesk for end-

users. Each call to the Helpdesk was reviewed by the Helpdesk team. The Helpdesk
team would provide problem and fault diagnosis™ prioritised according to severity
within agreed classification levels®>: A — business is disrupted and the caller cannot
continue normal working; B — business is impaired but a workaround is available; or
C - business is suffering only minor inconvenience. All reported incidents had to be
resolved within agreed service performance levels®® and there was ongoing
monitoring of all Helpdesk calls to ensure that repeat or consequential problems did
not occur.5” There were also regular project meetings between Pathway and POCL
at which all aspects of the project were discussed including the resolution of any

outstanding issues.

143.Every call to the Helpdesk was formally logged and retained and the Helpdesk
service was monitored and reviewed monthly as a way of analysing the Pathway
Project's performance. This review was presented to POCL at the end of every
monthly reporting period.5* As such, POCL received regular updates on performance

and was abreast of the issues facing the Pathway Project at that time.

defined in the updated Pathway Project contract as ‘the implementation of the POCL
Service Infrastructure and/or a POCL Service in Outlets.°9 Rollout was a clearly
defined process run by the Pathway executive team in conjunction with POCL, which
combined the deployment of physical equipment and software releases with the

training of end-user staff.

145.Upon Acceptance of the Core System Release®, the Release Authorisation Board
would decide whether to authorise national rollout of the Core System. As part of the
contract renegotiation, Pathway confirmed that following this Acceptance rollout
would be undertaken as quickly as possible.*' Pathway agreed to produce a plan for
rollout and a schedule for implementation that dictated which post offices would

receive the product.®2

146. There were a series of major urban areas nominated to receive rollout first: West
Midlands; Greater Manchester; Merseyside; Leeds/Bradford; Tyne and Wear;
Glasgow/Edinburgh and South Wales. Installation within the M25 would take place in

the second half of the overall rollout timetable.®

147. Pathway agreed to deliver training and support to POCL staff and end-users during
the rollout period, including distribution of a Horizon User Guide created by POCL for

its end-users.

Q39. Who was responsible for the decision to roll out Horizon at the time?

148. As the client, POCL was responsible for this decision. It was not in ICL's gift to decide
when to roll out the Pathway Project, as this depended on POCL agreeing that the

conditions for Acceptance (as set out at paragraphs 123 — 127 above) had been met.

Q40. Was the roll out considered a success at the time?

149. The roll out was considered a success at the time. As set out in the /CL Pathway
Limited Board Minutes of the Board Meeting held on 23 February 2000
(WITN0O388_01/34), we reported good progress against the business plan: ‘Rollout
of the Horizon systems into Post Offices had reached 300 post offices in a single
week... there are currently no major issues threatening this progress. Post Office
masters/sub post masters were adapting well and Post Office Management attitudes

were improving.’

150.As is usual in any project, we were still dealing with Acceptance issues and these
were being reviewed and prioritised in the normal way. The Pathway Project was
hugely ambitious but had been rolled out successfully in spite of the issues we had

faced.

Q41. What factors do you consider influenced the timing and pace of the rollout?

151.POCL ultimately made the final decision on the timing and pace of rollout. However,
factors such as the contract renegotiation had an unavoidable impact on the timing.
Once we had a finalised the renegotiated contract with POCL all parties worked hard

to implement rollout expeditiously.

152. Ultimately, | think that the agreed parameters around Acceptance had the biggest

impact on the timing of the rollout. We could not progress to national rollout until

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 61 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

POCL had granted Acceptance, and so any ‘high’ or 'medium' issues that breached
the threshold for Acceptance caused an inevitable delay to the timing and pace of the

rollout.

Q42. What role did the need to generate profits and ICL’s planned floatation play

in the timing and pace of rollout?

153. It was obviously important for ICL's reputation to deliver the project successfully and
broadly on time. However, it was also one project in the whole of ICL's multi-billion
pound portfolio at that time. ICL's survival was not contingent on rolling out Horizon
quickly. It is important to reiterate that the timetable for delivery was dictated by the
project plan set by POCL in Schedule 5 of the Heads of Agreement
(WITN0388_01/30). In the normal course of business, there may be a negative
impact on profits if you do not deliver projects on time, but there was no artificial need

to speed up the pace of the rollout in order to generate profits.

154.In my view, the planned flotation of ICL did not affect the timing and pace of the
project. As set out above, a successful project is beneficial for a company's reputation
and no doubt a good reference point for a proposed stock market float. Although |
noted in my call to the UK Ambassador to Japan® that the failure of Horizon may
‘undermine’ the flotation of ICL, ICL had many successful projects already and the
status of the Pathway Project was not a deciding factor in whether or not to float the
company. This decision took place in mid-2000, after the rollout had already

commenced successfully, and the decision was made at that time due to the market

conditions after the turn of the millennium, as well as in my view a desire to create

“one Fujitsu".

Q43. To what extent was there any political pressure to achieve the rollout at that

time?

155.1 do not recall any political pressure after the settlement with DSS took place in May
1999. After POCL and Pathway had renegotiated the contract and DSS had
withdrawn from the Pathway Project, Pathway was free from the political pressure
that had clouded the project and was able to focus on delivering it successfully for

POCL, the sole client.

Q44. To what extent were you aware of continuing technical incidents at this

time?

156. The Pathway Board of Directors received the Monthly Reports and so I, and the rest
of the Pathway executive, was aware of technical incidents. However, this knowledge
did not extend beyond the high-level summaries that we received in the Monthly
Reports. The Pathway team was an experienced team which had appropriate

business processes in place to resolve technical incidents.

157.The Customer Service team dealt with all technical incidents. The governance
process within Pathway ensured that any serious incidents were given high priority
and were addressed accordingly. Technical incidents are common practice in
software infrastructure rollouts and it is my understanding that this governance
process was robust and that issues were reviewed, addressed and resolved as they

were discovered.

Q45. What was your knowledge of any bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 83 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

system at this time?

158.As set out in my response to Q44 above, | received updates on bugs, errors and
defects by way of the Monthly Reports. In terms of specific issues, | was aware at the
time from reading these reports that we were still experiencing some issues, for
example with Reference Data errors which at the time were ‘causing major problems
with reconciliation and cash account production’. However, the Report also noted that
Pathway was ‘pressing for a full end-to-end review across Horizon as well as
Pathway’ to find and implement solutions.® It was standard practice for the Pathway
board to have a high level overview of the issues facing the project, but this
knowledge did not extend to the detail of individual bugs. The issues that remained
within the Pathway Project were being reviewed and resolved as prioritised by an

experienced team in conjunction with POCL.

Q46. To what extent did criticism in the press influence the timing of the roll out?

159. Criticism in the press had no impact on the timing of the roll out. Of course there was
occasionally press regarding the Pathway Project but this would not influence how

we would work or the timing of roll out of a project such as Pathway.

Q47. What was your understanding of POCL’s level of knowledge of issues with

Horizon at this time?

160.POCL, as our customer, would have had a comprehensive understanding of all
issues with the Pathway Project at that time. As set out in my answer to Q37 above,

we had an end-user helpline which logged all calls and a review of these calls was

provided to POCL on a monthly basis. There were also regular project meetings
between Pathway and the POCL team, and | recall also daily contact between the

teams.

Q48. Please set out whether you considered Horizon to have met POCL's

objectives at the time of the roll out.

161.We delivered the Pathway Project in accordance with the contract agreed by POCL.
As set out elsewhere in this statement, we were only able to commence the national
rollout of the project by virtue of POCL's agreement that the Acceptance conditions
were met. By definition, this meant that the project met POCL's contractual
objectives. When | left in July 2000 | believed that the project was moving positively

forward.

Q49. Please explain whether you felt that all potential concerns raised by POCL

had been resolved by the time of the roll out.

162.| was aware that there were open issues at the time of the roll out as is normal in any
large technical infrastructure project. Pathway and POCL had clear lines of
communication on the project. We had an agreed list of issues and Pathway had an
ongoing mechanism for dealing with outstanding concerns as they arose. As with the
issues we experienced before rollout, we had a method to establish prioritisation of
the concerns and corresponding resolution plans. The Monthly Reports continued
into the rollout phase of the project and the solid governance structure that we had in
place ensured a clear process for the identification and resolution of any concerns

raised.

Q50. To what extent was the project sufficiently resourced?

163.In my opinion, the Pathway Project was sufficiently resourced. Pathway had its own
resource plan but as ICL CEO | made it clear throughout the project that if necessary,
Pathway could draw on additional resources from within the wider ICL and Fujitsu
talent pools. There were of course occasionally gaps in resource but we were able to

leverage resources when we needed to.

Q51. To what extent did those involved have sufficient expertise?

164. The CVs and role descriptions of the Pathway management team were set out within
the original bid proposal’. Each person on the team was an experienced
businessperson who had experience on complex infrastructure projects and their
CVs clearly documented their relevant technical expertise. We had the experience to
deliver the Pathway Project successfully alongside an additional pool of expertise

within ICL and the wider Fujitsu group.

Q52. To what extent did postmasters have sufficient input into the requirements

definition, design and acceptance testing?

165.1 do not personally recall the extent to which postmasters had input into the
requirements definition, design or acceptance testing. However, from my review of
the documents provided to me by the Inquiry, | understand that POCL and Pathway

worked to incorporate input from postmasters into the Pathway Project.

166. For example, during the IGL project and initial rollout of Release 1, a number of 'user
awareness’ programmes took place to receive feedback on Horizon from

postmasters, as reported in the March 1997 Pathway Board meeting minutes: 'On

° Annex 7, Pathway Proposal 1995 (WITN0388_01/36) 7

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 56 of 62

WITN03880100

User Awareness, programmes had been started with sub-postmasters, for the April
Release and good enthusiastic attendance was being achieved. Surveys had taken
place of 200 Post Offices so far and a training programme for sub-postmasters

agreed. 8

167.There were also two Pathway Liaison Managers, who were described in the

November 1997 Monthly Report as follows:

"They are acting as ‘eyes and ears’ in the regions but importantly have also
developed a very good relationship with the subpostmasters. They are filling a
serious gap in ensuring that the users are happy with the system and able to

use it correctly."

This report also noted that 'Several meetings have taken place with the Federation of
Subpostmasters and with the individual Regional General Managers to ensure that
they are up to date with the programme”. It is clear from these reports that Pathway
took the input of, and cooperation with, postmasters seriously, however | no longer

recall any of this detail directly.

Q53. To what extent was there sufficient oversight of the project (i) from POCL (ii)

from Government (iii) from ICL and (iv) from Fujitsu?

168.1 am unable to comment on the oversight of the project from POCL or the

Government.

169.ICL and Fujitsu both had sufficient oversight of the project. As set out in paragraphs
47, 57 and 77 above, the strong managerial structure of Pathway and its clearly
defined governance process ensured that there was clear oversight of the Pathway

Project.

170. Although there were no Fujitsu representatives on the Pathway board, Mr Naruto was
on the ICL board and had the necessary strategic oversight. Fujitsu were at all times

fully briefed by the Pathway Board on the progress of the project.

Q54. On reflection, do you consider that the Rollout of Horizon took place at the

right time?

171.Given the issues that subsequently occurred with Horizon and the impact these
issues had on so many individuals, it is very difficult to answer this question. However,
| would consider that we rolled out the Pathway Project when it was ready and when
the client, POCL, had confirmed its Acceptance of the product. However there was a
clear process in place to determine the timing of the rollout, and the implication of
POCL formally accepting the product is that rollout then took place at the right time.
Each party involved understood what was required to make the project successful,
and in my opinion both Pathway and POCL achieved the collective aims of the project

at the time of the rollout.

Q55. On reflection, do you consider that you were sufficiently informed of

problems with Horizon from procurement up to and including roll out?

172. There was a clear governance structure in place for the whole lifespan of the project
and | was regularly informed of the project's progress. | took my position as a Director
of Pathway as well as CEO of ICL seriously and as far as | recall | attended each
monthly Board meeting.

Witness Statement of Thomas Keith Todd

Page 58 of 62
WITN03880100
WITN03880100

173.In addition, the Monthly Reports prepared by Pathway contained summaries of

progress on the following areas:

a. Systems

b. Commercial and Financial

c. Customer Requirements

d. Quality & Risk

e. Business Development

f. International Sales

g. Organisation & Personnel

h. Post Office Client

174. Pathway placed great importance on these updates and within each report, there
was a summary, an update on progress, a list of ‘current critical problems’ and an

update on costs.

Q56. On reflection, do you consider ICL was equipped to take on a project of this

size?

175.Yes. ICL had a proven record of accomplishment with large-scale infrastructure
projects and was more than capable of rolling out the Pathway Project successfully.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, ICL had become involved in a variety of local
government outsourcing projects, working for the Ministry of Defence, HMRC and the
Department for Work and Pensions, alongside the successful National Lottery
contract. It was clear from the success of these projects that ICL had the capability
to manage large-scale technology and infrastructure projects.

Q57. Is there anything you consider ICL should have done differently in respect

of this project?

176.My answer for this question is limited to my own involvement with the Pathway
Project, which ended when | left ICL in July 2000. As explained elsewhere in this
statement, ICL should not have engaged in a contract with two customers and this is
not something that | would do again. The issues with this decision became apparent
soon after the contract was signed and became a major obstacle in achieving
success with the project, due to both customers having distinct objectives and aims

and the lack of alignment.

177.1 would like to conclude this statement by once again expressing my sympathy to all

of those individuals who have been affected by the Horizon scandal.
