FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

This document comprises the HNG-X Acceptance Report to the HNG-X Acceptance Board for the
assessment of the progression through Acceptance Gateway 3 (AG3) — Readiness for Pilot.

The basis for HNG-X Acceptance is defined in Schedule B6.3 and some sections are reproduced within
this report.

The POL Requirements and Criteria, contained in the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue - POL DOORS
archive v1.42, and associated with AG3 are contained in Appendix A.

The definition of the HNG-X Acceptance Methods is contained in Appendix B.

The definition of the Acceptance Incident Severity is contained in Appendix C.

1.1. Scope
The purpose of this Acceptance Board is: -

‘To agree the Acceptance status of the relevant Release (HNG-X Release 1 for AG3) and provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board’.’ The proposed options that this Board can
select from are described in Appendix D.

This recommendation is based on an assessment of the status of the applicable POL Requirements and
Acceptance Criteria and of the stage progression criteria for AG3 are described in Schedule B6.3.

The primary assessment concerns the status of any Acceptance Incidents as follows:-

Progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 shall occur once all of the following have
been satisfied for the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria allocated to achieving progression through the
respective HNG-X Acceptance Gateway:

(a) subject to paragraph 4.6 (of Schedule B6.3 which refers to dispute handling, defect
aggregation and deferred tests), all such HNG-X Acceptance Criteria have been achieved;

(b) activities leading to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 (named “Readiness for Router Roll—
Out (Z1)” and HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 (named “Readiness for Data Centre Migration”)
must be completed and these two HNG-X Acceptance Gateways passed through in accordance
with paragraph 4.5.4.2 as pre-requisites to achieve HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3.

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents is five or fewer
and an agreed workaround exists for each of them; and

(d) there is an agreed workaround for all outstanding HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance
Incidents except for those which the Parties agree do not require a workaround.

(e) details of all Non Incidents are recorded, although they shall have no impact upon
Acceptance Gateway progression

These together with other supporting factors are summarised in the following checklists for AG3.

2 Review of status of Acceptance Criteria

The POL requirements for Acceptance Gateway 3 comprise all of the functional requirements
represented by the POL Use Cases and a set of the Non-Functional requirements.

2.1 Functional Requirements — Use Cases

There are 144 Use Cases which constitute the POL functional requirements. Their summary status is as
follows: -

Count of Status Status
Service Barrel Not Zero Deferred I Failed Passed I Grand

Failed - Each Failed Criteria is represented by an Acceptance Incident in section 3

No Run - This identifies the number of criteria whose designated tests have not been run at the time of
this Acceptance Board. A number of these are due to the status of the testing of the criteria being agreed
to deferred, with the associated criteria having the status of ‘Deferred Test’ — see section 2.2.1.

Not Completed — This identifies the number of criterion where either: -

a) Acceptance Evidence has been submitted by FS but not yet assessed by POL,
or

b) Test execution had started but not completed at the time of this Acceptance
Board. These will also have the status of ‘Deferred Test’.

2.2.1 Deferred Test status

The Schedule B6.3 acknowledges that there may be circumstances when previously scheduled testing
that was targeted for completion by this Acceptance Gateway cannot now take place. Providing that this
is not due to a contractual default by Fujitsu, and the parties agree, then the tests associated with a POL
requirement may be ‘Deferred’. Fujitsu are still obliged to carry out these ‘Deferred Tests’.

For this Acceptance Gateway, Fujitsu have requested that tests associated with the following
requirements are given ‘Deferred Test’ status. These are: -

SEC-3115, SEC-3135, SEC-3210, SEC-3212, SEC-3193, SEC-3161, SEC-3230, SEC-3154, SEC-3158,
SEC-3113, SEC-3177, SEC-3257, SEC-3354, SEC-3164, SEC-3210, SEC-3204, SEC-3348

These are all associated with the Security Penetration testing that is due to complete on 18/11/09.

The Joint Test Team has advised that ARC-462, ARC-463, TR471 are now scheduled to be tested in
LST and so should also be given ‘Deferred Test’ status.

3 Review of status of Acceptance Incidents

The Acceptance Incidents listed below have been raised because the acceptance evidence has failed to
meet the acceptance criteria. They have been classified into three groups: -

e Those arising from defects whose resolution has been agreed to be deferred until after
the start of Pilot. These have an identifier of Al-AD-nnn

e Those arising from defects that have been raised during the assessment of the non-
testable criteria - in this case Document Review. These have an identifier of AI-NT-nnn.

e Those arising from defects that have been raised during testing and where no formal
deferral discussions have taken place. These have an identifier of Al-TS-nnn.

3.1 Acceptance Incident Aggregation

Schedule B6.3 (4.6.3) recognises that HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the
same failure or deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function, may be
aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance Incident for the purposes of the thresholds identified in
section 1.2. The following sections contain details of all of the individual Acceptance Incidents and then
identifies where aggregation has occurred.

B_ Definition of Acceptance Methods

The set of HNG-X Acceptance methods are defined in Appendix D of Schedule B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance
Process and reproduced below.

Type Description

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that cannot be objectively verified by a test of HNG-X
Document may be satisfied by Post Office undertaking a HNG-X Document Review. The
Review outcome of any such review will be documented by Post Office in the HNG-X

Acceptance Tracking Document. Fujitsu Services will supply a list of documents.
(and any specific references within such documents) for Post Office review,
which may satisfy the agreed HNG-X Acceptance Criteria.

HNG-X HNG-X Acceptance Criteria may be satisfied by Post Office participating in an
Design HNG-X Design Walkthrough led by Fujitsu Services of the Fujitsu Services’
Walkthrough I design. The outcome of any such HNG-X Design Walkthrough will be
documented by Post Office in the HNG-X Acceptance Tracking Document.

HNG-X Tests that are owned and managed by Fujitsu Services with significant
Solution Test I Collaborative support from Post Office, for the purpose of verifying that the Fujitsu
Services’ solution for the HNG-X System satisfies the relevant HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria. The collaborative team will produce a joint test report
presenting the results of the tests.

HNG-X Tests that are run and managed by Post Office with significant collaborative
Release support from Fujitsu Services, for the purpose of verifying that the HNG-X
Validation Release satisfies the relevant HNG-X Acceptance Criteria. The combined team

will produce a joint test report presenting the results of the tests and provide
evidence on any areas of non conformance.

Post Office shall specify any need beyond the level of support that Fujitsu
Services are required to provide under normal operational practice (such as a
report etc). Duration, nature and characteristics to be agreed in advance between
Post Office and Fujitsu Services and will take place during Live Pilot or
exceptionally during Live Monitoring. The total duration of HNG-X Monitoring and
the obligations on Fujitsu Services to produce data/reports to support Post Office

C Definition of Acceptance Incident Severity

The definition of the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is defined in Appendix A of Schedule
B6.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process and reproduced below.

High The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would render a key element of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or a key element of the
Infrastructure unfit for operational use, which could include:

a) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types;

b) not allowing Post Office to undertake one or more Transaction types using the
required business inputs or generating the required business outcome;

c) creating system performance issues which are in, or are likely to cause a, breach
of Service Level Targets.

Medium The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that would not prevent operation of
one or more of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or elements of the
Infrastructure, but would cause problems in the operational use of one or more
Transaction types.

Low The HNG-X Acceptance Incident was caused by the introduction of changes arising
from Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process and results in a defect that does not cause any adverse
operational impact in the use of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities or an
element of the Infrastructure, or the HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be addressed by
a workaround without any adverse operational impact for Post Office.

Non An incident raised by either Party which, following investigation is found:

> not to be a defect;

> not to have resulted from the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X
and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X
