All

Following the meeting with Brian Altman QC yesterday I circulate for discussion the draft terms of engagement for
appointing him to advise POL. It is very much a first draft.

We need to think about:

1. Timing - when do we want the written report / do we need deadlines on each of the process steps.
2. Engagement with CK/Fujitsu and other interested parties
3. Will the report be public/private

I think we need to flesh out the process steps further and agree things with Brian ( including what resource he has
available/needs). At that stage we can then talk about his fee!

The other pressing matter is the response to the CCRC (which the holding letter said would be sent by the end of this
week). I think we should use Brian to help draft this and assume we need to say that POL has appointed him to review
prosecution cases.

Can we discuss this today?
