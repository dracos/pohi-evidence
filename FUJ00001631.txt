INTRODUCTION

Purpose

This document is the ‘Horizon New Service Business Volumes’, which once
approved becomes a CCD.

The ‘Horizon New Service Business Volumes’ documents the business
workload volumes for any new Services supported by the infrastructure within
the Pathway operational domain. Initially only NBS and EFTPoS are included.
As other New Services are agreed these will be added.

EFTPoS volumes have been included to reflect changes to the infrastructure
for NBS that also support the EFTPoS Service. Introduction of the EFTPoS
service itself will be subject to Change Control. All references to EFTPoS in
this document need to be considered in this context.

The volumetrics will be used for:

= Sizing the infrastructure within the Pathway operational domain to deal
with the New Services

= Capacity Management of the Infrastructure within the Pathway operational
domain for those services

The target audience for this document is varied and includes systems
designers, capacity managers and business analysts. Some parts of this
document may not be appropriate for all readers.

Because the workload volumetrics for New Services are based on business
projections that could be under or over estimates of the workload, Pathway has
included in the NBS a Capacity Management Service that will monitor:

= The workload generated by each New Service and
= The load generated on the infrastructure by those services.

As the roll-out of the New Services progresses the Capacity Management
Service will report to the Service Review Board enhanced predictions of the
capacity required to support the business volumes. Any changes in the
business volumes and the capacity needed to support them will be agreed
though Change Control.

The business volumes set out in this document have been used by Pathway to
determine the systems and network capacity required to support the New
Services.

Scope

This document defines the peak workload volumes for the New Services that
the infrastructure within the Pathway Operational Domain will be configured
to support.

Initially only NBS and EFTPoS are included.

EFTPoS is a future service that will be introduced under Change Control.

Introduction

“Horizon New Business Volumes’ documents the business-level volumes for
the New Services that will be run within the Pathway Operational Domain,
ies

= NBS

= EFTPoS

In addition, where volumes for NBS and EFTPoS have a combined impact on
the system these are covered separately as "Online Transactions". The reason
for this is that the NBS and EFTPoS peaks are not expected to occur at the
same time, so the peak Online transaction volume is less than the sum of the
peak NBS and EFTPoS volumes.

The business-level volumetrics will be used in conjunction with the system
qualities (response time and availability — see [N08]) to give the total system
view of the workload from which Pathway has determined the infrastructure
capacity required to support the New Service workload.

For each new service, the following are given:
= Contracted Volumes - the volumes that Pathway will contract to support

= Design Limits - the volumes that Pathway can scale the system to support
New Services within the Contracted Notice Period (see 1.6) and then
sustain without impacting the Existing Services.

= Scalability Threshold - the volumes that Pathway can scale the system to
support within the Design Limit Notice Period (see 1.6). Scaling beyond
these numbers is possible but will require significant design work and will
be dealt with on a case by case basis under Change Control.

= In addition, other areas of concern are covered for each service where
appropriate.

The justification for the numbers is provided in section 6.

Horizon New Service Business Volumes

Commercial In-Confidence

1.4

Overview

Based on current experience, the Existing Services offered at an automated
Post Office counter position mainly require local processing, with less than
2% of transactions generating on-line interactions with the datacentre. Data
generated within an outlet is replicated to the datacentre periodically. This
produces a very specific workload profile that the Horizon infrastructure has
been designed to support.

The New Services require on-line authentication and authorisation for all
transactions. This creates a very different demand profile particularly on the
outlet to datacentre network and the Horizon datacentre systems.

The demand on the infrastructure generated by New Services is not uniform
across the time periods used to describe on-line workloads e.g. second, hour or
day so a set of peaking profiles have been included which will be used to
model the demand in each of the peak periods.

Each of these measures describes a characteristic of the system that is required
to determine the capacity required as shown by the table below.

5 Minutes I The aggregate business over the Sizing components that need to support on line

expressed as a per second rate E.g. WAN, VPN Servers, Correspondence Servers,

yer capable of storing and processing two days data if'a
major failure occurs and overnight processing is delayed

busiest week of the year. E.g. data warehouse weekly data
Month The total business volume in the Sizing storage capacity

busiest month of the year.

E.g. data warehouse monthly data, correspondence

These volumes are also used to help size other aspects of the Pathway system,
for example impacts on MIS and SLA reporting.

1.5 Consequences of Excess Volumes

If the "Contracted Volumes" are exceeded, then the following service levels
may be affected:

Network Banking - 5 minute volumes I NBS Response Time [N08 2.1]
(section 2.2)

EFTPoS - 5 minute volumes EFTPoS Response Time [TBA]
(section 3.2)

Online Transactions - 5 minute NBS Response Time [N08 2.1]
volumes EFTPoS Response Time [TBA]

(section 4.2)
Outlet To DataCentre Network - 5 NBS Response Time [N08 2.1]
minute volumes EFTPoS Response Time [TBA]
(section 5.3) NBS Reliability [N08 2.3]
EFTPS Reliability [TBA]

If the Design Limits are exceeded then any service level or obligation
involving data processing (either human or computerised) may be affected.
This includes service levels and obligations for the Existing Services as well
as for the New Services. As per [N01 section 12], any failure to meet service
levels or obligations shall be disregarded, providing Pathway can demonstrate
that the failure has occurred as a result of exceeding the Design Limits.

1.6 Notice for Changing Volumes

For each Contracted Volume and Design Limit in this document two notice
periods are given for changing them:

© Contracted Notice Period - the minimum notice that Pathway needs to
increase the Contracted Volumes. The Contracted Volumes cannot be
changed so that they exceed the Design Limits.

¢ Design Limit Notice Period - the minimum notice that Pathway needs to
increase the Design Limits. The Design Limits cannot be changed so that
they exceed the Scalability Threshold.

Each notice period starts when both parties have agreed the Change Control
Notice, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

The notice period for changing the Scalability Limits in the tables will depend
on the nature of the change. Ideally more notice than the minimum should be
given to allow Pathway to plan the capacity changes in a cost-effective way
(e.g. by including within a major release).

1.7

It is a function of the Service Review Board to discuss, plan and agree any
such changes, which will be done under Change Control.

Phasing of Capacity
As set out in the pricing schedule [A12], capacity is being installed in two
phases:

e Phase I - These volumes (sized at 50% of final volumes) are used for all
components from the start of the service.

e Phase 2 - These volumes are used for all components six months after PO
Ltd has given notice that it needs Pathway to support these volumes, such
notice to be given no earlier than 1*' March 2003.

This approach avoids having to purchase 100% capacity from day one. This
has the following advantages:

e It defers spend on capacity that is not needed initially.

e If the expected transaction volumes do not arise or occur later than
expected, it may be possible to avoid or delay having to increase the
capacity.

e Waiting to purchase capacity typically means more capability can be
purchased for the same price. This assumption has been made in the
pricing for [A12].

e Being able to purchase systems with higher capacity reduces the total
number of servers required, lowering the overall cost of management.

The expected areas of change at phase 2 include:

e Increased processing power for the correspondence servers and potentially
a new version of WebRiposte to improve connection concurrency
handling.

e Increased processing power for the NBS agents
e Increased storage for the DRS and Data warehouse

e Increased processing power for the DRS Host

NETWORK BANKING

Introduction

The NBS is a new service that will provide a service to both:

a Existing benefit customers who will be paid through the NBS rather than
OBCS and

= New (non benefit) customers accessing the services provided by the NBS

The number of benefit customers serviced by Post Office once NBS is in place
is predicted to be lower than the number serviced under OBCS. This is due to
some customers choosing not to collect their benefit from the post office if it is
paid directly into their bank accounts.

The load generated on the Pathway infrastructure by NBS is significantly
different to that of the Existing Service workload. In particular, the
infrastructure will have to support:

= The peak on-line transaction volumes

= On-line response times (see [N08] 2.1)

= On-line service availability (see [N08] 2.2)
= On-line service reliability (see [N08] 2.3)

The peak-processing profile and the Quality of Service parameters determine
the capacity in a particular component that must be delivered to support a
given workload.

The rate of growth of NBS is driven by:

1. The take-up rate of the service by personal banking customers and
CAPO™ customers

2. The rate at which CAPO™ cards are be issued and the number of such
cards

3. The replacement rate of benefit payment books by cards.

Post Office Ltd. has predicted the future workload volumes but the process for
the introduction of infrastructure capacity recognises that there are variables
in the workload volumetrics and allows for planned change through the
Capacity Management Service.

2.3 Other Volumes

2.3.1 Routing Gateways

The DRSH has the concept of "Routing Gateways", which are defined by
reference data for a particular ITN/operation combination. These are used to
group transactions into separate reports.

The reconciliation report structure, in agreement with Post Office Ltd, has
assumed there are no more than 30 routing gateways. Each routing gateway
produces 11 daily reports and 2 weekly reports from the DRS. There are also 2
daily reports for covering all gateways.

With 30 gateways in operation the table below shows the total number of

reports:

Normal Weekday (not Monday) I 332

Monday (not Bank Holiday) 1056
Tuesday after B.H. Monday 1388
Tuesday after Easter 1720

2.3.2 NBE Interface

The Horizon to NBE interface has been sized to support the phase 2 peak 5

minute Contracted Volumes in section 2.2 above.

EFTPOS

Introduction

EFTPoS would introduce a new Method of Payment to the Horizon system so
that a customer in addition to paying by cash or cheque could now do so by
Card.

It is predicted that the customer behaviour that determines the distribution of
EFTPoS payments over the day will be similar to that for EPOSS transactions.
The key difference between EFTPoS and other services is that Saturdays are
expected to be significantly busier than weekdays.

The predicted Saturday peak results from a series of variable events occurring
on the same day e.g.:

= Month end resulting in a significant increase in MVL payments and

a Large utility companies issuing quarterly bills

Transaction Volumes

These volumes are used to size components that process or store EFTPoS
transactions separately from other Online Transactions (e.g. EFTPoS agents,
Warehouse, DRS etc).

Some of infrastructure upgrades for NBS have been sized to allow for EFTPoS
traffic as well. Since the EFTPoS contract has not yet been agreed, the
volumes below are only supported on the components specified below.

In sizing EFTPoS, it has been assumed that the workload generated by
EFTPoS on any component would be no more than 12% of the workload
generated by NBS. Pathway reserves the right to reassess and amend the
EFTPoS Contracted volumes if any changes before EFTPoS contract
agreement mean this assumption is not valid. [This caveat will be removed
when the EFTPoS contract is agreed.]

The following components will support the Contracted EFTPoS volumes:
e Correspondence Servers

e Agent Servers for loading data from the correspondence servers to the
DRS Host only (additional agent servers will be needed for processing of
the online EFTPoS transactions)

e Audit excluding Audit Retrieval (Audit retrieval requirements have not
been agreed for EFTPOS so have to be excluded).

4 ONLINE TRANSACTIONS

41 Introduction

For this section, Online Transactions are defined as the combined volumes of
EFTPoS and NBS transactions. These volumes are used to size components
that process and store Online Transactions in a common way (e.g.
Correspondence servers).

The outlet to data centre network is explicitly excluded from this section and
is covered later.

Note that the volumes in this section do not necessarily match the sum of the
EFTPoS and NBS volumes from previous sections. This is because the peaks
from NBS and EFTPS are expected to happen at different times.

4.2 Transaction Volumes

4.3 Other Volumes
4.3.1 Table of IINs

There is a limit to the number of IIN ranges that can be supported by the
Horizon system before the Target response times in [N08 section 2.5] are
impacted.

This limit for NBS and EFTPoS combined is 1600. [To put this in context, for
Electron, Visa-Delta, Solo and Switch combined the expected number of IIN
ranges is 85, although more may be needed to cope with cards with and
without start dates for example. ]

If this volume is exceeded, the response time for NBS and / or EFTPoS at the
counter will start to extend. As such, the maximum number of IIN ranges Post
Office Ltd can specify shall be 1600.

The number of IIN ranges for EFTPoS and NBS should have no impact on the
response time for the Existing services.

An increase in the number of ranges for the Existing Services (e.g. OBCS bar
codes and AP magnetic cards) may increase the response time for EFTPoS and
NBS. Any such issues will be handled under the CCN that introduced the
change.

OUTLET TO DATACENTRE NETWORK

Introduction

The outlet to data centre network is designed to to scale to support at least the
Online Transaction load.

This scaling is achieved by moving more outlets onto fixed connections as the
workload increases. The factor that forces this behaviour is that there is a limit
to the ISDN call attack rate that the network can support. Hence the need to
ensure that the workload generated by the outlets that dial on demand is less
than the call attack rate that the network can support.

Since fixed connections are more expensive than dial on demand ones, there is
a straight trade off between the network capacity and the network cost.

Outlet Types and Constraints

The network design supports the following Service types for an outlet:
a) Satellite Connected Outlet - As today. Supports around 250 Post Offices.

b) Bronze Outlet - Uses a "connect on demand" technology to establish an
ISDN connection when an online transaction occurs.

c) Silver Part-time Outlets - During limited defined hours, the ISDN line is
kept open. Outside these times a "connect on demand" service is used. There
are two types:
Type A - ISDN Line kept open 08:30 to 10:30 Monday, 08:30 to 09:30
Tuesday and 08:30 to 09:30 Thursday.

Type B - ISDN Line kept open 08:30 to 12:30 Saturday

d) FRIACO Silver Daytime Outlets - During daytime hours (08:00 to 17:30
Monday to Friday and 08:00 to 13:00 Saturday), the ISDN line is kept open.
Outside these times a "connect on demand" service is used.

e) Non FRIACO Silver Daytime Outlets - the same as d) but in a geographic
area not covered by FRIACO.

f) FRIACO Silver 24 Hour Outlets - The ISDN line is kept open 24 hours per
day, 7 days per week.

g) Non FRIACO Silver 24 Hour Outlets - the same as f) but in a geographic
area not covered by FRIACO.

There are some constraints on the Service type an outlet can be and the
movement of an outlet from one type to another as shown in the table below.

jalled Service ISDN Call The dial on demand service has a limit in the number of calls per second
rate is limited that it can support (see under section 5.3)

FRIACO Not Available for Energis do not have FRIACO coverage for the whole of the UK.
certain outlets Coverage is dependent on the DLE that the outlet connects to.

FRIACO Capacity may not I In some DLE's, there may be insufficient capacity for Energis to support

be sufficient in some all the Post Offices we wish to make Silver on the FRIACO service.
exchanges There should always be sufficient capacity on the Non-FRIACO Silver
service.

Mobile outlets have Bronze Mobile outlets will only be supported on the Bronze Service.
Service only

Oullets with 5 or more For large outlets, it makes sense to allocate as Silver as it ensures that the
counters have to be Silver transactions are replicated to the data centre as they happen. Having
looked at the expected transaction volumes, all outlets of 5 counters or
above would be made Silver anyway, so the system automatically
ensures such new outlets are made Silver (daytime or 24, FRIACO or
Non FRIACO).

Satellite Connected Offices Satellite connected outlets can only be supported on the Satellite service
have to be Satellite which has the same Service Levels as the Bronze Service.

Lead Time on changes Energis have specific lead-time for ordering capacity (see section 5.3.2).

Outlet relocation To relocate an outlet, the following actions are taken:

i) Move the outlet to a service that has 100% UK coverage (either
Bronze or Non FRIACO Silver)

ii) Relocate the outlet

iii) Move the outlet to a more cost effective service if available
(e.g. FRIACO service)

This action is needed to avoid having to co-ordinate change of the
network service with the relocation (¢.g. if the outlet mores from an area
with FRIACO coverage to one without FRIACO coverage).

Load on Correspondence Each Silver outlet imposes a load on the correspondence server for that
Servers outlet. There may be limitations to the total number of Silver outlets that
we can supported under phase I capacity. This is expected to be 2500
per correspondence server cluster. The post office estate is split into 4
such clusters each cluster looking after roughly a quarter of the network.

Minimum Quantity The minimum quantity of FRIACO connected outlets (either Silver
Daytime or Silver 24 Hour) is 6000.

5.3 Volumes

This section looks at the following volumes:

¢ Maximum Total Online Transaction Rate - the maximum transaction rate
supported by the whole network (both dialled and fixed connections). This
is expressed as a 5 minute volume.

¢ Maximum Dialled Transaction Rate - the maximum transaction call rate
for Dialled Connections. This is expressed as a 5 minute volume.

The maximum Online Transaction rate (i.e. for NBS and EFTPoS) that can be
supported by the dial on demand network is calculated by:

e Taking the maximum 5 minute Dialled Transaction rate that the network
can support

e Subtracting an allowance for OBCS Foreigns as described below

The allowance needed for OBCS foreigns is calculated as the product of:

* 2% (which is the OBCS foreign workload as a proportion of the whole
OBCS workload)

e Peak 5 minute volume for OBCS (this declines as NBS replaces OBCS)

e The % dialled workload (which declines as more outlets are made Silver).

The maximum Dialled Transaction rate varies by time of day (and day of
week), as allowance needs to be made for other causes of ISDN calls including
regular Riposte connections and systems management functions (e.g. software
distribution). This variation is shown by separate "Periods" in section 5.3.1.

5.3.1 Phase 1 and Phase 2

There is no phasing of the network capacity. The volumes it can support are
defined below:

this period there may be regular Riposte connections but the calls caused
by Systems management functions is designed to be low.

e Period 3 - All other times. During this period there may be regular Riposte
connections and / or calls to support systems management.

Since as it is not possible to increase the Contracted Volumes or Design
Limits for the 5-Minute Dialled Transaction Rates no notice period is given.

Notice Periods and Minimum Quantities

The required periods of notice for changing outlets from Dial on demand
Connections (e.g. Bronze) to Fixed Connections (e.g. daytime Silver) varies
depending on the amount of additional capacity that needs to be purchased
from Energis. The lead times for this are:

e Up to 500 ports - 45 working days
e 500 to 1000 ports - 60 working days
e Over 1000 ports - 120 working days

These time scales are subject to ensuring the FRIACO capacity for any DLE is
not exceeded.

The notice periods refer to the calendar month that capacity is supplied,
irrespective of the number of orders placed (for example if two separate orders
request capacity increase in December 2003 and each is for 600 ports then the
notice period of 120 working days applies to each order).

For orders over 1000 ports, additional ports can be ordered up to 45 working
days before the capacity is delivered, providing that capacity does not exceed
20% of the original order.

There is a minimum quantity of 6,000 FRIACO ports that must be maintained.
These can be either used for FRIACO Silver daytime outlets or FRIACO
Silver 24 hour outlets.

The total number of FRIACO ports can be reduced, providing the following
conditions are met:

¢ The port being returned has been held for at least 12 months.

¢ 6 months notice has been given (notice can be given once the port has been
held for a minimum of 6 months).

e The total number of FRIACO ports is not reduced below the 6,000
minimum.

The final allocation of outlets to ports takes place approximately 4 weeks
before the Energis capacity order is delivered. Silver outlets can be demoted to
Bronze as well as Bronze outlets promoted to Silver, provided the total Silver
outlets is kept consistent with the ordered capacity. At this stage the number of
ports for each DLE cannot be changed.
