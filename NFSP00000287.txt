Subject: LOSSES AT WATERLOO ROAD &

Don,

The losses at this office were discussed at a review and authorized under our normal procedure for
dealing with ' 8 week ' requests. From memory, 2 of the losses, totalling about £1100, were known to
be awaiting an error notice and authority to hold these beyond 8 weeks was given. The large loss for
about £3k was the subject of frequent discussions with the subpostmaster who could not accept that
this was a genuine error and not down to Horizon.

The loss was identified by Chesterfield to be due to an incorrect outward cheque-rem total being
carried to the cash account.

Itis debatable as to whether this was due to operator error or a glitch in the system,there is no
evidence either way. The nett result is that most of this large loss was accounted for.

One error that was due to a fault In the system was an error notice received by the office for £202.
Daily despatches of tv licences were totalled incorrectly by the system despite all the daily cut offs
being performed correctly. I was informed that this was a problem at a number of other offices as well.

I hope that this is the type of information that you were after but if you do require anything further then
please let me know.

Regards

Mike
