Tom,
Many thanks for your work on this and my apologies for the delay in replying.

lam broadly happy with the paper subject to the minor comments below. However, I think Annex B
needs work and I would prefer that we circulated this separately on Monday.

We also need to consider what the voice over will be for this paper and how we present it on
Wednesday.

My minor comments are:
Para 2.10 - penultimate bullet point: delete 'those' in the first line

Para 3.3 - 2nd bullet - I think the semi- colon in line 6 should be a comma
POL00222354
POL00222354

Para 4.1 - 1st bullet - would we release our materials ‘just before' the select committee report ( will we
have sufficient certainty around the timing of release?) or would we make the announcement just
after?

Annex C - presumption para 3rd bullet: I think 'place' in the first line is a typo and should be deleted
I will circulate for comment over the weekend my suggested version of annex B.

Regards,

Jane MacLeod

Version 5 now attached. I have attempted to reconcile a further 4 sets of comments and
fill in the blanks.

Subject to any comments over the weekend I think this is good to go. The PDF is Annex A.

Jane — as discussed, I will work out what we need to cover at the sub-ctte in terms of a plan
and work up some material to support it on Monday.

Tom
Can you change the header and footer to reflect it is a joint paper please?

Some answers on Jane’s questions:
Point 2.10 this pressure is from MPs, JFSA and Second Sight.

4.1 - I would suggest removing the suggestion we might issue our
announcement ahead of the select committee report. If the select committee
does report we should make our announcement in response on the same day,
and must be ready to do that

- Same point: we are staying close to the committee so I would expect,
but cant guarantee, that we would know when it was going to be
published. All the moer reason to be ready.

Final point, there is a draft narrative in the annex which I wrote: please can
colleagues take a look at that and also fill in the gaps?

Best wishes,

Mark
