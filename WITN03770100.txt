POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANTHONY OPPENHEIM

|, MR ANTHONY OPPENHEIM, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. 1am a former employee of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”), having retired

in October 2018.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to me
on 1 July 2022 (the “Request’), to the extent | have or had direct knowledge of

such matters.

3. I note that the topics set out in the Request relate to events that took place over
20 years ago. In this statement, | have set out my best recollection of those
events, which relate to procurement, contractual matters, rollout, technical
issues, and bugs, errors and defects, in relation to the Horizon IT system

(‘Horizon’), as well as the relationship between Fujitsu and Post Office Limited

(“POL”) (including their predecessors). As | mention below, my involvement

with matters relating to Horizon ended in December 2002.

4. As requested by the Inquiry, | have refreshed my memory by reviewing the
contemporaneous documents brought to my attention by the Inquiry in the
Request. Where relevant, | have also drawn on other contemporaneous
material in the public domain or made available to me by Fujitsu at my request.
Where my recollection has been either supported by or prompted by such
documents, they are referred to using references WITN0377_01/1 to

WITNO377_01/104 and are listed in the index accompanying this statement.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
5. At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section on my professional
background, | reviewed variations of Schedule A14 of the Codified Agreement
signed between ICL Pathway Limited (“Pathway”) and Post Office Counters
Limited (“POCL”) on 28 July 1999 (the “Codified Agreement”)
(WITN0O377_01/1 and WITN0377_01/2), a chart of Pathway Directors from the
year 2000 (WITN0377_01/3) and the minutes of a Pathway Group Limited

(Pathway’s previous name) Board meeting on 15 June 1995 (WITN0377_01/4).

6. Prior to being assigned by ICL PLC (“ICL”) to Pathway, | had served in a
number of senior Finance and Commercial roles within ICL: as Controller of
ICL Mainframes; VP of Finance of ICL North America and Board member of
ICL Systems Inc. (2-year secondment to the US); and most recently as VP of
Finance of ICL Retail Systems (a global business with its headquarters in the

UK).

WITNO3770100

7. By training | am an engineer and an economist (BSc BCom from Birmingham

University).

8. | joined ICL in 1979 having previously worked in various Marketing and Finance

roles for Shell Chemicals, British Leyland and Rank Xerox.

MY ROLE IN RELATION TO PATHWAY / HORIZON
9. | was one of the first to join the bid team in around October 1994. | was
appointed Pathway’s Commercial and Finance Director when it was first set up
during the first half of 1995 and, on 15 June 1995, a member of the Pathway
Board. | left Pathway in February 2001 having been invited to take up a more

senior Commercial and Finance role in ICL.

10. As Pathway’s Commercial and Finance Director, | had CFO responsibilities for
the commercial and contractual arrangements between Pathway and its
customers and sub-contractors, and for Pathway’s finances and funding

arrangements, until February 2001.

11. By way of background, Pathway was initially set up as a joint venture company
between ICL (controlling share), De La Rue PLC (to assist with the payment
card element of the project) (“DLR”), and Girobank (to assist with secure
banking operations, and a POCL client). Pathway’s sole purpose was to bid for
and operate the BA/POCL agreements (“BA” being the Department of Social
Security's Benefits Agency), which consisted of three agreements variously
entered into by the BA, POCL and Pathway: these agreements are described

in more detail below (the “BA/POCL Agreements’).

Each of the Pathway shareholders would also be principal sub-contractors,
along with An Post (Irish Post Office) and Escher (Irish Post Office solution
provider), Energis (network), Oracle (database), CISCO (routers) and Hambros

(funding).

As | recall, Fujitsu Limited provided funding support to Pathway in the form of
an equity injection to ICL, bank guarantees and a Parent Company Guarantee

(“PCG”) (via a deed) to BA/POCL.

| was involved in setting up all of the above arrangements, the management of
Contract Changes between 1996 and 1999, and then, in 1999, unwinding the
BA Benefits Payment Card part of the contract. This included negotiations with
HM Treasury to settle how much Pathway should accept as its share of the
wasted costs and to change the payment terms for the POCL part of the
contract going forward, leading to the Codified Agreement with POCL and,

later, Acceptance and then Rollout of Horizon.

In my role, | also worked closely with the National Audit Office (“NAO”) to assist
them in writing their report of 18 August 2000 entitled “The Cancellation of the
Benefits Payment Card project’ (the “NAO Report’) (WITN0377_01/5), and
represented Pathway as CFO at a Public Accounts Committee hearing in
February 2001 (see the Committee’s Third Report of the 2001-2002 session,

WITNO377_01/6).

| was designated one of a number of “Key Personnel” (WITN0377_01/1 and

WITNO377_01/2).

17. My resignation from the Pathway Board was recorded at the January 2002

AGM.

18. Following on from my direct involvement in Pathway, my new role in ICL (by
then branded Fujitsu) as Commercial and Finance Director for Large Projects
(a newly formed division comprised of ICL’s recently won Private Finance
Initiative (“PFI”) contracts) included commercial oversight of Pathway. In that
capacity, in 2002, | engaged with POL (as POCL had then become known) to
negotiate an extension to the Codified Agreement, referred to as CCN 1100
dated 31 December 2002 (“CCN 1100”) (WITNO377_01/7), which would
significantly reduce the price of the services provided by Pathway through the

introduction of new technology and certain changes to the services provided.

PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING
19. At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section on the procurement
and contracting of the Horizon system, | have considered the following

documents: WITN0O377_01/8 to WITNO377_01/61.

Involvement in the procurement process
20. | was involved from the early stages of the bid after ICL decided to respond to
BA/POCL Notice 94/S 165.58937/EN advertised in the Official Journal of the
European Community in August 1994 (“OJEC Notice”) (WITN0377_01/62).
The OJEC Notice sought a PFI proposal to “Bring technology to the Post Office
and Benefits Payments”. Following an extensive period of demonstrations of
the proposed solution, clarification of Requirements and contractual

negotiations, Pathway was shortlisted and invited to tender in February 1996

Page 5 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

(‘ITT’). It submitted a final tender in April 1996 and was awarded the contract

jointly by BA and POCL in May 1996.

Aims and objectives of the Horizon project
21. There were two distinct phases in relation to the procurement and contracting

of the Horizon system:

21.1. initially as set out in the 1994 OJEC Notice and ITT of February 1996,

and then

21.2. POCL’s objectives after the BA dropped out in May 1999.

22. These phases are addressed separately below.

Phase 1: BA/POCL

23. BA’s primary business objective for the project was to radically reduce
encashment fraud. As | recall, this was variously put at between £100m and
£400m per annum at the time the contract was awarded. Paragraph 18 of the
NAO Report (WITN0377_01/5) quotes a figure of £100m net of a £50m saving
already delivered within the M25 through use of the ALPS system (referred to
as the “Electronic Stop Notices System” in the NAO Report) that had been

procured in 1994 from ICL.

24. POCL’s business objectives were (i) to retain as much of BA’s business as
possible (the BA could also pay its beneficiaries via Automated Cash Transfer
or “ACT” (bank to bank transfer)) and (ii) to bring automation to its branch

network (previously 80% paper based — only Crown Offices and a small

Page 6 of 97
25.

26.

27.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

number of large franchises had been (partially) automated using a system

known as “ECCO+’).

The technical objectives were to (a) replace BA books and Girocheques with a
Benefits Payment Card system and (b) automate all transactions (including
Benefits Payment Card transactions) across POCL’s branch network, enabling
new and smarter services to be introduced and increasing the robustness of
POCL’s accounting with their clients (BA, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency

“DVLA’, and National Savings & Investments (“NS&I)”, by way of example).

After extensive delays, the BA terminated their part of the BA/POCL

Agreements in May 1999.

To quote from paragraph 9 of the NAO Report (WITN0377_01/5), which

accords with my recollection:

“In May 1999 the government decided that removing the payment card from the
project offered better value for money than complete cancellation, would better
protect the early automation of the Post Office, and was preferable to

continuation. They devised a new strategy with the following key features:

= the Benefits Payment Card element of the project would be dropped,

simplifying and assuring post office automation;

= automation of the Post Office would proceed, for completion by 2001;

= benefits payments would be made by automated transfers to claimants’
bank accounts; starting in 2003 and completing by 2005. Until 2003 existing

arrangements would continue;

Page 7 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

= people who wished to continue to collect their cash at post offices would
continue to be able to do so. The Post Office would introduce suitable
banking technology and commercial arrangements with banks to allow this

to happen; and

= for the relatively few people for whom a bank account may remain an

unsuitable option, special arrangements would be made.”

Phase 2: Horizon

28. When the BA dropped out, the goals with regards to the Benefits Payment Card

fell away.

29. POCL’s Requirements, Solutions and Rollout plan were carried forward into
the Codified Agreement essentially unchanged from the BA/POCL Agreements

as modified by Change Control during the period May 1996 to July 1999.

30. To these was added a new Agreement to Agree (an “A2A’) in relation to
Network Banking. This was to cater for the new BA requirement that POCL
offer suitable banking technology to enable their BA customers to encash their
benefits in post offices. Network Banking was otherwise referred to as
Universal Banking, aimed at those who would not normally have qualified for

bank accounts (hence the name).

Alignment of aims and objectives

31. The alignment of aims and objectives between the parties again fell into 2 parts:

31.1. while BA were a stakeholder and the contract was a “pure” PFI; and

Page 8 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

31.2. after cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card when the BA ceased to
be a direct customer of Pathway (they remained a customer of POCL
and hence indirectly of Pathway) and the contract terms were changed

to more conventional project payment terms.

Part 1: PFI

32. The key goal for the BA was to radically reduce the high levels of encashment
fraud to which the paper-based system was subject. This had been a running
sore for years and the government had instructed the BA to address it. To do
so, the BA had two options: tighten the controls over encashments made in
Post Offices or make ACT payments directly into beneficiaries’ bank accounts.
ACT largely eliminates encashment fraud and is considerably cheaper to

administer.

33. POCL’s primary business driver was very different from BA's. It was to retain
as many BA transactions as possible across its branch network. To encourage
its customers to stay with POCL rather than move to ACT, POCL’s goal was to
have the encashment process be as quick and straightforward for its customers
as possible, retaining the (considerable) flexibility that had been provided with
the paper-based system. POCL were not incentivised to be concerned about

the encashment fraud risk.

34. The arguments against ACT historically had been that many BA beneficiaries
did not have bank accounts (although that proportion was gradually reducing)
and that rural and small urban post offices were heavily dependent on BA

transactions for their survival (which was still very much the case).

Page 9 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

35. The Benefits Payment Card was intended to satisfy both objectives: eliminate

encashment fraud and continue to support POCL’s branch network.

36. The conflict between BA’s and POCL’s business objectives manifested itself in
the “rules” associated with security checks. The Benefits Payment Card
solution would only eliminate encashment fraud (or come close to eliminating
it) if payments to benefits recipients were tightly controlled. Historically, POCL
had afforded their customers considerable flexibility over the encashment of
their benefits through the use of alternates, proxies and “casual payees”.
Tightening controls went against POCL’s business goal of making the customer
experience as frictionless as possible in order to encourage usage.
Furthermore, introducing checks to confirm the credentials of benefits
recipients went against POCL’s goal of maintaining fast transaction times.

Pathway was caught in the middle of these conflicting objectives.

37. These conflicting objectives were reflected in the A2As and the difficulties
experienced in resolving them. The A2As were there precisely because the BA
and POCL could not agree on how to resolve them. For example, a
Requirement would state that the identity of an alternate payee had to be
verified but that the method for doing so had to be agreed. Without that
agreement, it would be impossible for Pathway to complete process design,
development and testing — and would never be able to secure Acceptance. The
need to agree such detail post-contract was expressly identified in 289 A2As
(as noted in the NAO Report at paragraph 22, WITNO377_01/5) and, from

memory, was implied in approximately 100 further places in the BA/POCL

Page 10 of 97
38.

39.

40.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Agreements. Many of the BA related A2As went unresolved until they fell away

when the Benefits Payment Card was cancelled.

As noted at paragraph 16 of the NAO Report (WITN0377_01/5):

“The objectives of the Department of Social Security and Post Office Counters
Ltd in undertaking the project were different, reflecting their different business
drivers. They rightly agreed a memorandum of understanding between
themselves before signing the contract with Pathway, which addressed their
commercial relationship. But this did not prevent later disputes on matters of
detail. For example, arrangements that the Department wanted to ensure
security for payments to people temporarily collecting benefits on behalf of
claimants proved difficult to balance against Post Office Counters Ltd’s

commercial interests in maximising the flow of customers through its outlets.”

A key PFI principle was that the service provider (i.e. Pathway) should be paid
on outcomes, in this case pence per transaction. Nothing was to be paid until
the service was up and running. The idea was to incentivise the service
provider to deliver the contracted services on time and to specification. Fine in
principle. But that could only work if the specifications had been set clearly and

in good time.

Given the obvious risks to timescales, Pathway had negotiated into the
BA/POCL Agreement, as a condition for entering into it, a commitment that,
within 90 days of contract signature, BA and POCL would complete the so-
called “Drop Down” of their Requirements. Drop Down was supposed to
expand the detail behind the high level Requirements set out in the contract to

the level necessary to define them fully. It was expected that, in the process,

Page 11 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

the majority of the A2As would be settled. If the deadline was not met, Pathway

would be free to cancel the contract and walk away (WITN0377_01/63).

41. The 90 day deadline was not met. At the end of it, many key Drop Down
Requirements (and A2As) remained undefined. Pathway was contractually
entitled to terminate the contract and walk away at that point but chose not to.
It chose not to (i) believing that the Government was 100% invested in the
project such that it would not allow it to fail and (ii) because, if it did, it would
not be able to recover the considerable costs already sunk into the project (tens

of £m).

42. When the BA terminated its part of the contract in May 1999, a large number (I
do not recall how many, but | do recall that it was a large number) of Benefits
Payment Card related A2As remained unresolved and, similarly, a large
number of pending CCNs were outstanding. The number of A2As relating to
POCL was much smaller, as | recall, but they included important gaps in
relation to the operation of POCL Reference Data (“Reference Data’) (as
explained further below), the TIP interface (“TIP”) and reconciliations, in
particular (TIP being POCL’s client-facing reporting system that accounted for
the transactions and money flows in relation to each client, e.g. BA, DVLA,
NS&l, Girobank, etc.). Reference Data issues would prove to be problematic

later on.

Part 2: Post-BA’s withdrawal

43. The removal of the Benefits Payment Card element of the service eliminated

(i) a great deal of complexity and (ii) the conflict in business objectives that had

Page 12 of 97

45.

46.

47.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

existed between the BA and POCL. Cancellation therefore reduced the project

risk of the remaining POCL element of the contract.

However, BA's cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card went directly against
POCL'’s key objective of preserving BA customer transaction volumes: it was
in fact an existential threat to its business. As noted in paragraph 1.29 of the
NAO Report (WITN0377_01/5), BA’s declared strategy was now to move to
ACT by 2005, starting in 2003. The ability of POCL to continue to serve its BA
customers, using Network Banking in place of paper, would depend critically
on the completion of the roll out of counter automation and the introduction of

Network Banking before BA started to migrate its beneficiaries to ACT in 2003.

In addition, POCL would need to introduce new revenue streams to replace the
BA transactions that would be lost to ACT notwithstanding the introduction of
Network Banking. These new revenue streams would depend on new, smart

products which would again require counter automation.

Both imperatives increased the pressure on POCL to move fast. The incentives

on POCL and Pathway were well aligned — both wanted to move ahead quickly.

At the time BA walked away, the Pathway Electronic Point of Sale System
(“EPOSS’) / Transactional Management System (“TMS”) solution was in an
advanced state. However, it contained deficiencies that both parties agreed
had to be closed out before starting volume Rollout. These were highlighted by
Acceptance Incidents (“Als”, each an “Al’), as described in the action points
from the Acceptance Workshop attended by Pathway and POCL on 17

September 1999 (WITN0377_01/64).

Page 13 of 97

51.

52.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

The immediate challenge in the summer of 1999 was to complete the work
needed to fix the deficiencies and to confirm through an Al Acceptance process
that the fixes had indeed resolved the deficiencies before triggering volume
Rollout in January 2000. Meanwhile, sufficient mitigations needed to be put in
place before a proving phase of 1,800 branches was implemented in October/

November 1999.

My understanding was that Pathway disclosed all relevant known defects and
issues to POCL together with their status to enable POCL to make informed
decisions as to their resolution. As evidenced by the Al Workshops minutes
and actions referred to above (WITN0377_01/64), there was a great deal of
close dialogue between the two teams on each of the Als. Individuals on both

sides were held responsible for the outcomes.

My recollection is that the two teams worked well together: the shared goal
being to ensure that the Als were all resolved such that a joint determination

could be made that Rollout should proceed.

By way of illustration, Pathway agreed to pay POCL to carry out reconciliation
checks in the TIP domain to ensure that any Al376 imbalances that occurred
before approval of the new 3-way reconciliation process (otherwise referred to

as the new integrity controls) would be flagged up for attention.

POCL'’s satisfaction with the outcome of the Al resolution process is evidenced
by the minutes of the Special Delivery Meeting held on 14 January 2000
(WITN0377_01/65) which closed the Als and approved the start of volume

Rollout on 24 January 2000.

History of the procurement process
53. Most of the events set out below are taken from either the varied and restated
codified agreement entered into between Pathway and POL on 31 December
2002 (WITNO377_01/7) or the NAO Report (WITN0377_01/5). | have added
some further events that | recall as significant in the run up to the Codified

Agreement:

53.1. August 1994: OJEC Notice (WITNO377_01/62).

53.2. 1H 1995: Teaming Agreements signed with An Post and Escher,

Girobank, De La Rue and Hambros.

53.3. 1H 1995: Pathway joint venture company agreed between ICL,

Girobank and DLR, ICL having the largest shareholding.

53.4. 1H 1995: Key Personnel assigned to Pathway from each of the

shareholders.

53.5. June 1995: Response to OJEC Notice (WITN0377_01/8).

53.6. July 1995 to February 1996: Demonstrations, negotiations and

attempts to better define BA’s and POCL’s Requirements.

53.7. February 1996: BA/POCL issue ITT to shortlisted bidders.

53.8. April 1996: Pathway submits updated proposal.

53.9. May 1996: Pathway Group Limited changes its name to ICL Pathway

Limited, ICL having bought out DLR and Girobank — driven by

Page 15 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

BA/POCL’s requirement, otherwise, for joint and several guarantees

from all 3 shareholders (WITN0377_01/67).

53.10. May 1996: BA/POCL award contract to Pathway.

53.11. 15 May 1996: Pathway entered the BA/POCL Agreements, which
comprised the “DSS Agreement’, “Post Office Agreement” and the
“Authorities Agreement’, as set out in the preamble to CCN 1100

(WITNO377_01/7).

53.12. February 1997: Contract reset in relation to the BA/POCL Agreements
pushing all planning dates back following failure to complete Drop

Down within the contracted 90 days of contract signature.

53.13. 1997: As referred to in the NAO report (WITNO377_01/5), PA
Consulting recommended doing away with the Programme Delivery
Authority (“PDA”) — an intermediary organisation not contemplated in
the contract but which BA and POCL had set up to manage Pathway

on their joint behalves — and replacing it with direct control by POCL.

53.14. 1998: POCL takes over contract control from the PDA.

53.15. July 1998: Horizon Programme Replan (the “July 1998 Replan”)

(WITNO377_01/9).

53.16. 24 May 1999: Pathway and the DSS agreed to terminate the DSS
Agreement, and POCL and Pathway entered into the “Letter
Agreement’, as set out in the preamble to CCN 1100

(WITNO377_01/7).

Page 16 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

53.17. July 1999: Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Codified Agreement
came into effect on 28 July 1999, as set out in the preamble to CCN

1100 (WITNO377_01/7).

Main challenges during the procurement process
54. The main challenges and concerns that | recall the Pathway bid team having

during the procurement process were:

54.1. The need to produce a fully operational Demonstration system to qualify
for shortlisting. Making the An Post solution meet BA’s Requirements
called for significant effort in relation to Payment Authorisation Service
(“PAS”) and Card Management System (“CMS”). Likewise, EPOSS for

POCL.

54.2. Teaming Agreements needed to be put in place quickly with our Principal
Subcontractors for them to deliver their components in time for Pathway

to integrate them all together.

54.3. BA/POCL’s aggressive timescales for delivery - requiring a fast start
and a strict limit to the amount of new development on top of the existing

An Post baseline solution — was this realistic?

54.4. Lack of precision over Requirements definition — the ITT contained a
large number of A2As — and it was far from clear how or when these

would be resolved post-contract.

54.5. Differing business drivers as between BA and POCL — would there be
sufficient will on the part of all three parties to find ways through the
conflicts?

Page 17 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

54.6. The tripartite nature of the contract and the fact that BA was a customer

of POCL, creating conflicting interests and objectives.

54.7. PFI encouraged innovation. A letter from Sir Peter Mathison (Chief
Executive of the BA) to Sir Michael Butler (Chairman of Pathway) dated
7 November 1995 refers to the heavy emphasis on innovation at the
time (WITN0377_01/10). But how much scope would we really have to
do things differently - would we be constrained by existing rules and

procedures yet to be defined in Drop Down and A2As?

54.8. PFI risk transfer beyond what we were best placed to manage (another
PFI principle) — and containing BA/POCL’s attempts to transfer more

risk through Drop Down.

54.9. Responsibilities still to be defined at the boundary of Pathway and
BA/POCL: dependencies on BA and POCL to provide quality
information on time — to what extent would the Contracting Authority

Responsibilities set out in the contract actually protect us?

54.10. The need to ramp up resources and make commitments to suppliers
before knowing if we would be selected in order to meet the contract

delivery dates.

54.11. Unduly tight Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”) being imposed on us.

54.12. Not knowing what we didn’t know.

Page 18 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Horizon project achievability
55. Notwithstanding all of the above, Pathway believed in its strategy of re-use of
the Eire solution augmented by teaming with the best in the industry for its

technology and service delivery.

56. My recollection is that the Pathway Board took the view that, given a collective
will on the part of all three parties to make the contract work (for which it

assessed there to be a political imperative), the project was achievable.

57. Ultimately, | would say that the internal conflicts within the combined BA/POCL
programme proved too much for the Benefits Payment Card but that the same
did not apply to the Horizon (POCL) part of the contract that became the
Codified Agreement. At the time | left the project in February 2001, | felt
confident that Pathway would deliver its elements of the Horizon programme
successfully and that it was approaching an operational steady state following

the intense period of Rollout.

58. When referring to “Horizon”, it should be noted that the term encompassed
significant elements of activity within the POCL domain in addition to those
elements undertaken by Pathway, notably in relation to Reference Data and

TIP.

59. My confidence was supported by a statement made by John Roberts (then
CEO of Post Office) at a hearing in front of the Select Committee on Public
Accounts on 26 February 2001 (the “PAC Hearing”), which | attended in my
role as CFO of Pathway. Mr Roberts stated at paragraph 145

(WITNO377_01/6):

WITNO3770100

“It has been a success in my terms, in the sense that we have got a product
which is working extremely well, we have managed to automate, which was
obviously one of our aims, the whole network of post offices, we will have done
by the due date, which is June of this year at the latest, we will probably
complete it by March/April rather than June. In a very limited sense we have an
automation project, we have moved, as many other countries have done, the
network of post offices, which is probably bigger than most other countries, into
one which is now fully automated and on which we can build the kind of

technological future that the performance innovation in the report wanted us to

60. My recollection is that, at the outset, the greatest risks were perceived to lie

with:

60.1. the Benefits Payment Card (in particular, resolving the associated A2ZAs

and minimising additional development work) on the one hand and

60.2. the Rollout to 18,500 post offices on the other (sustaining the flow of
preparation work, ISDN provisioning, training and equipment supply

over almost two years with few breaks).

61. Risks in relation to the Benefits Payment Card (so far as | can recall) were as

follows:

61.1. determining the detailed Requirements via Drop Down and, in the

process, the many A2As - within 90 days of contract signature;

Page 20 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

61.2. “requirements creep” whereby Drop Down and A2A resolution would

seek to introduce new Requirements;

61.3. agreeing the fraud risk attribution in relation to each fraud scenario,
matched to what it was possible for the system to control (Pathway
responsibility) versus where it was not possible for it to do so with the
information provided (not to count as a Pathway failure). It is worth
noting that the indemnity was in relation to encashment fraud: it did not
extend to BA entitlement fraud nor to any fraud in relation to POCL’s

sub-postmasters;

61.4. the CAPS interface and the timely provision of beneficiary data by BA;

and

61.5. the impact of the above on timescales (leading to potential breach of
contract by Pathway), and on costs and lost revenue (any delay would

lead to a shorter revenue earning life for the project).

. On the POCL side (so far as | can recall), the perceived risks were as follows:

62.1. rolling out 40,000 sets of Counter equipment to 18,500 Post Office
branches at a rate of hundreds a week, having first connected each

branch to the network via ISDN (or otherwise satellite);

62.2. modifying the branches to accept the installation of PCs and printers;

62.3. training 67,000 sub-postmasters and counter staff (just) before their
respective implementation dates (these statistics are set out in Figure

2 of the NAO Report, WITNO377_01/5);

Page 21 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

62.4. managing procurement lead times and last time buys of equipment to

ensure compatibility across the branch network;

62.5. resolving A2As — those that had to be agreed with both BA and POCL

and those affecting POCL alone, viz.:

= Reference Data;

* the interface between Pathway’s TMS and POCL’s TIP systems; and

62.6. resourcing up fast enough to carry out additional development and
testing and to meet rapidly growing demand for e.g. Help Desk

services.

My involvement in relation to the Codified Agreement

63. | was involved throughout the process of getting to the Codified Agreement as
described in paragraph 53 above and then working to implement that contract

with POCL until the time | left Pathway in February 2001.

64. Following BA's notification of its intent to cancel the Benefits Payment Card, |
led the negotiations on behalf of Pathway to replace the three BA/POCL
Agreements with a single Codified Agreement between Pathway and POCL.

Those negotiations included HM Treasury.

Main challenges in agreeing the original BA/POCL contract

65. The foremost challenges as | recall them were:

65.1. the many Requirements and A2As that would be subject to “Drop
Down” — how to ensure that they would be resolved quickly and how to

protect Pathway from delays resulting from a failure to do that;

Page 22 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

65.2. Drop Down — protecting Pathway from the introduction of greater

complexity and/ or risk transfer (Requirements “creep”);

65.3. dependencies on BA and POCL — making sure that appropriate
Contracting Authority Responsibilities (“CARs”) were included in the

BA/POCL Agreements in relation to, notably:

* BA providing accurate, complete and timely streams of beneficiary
data from its CAPS system (a new system to be developed by them);

and

= POCL providing accurate, complete and timely streams of Reference

Data;

65.4. SLAs — trying to avoid unduly stringent SLAs and potential breach

conditions;

65.5. encashment fraud indemnity — ensuring that the contract limited our
exposure to only those things that Pathway would be able to control;

and

65.6. Change Control — trying to make sure there would be an effective
process in place from day one given the tripartite nature of the contract
and the inherent conflicts as between our two customers, one of which

was a customer of the other.

WITNO3770100

Reasons why the contract changed in 1999
66. The BA/POCL Agreements were replaced by the Codified Agreement following
BA's cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card. The change was necessary

to:

66.1. Remove BA as a party to the agreements;

66.2. Strip out all references to the Benefits Payment Card and associated

services (CMS, PAS and Benefits Encashment Service, or “BES”);

66.3. Add the intention to develop and provide a Network Banking service to

replace the Benefits Payment Card services;

66.4. Reset the timetable for Rollout; and

66.5. Change the payment terms, replacing the original PFI structure with a
combination of milestone payments related to rollout and annual
service charge payments related to the ongoing provision of services
following Rollout. A fuller explanation of the changes is set out in a
memorandum dated 29 July 1999 from John Bennett to the Pathway

Board and senior management team (WITN0377_01/11).

Main challenges in amending the contract

67. The main challenge in amending the contract was financial.

68. As | recall, by mid-1999, Pathway had spent around £300m on the project, of
which it had to write-off £180m in relation to the Benefits Payment Card. The
cost of development and of all the preparation work to get to that point, over 3

years, had used up funds that had been earmarked for Rollout. In addition, the

Page 24 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

elimination of the Benefits Payment Card rendered transaction volumes and
therefore revenues less certain. Under the BA/POCL Agreements, revenue
was to be derived by multiplying the volumes of each type of transaction by the
unit price (in pence) for that type of transaction. Agreeing a change to more
conventional project-based payment terms was key to being able to proceed

with the project.

69. For POCL to be able to accommodate such a change necessitated the

intervention of HM Treasury.

70. None of this was easy for either Pathway or POCL.

Different positions between the parties
71. BA had been on the hook for all of the Benefits Payment Card costs and a

significant share of the Post Office automation costs.

72. With the BA contribution likely to be significantly reduced, POCL would be
unable to cover all the costs of Rollout and counter operations unless HM
Treasury agreed to grant POCL financial relief. For its part, Pathway could not
afford to carry on with the programme unless all the Rollout and on-going

operational costs of the branch network were covered.

73. Both parties needed help from HM Treasury to bridge the gap. HM Treasury
were able to fund the gap by using the cost savings that the BA would make by

moving to ACT.

74. My recollection is that, once the change in commercial terms had been agreed
with HM Treasury, agreeing the Codified Agreement with POCL was relatively
straightforward. Apart from the commercials, and the introduction of a new

Page 25 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Acceptance process founded on an Operational Trial, much of the rest of the
POCL part of the BA/POCL Agreements carried forward, largely unchanged.

Both parties were incentivised to proceed as quickly as possible.

Joint workshops and their successes and failures
75. The joint workshops were set up to go through and manage the Als which had
been identified as a result of the Operational Trial. It was attended by the
technical experts from both sides who had lead responsibility for the resolution
of the Als (WITN0377_01/64) and by Keith Baines of POCL and myself as joint

Chairs.

76. My recollection is that the joint workshops were successful in achieving the
objectives set for them, even though it took significantly longer for the Als to be
resolved than was called for by the Codified Agreement. They set actions on
both parties and held both parties to account for seeing those actions through
to completion. The majority of the actions were on Pathway but it was very

much a joint endeavour.

77. New information was produced overnight in response to actions placed each

day.

78. Individual Als were managed through to closure where the information
supported closure. Where it did not, Keith Baines and | worked together to
identify and agree the actions that would enable a resolution to be found. |
believe we did that in a spirit of mutual goodwill and that between us we were

able to come up with and agree solutions that were appropriate to the risks.

Page 26 of 97
Political dynamics in respect of the procurement and contracting process

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

79. As before, this needs to be considered in two parts (i) the original BA/POCL

joint procurement and (ii) the replacement of the BA/POCL Agreements by the

Codified Agreement, with POCL only.

Part A: The original procurement

80. | would summarise the political dynamics as follows:

80.1. POCL, the Department for Trade and Industry, Cabinet Office and HM

Treasury all wanted the Benefits Payment Card solution to succeed;

80.2. DSS and BA were, | believe, were far less enthusiastic, always

favouring ACT over POCL.

81. There are invariably problems to deal with in any large complex project (with

faults typically on both sides). In my experience, overcoming these problems

invariably depends on there being the will on both sides to find and agree

solutions. In this case, there were three sides, not two, and in my opinion, the

will was lacking on the part of the BA, partly because ACT was more attractive

to them than the Benefits Payment Card and partly because their CAPS

development was running late, which is illustrated by the July 1998 Replan

discussed in more detail below.

82. The immaturity of PFls in the Information Technology industry did not help any

of the parties (this was only the second IT PFI contract to be awarded). The

concept was that the Public Sector would look to the Private Sector to innovate

— to come up with new and smarter ways to do things. The reality was that we

were constrained in our ability to innovate by a multiplicity of rules and

Page 27 of 97
83.

84.

85.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

processes (some of them enshrined in government regulations) some of which
only became apparent a long time after the BA/POCL Agreements were

signed.

As | understood it, the decision to go down the Benefits Payment Card route
via a complex set of three-way agreements was driven by Government policy
to underpin the rural and small urban post office — their viability depended to a
large extent on BA transactions. To crack down on encashment fraud (a
political embarrassment as well as being a waste of money) and at the same
time maintain the viability of rural and small urban post offices, the Government
decided that: (i) the BA should switch from their fraud-prone paper-based
systems to a secure benefits card-based system still using post office
branches; and (ii) the post office network should, in essence, be modernised
through counter automation on the back of the Benefits Payment Card

programme.

In my opinion, the BA always favoured ACT and was never fully committed to
the Benefits Payment Card. ACT was a lot simpler and cheaper for them to
administer and it largely did away with encashment fraud. Problem solved as

far as the BA were concerned.

This was a PFI, so apart from having to spend money developing CAPS, the
BA had little investment “skin in the game’. It could afford to play it long with
A2As until Ministers and HM Treasury lost patience with the Benefits Payment

Card solution and called time on it.

Page 28 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Part B: Moving to the Codified Agreement

86. Pathway and POCL were well aligned in their objectives except for cost and
cash flow. Withdrawal of the BA would create a sizeable revenue gap for POCL.
Following 3 years of cash drain, Pathway was looking for milestone payments
to cover the cash costs of rollout, instead of all payments coming from

transactions.

87. Solving this required the involvement of HM Treasury. When faced with a
choice between enabling POCL to modernise its branch network through
counter automation or continue to decline with increasing numbers of branch
closures, HM Treasury chose to provide the additional funds needed to

complete the project.

The relationship between Pathway and POCL prior to the rollout of Horizon
88. During the first two years of the BA/POCL Agreements being in operation, the
existence of the PDA as “front man” to the BA and POCL inhibited the creation
of direct relationships with BA and POCL. My recollection is that the PDA spent
a lot of time attempting to tie-break between BA and POCL — a task rendered
extremely difficult, if not impossible, by the inherent conflicts between BA and
POCL, and lack of BA motivation. Inevitably, the lack of progress led to tensions

in the relationships.

89. The situation was so bad that PA Consulting were asked to review the reasons
for the lack of progress and to make proposals. They recommended in 1997
doing away with the PDA (as | recall, the PDA was not contemplated in the
BA/POCL Agreements) and instead giving lead responsibility to POCL, with the

BA sitting “behind” POCL as POCL’s client. From the time that the PDA was
Page 29 of 97

93.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

disbanded in 1998 it became possible to develop a working relationship with
POCL. The problem of conflicted business objectives remained, however. It
was clear from our interactions and discussions with POCL at the time that,
behind the scenes, a lot of back and forth was still going on between POCL

and BA. Resolving A2As and CCNs continued to be a slow and painful process.

It became increasingly clear during 1998 that development of the CAPS system
(the new BA system upon which Pathway was dependent for customer and
entitlement data) was running late. The July 1998 Replan referred to above and
considered in more detail below was testimony to the CAPS delays. The fact
that CAPS was running late gave the BA the incentive to slow down A2A
resolutions and place unreasonable demands on Pathway in relation to, e.g.

testing of the interface.

By way of illustration, | cite the formal complaint | felt compelled to register with
the Chair of the Core Negotiating Team, Pat Kelsey. Pat Kelsey relayed my
complaint on to Peter Crahan of BA and Dave Miller of POCL on 2 September

1998 in this memorandum: WITN0377_01/12.

From the point at which BA formally withdrew, | would say that the relationship
between POCL and Pathway improved quickly. Notwithstanding POCL’s
disappointment, and to some extent perhaps resentment towards Pathway for
the failed Benefits Payment Card solution, the business objectives between

POCL and Pathway were now well aligned.

| recall what, at a personal level, | consider to have been a strong professional
working relationship with my opposite number, Keith Baines, and that the inter-

team working through the Al process over a period of months was likewise

Page 30 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

strong under considerable pressure. Both sides, | believe, worked hard to
resolve the critical deficiencies that had been identified to clear the way forthe

safe Rollout and operation of Horizon.

ROLLOUT
94. At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section on the rollout of
Horizon, | have considered documents WITN0377_01/63, WITN0377_01/65
and WITN0377_01/68 to WITNO377_01/78. They cover a wide range of topics
and also timescales. | address a number of them individually to provide

background and context.

The rollout of Horizon

Phase 1: Early life Live Trials / pilots - Background

95. The minutes of the Contract Negotiation Team (“CNT”) meeting dated 16
October 1996 (WITNO377_01/63) describe the status of Drop Down and that
of the associated CARs and A2As some 5 months after contract signature. This
is a good example of the weekly CNT meetings conducted at Bird and Bird’s
offices, being still heavily focused on specifying the detailed requirements. At
that point, completion of Drop Down was 2 months overdue. No consideration

had yet been given to Rollout.

96. | have reviewed two Pathway documents entitled “100 Trial Surveys Report’
from March 1998 (WITN0377_01/68 and WITNO377_01/69), which had to do
with assessing the on-site work that would be required to make branch offices
ready to accept the installation of PCs and printers at that time. To the best of
my recollection, although challenging, there were no material issues arising

from the preparation work or the installations themselves. After volume Rollout

98.

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

was kicked off in early 2000, it was quickly possible to reach a beat rate of 300
post offices per week and to sustain it for months on end. In my experience,
that would not have been possible if there had been any significant issues with

the preparation work.

The High Level Counter Infrastructure Rollout Strategy document from June
1998 (WITN0377_01/70) sets out the Rollout strategy as it had evolved until
then: designed to be incremental by BA release, it was oriented towards BA
districts and subject to a series of selection criteria which were driven by BA’s
priorities rather than POCL’s. As | recall, the pace and locations of POCL’s
rollout were driven by the availability of BA data and clustering of their highest
risk customers (encashment fraud) more than by a coherent rollout across
geographic regions to suit POCL. This strategy was replaced by the July 1998
Replan (WITNO377_01/9) which “decoupled” the two rollouts — POCL
infrastructure and the Benefits Payment Card. It removed POCL’s dependency
on BA: instead of POCL’s infrastructure Rollout having to be aligned to BA
districts, POCL would now lead with infrastructure Rollout according to its
priorities and BA would follow with the Card issue and conversion of payment
method. The July 1998 Replan largely carried forward to the Codified

agreement.

Prior to cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card:

98.1. Approximately 200 branches had been rolled out as a live trial/ pilot in
1997. The primary focus had been on proving the Benefits Payment

Card solution (end to end operations starting with BA customer and

Page 32 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

benefits data going from CAPS to Pathway to the POCL network and

back to BA via POCL’s TIP).

98.2. The live trial/ pilot was increased in size by the addition of a further 100
branches (approximately) following the July 1998 Replan: the focus

shifted towards POCL functionality and processes.

Phase 2: After signature of the Codified Agreement — Background

99. Of those documents cited above at paragraph 94, WITN0O377_01/65 and
WITNO377_01/71 to WITNO377_01/78 all relate to the Rollout that followed the
cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card, from the resolution of Als and
Acceptance to the later stages of Rollout. | refer below to those documents |

consider most significant.

100.Following cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card and signature of the
Pathway/POCL Letter Agreement, a formal Operational Trial was kicked off in
May 1999, to run from 31 May to 16 August 1999, culminating in an Acceptance
decision. It was designed to test all the functionality and end to end processes
across Horizon (starting with POCL Reference Data going to Pathway, these
and Pathway Reference Data going to branch counters and transaction data

going back from counters to Pathway and on to TIP).
101.The Operational Trial ended with Als identified and Acceptance denied.

102.Under the terms of the Codified Agreement, the Rollout that had been planned
to start in September was put on hold while rectification actions were put in

place.

Page 33 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

103.As discussed at paragraphs 75 to 78 above, POCL and Pathway attended a
series of joint Acceptance workshops in order to progress Als as condition

precedent for starting volume Rollout (WITN0377_01/64).

104.The Codified Agreement set out an extremely tight timetable for rectification.
There followed an August dated Supplemental Agreement that allowed more
time. On 24 September 1999, a Second Supplemental Agreement
(WITN0377_01/79) further extended the deadline, to 24 November 1999. It
also determined that, notwithstanding that the Als were still being worked on,
1,800 branches would be implemented in October/November 1999 to prove the
Rollout processes and increase the size of the installed base upon which to

monitor live running of the Horizon service.

105.At the Special Delivery Meeting held on 14 January 2000, (WITN0377_01/65),
POCL accepted the Al rectifications subject to finalising a Third Supplemental
Agreement to deal further with Als 376 and 408. POCL and Pathway jointly
took the decision to start volume Rollout on 24 January 2000 on the condition
that the Third Supplemental Agreement would be finalised by then. It was

approved on 19 January 2000 (WITNO377_01/80).

106.Once approved, volume Rollout quickly hit a beat rate of around 300 branches
per week, in accordance with the Rollout Schedule 12 in the Codified

Agreement.

107.Ultimately, all four Rollout milestones were achieved on time.

Page 34 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Responsibility for the rollout of Horizon

108.Pathway was responsible for the Rollout of Horizon.

109.However, Pathway had dependencies on POCL to carry out each of the
following activities, each being subject to a CAR as listed in Schedule GOS of

the Codified Agreement:

109.1. ensure that postmasters would provide timely access to their post

offices;

109.2. ensure that postmasters would permit Pathway to make physical

changes to their branches so that PCs and printers could be installed;

109.3. ensure that postmasters would permit Pathway to arrange to have

ISDN connections to be installed;

109.4. ensure that postmasters would get themselves and their staff (some
67,000 in all) trained in the Horizon counter system (the training
courses to be provided by Pathway and scheduled to be held, as |
recall, no more than a month before the planned implementation date

for each individual branch);

109.5. provide the reference data needed to specify the characteristics and
prices of POCL’s products at each branch, applying the necessary
quality and process controls over changes to ensure that errors are not

propagated into the Post Office estate; and

Page 35 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

109.6. operate TIP (as mentioned above, POCL’s client facing back end
system) such that it would interface correctly with Pathway’s TMS

system.

Concerns about system performance and/or targets before start of the rollout.
110.POCL’s concerns were expressed through the Als. These are covered in more

detail below and in later sections of my statement.

111.For its part, Pathway had been working to resolve faults found in testing and
PinICLs which had been raised as a result of incidents reported to the Help
Desk. Highlights went to Management for review in a Monthly Incidents Report
(see examples: WITN0377_01/81 and WITN0377_01/82). Many PinICLs could

be (and were) mapped directly to an Al. POCL had visibility of those PinICLs.

112.Pathway had taken actions to deal with service quality shortcomings
highlighted in Monthly Service Reviews (see example: WITN0377_01/83). The
Help Desk had twice been put on “Red Alert” (the highest escalation level in

Pathway’s internal risk management process).

113.To assure itself that the system would scale, Pathway Programme and Risk
Managers ran simulations of system performance against different volume
scenarios to stress-test every component of the system. As | recall, in the run-
up to Rollout there were at least a hundred individual actions running as a result
of the stress tests. The outputs were consolidated into a Monthly Performance

Live System Reports (for example, WITN0377_01/77).

114.The Second Supplemental Agreement dated 24 September 1999

(WITN0377_01/79) approved the implementation of 1,800 post offices as a

Page 36 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

rollout trial in autumn 1999. It was recognised that none of the high impact Als
would have been resolved by then and that interim safeguarding arrangements
would therefore be required. Pathway would fund work to be carried out by
POCL to carry out AI376 related reconciliations in lieu of the automated checks
to be introduced in December 1999. The decision to go ahead with the 1,800
implementations was taken (i) to provide experience of rollout and (ii) to afford

an opportunity to monitor live operations on a larger estate.

115.In relation to the most critical Als:

115.1. Al298 — there had been some instability issues, notably with ISDN, over
the summer of 1999. These were resolved by October 1999 and the Al

was closed in November 1999.

115.2. Al218 — concerned training. It was worked through and closed (from

memory) in December 1999.

115.3. Al408 - Pathway had been missing Help Desk SLAs (in particular the
percentage of calls answered within 20 seconds). There were also
issues attributable to a lack of agreed scripts and agreed scripts not
always being adhered to (resulting in potentially inappropriate/
inconsistent resolutions of those calls), and to the ability of Help Desk
operators to deal correctly with cash account related calls (training and
resourcing). A rectification plan was agreed. Service quality improved

significantly in November and December 1999.

115.4. New “rules” to improve the service further were enshrined in the Third

Supplemental Agreement dated 19 January 2000 (WITN0377_01/80).

Page 37 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Some of the new rules required additional work to be carried out after
date of signature. The combination of the improvements already
observed and the commitments to fully implement the new rules gave
both Pathway and POCL the confidence, by 14 January 2000, to justify

the start of volume Rollout on 24 January 2000 (WITN0377_01/84).

115.5. That left Al376.

116.Resolution of Al376 was challenging. It had to do with detecting and correcting
possible errors (of various kinds) which could arise in the system and which
could cause cash imbalances. It was understood to be of critical importance.
My recollection of the causes and the solutions, as comprehended in

September 1999, can be summarised as follows:

116.1. Software faults: most of the software faults that had been identified had
either been fixed before or in CSR or had fallen away because they had

to do with the Benefits Payment Card solution.

116.2. Component failure (e.g. printer) or user error: typically causing
“Incomplete Transactions”, some of which would have resulted in cash
imbalances. Work to reduce the scope for user error would be worked
on and introduced in either an interim release, C13R, in or around
March 2000 or in Core System Release + (“CSR+’) in September 2000.
These included the addition of “no-entry signs” and system locks to
prevent the user from starting a new activity before completing the one
they were in. POCL knew that incremental releases would be
incompatible with Rollout and that CSR+ would not be ready before

September 2000.
Page 38 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

116.3. Mis-matches occurring within the end-to-end system: it was possible
under certain exception conditions (e.g. network failure) for transaction
and cash account data “harvested” from branches to get out of sync as
between the branch and Pathway’s TMS system or in the process of
transmission across the Pathway/POCL service boundary from TMS to

POCL’s TIP system.

116.4. The agreed solution was a 3-way reconciliation mechanism (otherwise
referred to as an integrity check) that would validate that (i) the branch
counters, (ii) TMS (Pathway’s central system), and (iii) TIP (POCL’s
central system) were all balanced and in sync. Where they were found
not to be in sync, the reconciliation would enable corrections to be made
by either Pathway or POCL in their respective TMS or TIP systems to
bring TMS or TIP into line with the transactions logged at the counter
and the cash account committed by the postmaster. Where they were
found not to balance or a difference was identified between the
transactions recorded in the branch and the cash account committed
by the postmaster, the intention was that the reconciliation would

identify the reason and enable it to be corrected

117.The above summarises my recollection of the way Al376 was viewed as at
September 1999. It changed materially over the next two months as a result of
monitoring the live estate. Monitoring in October / November 1999 revealed (in
PinICLs) an increasing number of cash imbalances attributable to Reference
Data faults. As | understand it, Reference Data faults had been seen in the

occasional PinICL previously but had not registered as a serious threat to the

Page 39 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

integrity of Horizon until then. Following the limited Rollout of the 1,800
branches and associated generation of Reference Data needed to “drive” those
branches, the Reference Data process had been exercised in earnest for the
first time, and had been found wanting. Note that there are two types of
Reference Data: (i) that controlled by Pathway to manage the release of new
software to each branch office, and (ii) that controlled by POCL to define and
manage the products it sells in each branch office. The Reference Data
relevant to each branch office was down-loaded by Pathway to that branch
office. In the case of product-related Reference Data, the data was first sent to

Pathway by POCL, then reviewed by Pathway and approved by POCL.

118.POCL Reference Data originated with POCL product managers (e.g. increase
the price of a First Class stamp from X to Y on Z date), got consolidated into
updates within POCL and then issued to Pathway to push out to all branches
which sold the affected products. The data needed to have landed in all
affected branches before the change was due to come into effect. A change in
the price resulted in a value stock revaluation at each counter. If a product was
withdrawn from sale at a given branch, that branch needed to remove its stock
of those items first. In short, there was considerable complexity that had to be

tightly managed end-to-end by POCL and Pathway separately and jointly.

119.Whereas each instance of a component fault or use error would affect just one
branch, a Reference Data error could have affected multiple branches, i.e. all

branches selling the product which is subject to the Reference Data error.

120.In November 1999, John Bennett wrote to David Smith of POCL formally

notifying POCL of Pathway’s serious concerns regarding Reference Data

Page 40 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

processes and controls. With responsibilities and control processes still the
subject of draft Contract Controlled Documents (also referred to as “CCDs”),
A2As and at least one CAR, Pathway put it to POCL that, as an end-to-end
issue spanning both organisations, this was a problem that both organisations
needed to get on top of urgently but that, as originator of the product-related
Reference Data, POCL needed to “own” the overall process controls

(WITNO377_01/13).

121.The criticality of the Reference Data issue was discussed at the Pathway Board

meeting on 24 November 1999 (WITN0377_01/72).

122.To understand better what had been going on in the run-up to the joint decision
to start volume Rollout in January 2000, in preparing this witness statement, |
went through PinlCLs raised in late 1999 that related to Al376. | do not recall
having seen any of these PinICLs at the time although (as explained above) |

had been briefed on the issue.

123.PinICLs PC0032552 (WITN0377_01/85), PC0031884 (WITN0377_01/86), and
PC0033363 (WITNO377_01/87) are examples of PinICLs that identified
Reference Data as the cause of issues. The records show that in each case
POCL were aware of what had happened and approved closure of the PinICL,

as demonstrated by the quotations below:

123.1. Pinl\CL Record PC0032552 (WITNO377_01/85)

= “This is clearly the result of the missing Primary Mappings on the
local travel ticket products in the Southend area. The error in the

reference data was corrected on Friday 24th September and

Page 41 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

therefore transactions recorded up to that time (Caps 26 and 27) will
fail to report to the Cash Account, causing a Receipts <> Payments

condition.”

= “ok to close as per martin box of pocl 16/2/00”

123.2. PinlCL Record PC0031884 (WITN0377_01/86)

= “The differences reported on the Cash Account originated in CAP 28
when two transfers of cheques (£2252.59 and £2168.89) were
corrupted due to the transfer reference data deletion during the

period 1st to 4th October.”

= “Defect cause updated to 16: Development - Reference Data”

= “The only evidence presented was for FAD Code 361704 and
therefore although it is probable that the other outlets referred to in
the call suffered from the same problem, it has not been possible to

confirm this without examination of the affected message stores.”

= “ok to close as per martin box of pocl 15/3/00”

123.3. PinlICL Record PC0033363 (WITN0377_01/87)

* “This call relates to 9911120543. Cash account Customer Call
reconciliation (itip) within cap 33, comparison of values within cash
account Customer Call file and those derived from the transaction
stream identified line 2015 declared is zero pounds, derived

£1049.00, difference is -£1049.00.”

Page 42 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

“Investigation of the message store shows that at the time the stock
unit balance was run for CAP 33 on 9.11.99, the reference data for
Product 56 had been deleted from the message store (it was
eventually re-instated on 11.11.99). As a result, the balance
summary record for Product 56 was written without any ‘Primary
Mappings’ (Primary Mappings are contained in the product reference
data record) and therefore the value, £1049.00, did not appear in the

stock unit balance or on the Cash Account.”

“CS/PRD/065 is the document that covers the Process for Removing
Products from Outlets at CSR. Section 3 refers to Pocl checking if
Live Outlets have stock or done any transactions. Pathway Ref Data
Team had flagged to Pocl that HR/911/003 contained ended links -
the Counter Update emails of 3/11 and 5/11 showed: “HR911003

Non Core Links - 3 x Lotto Products - Links ended.”

“Having spoken to Andy Corbett of Pocl OSG, the original change
(HR/91 1/003) was introduced as Pocl identified that this office would
no longer stock scratchcards (National Lottery). The XXX file was
then sent to enable the office to rem out some stock that had been

missed.”

Note that there was a gap of 3 days before that second file was
received, spanning the critical cash account day. As a result, the cash
account would have included the cash imbalance resulting from that

stock having been written down to zero.

WITNO3770100

124.The Third Supplemental Agreement (WITNO377_01/80) sets out
enhancements to the Help Desk and Reconciliation / Integrity Control
processes over and above those provided for in the Codified Agreement and

the previous Supplemental Agreements.

124.1. The “Enhanced Integrity Controls” introduce detailed provisions with
respect to the “Accounting Integrity Controls” (the 3-way reconciliation
mechanism), so-called “Defences” (new) and an “Attribute Checker”

(new).

124.2. The Accounting Integrity Controls introduced new and detailed
processes in relation to TIP data transfer rules which had still been

subject to A2As in the Codified Agreement.

124.3. The Attribute Checker was to (among other things):

= “detect and report on instances when the cash account payments

table total does not equal the cash account receipts table total’;

= report on those “records that cannot be harvested for onwards

transmission to TIP because they fail validation checks’;

= detect differences between the cash account and the control figures

accumulated daily at the counter; and

= carry out a “Receipts not equal to Payments check” to ensure that

the totals for the Payments table and the Receipts table are equal.

124.4. As such, the Third Supplemental Agreement did what John Bennett had

asked for in his November 1999 letter to David Smith

Page 44 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

(WITN0377_01/13): it tightened the processes very significantly and
clarified which party was responsible for doing what, notably
Schedule 4’s Error Matrix and the amendments to paragraph 3.6 of
Schedule G01 of the Codified Agreement set out in Schedule 5

(WITNO377_01/80).

124.5. The underlying premise was that, with these new tools, it should
generally be possible to identify each instance of error and to determine
the correction to be applied to each one (whether by Pathway or POCL).
However, Schedule 5 sets out the following amendments to paragraphs

3.6.1.1 and 3.6.12 of Schedule G01, respectively:

= "Inaccurate Cash Account (Not Data Error) means an Inaccurate
Cash Account which [....] is irrevocably committed by a User [....]
notwithstanding that, prior to irrevocably committing such Inaccurate
Cash Account, that User had been provided with a warning that
receipts and payments did not match and that continuing might lead

to an unbalanced cash account’; and

= “Where the Contractor is required to make an assumption in order to
correct a Data Error and/or present Repaired Transaction Data or a
Repaired Cash Account, the Contractor shall make such assumption

and promptly inform POCL of the assumption made.”

124.6. To my mind, these provisions acknowledge that it would not always be
possible to get to the root cause of an imbalance or to make the
appropriate correction. In every such case, POCL should have been

made aware.

Concerns about system performance and/or targets during Rollout

125.System performance was monitored continually throughout the 18 months of
Rollout. | recall challenges along the way as illustrated by the February 2000
Monthly Performance Live System Report (WITN0377_01/77) but also that
they were tightly managed by the Pathway Programme team. | do not recall
there having been any significant outages or degradations in service in relation

to system performance.

126.Pathway struggled to meet its contracted Help Desk SLAs throughout Rollout.
In September 2000, Keith Baines wrote to me alleging breach, as referred to in
the preamble to CCN 957b (WITN0377_01/88) and | recall that | replied citing
as mitigation the elevated volumes of calls attributable to product-related
Reference Data errors. A high proportion of these calls would have called for
reconciliations to resolve cash account imbalances — placing heavy demands

on Help Desk resources.

127.Allegation of breach gave POCL the ability to pause Rollout had they
considered that desirable. POCL chose not to do that, indicating that POCL
considered the Help Desk’s performance to have been “good enough”. (See
the letter from Keith Baines to me on 26 November 1999, WITN0377/01_78).
POCL and Pathway agreed with the signature of CCN 957b dated 21 June
2002 to vary the Help Desk SLAs as part of a package of changes to take effect
with the introduction of Network Banking. The Help Desk service was further
refined to better align incentives and value for money on 31 December 2002

by CCN 1100 (WITNO377_01/7).

Page 46 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

128.To the best of my recollection, the issue of unexplained imbalances was not
brought to my attention again as a problem after the Third Supplemental
Agreement (CCN600) was finalised and signed on 19 January 2000

(WITNO377_01/80).

Success of the rollout

129.From my recollection, Rollout was considered a success by Pathway, ICL and
Fujitsu Limited and, | believe, by POCL as well. All four milestones were
achieved on time. As | recall, the small number of branches implemented after
the 31 March 2001 target end date (mostly down to ISDN access issues) were

within the exception limit allowed for in the Codified Agreement.

130.This recollection is supported by the statement of Mr Roberts in the PAC

Hearing (WITNO377_01/6).

131.The Pathway Board Meeting held on 24 November 1999 (WITN0377_01/72)
noted that: “Payment was received on 22nd October for the £68m acceptance
milestone and the invoice submitted for the £90m implementation milestone”

(the 1,800). This was duly paid on time on 3 December 1999.

132.As | recall, POCL paid all the milestone payments on time. If POCL had had
any significant issues with either Rollout or operational performance, it would
have been POCL’s “style” to have highlighted them at the time and to have

withheld payment pending rectification.

133.As mentioned above, POCL had opportunities (rights within the Codified

Agreement) to pause Rollout but decided not to.

Page 47 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Lessons learnt from previous releases and their influence on rollout
134.The previous releases had been focused on deploying the Benefits Payment
Card and associated payments. They were characterised by the delays in
completing the Drop Down of BA Requirements and in resolving A2As. As
noted above, delays had also been experienced in relation to CAPS, which BA
were developing in parallel. Integration with CAPS was a dependency for
Pathway to be able to issue Benefits Payment Cards and make card-based

payments.

135.CAPS had been struggling, in particular, with multi-benefit entitlements. As a
result, the July 1998 Replan had proposed de-coupling the Rollout of Counter
infrastructure and deployment of POCL functionality from that of card-based
payments: BA would go ahead with Child Benefit but defer the other benefits
until CAPS was ready. POCL would be released from having to wait for BA to
be ready (WITN0377_01/9). It was this Replan that formed the basis of the

Rollout plan incorporated into the Codified Agreement.

136.Pathway had initially been granted more time on the basis that the delays were
not Pathway’s fault. But the failure to agree critical A2As in relation to the
Benefits Payment Card “rules” and the CAPS integration issues both persisted,
causing prolonged further delays and ultimately the decision to cancel that part

of the programme.

137.Removal of the Benefits Payment Card reduced complexity in the solution and
in relation to Rollout. It eliminated the inherent conflicts in business objectives
as between BA and POCL and improved the alignment as between Pathway

and POCL.

Page 48 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

138.Previous releases had been very much focused on BA functionality. The
number of Post Offices had been small, at around 200 (until increased to 300
following the July 1998 Reset). As | recall, lessons had been learned and
applied regarding training but otherwise | would say that the influence of the

early BA/POCL phase of the project on Rollout was minimal.

Factors influencing the timing and pace of the rollout
139.At the point where BA cancelled, Rollout had been re-planned to start in
September 1999. This intention was carried forward into the Codified

Agreement.

140.Cumulative Rollout milestones were set as follows (see Schedule A12 of the

Codified Agreement: WITNO377_01/14):

140.1. 1,800 by 1 November 1999;

140.2. 5,590 by 1 May 2000;

140.3. 10,680 by 1 November 2000; and

140.4. All by 31 March 2001.

141.The Operational Trial identified a number of Als that needed to be fixed before
Rollout could start. The Joint Acceptance Workshop was created to facilitate
the rectification process, with a deadline of 24 September 1999 for the Second
CSR Acceptance Test to have completed. The changes to the Codified
Agreement were introduced by CCN 550, the “First” Supplemental Agreement,

signed on 20 August 1999 (WITN0377_01/15).

Page 49 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

142.A Second Supplemental Agreement dated 24 September 1999
(WITNO377_01/79) introduced a further set of changes to the Codified
Agreement, pushing back the deadline for Second Acceptance to 24 November
1999 and the start of volume Rollout to 24 January 2000. However, in order to
(i) test the rollout processes and (ii) enable monitoring of a larger live estate, it
was decided to go ahead with the implementation of 1,800 outlets in October

and November 1999 subject to satisfactory safeguards being put in place.

143. The 24 November 1999 deadline was partially but not completely met.
Progress on the outstanding Als was considered by POCL to be sufficiently
encouraging that they decided to defer a Go / No-Go decision on Rollout until
14 January 2000, shortly before volume Rollout was due to start on 24 January
2000, whilst reserving their rights to defer Rollout at that time

(WITNO377_01/16).

144.At the Special Delivery Meeting held on 14 January 2000, POCL accepted the
Al rectifications subject to finalising the Third Supplemental Agreement (it was
approved on 19 January 2000) and POCL and Pathway jointly took the decision

to start volume Rollout on 24 January 2000 on that basis.

The decision to rollout and associated pressures
145.In my opinion, the previous delays had very little if any bearing on the decision
to roll out the POCL infrastructure and services when we did. That was all

driven by the status of the Als.

146. It is, however, fair to suggest that there was financial pressure on both Pathway
and POCL. After the years of false starts and moneys spent, both sets of

shareholders (and subcontractors) were looking to us to deliver.

Page 50 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

147.After the intervention of HM Treasury, it may also be the case that POCL would
have felt political pressure that, with the BA now out of the way, they should

get Rollout done according to the schedule that had been agreed.

Technical issues with the system during rollout
148.1 do not recall any significant technical issues being brought to my attention
during Rollout. Rollout quickly achieved a regular beat rate of around 300
branches per week over an 18 month period. In my experience, that would not

have been sustainable if there had been any significant technical issues.

149.1 believe that all four of the Rollout milestones set out in the Codified Agreement
were achieved on time, again suggesting to me that Rollout could not have
been beset with difficulties and, therefore, that it was not triggered before we

were ready.

150.At no time during my tenure do | recall “red flags” being raised by POCL (or
anyone else) about high volumes of unexplained balances, cash account
imbalances or failures in the Accounting Integrity Controls introduced by the

Third Supplemental Agreement.

Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects at the time of the rollout
151.1 knew that we had the following high and medium severity (Category “A” and
“B”, respectively) Als to deal with before rollout could start (WITN0377_01/64).
Category A:

151.1. Al218 - Training
151.2. Al298 — System Stability

151.3. AI376 — Data Integrity

Page 51 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Category B:

151.4. Al314 — Provision of Technical Documentation

151.5. Al369 — Scanner Reliability

151.6. Al372 — Systems Management

151.7. Al378 — Incomplete Cash Account Records

151.8. Al391 — Physical Security at Bootle and Wigan

151.9. Al408 — HSH (Help Desk) Performance

151.10. Al412 — Service Performance Ad Hoc Reporting

The 3 unresolved incidents that could have resulted in a delay in acceptance
152.In preparing this section, the Inquiry asked me to consider the minutes of a
Pathway Board meeting on 15 September 1999 (WITN0377_01/71). These
minutes refer to “three high severity incidents not yet resolved, which could

delay Acceptance”.

153.The three Als were:

153.1. Al218 - Training

153.2. Al298 — System stability

153.3. AI376 — Data Integrity

154.In addition to these three Als, Help Desk performance (Al408) was viewed as

important.

Page 52 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

155.As mentioned above, of these, Al298 was dealt with and closed in November
(see email from Keith Baines regarding a meeting with Pathway on 22
November 1999, WITN0377_01/17). Likewise, Al218 was, | believe, closed out

in early December 1999.

156.AI376 and Al408 remained challenging right up to approval by POCL at the
Special Delivery Meeting held on 14 January 2000 (WITNO377_01/65). More

on both of these below.

157.Under the terms of the Second Supplemental Agreement, 24 September 1999
(WITN0377_01/79), POCL had the right to postpone the re-start of Rollout if

not all Category A Als had been resolved by 24 November 1999.

158.We knew that at least AlI376 would not be resolved by then. It followed that
POCL could have opted to push back the planned date for starting the main
Rollout from 24 January 2000. They chose not to exercise that right,
encouraged, as | understood it, by the progress being made. They decided
instead to defer the Go/No-Go decision until 14 January 2000

(WITNO377_01/17), i.e. just before the 24 January 2000 planned start date.

POCL awareness of issues within the Horizon system at the time of rollout
159. POCL had conducted Acceptance reviews over the summer of 1999 as

provided for in the Letter Agreement and Codified Agreement.

160. These reviews identified a number of defects and vulnerabilities referred to as
Acceptance Incidents (Als). My understanding is that POCL had access to our
PinICL system and test data and that, under the aegis of the Joint Al Workshop,

they were intimately involved in the Al rectification plans, the implementation

Page 53 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

of those plans and monitoring following the application of system updates.
POCL then carried out a second round of Acceptance tests in respect of each
Al to confirm that the faults that had been identified had been resolved to their
satisfaction. That process ran through the autumn and winter of 1999 and into

2000.

161.My understanding is that the Pathway Al resolution leads shared with their
POCL counterparts the evolving status of each Al as it moved from
identification to resolution. Specifically, | believe that the Pathway leads (who
included John Dicks, Steve Muchow, Dave Hollingsworth, Dave Cook, John
Pope and Mike Coombs, as set out in WITN0377_01/64) would have made
clear which fixes would be included in the December 1999 system update,
which were to be included in C13R in around March 2000 and which were to
be carried forward into the larger CSR+ release planned for September 2000.
In the case of Al376, part of the resolution would lie in the introduction of
strengthened reconciliation / integrity controls. | believe that all of this was well

known to our counterparts in POCL.

162.When POCL approved the start of volume Rollout at the Special Delivery
Meeting held on 14 January 2000 (WITN0377_01/65) they did so having
satisfied themselves that the Als had passed their respective second
Acceptance tests or would otherwise be resolved through the introduction of
new provisions in one or other of the Supplemental Agreements. Resolutions
for Al376 and Al408 were finalised in the Third Supplemental Agreement

(CCN600) dated 19 January 2000 (WITNO377_01/80).

Page 54 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

163.The minutes of the Special Delivery Meeting (WITN0377_01/65) quote David
Smith as having “identified that for each of these areas there was now an
agreed way forward and that robust checks had now been put in place that
addressed the original concerns. However, there were still further checks to be

completed by TIP on the deployment of the integrity control.”

164.1 take the reference to “original concerns” as being an acknowledgement that
the enhanced Reference Data processes had only just been introduced by the
Third Supplemental Agreement on 19 January (and the Agreement
acknowledged that there was still work to do to complete the work), so there
would have been insufficient time to confirm that these new measures would
be 100% effective in preventing Reference Data errors getting through to

counters.

165.The agreement acknowledged that there was a possibility that a judgment call
would need to be made from time to time as to the appropriate correction to
apply when an error was identified: it followed that care would need to be
exercised over any problems flagged up by sub-postmasters in relation to

unexplained imbalances.

166.In my experience of large IT projects, some service quality shortcomings are
to be expected in any new system. In particular, the system may function
correctly when operated correctly but may not do so if operated incorrectly due
to user error. It is difficult to predict all user error scenarios and therefore to
guard against them. It is worth remembering that most sub-postmasters and
their staff had had no experience of operating anything other than a paper-

based system before going live with Horizon.

Page 55 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

167. POCL would have known that certain measures to inhibit user error would not

be delivered until CSR+ in September 2000.

168. In summary, notwithstanding the Al resolutions that had been put in place and
accepted, | would say that both parties knew that they should be on the look-
out for new incidents (such as those identified at paragraph 170 below) and that

they should make allowances for early life user error.

Pathway’s preparedness to provide customer services at the time of rollout
169.At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section, | have considered the

following documents:

169.1.The Service Review Performance Statistics for January 2000

(WITNO377_01/83); and

169.2. Two Pathway Customer Service / Business Support Monthly Incident
Reviews from December 1998 and January 1999 (WITN0377_01/81

and WITN0377_01/82, respectively).

170.The Service Review at WITN0377_01/83 had reported three types of failure

condition as having occurred in January 2000 (my emphasis added):

170.1. BT bills - invalid token: “On 27th January a large number of incidents
were raised because BT Bills could not be scanned. This was the result
of a Reference Data Process fail and a subsequent over-run during
the previous night. This particular problem was resolved by advising
counters of a work around and transmitting the missing Reference data

later that day.” The Reference Data problem could have been down to

Page 56 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

bad data sent to Pathway by POCL or bad execution by Pathway. Either

way, it points to fragility in the end to end Reference Data processes.

170.2. Blue screens - NT error: “These occurrences of blue screens were
caused by a communication outage to several Outlets. This resulted
in a system crash at the Counters. This problem with the network
connection has now been resolved and a fix delivered to all gateway
Counters in all Outlets.” Communication outages do happen but they
should not cause the Counter PCs to crash: it appears there had been
a software defect, corrected with a fix. This was a system error and a

Pathway responsibility.

170.3. Girobank transaction report: “A report fix was delivered on 26 January
to 1,100 Counters causing the following scenario to occur in a number
of Outlets. When a transaction was reversed on a lower numbered
Counter node, there was no evidence on the Girobank summary that
this reversal had taken place, although the correct information did go
to POCL TIP. Some Outlets realised this to be the case and altered the
Girobank summary to reflect the correct transactions. Some Outlets
however, completed the reversal again, which resulted in a
discrepancy for the value of this reversal. A fix was delivered on 31

January.” This was a system error and a Pathway responsibility.

171.The conclusion | would draw from the above is that there had been incidents

but they were not widespread and they had been quickly resolved.

172.The Monthly Incident Reviews dated December 1998 and January 1999 were

historic and of no significance by the time volume Rollout started. They set out

Page 57 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

the state of “Incomplete Transactions”, in particular, as they related to the
Benefits Payment Card. Any associated software errors that had not been
resolved by then would have fallen away with the withdrawal of the Card service

(within 60 days of cancellation in May 1999).

173.By 14 January 2000, POCL considered the Als to have been resolved

(WITN0377_01/65), subject to finalising the Third Supplemental Agreement.

174.Those Als included Al408 — Help Desk performance. However, with demand
rising at the rate of 300 post offices a week, meeting the SLAs remained a

challenge throughout Rollout:

174.1.CCN 957b dated 21 June 2002 (WITN0377_01/88) notes in the
preamble that Pathway breached SLAs at least 3 times during the 24
months period up to September 2000, giving POCL the right to

terminate;

174.2. however, at no stage did POCL determine that the Help Desk

performance was so serious that Rollout should be halted; and

174.3. the Codified Agreement was amended by CCN 1100 on 31 December
2002 to, among other things, reduce the Help Desk SLAs in return for
a price reduction, POCL having concluded that the SLAs had been
unnecessarily stringent and did not represent good VFM

(WITNO377_01/7).

175.Having looked again at the documents provided, | believe that, with Als judged
under control, Pathway was in good shape by January 2000 to provide a high
level of customer service during Rollout. However, it is worth noting that:

Page 58 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

175.1. the systems and processes were complex; and

175.2. many of the inter-actions with POCL, their sub-postmasters and clients
and Pathway’s subcontractors were new: they called for tight process

and stakeholder management not all of which had yet been bedded in.

AMENDED CONTRACT

Reason for amendment in 2002

176.As suggested by the Inquiry, in preparing this section, | have considered two
sets of minutes from a meeting of Fujitsu Services Holdings PLC (as ICL PLC
became known in April 20002) (“FSH”) on 20 December 2002

(WITNO377_01/89 and WITNO377_01/18).

177.The most significant changes that | can recall, and the reasons for these

changes, are listed below.

Changes to the contract pursuant to the 2002 amendment

178.This amendment:

178.1. introduced Network Banking into the contract, converting an A2A into a

fully defined service;

178.2. modified the Help Desk SLAs: it amended the charging mechanism to
be a fixed charge for the provision of capacity, putting the onus on POL
to predict the volume of calls it wanted the SLAs to apply to and, in
return, Pathway reduced the price of the service, improving value for
money for POL (as POCL later became known) (see paragraph 5.1 of

CCN 1100, WITNO377_01/7);

Page 59 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

178.3. introduced ADSL in place of ISDN, passing through to POL the
associated (significant) cost savings (see paragraph 5.8 of CCN 1100,

WITNO377_01/7);

178.4. extended the term of the contract from 2005 to 2010 in return for which
Pathway granted POL special discounts in 2003, 2004 and 2005 (see

paragraph 9.1 of CCN 1100, WITNO377_01/7);

178.5. taken together, gave POL an immediate annual price reduction of

around 20%;

178.6. it enabled POL to drive forward with Network Banking (essential to
preserve as much of its BA business as possible) and new business
based on counter automation (essential to replace lost BA revenues):

a new procurement in 2003/4 would have brought both to a stop;

178.7. added important interface and process rules that had been missing

(resolving long-standing A2As) for Reference Data and TMS/TIP;

178.8. incorporated a considerable number of CCNs that had been approved

since the Codified Agreement had been signed; and

178.9. introduced a two-speed CCN process to make certain CCNs easier to

fast track.

179.As part of the arrangement, POL would agree to release FSH from its existing

guarantee in return for a new guarantee (WITN0377_01/89).

Page 60 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

DEED OF RELEASE
180.As suggested by the Inquiry, in preparing this section of my statement, |
considered a Deed of Release dated 28 March 2003 between POL, Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd (the new name for ICL Pathway Limited), Fujitsu
Services (Pathway Asset Company) Ltd and Fujitsu Limited

(WITNO377_01/90).

The influence on decision making in relation to Horizon

181.By way of background, Fujitsu Limited was always the parent of ICL / FSH.
Following the buy-out of DLR and Girobank, ICL became sole parent of
Pathway. Fujitsu Limited had agreed before being down-selected for the ITT to
provide a PCG to underwrite Pathway’s financing and performance, in

particular with regards to the fraud indemnity offered by Pathway to the BA.

182.The Deed of Release at WITN0377_01/90 released Fujitsu Limited from the
PCG. With Rollout completed, all the large investments in development,
equipment, deployment, training, etc. had been made. From that point on, with
the fraud indemnity gone, there was no reason to retain the PCG: the risks for
POL were low at this point and were expected to remain so. POL was content
to give up the Fujitsu Limited PCG as part of a package of changes that would

involve a significant price reduction.

183.Dropping the PCG had not been considered at the time the Codified Agreement

was entered into so did not influence Rollout decisions in any way.

THE RELATIONSHIP WITH POCL/POL
184.At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section, | have considered

minutes of a Pathway Board meeting on 7 May 1997 (WITN0377_01/91).

“Customer education”

185.My recollection in this regard is as follows:

185.1. POCL wanted to forewarn its customers about the changes they should
expect from the impending switch from paper to the Benefits Payment
Card and to “sell” the advantages of the changeover. POCL were
concerned that, when told they were to be issued with a Benefits
Payment Card, some customers might decide to go over to ACT

instead.

185.2. Provision of such public relations material had not been included as a
Requirement and had not been costed into our response. | suspect |
drew attention to it at the Board meeting as an illustration of our
intention to charge for any work that was not in scope and to resist

“requirements creep”.

186.The challenge POCL faced in relation to “customer education” was, as | recall,

to:

186.1. encourage its customers to see the advantages of moving over to a
Card based system (single compact instrument, increased security
against theft, etc.), so that customers who had the choice would opt to

stay with POCL and not move over to ACT; and

Page 62 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

186.2. make the messaging as simple and reassuring as possible for POCL’s

customers — many of them elderly or disadvantaged.

187.As | recall, the information was to be presented in multiple languages to

address the many different customer bases.

188.The description of the change to Benefits Payment Cards would have included:

188.1. cards instead of books and Girocheques;

188.2. how they would need to identify themselves to register their card;

188.3. restrictions on who could encash on their behalves; and

188.4. restrictions on how many “foreign” encashments they would be able to

make per annum.

189.The challenge was to present that set of information so that customers would

view the Benefits Payment Card as a positive.

The relationship with POL as at the autumn of 2000
190.As suggested by the Inquiry, in preparing this section, | have considered
CCN 957b, which concerned the variation of SLAs in relation to answering Help

Desk calls WITN0377_01/88.

191.1 believe Pathway’s relationship with POCL at this stage was actually pretty

good.

192.By late autumn of 2000, Rollout was on track with approximately 13,500 of the
18,500 branches completed and CSR¢+ (a key upgrade) had been implemented

successfully.

Page 63 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

193.As already considered above, the reference to the alleged Help Desk SLA
breach in the CCN was a preamble to set the scene before going into the details

of an agreement to amend the Codified Agreement. The amendments:

193.1. introduce Network Banking; and

193.2. reduce the Help Desk SLAs to a level that represented value for money

without jeopardising quality of service.

194.In the same way as POL was content to give up the PCG, POL was content to
relax the stringent Help Desk SLAs in the original agreement in return for a

price reduction.

My relationship with POCL in around December 2002
195.As suggested by the Inquiry, in preparing this section, | have considered the
Fujitsu Key Personnel schedule from 19 December 2002 (WITN0377_01/92),
which describes one of my tasks as “Championing new ways of working and

act as a champion within Fujitsu Services for Post Office.”

196.A key POL business objective was to develop and grow their business by
leveraging counter automation. The minutes of Pathway Board meetings show
that we were looking for ways to help POL do that but had had limited

engagement.

197.My “USP” was “Knowledge of the Agreement, the new Charging principles and
mechanisms and the intentions of Fujitsu Services in agreeing the changes
made by CCN 1100”. Behind CCN 1100 (WITN0377_01/7) lay a great deal of
history and also considerable technical complexity: better for POL to deal with
someone who understands the nuances than someone new.

Page 64 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

198.The “Task” of “Championing new ways of working and acting as a champion
within Fujitsu Services for Post Office” was, as | saw it, all about innovation and
lowering barriers. CCN 1100 had used technical innovation to reduce costs. It
also applied some subtle changes in incentives and working processes to

better align the two businesses and reduce stress.

Relationship between Pathway / Fujitsu and the Post Office during the period of
my involvement

199. Initially, the relationship with POCL was indirect via the PDA, where the PDA

was resourced by BA and POCL personnel but was representing two clients

who were not well aligned as between themselves: the resulting inabiity to get

time-critical decisions taken (A2As, CCNs) created day-for-day delays and

undue stress in the relationships between all three parties.

200.Direct interaction with POCL once the PDA had been dismantled in 1998 was
better than dealing with the PDA, but still fraught because now POCL had to

secure BA’s agreement behind the scenes.

201.Following cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card, alignment between the
remaining two parties (POCL and Pathway) improved almost overnight: we
were now able to do business together, properly, for the first time. That newly
aligned relationship carried us through Acceptance and Rollout and into

Network Banking and contract extension.

202.Personally, | considered the relationships | had with my opposite number, Keith
Baines, and other members of the POCL team to have been professional,

respectful and straightforward. We got on well together but never got too close.

Page 65 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

203.Which is why | was as shocked as | was to hear about the prosecutions when
| first saw them reported in the press, which must have been ten plus years
ago. To the best of my recollection, the fact that these prosecutions were going
on was never brought to my attention at the time let alone raised as a concern:
| have no recollection of having been asked to take a look at what might be
going on under the covers, which is what! would have expected given my direct
involvement in the Third Supplemental Agreement and, more generally, the
close working relationship we were supposed to have (see for example
paragraph 93 above). Neither do | recall the subject being raised during my
renewed engagement with POL to work on CCN 1100. If there had been any

concerns on POL’s part, this was the perfect opportunity to raise them with me.

204.1 discuss my understanding of the contractual obligation relating to the

provision of data to POCL with regard to prosecutions at paragraph 277 below.

Post Office involvement in setting Requirements
205.POCL had been involved and had contributed to the joint BA/POCL

Requirements set out in the February 1996 ITT.

206.As stated already, many of the Requirements were too high level and lacked
the necessary process definitions essential for low level system design. The
contract acknowledged the need to agree almost 300 A2As, with more A2As
implied. Putting to one side the large number of Benefits Payment Card-related
A2As, there were also A2As in relation to Rollout, the TIP interface, Reference
Data, the cash account, asset management, training and Help Desk support —

all in POCL’s domain.

Page 66 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

207.Some of these had been settled before the Codified Agreement was entered
into but others had not been: in particular, important A2As to do with end-to-
end Reference Data processes and controls, the TIP interface and Help Desk

scripts.

POCL awareness of difficulties with Horizon, including in respect of bugs, errors
and defects
208.1 have described the process running up to the decision taken on 14 January

2000 to start volume Rollout on 24 January 2000.

209.1 have noted in paragraphs 159 - 168 above that when they took that decision,
POCL knew that it was likely that instances of cash imbalance would still arise
under certain exception conditions, in particular Reference Data errors and
user error. Specifying how to deal with those as and when they did arise was

the main purpose of the Third Supplemental Agreement.

210.In addition, it should in my view go without saying that the live running at scale
of any new system is likely to throw up some previously unidentified bugs
notwithstanding extensive trialling and testing. And that a certain amount of

time needs to be allowed to put those right.

211.Given this knowledge, | took it as a given that POCL would give sub-
postmasters the “benefit of the doubt’ while the new system and processes
were being bedded in and the rough edges removed. To do so would be
standard practice with any new system. Here we had 67,000 users most of
whom had never used IT automation in their businesses before. Their entire
method of working needed to be changed from paper to electronic. That would

take familiarisation, support from the Help Desk, and feedback to Pathway and

Page 67 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

POCL to effect system corrections and process improvements. All of that would

take time.

212.During that bedding in period, | would have expected POCL to have reviewed
the error correction reports submitted by Pathway to POCL in accordance with
the Third Supplemental Agreement (see paragraphs 225 - 229 below) to

ensure that Pathway was carrying out those corrections appropriately.

KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS AND DEFECTS

213.At the suggestion of the Inquiry, in preparing this section on knowledge of bugs,
errors and defects, | have considered various examples of PinICL exports from

the period 1998 to 1999 (WITN0377_01/93 to WITN0377_01/98).

214.The PinICL system was the system used by Pathway to log system defects,
including incidents raised by postmasters with the Help Desk, and to track their

progress through to resolution.

215.lssues would be raised with me if the technical expert or support person thought
there might be contractual implications with regards to the defect or resolving
the defect. That could have involved the need to take a contractual position
with POCL or, by way of example, the need to escalate a particular issue to the
CEO of Escher to secure fast turnaround for a fix. Other than that, | would have
reviewed the Monthly Incident Reports which summarised where we stood but

generally have had no day-to-day involvement.

PinICL Record PC0015152
216.The Inquiry asked that | consider PiniICL record with number PC0015152

(WITN0377_01/99), which has to do with recovering BA payment transactions

Page 68 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

lost as a result of a break in the network connection. As set out in the PinICL,
the fact that it would be possible to use “BES no EPOSS” and “EPOSS no BES”
error reports meant that it was not essential to have the Receipt / BESCommit
message reconciled. The reason this was important was that it was now too
late to add the Receipt / BESCommit message reconciliation into the up-

coming release.

217.PC0015152 notes that the subject of lost transactions is a “very sensitive area”.
This is because the objective was to never lose a single transaction from the
system or, failing that, to be able to recover any that had been lost. This was a
basic integrity principle in the same vein as never amending or deleting

transactions from the system.

218.1 do not know whether this specific PinICL or issue was raised with POCL. What
| can say is that it was specific to BES — the counter service associated with
the Benefits Payment Card. The issue would have fallen away with the

cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card.

219.For the reasons set out against my name in the body of the PinlCL, | believe

that this issue was adequately addressed.

PinICL Record PC0010071
220.The Inquiry asked that | consider PinICL record with number PC0010071
(WITN0377_01/100) involving a request made by the BA to delete 200

customer entitlement records.

Page 69 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

221.The PinlCL sets out the position thus:

“CAPS require deletion of records from PAS CMS.
CAPS have been sending us incorrect data in respect of customer details. They
have requested that we delete around 200 beneficiaries/cardholders from the

system.”

222.The BA/POCL Agreement specifies that no client data should be amended or
deleted. Knowing that to be the case and having confirmed it with our in-house
lawyer (as set out in the PinICL), the Pathway Problem Manager declined the
CAPS request and gave her reason for doing so. She instead invited CAPS to
send a new file containing instructions to de-activate each of those faulty
records and another replacing them with new, correct customer data. BA

ignored her suggestion and continued to press her to delete the records.

223.1 would not normally have been involved in a PinICL but, given the contractual
impasse, the Pathway Problem Manager asked me for my advice on what to

do. | am quoted in the PinICL as saying:

“The CAPS request on us is to delete data from PAS/CMS files. We are not
permitted under the contract to delete or amend client data. The advice given
to you/ position taken by Tony Hayward is correct and should not be deviated
from. If CAPS do not accept it, you should explain that you are under instruction
to do nothing by your contracts people, and the reason why. If still not happy,

advise them to escalate the matter to their contracts people.”

Page 70 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

224 Pathway held to its position. For its part, CAPS never did respond to Pathway’s
proposed solution. The issue went away when the BA cancelled their contract

a few months later.

225.PinICL PC0010071 illustrates that Pathway took seriously its contractual
obligation to not amend or delete client data. It does, however, leave open the
question — were there other occasions when Pathway did amend or delete client
data? Also, could it have lost or corrupted client data? | will attempt to answer
those questions from the perspective of one who was involved in the resolution

of Al376 and the resulting Third Supplemental Agreement.

226.POCL’s extensive branch network was inherently vulnerable to breaks in
communication, physical equipment failures and possible human error.
Unfortunately, any of these can cause reporting errors to arise whether or not
there were also bugs in the software. The Third Supplemental Agreement
obliged Pathway to carry out reconciliation and other integrity checks to ensure
that all parts of the system were in sync and reporting the correct information.
Where a mis-match was identified, Pathway was required to trace the cause
and to correct the error itself (in TMS or Riposte) or inform POCL as to the
correction POCL should apply in TIP. POCL was to be sent the details of every

correction made.

227.It is my understanding that:

227.1. Riposte (the operating system used in branches) used a distributed
“messaging” architecture akin to Blockchain. The key attribute of a
messaging-based system is that it should ensure that no transaction

would ever be “lost”, deleted or tampered with without detection. Any

Page 71 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

change made to a transaction would show up as a new message within
the audit trail for that transaction: original messages would not be over-

written.

227.2. All counters replicated their messages across all other counters. This
provided resilience within branches with two or more counters, ensuring
that transactions would not be lost. It meant that the cash account could
be produced each Wednesday, the end of the branches’ week, even if
one of the counters went down and stayed down. There should have
been no need to keep running totals of the cash account because all
the messages remained in the branch to be aggregated when the cash

account was run at the end of the week.

227.3. The solution was designed to operate mostly offline, connecting when a
banking transaction required an authorisation or otherwise around
every 15 minutes to allow counters to replicate messages to the central
servers. The offline/online design mitigated the inherent unreliability of
network communications and significantly reduced communications
costs (to POCL’s benefit). At the time anything other than dedicated
leased lines (dial-up or ISDN, and later DSL) was prone to line failure
that could result in data loss and would have required the branch to
either shut or revert to manual processes for the duration of the network
outage. The downside of the offline/online design was that timing
differences could occur when there was a network outage. Timing

differences were one of the reasons identified by Al376 and the Third

Page 72 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

Supplemental Agreement for having to make corrections to central

systems.

227.4. EPOSS was written on top of Riposte’s POCL specific functionality to
take instructions from POCL supplied Reference Data (inputs) and
produce the transaction and cash account data required by POCL’s TIP
system (outputs). TIP in turn provided data to POCL’s clients. My
understanding was that the Reference Data supplied by POCL provided
the data dictionary definitions that would normally have been set by

Pathway.

227.5. Certain types of Reference Data error would have generated cash
imbalances. | would have expected any such incident to have
generated a call by the sub-postmaster to the Help Desk and a follow-
up investigation by a Cash Account specialist. And that the result would
have been an error correction to the branch records with the agreement
of the sub-postmaster. Such corrections should have been made in the
central Riposte servers and (as above) should have showed as discrete

messages, in addition to the original transaction messages.

227.6. The Third Supplemental Agreement required Pathway to disclose the

details of all error corrections to POCL.

227.7.The Third Supplemental Agreement recognised that in some
circumstances it would not be possible to identify what had gone wrong
and therefore what correction should be made. Such instances were to
be expressly disclosed by Pathway to POCL. Although not expressly

stated, the logic was that it would fall to POCL as ultimate owner of the

Page 73 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

service and of the relationships with its clients and sub-postmasters to

exercise judgement in such cases.

228.What | have described above is the layman’s understanding of someone who
needed to know sufficient information about the system to be able to take
contractual positions on Pathway’s behalf but whose technical expertise was
limited. To arrive at this understanding, | was dependent on inputs provided to

me by my technical colleagues in Pathway and experts in Escher in particular.

229.1 should make clear that | cannot comment on the extent to which Pathway’s
operational support unit applied the provisions of the Third Supplemental

Agreement in practice.

PinICL Record PC0059753
230.The Inquiry asked that | consider PinICL record with number PC0059753
(WITNO377_01/101) and the Peak record of the same number
(WITN0O377_01/102), which have to do with the incorrect classification of

certain transaction types.

231.To quote the PinICL:

“On investigating this appears to be due to incorrect mapping of the APS Products

that were expected to be associated with AO2 namely

. 3169 Teignbridge D C N
. 3177 North Devon Homes Ltd

. 3178 North Devon Homes Ltd”

Page 74 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

232.Instead of being mapped to “02: APS Cash Payments - Tokens Handed Back”
they were being mapped to “A01: APS Cash Payments - No Tokens Handed

Back’.

233.If not resolved, the volumetric reporting of transactions by transaction type
would have been mis-reported to POCL the following month when this new
form of reporting was to be introduced for the first time. | was looking to have
the error fixed before then. Mis-reporting would have damaged Pathway’s

credibility.

234.However, it is important to note that neither the transaction as viewed by the
customer nor the cash account balance as viewed by the sub-postmaster

would have been affected by the mapping error.

235.This was known among some members of the Support and Test teams within
Pathway and the Head of Customer Service but, given that it had no impact on
either sub-postmasters or POCL customers, this was (rightly) not viewed as a

high profile problem.

236.The discrepancy was duly corrected in time for the April 2001 invoice.

237.This is an example of product-related Reference Data error, but it is one that

did not generate an unexplained imbalance.

238.In conclusion, | believe all the appropriate actions were taken with regard to
this particular PinICL. However, it does illustrate that there were issues to

address within the end to end Reference Data processes.

Page 75 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

UNEXPLAINED BALANCES
239.In order to prepare this section, the Inquiry asked that | consider a
memorandum containing emails between Keith Baines (POCL), Ruth Holleran
(POCL), David Smith (POCL) and others with subject ‘High Al Re-classification
Tactics’ (WITN0377_01/103). | would not have been aware of POCL’s internal

correspondence at the time.

AI376
240.“Unexplained balances” were the subject of Al376 and then a large part of the

Third Supplemental Agreement. It is a complex subject.

241. To determine fault, consideration needs to be given to exactly why those
unexplained balances could have occurred. In the following section | will do my
best, as a non-technical person casting his mind back some 20 years, to
describe possible causes based on my recollection of the Horizon system as it

was in 1999/2000.

242.As | see it, an unexplained balance could have occurred for any one of the

following reasons:

= Software coding error (bug);

= Operational (component) failure;

= User error; and / or

= Reference Data error (product).

243.It was important to distinguish between these possible causes in order to

determine (i) what needed to be done to stop / prevent the imbalances from

Page 76 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

occurring, (ii) who needed to do what to correct them if they did occur, and

(iii) accountability and/or fault.

Software coding error:

244 An error in the software code will cause the system to produce an outcome that
differs from what had been intended under a particular circumstance. The
system will always produce the same (bad) outcome under the same

circumstance.

245.In my view, software coding errors would always be Pathway’s fault.

Operational (component) failure:

246.A component of the physical infrastructure fails causing the transaction to break
in the middle of its execution and not complete correctly, resulting in an

“Incomplete Transaction”.

247.Components that can fail and so result in this happening include:

= Printer (including paper outage);

= Counter (PC freeze); and / or

= Network communications (network down).

248.It is a fact of life that component failures will occur from time to time: the
question is how the system behaves when that happens, how it recovers, who
needs to do what to correct an incomplete (broken) transaction if that is the
outcome and what happens if it is not possible to determine what the correction

should be. Attribution of fault depends on the answers to those questions.

Page 77 of 97
User error:

WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

249.The Horizon system is complex from the user’s perspective, with some 3,000

different products on sale on behalf of multiple clients (e.g. BA, DVLA) and

many different functions to perform on a single device.

250.Complexity brings with it considerable scope for user error. That is especially

the case where users have previously done everything manually.

251.Examples of user error include where the clerk:

initiates a transaction on one Counter, then does so a second time on

another Counter because, say, the first Counter is running slow;

starts another transaction before completing the current transaction (on

the same Counter);

starts a transaction and makes a payment but then does not complete

the transaction in the system;

starts a transaction and makes a payment but then voids the transaction;

starts an admin activity before completing the current transaction; or

pulls the paper out of the printer before it has finished printing.

252.In the real world, notwithstanding training and operating instructions, user error

will happen from time to time. The questions are then how the system behaves

when it does happen, how it recovers and who needs to do what to correct an

Incomplete Transaction, an Uncommitted (voided) Transaction or one left in an

“open state” if that is the outcome.

Page 78 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

253.The question of fault is a difficult one to determine as it involves consideration
of whether the user has operated the system correctly and whether the service

provider should have done more to make the system harder to “break”.

254.An example of making the system harder to break was implementing a utility
that automatically completed an open transaction after 74 seconds. Doing that
roughly halved the number of instances of Imbalances in relation to BA

payments.

Reference Data error:

255.As already described above, product-related Reference Data are instructions
provided by POCL that define the products that POCL sells across the branch
network. Not all products are sold everywhere. A change starts with POCL’s
product manager, is transferred to Pathway as a set of instructions for Pathway
to act on and is then downloaded to the affected branch counters (not
necessarily all branches are affected). The change must have a pre-set
implementation date and the data must have been downloaded to every

affected counter before that implementation date.

256.Ensuring that Reference Data is always 100% correct calls for strong controls
to be designed in and applied at every stage in the data’s “lifecycle”, “end-to-
end”: starting with data definition by POCL, checks by POCL, transmission by
POCL to Pathway, checks by Pathway, transmission by Pathway to branches,
and ending when the data has been (correctly) applied at every branch counter

where that product is to be sold. Failure to do so can (and will) result in

transaction errors. These may be a failure to categorise the transaction

Page 79 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

correctly (as above) or, far worse, Incomplete Transactions resulting in cash

imbalances.

257.To illustrate by reference to PinICL PC0028734 (WITN0377_01/104):

“The particular circumstance which has been highlighted is the possibility of
removing a non-core link for a value-stock product (or removing the product)
where there is some stock in the outlet. Currently the counter takes no action
to avoid this..... A routine should be introduced, similar to the warning about
stock revaluation, which would prompt the counter clerk to tidy the system a
few days before the end date. This routine should enforce the rem-out of

products on the last day to ensure that the system is left tidy.”

258.On 4 November 1999, John Bennett wrote to David Smith of POCL to escalate
Pathway’s concerns about the end-to-end controls then in place and to warn
him that “significant changes are necessary if the national rollout is to be
conducted safely’. He sought “an urgent workshop to review end to end

reference data management’ (WITN0377_01/13).

259.On 5 November 1999, John Dicks (Pathway’s Solution lead) wrote to his POCL
opposite number John Meagher to make clear that Pathway attributed multiple
incidents experienced during the monitoring period for Al376 to incomplete
Reference Data - and to highlight his concerns. He notes that Pathway had
“identified the problem and formally notified POCL of the need to rectify it in

June (1999) but that POCL had not acted on that warning” (WITN0377_01/19).

260.1 believe that POCL had taken the position that it was up to Pathway to identify

and filter out any errors passed to them and to correct them. On 18 November

Page 80 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

1999, | wrote to Keith Baines (WITN0377_01/20) reminding him that, under
CAR 891 (in addition to the associated Contract Controlled Document (CCD)
and rules set out in the Interface Specification Document), POCL had the

following responsibilities:

= The POCL RDS Operational Team (POCL’s Reference Data Systems
team) was to ensure that Reference Data was “forwarded to ICL

Pathway in an accurate and timely fashion”, and

= The POCL “Change Authorisers” were to ensure “that the change
information ultimately passed to the RDS Team is accurate, complete

and timely’ and that was required to be confirmed to Pathway.

261.The Third Supplemental Agreement addressed the question of who was to be
responsible for what with regards to accounting integrity within the Horizon
system, end-to-end. It specified the correction processes to be applied from 19

January 2000 in relation to every known type of error.

262.But some of the provisions were still a work in progress. For example,

paragraph 5.2.3 of the Third Supplemental Agreement states:

“in connection with that referred to in item B5 in the table at Schedule 4,
relating to reference data leading to the incorrect summarisation of products
196 and 197 in the cash account, the Contractor will co-operate with POCL
and assist POCL to prevent recurrence of similar unintended effects of

reference data changes by:-

(i) developing a diagnostic tool (the "attribute checker"), which will
accurately predict the effect of applying all reference data changes;

Page 81 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

(ii) assisting POCL to put in place appropriate authorisation processes;

and

(iii) co-operating with POCL to define business rules and procedures for
applying the attribute checker and authorisation processes referred

to in sub-paragraphs 5.2.3(i) and (ii) above...”

263.As comprehensive as it was, the Third Supplemental Agreement could not
guarantee success in preventing further Reference Data errors which in turn
could cause cash imbalances in branches. It envisaged that the new “attribute
checker” tool could be made to work so as to help POCL avoid further product-
related Reference Data errors generating cash imbalances. But it still had to

be proved.

264.Pathway would undertake certain checks and put in place certain defensive
measures but ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of product-related

Reference Data lay with POCL.

265.As | understand it, Help Desk data continued throughout 2000 to show elevated
volumes of calls associated with cash account imbalances caused by product-

related Reference Data errors.

266.It follows that any determination that fraud had been committed (that the
missing cash had been taken by the clerk, not paid to the customer) should
only have been arrived at after thorough consideration of the audit trails and
that, until all the enhancements had been put in place and been proved to work

effectively, due allowance should have been made for user error, system

Page 82 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

failures and Reference Data quality issues (whether caused by POCL or

Pathway).

267.In summary:

267.1. in order for the Horizon system to function correctly, there needed to be
an absence of software bugs in the system that could cause incorrect

outcomes (not all bugs cause incorrect outcomes), but

267.2. the absence of any such bugs would not have guaranteed that every
outcome would be correct — because there were factors other than
software bugs which would have generated incorrect outcomes

(notably bad Reference Data and user error).

Matters other than Al376
268.The correspondence | was asked to review for the purposes of giving this

statement included references to Al298.

269.As already noted, Al298 had to do with system stability. Concerns had been
raised over the summer of 1999 in relation to the number of re-boots needed
and so-called “hour glass” instances of slow running. There had also been a
number of communication breaks. By the start of 2000, Al298 had been signed
off as resolved in respect of all these issues and, to the best of my knowledge,

there were no significant system stability issues subsequently.

GENERAL
My resignation in 2002
270.After six years working on the bid and for Pathway, having overseen the

contract reset, Acceptance and the first three tranches of Rollout, | was asked

Page 83 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

to step into a new role as Commercial and Finance Director for ICL’s newly
formed Large Projects Division. This comprised all of ICL’s recently won PFI
contracts, including Pathway. | began my new role in February 2001, handing

over my Pathway responsibilities to my successor Colin Lenton-Smith.

271.My resignation from the Pathway Board was formally submitted to the next

Board meeting in January 2002.

Impact of financial / contractual arrangements or financial pressures on the
issues which the Inquiry is addressing

272.Firstly, | want to say that | have been shocked and deeply saddened by the

revelations being examined in this Inquiry and the damage done to innocent

individuals.

273.Was Pathway driven to take shortcuts and to encourage POCL to commence
Rollout sooner than was safe? It is undeniable that the financial incentives to
roll out quickly were strong. But having already taken a reputation hit over the
cancelled Benefits Payment Card (notwithstanding that the NAO Report and
PAC Hearing to a significant extent exonerated us for that failure —
WITNO377_01/5 and WITN0377_01/6, respectively) we were acutely aware

that we could not afford another set-back such as Rollout going badly.

274.We had applied fixes to address the Als that had been identified, monitored the
system between October and December 1999 across a large-scale live trial
and had passed POCL’s Acceptance tests. We had put in place rigorous
integrity controls to address the cash imbalances issue. POCL had declared

their satisfaction with the outcome.

Page 84 of 97
WITNO3770100
WITNO3770100

275.POCL wanted to roll out Horizon for their own business reasons.

276.There is only so much simulation one can do in a test environment or even in
a live trial. At some point the system has to be taken live to find out how it
operates at scale. While issues are being identified and fixed, it is, in my
experience, generally accepted practice that allowances should be made for
early life operational issues. That would have been especially appropriate in
this case where most users had had no experience of automation before

Horizon and where there were known vulnerabilities to user error.

277.1 was aware of POCL’s facility to mount private prosecutions against sub-
postmasters determined to be acting fraudulently and that the Codified
Agreement required Pathway to provide audit trails when requested to do so to
support such prosecutions. My expectation was that each case would be
properly investigated before concluding that the cause of a cash shortfall was
indeed fraud rather than some kind of mis-match in the system. To the best of
my recollection, | was never asked to look into any of these cases — indeed, |

was completely unaware at the time that the prosecutions were going on.
