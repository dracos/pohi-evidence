[Start of Response]

the problem occurred on 15/09/10 when stock unit 02 rolled over. This was originally reported, as per KEL ballantj17590, in I
jcall PC0204537 /tfs 2868995, but for some reason the call was closed without being investigated.

jthere is a known problem with the use of the Cancel button during stock unit rollover. This is fully described in KEL
ferightm33145J. A fix is currently being worked on. I
