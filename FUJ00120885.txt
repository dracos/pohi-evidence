Sharon & lan,

This appears to be saying that the banking transaction recovery has worked correctly without any impact to branch or
customer. The recovery of the health lottery transaction however was not successful.

It appears that the postmaster followed the on screen prompts and processes correctly can that you confirm that for me
please? It doesn’t tell me whether there’s any impact to branch or customer for the Health Lottery Transaction but Pat
has kindly rung the branch and confirmed the customer isn’t impacted, nothing changed hands for the Health Lottery
transaction, and there is no branch discrepancy.

I’m therefore happy to authorise this session to be deleted so that the kit at the branch can return to BAU state.

I still need to understand the background to this type of enquiry, what has happened in the past, where would
authorisation have been requested from. If a branch has followed process correctly that may explain why Network
haven't been asked for authorisation in the past but without identifying root cause or knowing past cases I don’t know
where this should sit or why Network need to make the authorisation.

What needs to happen now is that the reason for the unsuccessful recovery of the health lottery transaction needs to
be established so that if this scenario happens again the branch or customer isn’t impacted. Who has responsibility for
taking that forward please?

Thanks
Anne

Following a conversation with Rebecca, I’ve been asked to provide further information regarding the transaction to assist in

progression the deletion.

The details provided by the Postmaster are :

Time: 18
Date: 23/02/2015
Node: 4

PM has advised the following happens when he logs in to node 4.

A recovery message. appears advising a failure occured during a previous session.

PM presses continue - Recovery details:

Cash withdrawal 00-269323-4-4536297-1
FUJ00120885
FUJ00120885

PAN 633641******0508
Date/Time: 23/02/2015 10:46:21

id they gave the customer £140, so PM presses yes.
Start recovery process, ‘Horizon was processing a health lottery transaction when the system went down."
This transaction will now be cancelled by the health lottery.

PM presses ok.

PM then receives the following message: ‘Void not confirmed, recovery process was unsucessful the cancel of the health lottery transaction cannot be confirmed, No further action
is required.’

PM presses enter and it logs him out.

Hi Anne

I don't know where it sat before all I know is that it did not sit with Duty Manager and to be honest I do think it should sit with
branch to provide confirmation of what transaction needs removing. Fujitsu may have changed their process following watchdog
articles and this is why they are no longer accepting confirmation over the phone. Can anyone in network agree the process
Regards

Rebecca

All,

Can someone please provide me with the process that was followed for this type of enquiry prior to Service Integration
FUJ00120885
FUJ00120885

and who the escalation point(s) were? This type of request has not formerly been managed by the Branch Support
Team and if it needs to be embedded into a BAU environment I would prefer to understand the background to the
process, where it should sit (based on earlier cases) so that enquiries are dealt with consistently and are fully
documented for audit purposes.

Please provide me with some understanding of how often this happens, root causes, potential solutions, impact to
branch/customer and whether there's any financial implication.

There must have been examples of this prior to Service Integration so please could you urgently provide the
background so this case isn't held up and any future cases are managed efficiently in the appropriate area. 14,

Thanks
Anne

Subject: RE: 16809136 / A7701255 - Meanwood Branch - Unable to Connect to the Data Center

Please could you assist. The Meanwood Branch has reported an issue with a Health Lottery transaction that is now preventing the
terminal from connecting.

Fujitsu is requesting for an authorisation for them to remove the Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 -1 which is preventing
successful recovery on counter node 04.

As per Fujitsu's investigation;
According to counter log, there were two transactions in the session 4-520273.

1. Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 -1
2. Banking txn 00-269323-4-4536297 -1

The settlement failed due to poor communication with the data centre (Network issue) and user was logged out by the system.

When the user logged back in, the recovery kicked-in. But the recovery of the Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 -1 failed.
As the recovery failed, user was/in unable to logon to Node:4.

Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 will need to be remove on the counter logs because it is preventing successful recovery.
Node:4 will NOT be usable not until the said txn is removed.

Authorisation is required urgently to enable the Post Master to get the node back on line.

Please could the Area Manager provide the authorisation or someone from with the Network area as this must originate from
within Post Office Ltd.

I have spoken to Rebecca to agree the way forward as neither Atos or the IT Supplier Management are able to authorise the
requested action.
