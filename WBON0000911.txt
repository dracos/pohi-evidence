gement Additional Questions

James, we did not discuss timescales but I have just been asked by Leighton for some more details before a

10:30 meeting today.

These are to the best of my knowledge:

Question I about the TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL table.

WBD_000781.000001
WBONO000911
WBON0000911

How does this process operate and who has the ability to be able to perform this e.g. POL and/or Fujitsu?;
and

The normal support route is used to identify when a fix is required, either from a branch raised incident or
estate monitors that alert support staff.

A TES incident would be raised with evidence.

This would be transferred to the SSC as a Peak because they support the applications.

The SSC would investigate with evidence from the support branch database and then liaise 4" line
development (evidence and progress would be recorded on the Peak).

4th line development would generate the required scripts using a test system to make the correction.

An MSC (or OCP/TfS) would be raised for permission to run the support tool on the live branch database
(BRDBX015).

The SSC would run the script using the support tool against the live estate.

What monitoring is performed over the table TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL?

The Support tool is written to run under the SSC (read only role) role and connects internally as the
APPSUP role (write permission).

All changes are written to the AUDIT logs.

The output from the support tool is captured and recorded on the Peak.

I can find just one recorded use of this tool:

Date: 03/03/2010

TFS: 20156

Peak: PC0195561

OCP: 25882

Branch: 226542

Question 2 about JOURNAL_SEQ DENSE_SET_CHECK ENABLED setting.

Can we see evidence to demonstrate that this parameter is currently set to “True”?; and

I ran this query against the live BRDB (node 1) today at 09:47

WBD_000781.000002
1 select * from brdb_system_parameters

2* where parameter_name = 'JOURNAL_SEQ_DENSE_SET_CHECK_ENABLED'

These are the results:
PARAMETER_NAME:JOURNAL SEQ DENSE SET CHECK ENABLED
VERSION_NUMBER:1

INSERT_TIMESTAMP:05-OCT-09 04,06.30.0639 AM
START_DATE:05-0CT-09
PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION: Indicates whether sequence checking is required in BRDBC002
PARAMETER_TYPE:T

PARAMETER_NUMBER:

END_DATE:

PARAMETER_DATE:

UPDATE_TIMESTAMP:

PARAMETER_TEXT:

This indicates that this parameter has not been changed since created on 05-Oct-2009

WBONO000911
WBON0000911

Who has access to be able to amend this parameter and is any proactive monitoring performed to ensure

that it is not altered?

As this is in the database it would require write permission to update the parameter.

This would require access to the APPSUP role which may be granted to the SSC under MSC. Any change

to this role is audited.

I am unaware of any proactive monitoring of these values.

Regards

John

James,

I have been provided with your contact details by my colleague, Mark Westbrook, as somebody who may

be able to assist with technical queries we have in relation to the Branch Database.

Please could you review the email trail below, and advise whether this is something you can assist with?

Kind regards,

I’ve had a chat with Jane and I believe the only way we will be able to resolve this is if you get
confirmation from Fujitsu of whether this has ever been done and what the process is (POL have no direct
access to the database). If corrections are needed, “we” insert a transaction to correct the situation
following a reconciliation process rather than make direct changes to any transaction in the database.

I am in a similar position with the audit trail question

I believe you have a contact in Fujitsu who can confirm directly?

Thanks

Following review of the technical design document in relation to the Branch Database, I had a couple of
queries that I was hoping you may be able to help with. If not, please could you direct me toward
somebody who may be able to assist:

) Balancing Transactions

Section 5.6.2 describes back end database amendment process which is included by design:

Inserting Balancing Transactions

From the above we wish to clarify, with evidence where possible:

How does this process operate and who has the ability to be able to perform this e.g. POL and/or Fujitsu?;
and

What monitoring is performed over the table TXN_CORR_TOOL_JOURNAL?

) Audit Store File Generation — Optional Parameter

Section 7.2.2.8 on page 122 describes how:

WBD_000781.000006
WBONO000911
WBON0000911

Can we see evidence to demonstrate that this parameter is currently set to “True”?; and

Who has access to be able to amend this parameter and is any proactive monitoring performed to ensure
that it is not altered?

Jane - Per our conversation earlier this morning, have you been able to locate any of the documents to
support the ‘Client File Receiving Project’ 2012? As discussed we'd like to see evidence to demonstrate
that the correct plans, approval and testing was performed before the change was applied to live, so would
expect evidence such as:

Business plans and requirements;

Steering group minutes;

Approvals at each stage of development, testing and final go live;

Evidence of any testing performed during the development life cycle; and

Post go-live review to ensure business requirements were met and any residual risks were adequately
documented.

If any of you have any questions in relation to the queries raised, please feel free to give me a call.

Kind regards,

Sean
