Version: 0.4
Company-in-Confidence Date: 26-FEB-2004

1.0 Introduction

This document reports on the issues that arose from a major incident affecting on-line
transactions that occurred on 16 February 2004.

This report covers:
- How the problem came to light
- The impact on the branch service
- The investigation
- The resolution
- The root cause

- Actions to prevent recurrence

2.0 Scope

The scope of this report is the major incident that occurred on Monday February 16" that
affected all online transactions at 920 Branches.

3.0 Management Summary

On Monday 16" February 920 Branches were unable to perform online transactions. The
problem was caused by the expiry of keys on the VPN Servers in the Data Centre. The key
expired at midnight on 14" February. Any Branch that needed to reconnect to the Data
Centres after that time was affected by the problem

The HSH took 500 calls on the problem and a further 597 calls were abandoned.
The Engineer Service as provided to Branches was also impacted - details are in Section 4.1.1.

Initial investigation by support and development staff centred around cryptographic keys,
because there had been an issue on Sunday with the expiry of the Key Disc on the VPN
Loopback Work Station (an administration tool not required as part of live service). No
problems were found (there were no system events to suggest any issues) and the
investigations widened to look at the network. It was not until the middle of the day that the
problem was diagnosed.

Following the production of new keys, the VPN servers at Wigan began to be rebooted from
around 16:30 which allowed gradual restoration of on-line service to the affected Branches.

There are similarities between this incident and the Smart-card Acknowledgement Key expiry
incident of 31% July 2002.

Although Post Office Limited were kept updated on the problem during the day, it was not
possible to advise on how much of the estate was affected.

Company-in-Confidence Date: 26-FEB-2004

On the subsequent day (Tuesday 17" February) the estate was running normally. In the
morning of the 17" the third-line support team were unable to contact 348 Branches but non-
polled checks, monitoring of calls to the HSH and proactive calls made by HSH to Branches
showed that in practice the estate was back to business as usual.

A set of corrective actions has been identified and they are listed in Section 7.

4.0 Description of the fault and service failure

4.1 Symptoms and Business Impact

4.1.1 Symptoms as seen by Branches

920 branches would have seen the "on-line services unavailable" message and were unable to
undertake on-line transactions for all of (or in some cases the greater part of) the day. There
would have been a corresponding impact on customers visiting those Branches.

The Engineer Service as provided to Branches was impacted in the following areas:

e Break Fix: Gateway PC calls could not be resolved. However peripherals faults
received an engineer visit as normal and slave counter faults requiring a base unit
swap received an engineer visit once it was confirmed that the Gateway at the
branch was still in contact with the data centre

e ADSL hardware roll out: Out of 41 scheduled upgrades, 15 jobs were cancelled
and rescheduled.

e OBC Branch Change: No “opens” were scheduled for this day, however 4
“counter increases” were cancelled and rescheduled to 17" February with the
agreement of Post Office Ltd, NIET Chesterfield.

e Bureau de Change Upgrades: 14 Bureau de Change upgrades were scheduled and
following discussion with Barry Evans, Post Office Ltd, the decision was taken at
approximately 1.15pm to cancel 13 jobs (1 branch had been successfully
upgraded).

e Data Retrieval: All data retrieval calls were suspended.

4.1.2 Symptoms as seen by Fujitsu Services

On Sunday 15" February a key expiry on the VPN loopback workstation was noted. No VPN
Server events were generated at that time. Further immediate action was deemed not to be

necessary and, as the VPN loopback workstation is not business-critical, this was logged for
resolution on Monday.

On 16" February a trend of calls to the HSH was noted shortly after 9.00 and the escalation
process began. During the day HSH took 500 calls stating online services were unavailable. A
further 597 calls were abandoned.

The issue identified on the 15" led to initial investigations into the problems experienced by
the Branches being focussed in the area of VPN keys. However, no symptoms of key expiry
on the VPN Servers were found during the first round of investigations by support and
development staff.

4.2 Detailed explanation of the incident

Although not recognised at the time, the keys on the VPN servers expired on 14" February.
Following this expiry any Branch which became disconnected from the data centres would not
be successful in reconnecting and would thus not be able to perform on-line transactions.

A key expiry on the VPN loopback workstation (which does not form part of the live service)
was noted on 15" February during a business continuity test where a VPN Server had been
disconnected and then reconnected. This informed the first investigations on the morning of
16" February when the initial calls to the HSH, stating inability to perform on-line
transactions, were received.

These initial investigations, which involved both support and development staff, did not locate
the fact that the keys on the VPN servers had expired as there were no system events to
suggest any issues. The scope of the investigation widened to encompass the network.

Following investigation during the morning it was established by CS Security, in checking
back through their records from the time the keys were first installed, that the VPN server
keys had in fact expired and that new keys needed to be generated. Due to a problem with the
key generation workstation at Bracknell the Key Manager was relocated to Feltham and the
work undertaken there.

At the end of the afternoon the VPN servers at Wigan were updated with the new key. The
Bootle VPN servers were updated during the evening.

The number of Post Offices on the non-polled report overnight was normal for a Monday
night. There were 31 calls to the HSH on the morning of Tuesday 17" February - of these 21
were cleared by a reboot and the rest went for resolution by Energis - again, normal business.

The picture was clouded by the fact that the third line support team were unable to contact
348 Branches when doing their check. However, checks by HSH and further work by SSC
confirmed that there were not any on-going issues.

6.0 Problem Management

The processes for problem management regarding escalation and communication were
followed. However, there were a number of issues.

It took too long to diagnose the underlying problem. There were no system events that
indicated that there was a problem with the keys on the VPN Servers.

Once diagnosed, there was a delay of some 30 minutes in the production of the new keys due
to problems with the key generation workstation at Bracknell.

On Monday 16" Fujitsu Services were not able to advise Post Office Limited of the number
of affected Branches. It was only possible to estimate the figure of 920 Branches after the
problem was diagnosed.

The checking by third-line support staff on the Tuesday morning of the 920 Branches, by then
known to have been affected on the Monday, took too long to enable timely information to be
provided to Post Office Limited. Furthermore the result of the checks indicated that there
were still problems in the estate, when in practice this was not the case.

Problem 455 has been logged on the Problem Management database for this incident.
