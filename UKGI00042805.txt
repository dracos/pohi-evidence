‘+ The relationship with POL's generally open and fairly collaborative but with room for
improvement. POL can perceive UKGI team as asking for ‘too much’ information

‘+ Although there is no formal governance or shareholder relationship letter with POL,
there is a clearly defined governance relationship set out n POL's articles and a
contractual funding agreement that sets out key elements of the shareholder
relationship (e.g. access to information). There is also an entrustment letter in place.
Currently developing a framework agreement.

‘There are formal financial meetings held every month (and quarterly shareholder
‘meetings) tailored to UKGI's needs, and quarterly reports on investment performance.
Access to senior management and others relevant members also good

‘UKG! administers a complex working capital facility which we would like to transfer

Board and exec team are generally of good quality. Extension of Chair's term to
December 2022 has been approved. CEO despite some identified weaknesses works
well with the Chair.

‘= There has been some chur at the executive level - recently the Chief Executive of the
Financial Service and Telecoms business segment has left and a new Retail Chief
Executive has joined. Whilst both are stil bedding in, we consider that there is a
continuing trend of strengthening the team under the CEO and CFO.

‘There has been no recent Board Effectiveness Review; chair known to be sceptical

UKGI currently undertakes both policy and shareholder functions, and POL has
suffered from a lack of policy sponsorship in BEIS.

BBEIS have agreed in principle to take over policy function. This should include taking
‘over some time-consuming aspects including correspondence and daily management
of a short term loan facility.

‘Meeting with BEIS team in July to flesh out detail and timing.

Financial Performance (“F")

alance Sheet & Risk (

POL's financial performance is much improved over the last five years. It achieved its first
"oft In 16 years of €13min FY 16/17 and ison tack to achleve an operating profit of
‘approximately £36m before subsidies in FY 17/18 (ahead of £28m target). The three year
strategy targets £85m by 20/21, so that it will not require ongoing HMG subsidy and
Investment funding.

Better performance has partly been driven by significant cost reductions, although there
is scope to do more. New technology provides capability for POL to considerably improve
its Management Information.

UKGI will be providing close scrutiny and monitoring of POL's performance in delivering
‘against this objective.

UKG1 also monitors the performance of POL's investments and approves the release of
Investment funding tranches on a quarterly basis, with a maximum of £210m available in
investment funding over the period 18/19 and 19/20.

‘The Company has an adequate capital structure - £370m funding agreed to be provided
by BEIS over the 3 year period to 2021, State Aid Approval obtained, £950m loan facility
‘extended to March 2021. Treasury approval obtained for a £50m facility for emergency
intra-day cash needs for the POL network. UKGI currently working through how this will
be operated by BEIS.

There is an ongoing litigation being undertaken against Post Office Limited in relation to
historic claims about the Horizon IT system. If successful, the quantum of the claims
‘could be substantial. Itis worth noting that POL's auditors EY have agreed POL's
‘accounting treatment of this, which is not to create a provision given the lack of claim
details to date.

POL Is considering the buy out of a JV with Bank of Ireland. At over £250m, this would
require additional capital funding
