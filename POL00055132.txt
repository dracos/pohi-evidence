To copy everything on the transaction log covering 1st December 2006 to 31st December 2007 would be
approximately 91,000 pages per jury bundle (7,000 pages x 13 months). Multiply this by 10 bundles and we
have a total of 910,000.

This would have to be outsourced and a rough quotation from a company called Service Point}
TGSRO has put the cost at a minimum of £18,300. I stress however, that they have not seen the Tayout OF
‘trartsaction log data so this is only a very conservative quote at this stage.

In addition this amount of paper would equate to about 37 boxes of photo copy paper so transportation,
storage and handling costs would be another add on.

How could the jury see the judge if they were behind a jury bundle containing 91,000 pages? A ream of photo
copy paper contains 500 sheets and measures about 2 inches thick. Imagine 182 of these reams piled up in
front of you for each jury oundle ~ that’s 30.3 feet.
