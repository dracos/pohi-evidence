inister Hollinrake Monthly meeting wi (rescheduled 28th

Have sent a teams but can someone urgently try and find those slides that POL
presented to the minister about headcount? I think it was from the first meeting where
the interim CFO attended
BEIS0001018
BEIS0001018

He is also asking for a complete breakdown of POL staff by pay and by grade - he's
asked POL for this multiple times and is getting increasingly frustrated that this has
not been supplied.

This is very urgent

thanks,

Jamie

Hi Jamie,

As discussed, please find attached an updated briefing which reflects POL’s request to
reorder the Agenda and includes lines on the Postmaster Remuneration announcement.

N.B. I have reiterated to POL colleagues the importance of keeping to time and ensuring that
item 2 (Central Costs) gets a proper airing.

All the best,

Rebecca
