Cooper, Tom - UKGI }
RE: Post Office Litigation - CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE

Tom has forwarded your below email.

As I explained when we spoke, the concern from our end is HMG being seen as not upholding the independence and
integrity of the judiciary, hence the concern about Tom making a decision as a Director of POL on whether to make a
recusal application. However, it is perfectly proper that Tom, as a director, should to ensure the Board fully realised
the seriousness of what was proposed including the impact on the shareholder (and the difficulties of distinguishing
between strategic direction and operational matters in Parliament and the media) as well as the wider litigation
strategy, that the Board had taken and properly considered legal advice, and finally has reflected properly on whether
there was bias or (painful as it is) inferences/findings drawn ultimately properly from hearing the evidence expressed
in pithy and robust language. In supporting Tom I would like to receive the information relating to the recusal issues.

Apologies if I suggested otherwise in our call.

Happy to discuss
Kind regards

Richard

Tom
Please find attached the note referred to.

In my call with Richard on Friday, he gave me the impression that the UKGI legal team would not want to
be seen to have received the information relating to the Recusal issues. To that end I have not provided
any of the advice to him. If that position has changed, would you please ask him to let me know?

Kind regards,

Jane
