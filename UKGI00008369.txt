Thanks Stephen. The driver is arriving at 10.30am to collect the box so I will need the briefing by 10am. Is that okay?

Hi Sam,

I’ve circulated draft briefing for stakeholder comments by close tomorrow so getting it to you for first thing Friday
should still be ok.

Tom, Nick, Stephen,

I initially commission the briefing for this meeting for Friday, however Kelly has asked for her meeting briefings for
Monday and Tuesday to be sent to her this Friday. Would it be at all possible to have the briefing by the end of
tomorrow or first thing Friday instead? We are currently sorting out what time exactly the box will leave on Friday so
will come back to you shortly to confirm — if it’s afternoon, it would be fine to send it up in the morning for example.

Hope this isn’t too much of a pain. Happy to discuss.

Many thanks,
Sam
