PTC

Lose the one month phone call and the PTV at three months and change it to a
PTV at one month and PTA at 6-9 month stage. Generally if a Subpostmaster
is struggling with a particular element it will have raised itself by one month, it is
much easier to sort out problems on site rather than over the telephone, if
additional training/ support is required the Sub may be reluctant to ask for it over
the telephone but on site you can see the issue. It seems daft to me to leave it
until the 3 month visit if the Sub tells you over the telephone that everything is fine
at the one month stage.

PTC

If three elements of PTC are to be maintained then the questions should be less
repetitive. What is the point of asking at one month “are you aware of the Helpline
to assist you” then repeat the question at the PTV and PTA. If know about the
Helpline at the one month stage then they obviously know about at PTV and PTA
so why ask again it just makes us look unprofessional. The questions should only
be repeated if there was gap last time.

Can we find a compromise, for existing Postmasters who are required to attend
classroom training. There have been several occasions recently, where
postmasters have attended courses.For example Twechar, where the postmaster
had 10 years previous experience, but had taken over the Office from his father.
He only required the conversations, to boost Office sales.

Castlemilk road where the Postmaster had owned and run Burnbank for over two
years, so only required the conversations.

Fortunately the attendance of both Postmasters was not detrimental, or disruptive
to the new trainees, but this could easily be the case in future.

In addition, the above examples could easily produce negative Kendata scores as
a result of attending a course needlessly.

Loose notes reference to pouch numbers as there are only two pouches

On Site/PTC

From my experience both are working well, and feedback from the postmasters
has been positive.

complete the filling out of the PSA

Set-up a group to change and test what goes on EASE. People using the system

EASE regularly should control more of what is on it and where it goes.

All I know we use Mondays etc when free to update ourselves, but occasionally
preparation time and keeping up to date should be scheduled.

The running order of the classroom course. To me it is totally illogical. What other

I've just completed a classroom course and session 28 could do with sorting out —

geographical spread, it’s unrealistic to schedule them to the FTLs. I’ve had some FSAs
complete some for me, and also ran a training session and shadowing for FCAs, a
couple of whom have done some visits for me

This is from a SPMR, via Kendata, and although they’re not an internal stakeholder,
thought I'd include it anyway: “As the audit and Post transfer visits were conducted on
PTC the same day I was not pre-informed. Had I known I would have made provision for
another member of staff to be present as I happened to be alone on that day and
therefore not an ideal situation. Otherwise the visit went well.”

needed?), similar to the one we had on EASE for the old module 2? The test could be
Classroom on all aspects of the PO and classroom course, is given out at the start and the end of

Since review my time in the classroom has been limited so I can only judge on a
couple of days; Timings seem tight to get the course done in 8 days. Long days
reduce learning ability. Course being rushed would be worse. Suggest an extra day to
make a 9 day course, which would still be 1 less day than before modular course.

Too much to cover in the 8 days, but the new delegates do struggle to take all on

classroom board with the timetable sessions. Suggest back to 10 days

Day 1- should include Business awareness (sess. 3) due to the history of the Post

Classroom Office, business value, retail standards and mystery shopper

classroom Security (45) should also be on day one to highlight importance

Royal Mail 1* & 2"4 Class / Rec Del/Special Delivery (18) The slides from 1-22 are

On Site delays on transfer of deeds/funds due to solicitors/banks can make it a late opening

Classroom Timetable / Days Allocated - We can cover the course in how ever many days are

relegating some of the talking sessions to handouts gven before the delegates arrive,

Weekly evaluation at the end of 6 days — take time out from PSA. We feel an

Network Field Support I Classroom evaluation is a better guide to delegates understanding.

PSA needs to be revisited as we feel at the present it does not give a guide to how the

Classroom Knowledge quizzes for example — the ones used in module 2 for the financial
products.

Classroom More practical’s, delegates find hands on more beneficial.
Classroom should be made a specialist that is not to say that no one else should ever

Classroom do it. All should be given the opportunity to cover if necessary. We feel it gets watered

Classroom Train the trainer? Quality needs to be good, Sub postmasters are investing a lot of

money and poor training also has a knock on effect when it comes to an audit.

Compliance workbooks or learning packs should still be issued as delegates that have
Classroom been on the course have not been able to read up before taking the on line tests, and

aspects of balancing — for example, TP and BP, net discrepancies’ settling centrally,

We keep getting experienced Spmr’s on CTC’s and after discussing it with my team
we agree that that they are not a benefit to the course. Not that they are purposely
trying to disrupt or spoil anything. It's just that we find They get bored listening to what
they already know. Some have had to pay extra wages so they can attend to be told
what they know already. They try to help others which is not always a good thing as
they show them the shortcut’s etc. When they do exercises on Horizon they complete
well before the others and this has a detrimental affect on the others confidence.
Some contradict or tell them “how it should be done, never mind what the Post Office
say's”

Classroom Please don’t think we are being negative, quite the opposite. Our suggestions are that
Have a 2 day course for them where we can concentrate on matters such as branch
standards, compliance, sales, etc. Arrange a training regime that suits them, such as
on site.

1. The trainer assess their capability

2. Helps any member of staff that may need support

3. Concentrate on any specific area the Spmr requests help on

4. Agree with the Spmr what we can do best for his office

5. Agree with the Contracts Advisor this course of action

6. Have a signed pro-forma that the Spmr signs to say he is OK with this process.

Also we think we could look to have a different process on-site for Spmr’s who are not
On Site going to have an active part in the running of the office. If we try to get them to be
behind the counter for the 6 days training this leads to problems.

On Site of week 1 the Subpostmaster just goes down the list and puts a tick against whatever

On Site PSA Alter PSA so if you mark a subject as Red then a comment feeds through to the
action plan (make it the same as the CAT reporting tool).

Would like to see a place where comments can be left by the on site trainer, e.g.

On Subpostmaster generally very good however there was an issue when his paystation

Site/Classroom crashed three times in one day or Subpostmaster had his rubbish stolen whilst I was
on site. This would assist with the PTC process as whoever was completing this
element would have an understanding of any problems the Sub was having.

Visit is extremely useful to get genuine and honest feedback, however it is not best
use of FTL's time and generates high t&s costs because of the areas covered.

PTC Perhaps they could be scheduled for the FSA and then the FTL to pick up at least 2

Bit concerned that there is absolutely no mention in the objectives about focusing on
providing a high standard of ‘customer service’ ... the focus seems to be sales and
transactional! I think the first or second bullet needs to reflect the importance of

Classroom

I feel that the new module does not cover any means of test after day 5 and day 8.
Previously with the old course we covered a course on day 5 which gave an indication
on how the delegates under stood the transactions and the course, which also meant
that any weak areas could be forwarded on to the onsite trainer , The same with day 7 &
8 there is no test to show if the delegates have understood the sessions.

Classroom

There are many areas as a ctc trainer that I have had to deal with in a short period of
time, and its then we build up the rapport with the new delegates, if we know they have
left the course happy and understood , then the transition will not be so daunting.

Classroom

have heard from previous delegates with the group how much they have to take in
such a short time.

Classroom

Many of the new delegates who are spm do not seem to have contact from HR &
Recruitment with regard to contracts, transfer dates change due to problems with
outgoing, so may be if both teams could contact the new spm whilst they are on the
course it would avoid cancellation or changing transfer dates at the last minute,

Classroom

Most of the time the spm have not received contracts and additional papers from HR.

Classroom

It would be nice to have a CA to sit in on a session to see how delegates are doing on
the course, but understand they are busy, but we have to pick up the pieces when they
are struggling.

Classroom

Over all my main changes would be to have a 10 day course as before, and having day
2 on all sales products , The secret and perfect branch all covered at the same time.

Classroom

Also to have a test on both day 5 and day 10 so we know how well the delegates have
done and also it gives the ctc trainer an idea on how the course went.

On Site

Ready to Serve - This requires the Subby to do a check every day which is too much
and not really required. As a result, they tend to do it for about a week or two and then
forget it. It would be better if it were a ‘once a week’ task and maybe the completion of it
should be checked at audit.

PTC

1 month Call - These calls can be difficult. You cannot see if the Subby has a queue and
if it really is convenient to be talking with him. A visit also allows you to check on the
general running of the office in the most crucial early stages e.g. is he/she doing
everything right. Any problems can be resolved quickly which, under the present
procedure, would not be spotted until the 3 month visit.

PTC

6-9 month audit - There is rather a lot to do at this audit and it all takes a long time. It
can be very difficult to ask all of the questions, and talk about everything that we have
to, whilst the Subby is trying to serve customers.

On Site

Minimum Service Standards (conversations) - Is it just me? I've tried to instil the correct

conversations into the folk I've trained but they all want to ‘say it their way’. Then at later
visits, all of the work done on these conversations is proved to be a waste since they are
not having them as they should be.

PO Local

General - Completing the transfer and then expecting the branch to open in the
afternoon is a very optimistic expectation. In all but a handful of cases the money
transfer for the business does not take place until at least 2pm on the day of the transfer
and it is quite often later than that. Once the money has transferred the incoming is then
pulled in all directions, trying to learn from the outgoing what all the keys open and
close, learning the locking up process, how the tills work, dealing with stock takers,
removal men, agreeing meter readings, putting beds together so the children have
somewhere to sleep that night, numerous phone calls from the bakery/ milk/ newspaper
supplier wanting to set up accounts etc etc. The last thing they want to do serve in the
PO. So you either get the staff running the branch, which is OK as you can get them
coached in minimum sales standards (if required) but this could obviously be completed
later in the week However as the on site FSA you want the new Subpostmaster and it is
very rare to see him/her. If a single person branch you get a very harassed person who
wants/needs to be elsewhere and he/she takes nothing in. No matter how much you
stress on the pre transfer telephone call what the expectation is in my experience it does
not happen successfully very often, I feel we should go back to lunchtime transfers and
leave the PO closed pm. As branches are generally busier mornings that afternoons
anyway less customers would inconvenienced. Branches were there are staff or the
Sub wants to could still open after the transfer once the money has gone through and it
would make better us of FSA time as we would not need to attend until lunchtime in all
but the busiest branches where it may be beneficial to go a bit earlier. We would not to
sit around for at least half a day and sometimes considerably more awaiting the transfer
of funds. I am of course aware that there would be an additional cost of one day on site
training if it was decided to stick to the same delivery package as at present, but this
would in my opinion be justified as the value of day one on site in terms of training is
generally worthless.

transactions in branch are mails should we spend more time percentage in the

The new Help navigation exercise - This new exercise crucial to the new course to ‘sow
the seed’ of the importance of the Help function was not in my prep box (2 weeks ago). I
had to print off my own copies.

Confirmation required that this will in future be included.

Classroom

Having done my first course for quite a while I went into this course with a positive
attitude but possibly looking for issues.

My initial thought is what has changed. I have already expressed the opinion that we
might have missed the boat as far as making changes to the course and still hope this
isn’t seen as being negative and unconstructive. It seems to me all we have done is to
take the old sessions, up date them a little but no longer call them module 1, 2 or 3. 1
was very aware that this course is still a one size fits all type of course which is aimed
more towards the crown office branches. All of this might of course be changed with the
network changes, even so, SPMR of Main PO Branches are not the same as counter
assistants in a Crown Office, my feeling is there should be a course written completely
from scratch that is aimed specifically at someone who will have to run a branch by
themselves after a couple of weeks or so. As a for instance, we could cover Rem’s more
fully.

The notes are very full now almost scripted and even though I tried to follow them I
found I was talking a head of the slides. I do find it hard to train with the notes in front of
me meaning that I have probably missed something that was important. The onsite
training will probably high light if that is the case. When I was running courses back to
back I developed my own style and more importantly, made changes. So the next
course always ran smoother than the previous one, unfortunately this doesn’t seem
possible now, which I fully understand.

Day 2 I found a very heavy day and I think the delegates did as well. Someone
commented that Business awareness sits better in day one. I didn’t really understand
slide 14 in session 9, and there are no notes. The notes for slide 6 say, ‘you may have
seen this before’, when did the delegates see this slide before? If we are going to simply
put another presentation designed for a different type of audience into the course, can
we at least make some changes to reflect what we are about? In fact I wasn't

comfortable delivering this session as although it clearly is important, I didn’t feel
qualified to deliver it. It is clearly designed to be delivered by an experienced sales
manager. Still I feel I did my best.

I haven't really done that much on-site training, however I don’t see there is much
change here. The main issue I think on site is training a new PM to run a well managed
On Site branch and some time in a classroom setup going through basic routines, i.e.
Remittances, MVL procedures etc I am sure would be useful, let's call a one day
induction.

I can’t comment on the PTV as I haven't done one, however the phone call is good as
issues can be picked up quickly. As to the audit, again this is good as it picks up any
problems, however, would it not be better to do a compliance audit at the 3 month visit
PTC and use the actual audit at the 6 month stage to gauge whether any gaps have been

closed. This can then be seen not so much as finding fault but as part of the training and
support. Most new PM's want to have a well run compliant branch and will take this
seriously. The real concern would be if they haven’t closed the gaps by the 6 month
period.

General Observations: The whole appearance of the presentations is mixed. It's quite
obvious they've been written by different people. The result is an incohesive look and
feel to the course which makes it harder to deliver and makes the trainer look less
professional
