Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Known Error Log and Unfiltered Transaction and Event Data

We write further to our call on 1 March 2017 to provide an update on disclosure of the Known Error Log
(KEL) and extraction of the unfiltered transaction and event data.

4. KEL

It was discussed on the call that extraction could be undertaken via a manual process of printing each of
the KEL entries to PDF. Fujitsu have undertaken further analysis and informed us that it has been
possible to automate the extraction process which will output each of the KEL entries into an HTML
format. Please let us know if you have any issues with the documents being provided in HTML.

2. Unfiltered Transaction And Event Data
Post Office proposes that extraction and disclosure of the unfiltered transaction and event data should be

limited to the 6 Lead Claimants who are progressing to trial. Fujitsu would therefore extract and provide
the following months of data:

SPMR Branch Name Branch Code Months

Stubbs Barkham 212939 September 2009 to June 2010

Bates Crag-Y-Don 461614 None

Dar Lenzie 243855 November 2014 to 31 March 2017

Abdulla I Charlton 096007 January 2007 to July 2009

Sabir I Cottingley 181306 November 2007 to August 2009 (for both
Crossflats 182306 branches)

Stockdale Sandsacre 219337 May 2014 to September 2016

If you believe that the unfiltered transaction and event data relating to the Lead Claimants who are not
progressing to trial should be provided, please set out your reasons as to why it is necessary and
proportionate to do so.
