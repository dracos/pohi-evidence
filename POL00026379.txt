All
Justice Coulson has refused Post Office’s application to appeal the Common Issues Judgment. (see attached).

We are working through the detail of the reasons but His Honour echoes the comments of Justice Fraser and POL’s
litigation approach. I will circulate a more detailed note in due course.

Comms statements have been drafted and approved.
We will draft a note for Board to be sent later this afternoon.

UKGI are informally aware of the result.
