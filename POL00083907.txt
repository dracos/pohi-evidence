Subject AB and RAB on Friday
John/Andrew,

At this morning's briefing session with Stuart Sweetman on the Acceptance position, there was some
discussion about the role and empowerment of the AB and RAB. I have since spoken to Jeff Triggs
and obtained his view on this, and then discussed with Dave Miller. The position is as follows...

POCL will not be accepting the services against the existing contract, and therefore the nature of the
decision at the ecceptance board is different to that originally intended. The board should make a
recornmendation as to whether or not the second supplementary agreement, which has been
negotiated with Pathway over the last few weeks, should be signed. The supplementary agreement
then states that acceptance is deemed to have taken place, and the various contractual cosequences
of that (such as payment to Pathway) will follow.

The same applies to the RAB, since the supplementary agreement says that POCL has authorised
Toll-out.

The supplementary agreement Is formally a change contral note to the contract, and therefore can be
signed by Dave Miller - it doesn't need Stuart's signature.

Gan you make this {rather subtle) change in the roles of the meetings apparent in their agendas,
please.

Subject Supplementary Agreement

The enclosed is my understanding of the position we reached at the end of yesterday's meeting with
pathway. There is one area not yet agreed - namely the question of how to count incidents under Al
298. The wording in the enclosure is that suggested by pathway, and recommended by Peter Copping.
We were not able to agree it yesterday, because we didn't have the right people available to review it.
Can John and Ruth look and camment to me, copied to Jeff Triggs, please,

Keith

WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND SUBJECT TO CONTRACT
Position reached in negotiations on 21/9/99

Acceptance Incident 298 (System stability)

The occurrence of operational incidents in connection with this AI should
have been reduced below a target threshold as measured over the 4 weeks

Measurement will be based on all outlets installed before or on 15 October
1999, provided that there are at least 750 such outlets. Otherwise,
measurement will be over all outlets installed up to the end of the first week
in which the number of live outlets equals or exceeds 750.

[Following is Pathway proposal, for POCL to review}

Incidents are to be quantified in “units” where:

¢ Help desk authorised re-boots and Office Snapshot Print Previews to count as one
unit each;

© Other work-arounds to remove invalid no-entry signs to count as half a unit;

« New work-arounds to remove the need for re-boots (such work-arounds to take less
than 10% of the combined re-boot and recovery time) to count as half.a unit;

The target to be met is that the rate of occurrence measured over the four
week period to mid-November 1999 should average no more than one unit
per counter position per 3 months.

In addition, Pathway are to be permitted to continue the good business
practice of planned re-boots outside working hours, not to exceed one per
counter position per month.
