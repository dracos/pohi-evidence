POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION WOMBLE
Steering Group Meeting: 20 November 2017 DICKINSON

DECISION: Should Post Office pay Fujitsu to employ additional staff to extract transaction data?

1. BACKGROUND

1.1 Post Office has been ordered by the Court to disclose the transaction and event data recorded in
Horizon for the 12 Lead Claimants. This disclosure is to be provided to Freeths by 19 January 2018
and is subject to a limit of 400 months of data. Fujitsu have informed WBD that to extract 400
months of data will take approximately 600 man hours / 16 weeks of work andthey will be able to
begin extracting the next working day after they are informed of the identity of the Lead Claimants.

1.2 Currently, Fujitsu have one member of staff who can be dedicated to the extraction. With one person
it would take until 16 March 2018 to extract 400 months of data (two months after the Court
deadline). To resolve this Fujitsu can hire an additional member of staff to be dedicated to the
extraction and it would be completed within 8 weeks (by 19 January 2018). Fujitsu have provided a
rough estimate of around £35k to hire one additional head for 6-8 weeks which would include all
training, project management and hire/de-hire costs.

1.3 As a side point, we note that Fujitsu have been highly responsive, accommodating and helpful in
preparing for disclosure and the preparation of expert evidence. In assisting WBD, Fujitsu inform us
that they have moved personnel off "BAU" work for which they would normally charge Post Office.
So as to ensure that the current excellent working relationship is maintained it would be helpful for

Post Office to discuss this situation with Fujitsu, and in particular the commercial terms on which
Fujitsu will continue to support the Group Action.

2. OPTIONS

2.1 Fujitsu undertake the extraction with one member of staff.
The Court deadline would not be met and it would be necessary to discuss with Freeths the provision
of data in stages after the deadline. This is unlikely to be agreed by Freeths and subject to criticism
by the Judge since there are reasonable and proportionate steps which can be taken by Post Office
to ensure the deadline is met. The Judge will not consider an additional cost of £35k to be
unreasonable in this case.

2.2 Fujitsu hire an additional member of staff.

For a cost of around £35,000, Post Office would be able to fulfil its obligations as ordered by Court.

3. RECOMMENDATION

3.1 Post Office should pay Fujitsu to employ the additional staff needed.
