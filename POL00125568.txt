Dear All

Please find attached the initial review prepared by professor Kramer and Dr Dulay of London imperial college
consultants.

The initial review contains a proposal which is through and outlines the steps the steps to be taken and
documentation to be considered. There is a proposed work plan on page 4. As you will see it is estimated that it will
take 50 hours consultant days by Professor Kramer and Dr Dulay to complete the work.

Before we proceed with the next step, may I ascertain whether there is any views or observations or questions on
the attached documents.

regards
