BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS 2008

Attached are the summarised results of this year’s survey. Overall the results show a
greater number of “dissatisfied” responses than last year (15 compared with 8 - and
these are from 8 respondees compared with 12 last year). There are some views
similar to last year — eg lack of time on strategy, frequency of board meetings — but
the issue that featured strongly last year of management of risks appears now to be
resolved. The main issues this year are as follows:

Q4/5 — time spent on business strategy: still some dissatisfaction that the board
looks too much at the day-to-day than the longer term.

Q6 — meeting frequency: a lot of support for permanently removing the August board
— if not going further?

Q12 — board debates: some concern about the voice the executives have compared
with the non-executives

Q14 — Audit and Risk Committee: shortage of financial expertise to support Helen

Q15 — Nomination Committee: the highest number of dissatisfieds — but perhaps the
recently implemented process changes will help here?

Q16 — Remuneration Committee: again some dissatisfaction, in a number of areas

Q18 — relationship with shareholder: still some concerns here. Note the suggestion
to invite the Secretary of State to a Board meeting/dinner, which was raised last year.
