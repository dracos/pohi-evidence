POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANNE CHAMBERS

|, Anne Olivia Chambers, will say as follows:

1. This is my second witness statement to the Inquiry and is provided in response
to a request dated 28 April 2003 made pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules

2006.

2. lam asked questions about the workings of the System Support Centre (SSC)
and its relationship with other departments within Fujitsu and with the Post
Office's NBSC. | have provided answers more broadly on these topics in my

first witness statement but here address the following points.

3. Postmasters could telephone the Post Office’s National Business Support
Centre (NBSC) or Fujitsu’s Horizon Service Desk (HSD; also HSH). Where
there was a report of a discrepancy the protocol was that NBSC were
supposed to investigate the possibility of user error before Fujitsu were to be
asked to investigate a possible system error. HSD could generate a
PinICL/PEAK and refer a problem to us at SSC. If there was a specific piece

of information that we needed from the postmaster we had the ability to

Page 1 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

telephone them but otherwise there was no expectation that we would. We in
SSC could pass problems on to Development if we had identified or suspected

a system problem but they would not speak directly with postmasters.

. Lam asked what system information | had access to, and how much of it was
unavailable to other helplines used by branch staff. For Legacy Horizon, SSC
could look at the full message store for each branch: a repository containing
all transactions carried out in the previous 34 (or possibly 42) days, numerous
other messages including for example declarations, reports, user logon/logoff,
and reference data controlling many aspects of the system. This full
information was not available to any other team, though each branch could

print off a variety of reports including transaction logs.

. |recall that Post Office received transaction information each night but | do not
remember the level of detail nor know who within Post Office had access to

this.

. SSC could also retrieve audit logs, psstandard (peripheral server) logs and
Windows NT event logs from the counters for diagnostic purposes. The NT
events were also fed back via the Tivoli system to SMC whose role included
monitoring for any unexpected critical events. HSD could also inspect those

events.

. SSC could interrogate the central databases in which data was stored before
being passed to various external clients, for example regarding banking

transactions and bill payments.

. | do not know what information was available to those who worked on NBSC.

Involvement in relation to Marine Drive Post Office and the litigation against Lee

Castleton

9. Nineteen years later, | have no clear memory of individual investigations
undertaken. The following is based upon what | recorded on PC0099954
[FUJ00146165] at the time and expanded upon in my witness statement dated
14 September 2006 [LCAS0000112]; the associated exhibits, mostly
Powerhelp calls [FUJ00122322]; my Afterthoughts document [FUJ00152299]

and upon my memory of my normal procedure for such calls.

10.1 have now been provided with a copy of the NBSC call log for Marine Drive
[LCAS0000365]. This is not something that was ever available to me during
my time at Fujitsu. As | have explained in my first statement, there was a clear
division between business investigations conducted by NBSC and system
investigations conducted by SSC. | can see now from this document that there
was a call about a discrepancy at Marine Drive on 14 January 2004 and
another a week later on 21 January 2004, and the record shows NBSC as

assisting the postmaster to make checks at that time.

1

.| can see that on 28 January 2004 the NBSC call handler suggested the
postmaster call the HSH and indeed the first relevant call to the Horizon
Helpdesk [E-0401280325] [FUJ00122322] relates to a call on 28 January 2004
regarding three weeks of discrepancies which the caller stated had related to
the level of stock held. | see the caller was told that the matter would have to
be thoroughly investigated by NBSC before it could be investigated as a
software problem. | was not involved at this stage and there was no PinICL

generated for SSC at this time. When | came to carry out my investigation on

Page 3 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

26 February 2004, | did see the limited information on the Powerhelp call for
28 January 2004 [FUJ00122322, page 1] and the subsequent calls in
[FUJ00122322], which were exhibited to my witness statement AC/1. | see
there are further calls to NBSC up until 26 February 2004 which | would not

have seen at the time.

12.On 29 January 2004 [E-0401290358] [FUJ00122322, page 2], a caller from
Marine Drive told the Horizon Helpdesk that he had a problem when he
remmed something in which resulted in a discrepancy and that he had been
back and forth to NBSC and wanted the software investigating. | see he was

told that he needed NBSC to authorise that and was referred back to them.

13.Call E-0402020111 (exhibited in Andrew Dunks’ evidence at [POL00073280])
was not obviously relevant to discrepancies. It was logged when Mr Castleton
found the message ‘Desktop initialisation failed’ on the counter 2 screen on the
Monday morning. Attempts to clear the problem by rebooting, and by deleting
the training messagestore, were not successful so an engineer was sent to
replace the base unit with a new one. As part of the standard base unit
replacement process, a zipped copy of the previous night’s messagestore was
copied from counter 1 to the new counter 2, then all subsequent messages
were replicated across. This was completed by around 14:20 and then LCA001
was able to log on to counter 2. It was not possible to carry out transactions on

counter 2 before then (though see below).

14.Looking at the February event messages in [POL00072839], there are none
written on counter 2 between 1 February 2004 and 14:24 2 February 2004. All

counters at each branch regularly exchanged handshake messages to check

Page 4 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

that they were all up and running; counter 1 realised that it could not
communicate with counter 2 and so wrote an event (and also displayed a
message to the user) that it was disconnected from the network. | think the
message that it was disconnected is slightly confusing; the network was ok
(and counter 1 was in communication with the data centre and could do online

banking transactions) but counter 2 was effectively dead.

15.The counter 1 event and message were repeated at 12:41. | suspect this may
be because a new user logged on, who might be unaware of the problem, so
Riposte reported it again. At 14:03 the counters were able to communicate
again and so counter 1 reported that it was no longer disconnected. Counter 2
did not report this because it did not know it had been disconnected, having

not been in a state where it could send handshake messages.

16.1 was not expecting to be asked questions about this topic at the trial in
2006. As | said in my evidence at the time, | was not 100% sure exactly how
and when Riposte decided to report disconnection and reconnection. However,
| did not assume that counters were communicating correctly just because

there were no such messages.

17.\s it possible that any transactions were carried out on counter 2 that never
reached counter 1 or the data centre? | can see from sheet 1 of spreadsheet
[FUJ00152293] that an e-topup transaction was done at 19:05 on Saturday 31
January on counter 2, and from the January 2004 Riposte event log
[POL00082270, page 89] that user LCA001 logged off (or was automatically
logged off due to inactivity) at 20:19. From the complete messagestore | could
have established whether the counter was usable but unused for the remainder

Page 5 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

of Saturday and Sunday, since it would continue to write some information
messages even while dormant. | am just about certain | made these checks

around the time of the trial. The branch did not normally trade on Sundays.

18.In my view it is extremely unlikely (bordering impossible) that any transactions
were lost as a result of the counter replacement. There is no indication of any
problem with the physical connection between the counters. Even if there were,
they could only impact CAP45 and could not cause losses in subsequent

periods.

19.1 see from the partial transcript [LCAS0000252_109] and the Claimant's Note
of the Castleton trial [LCAS0000444] that Andrew Wise was asked about this
issue, and it was suggested to him by Mr Castleton that the material showed a
transaction being entered when nobody was logged on. The transaction in
question was recorded with Id 2, but was started at 14:21:12 before LCA001

logged on to counter 2 at 14:24:56.

20.1 cannot remember if anyone asked me about this in 2006, although | see Mr
Castleton did ask me some questions about the replacement of the base unit.
Looking at the matter now | can see from the event log [POL00072839] that Mr
Castleton did not log out of counter 1 before logging on to counter 2. If there
was anything in the basket on counter 1, it would be transferred over to counter
2 for settlement. If | could see the transaction log or full set of messages for 2
February 2004, | could establish this one way or the other (the Session Id would

include branchcode-1- instead of -2- if this had happened).

21.As a general observation, counter replacement, though it could potentially

result in transactions being lost if the broken counter had been operational but

Page 6 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

disconnected prior to replacement, would not be a cause of losses occurring

two or three weeks later.

22.1 see that the next call to the Horizon Helpdesk was on 13 February 2004 [E-
0402130267] [FUJ00122322, page 3]. This was a call from Marie at NBSC in
respect of Marine Drive and records “PM adv[ises] his system is doubling up
cash declarations and cutting off cheques they still appear the next day [NBSC
have] checked that he is cutting everything off properly, cash figures are being
done properly”. The postmaster had insisted on a system check. It also
records that there has been a problem for five weeks; every time stock has
been remmed in they have a loss that night. It records that snapshots and
transaction logs agree with the postmaster’s figures. The postmaster advised
that NBSC had checked transaction logs, girobank logs, reconciliations, rems

in and out and stock holding.

23.The matter was “escalated” to Heather Dryden after which the call handler,
Tony Law, appears to have addressed the question of the cheques with the
postmaster. Cheques for the 10 February were showing on the 11 February,
although the postmaster insisted that he had run the cut-off on the 10". The
postmaster said it had happened more than once, but the helpdesk established
it was just once. He was told to call back if it happened again. A failure to cut-

off cheques would not be connected to the cash discrepancy issue.

24.The next call involving the Horizon Helpdesk was on 25 February 2004 [E-
0402250454] [FUJ00122322, page 8] and again reports problems with
balancing that seem to be related to stock remmed in during the week. Itis a

report of losses over seven weeks. The clerk reported that she printed a stock

Page 7 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

snapshot on Monday and it all looked OK but since then they had remmed in
some stock which seemed to have given a loss. Helpdesk “advised the clerk
that she will need to check her stock position for last week and then check her
rems in summary, this will give her the stock she should be holding, this figure
can then be compared with the stock showing in adjust stock and this will
highlight any problems with stock on hand ... clerk reports that they were told
that checks would be made on the system but she is unsure if this information
came from nbsc or hsh as she has no names of ref numbers ... advised the
clerk that we need her to take the unit to trial balance this evening and come
back before she rolls over so we can take down any details she can give us.”
The call was closed with a note that if the clerk called back it should be handed

on to someone more senior such as Heather Dryden.

25.1 note that shortly after that call, NBSC called the Horizon helpdesk saying that
the branch had just called them [E-0402250553] [FUJ00122322, page 10].
The log reports that NBSC were told that the caller had been told to call back

that evening with the net discrepancy on the cash account.

26. There was then a call at 16:55 raised by SMC [E-0402251011] [FUJ00122322,
page 12], querying a Windows NT event from counter 1 at Marine Drive on 18
February 2004. | think this was raised because HSD had noticed the NT event
when looking into the reported balancing problems and had asked SMC about
it. This had been investigated at the time [E-0402180803] [FUJ00122322, page
5] and related to the generation of a single event from a large number of
branches within a short period. This had no connection with the discrepancy
problem identified at Marine Drive and was a freestanding issue that was
resolved.

Page 8 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

27.There was then a further call at 17:33 on the same day, 25 February 2004 [E-
0402251077] [FUJ00122322, page 14]. The postmaster advised that the
problem with the cash account had started weeks previously when a BT
engineer moved the broadband box. It is recorded that NBSC had said there
was no user error. The call was assigned to SSC which generated a PinICL
[PC0099954] [FUJ00146165], referring the matter from HSD to SSC for the
first time, and, on the morning of 26 February 2004, the call was assigned to

me.

28.On 26 February 2004 | looked at the HSD-raised calls for the branch on the
Powerhelp system. Some of these had been specifically mentioned in
PC0099954, but | would have been able to see all calls raised by the branch
for at least a couple of months, and | would have looked at them to see if they
might be relevant. | cannot now remember how far back the calls went but |
do not recall that it was ever an issue that we could not see enough history on

Powerhelp.

29.1 would also have looked for any other PinICL calls raised by or for this branch,
searching against the branch FAD code. This would have found any calls
raised for reconciliation report entries, as well as any branch-raised calls
previously investigated by SSC. My recollection is that there were no such

calls.

30.1 checked whether the branch had appeared in any of the reconciliation reports,
in case there was an entry for which no PinICL had been raised for further

investigation. | cannot now remember but my 2006 witness statement suggests

Page 9 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

that two weeks of reports were available to me. | think the checks of particular

interest in 2004 included:

a. Accheck to see whether the branch was in contact with the data centre
at the end of the day (non-polling) — or possibly had not been in contact

for over a day.

b. Acheck as to whether the branch transaction totals for number, absolute
quantity and absolute value, calculated on the gateway counter (counter
1) at the end of each day, matched the same calculation on the data held

at the data centre.

c. Whether at the end of the Cash Account Period (each Wednesday or
Thursday) the cash account lines calculated and printed at the branch
matched the recalculated cash account constructed from the
transactions held at the data centre, and the totals of the daily cash
account data calculated on the gateway counter (solely for reconciliation

purposes) at the end of each day.

d. Whether the total Receipts for a stock unit, or the whole branch, matched

the Payments when a balance report or cash account was produced.

e. Whether a transaction was malformed in some way when it reached the

data centre and could not be harvested.

31.There were separate daily reports for each of these checks. Branches where
the checks succeeded were not listed, so commonly the reports were empty
or had very few entries. Some errors would result in entries for a branch on
more than one report. The reports were text files, so | used a ‘find in files’ tool

to look for the branch code.

Page 10 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

32.1 found no reconciliation report entries relating to Marine Drive in the two weeks
prior to my investigation, indicating that all transactions recorded at the branch
had reached the data centre and had been included in the cash accounts
produced and printed at the branch. If there had been entries before my search
period, | would have expected to find PinICLs raised for them (unless caused
by a known error that did not impact branch accounts in any way). | note
however that the 26"" was a Thursday so Cash Account checks relating to the
most recent balance would not have been made until that night after | had
finished my investigation, but again if the checks failed that week for Marine
Drive they should have been picked up subsequently as reconciliation errors

as part of the normal process.

33.To investigate fully, | retrieved the branch messagestore, described in
paragraph 4 above. | made some specific checks for cheque handling,
declarations and remittances, described in my 2006 witness statement
[LCAS0000112] at paragraphs 11, 12 and 15, as Mr Castleton had mentioned

these as being areas of concern.

34.As well as examining the messagestore using a text file viewer, | probably
extracted all the transaction messages into a spreadsheet so they could be
more easily examined. | certainly did this for the cash lines (product 1). | cannot
remember whether this was for a week or longer, nor which week(s) | checked.
| then calculated the system cash position after each transaction and compared
it with the declarations made by the SPM or clerk at the branch — both the
Overnight Cash Holdings (ONCH) declared at the end of each day, and the

Cash Declaration made during the weekly balance.

Page 11 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

35.The loss calculated by the system during the balancing process at the end of
the week was correct, based on the transactions recorded on the system and
the Cash Declaration (and other declaration of stock etc) made by a user at
the branch. The daily check showed a surprising variation between my
calculation of what the system expected, based on the transactions recorded,
and what the branch declared. | had done the same check for other branches
when trying to track down discrepancies, and | was used to seeing small
variances of perhaps a few pounds. A sudden change in variance one day
would mean that the error was likely to have occurred on that day, and then
the increased variance would remain more or less constant for the rest of the
week. This was not the pattern at Marine Drive and | could not tie any part of

the loss to a particular day.

36.1 concluded that either the transactions recorded on the system for Marine
Drive were not a true reflection of the business carried out at the branch, or the
cash was not being declared accurately. The branch had to print reports at the
end of each day and check that what was recorded on the system matched all
their paper records. | did not know how much of their business could be cross-
checked in this way, but they had not mentioned any concerns about any
specific transactions being incorrectly recorded. This checking should have
helped the branch to identify any incorrect, missing or duplicated transactions,

whether caused by user or system error.

37.It may assist if | set out some context for the comments made in several of the
calls that losses occurred after stock had been remmed in. When a postmaster
received stock from Post Office it came in pouches and, as | recall, the
postmaster had to enter the items by product onto the system to rem the stock

Page 12 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

in. Although | do not recall any specific incident, one could hypothesise either
a software error or a user error which might result in there being a higher figure
for stock recorded on the system than was in fact the reality. If that happened,
then when the postmaster counted and adjusted his stock at the end of a period

there would be less stock than the system expected.

38.However, if there was such a discrepancy in stock the system would record a
Stock Adjust Positive or Stock Adjust Negative (SAP/SAN) in the transaction
log settled to cash, thus correcting the stock holdings but causing a cash
discrepancy. Looking at the Marine Drive transaction log for January 2004
[FUJ00152293] and filtering it for SAN and SAP entries, in the Mode column
of Sheet 1, | can see that the largest positive entry was a Postal Order and fee
to the value of £63.80 (line 10230) and there is a negative entry of -£63.80 a
week later (line 13436). If there had been a problem with remming-in stock |
would expect to see a much more significant adjustment. In other words, if an
error in respect of remming in stock had caused a discrepancy it would have
been identifiable as the cause by reference to the transaction log, yet the log

shows no support for that.

39. Although | have no specific recollection of checking the SAN and SAP entries
in 2004, | am confident it is something | would have done, particularly against

the background of the call records.

40.1 had found no indication of any system error which might affect the accounts
at this branch. The losses were correctly calculated based on the transactions
recorded and the declarations of cash and stock holdings made by the branch

users.

Page 13 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

41.1 felt that the only way to progress the investigation was at the branch, to check
that they were following the correct business processes and correctly recording
everything that was done. Fujitsu did not have staff who were allowed to go to
branches to investigate business or financial problems; this was Post Office’s

responsibility.

42.At this point, having not found any evidence of a system error, the correct
process was for me to close PC0099954 with my findings, and HSH would
communicate them to the SPM. However, given the number of calls that Mr
Castleton had already raised, | felt this was not in his best interests, as the
problem persisted, and so | contacted Julie Welsh in Customer Services,
knowing that she had a route to Post Office and hoping that this would help Mr
Castleton to find the cause of the losses. Then | closed PC0099954 ‘Advice
and guidance given’, stating what | had found and that | had contacted Julie

Welsh.

43.The PinlICL [PC0099954] records my findings. | had followed up the system
event raised at around 13:00 on Wednesday 18/02/04, checking on PinICL
(PC0099159 which | do not have), Powerhelp (e-0402180803 on page 5 of
[FUJ00122322]) and probably the KEL database, to ensure | understood the
cause of the event and any effect it might have on branch accounts. | agreed
with the conclusion already drawn, that it had no impact on the accounts nor

on the operation of the counter.

44. At 15:16 | recorded on the PinICL:

“Category 94 - Advice and guidance given | have checked various things on the

system. All the internal reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being

Page 14 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

handled correctly (except for 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report
- but this didn't cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually
use drawer id 11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can
lead to amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be
avoided. But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash
transactions on the system against the declarations shows that they are not
working particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day the cash they declare
in the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has
been recorded on the system). It is possible that they are not accurately
recording all transactions on the system. There is no evidence whatsoever of
any system problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer
Services) who will try to get POL to follow it up, but in the meantime please tell
the PM that we have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the
difference between the transactions they have recorded on the system and the
cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the software or

hardware.”

45. It is recorded on the Powerhelp Call E-0402251077 [FUJ00122322, page 15]
at 15:34 on 27 February 2004, that the postmaster was directly informed, by
Suzzanna, that there was no evidence to suggest the discrepancies had been
caused by a software problem or by a hardware problem and that he was also
told that Julie Welsh from customer services had been made aware of the

branch and that she will try to get the Post Office to follow it up.

46.It appears that at some point Julie Welsh then contacted me because | see
from [FUJ00122322], page 16 which was part of an email to Richard Benton
at Post Office in which she says that she had a chat with me and that | had

Page 15 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

used the messagestore to investigate and that if the Post Office wanted copies
of extracts of the messagestore for the particular incorrect declarations they
were requested to submit ad hoc requests. | see she also copied my findings

from the PINICL to Richard Benton [FUJ00122322].

47.The NBSC call log [LCAS0000365], which | have not previously seen, shows
calls through March 2004 which include reference to an auditor being sent to
the branch. It appears therefore that Post Office recommenced a business

investigation.

48.1 am asked to consider pages 112 and 113 of the Claimant's note of my oral
evidence [LCAS0000444]. | was referring to the Windows NT application event
log, which exists | believe on every Windows NT PC and which would be
retrieved from the counter and checked as a standard part of any investigation.
Various processes running on the counter, including the Horizon application
and the underlying Riposte software, would write events to this log —
sometimes just progress messages for example as applications stopped or
started, but also if something unexpected happened — this might be a critical
(red) event. In addition, these NT events were streamed from counters via

Tivoli for SMC to monitor as part of their day-to-day work.

49.NT events for the branch would have been checked by HSH and SMC before
passing a call to SSC but | also would have checked the NT event logs in
February 2004. The event on 18 February 2004 for Marine Drive detailed in e
0402251011 [FUJ00122322, page 12] and discussed above is one such and

was the only event of any interest noticed at the time.

Page 16 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

50. After 26 February 2004 | did not carry out any further investigations into Marine
Drive that year. As far as | am aware, no further calls were passed to SSC,
nor was | was aware of further calls to the helplines. As | have said above, |
now believe Julie Welsh spoke to me to confirm what | had found, and it is
possible that there were further emails or queries relating to the investigation
described above in the months or years following, but | was not asked to make

any further checks on Marine Drive.

5

.| did consider the issues that Mr Castleton was reporting to be unusual, and
that he needed assistance to get to the bottom of it. | was not in a position to

give or organise that assistance.

52.1 am asked whether | considered whether any known bugs, errors or defects
(“BEDs”) might be causing the discrepancies. | did not work my way through a
list of known errors. That was not my method of working, nor that of my
colleagues. Once | had examined the available evidence and found something
wrong, then | would consider whether it might be caused by a known system

error, a user error or whether it was a new system problem.

53.1n this instance the difficulty was that there was no evidence of any sort of error
(human or computer) save for the fact that the cash declared by the postmaster
did not match what was expected in accordance with the transactions that he
had entered and checked on the system and hence a loss was evident at the

end of the financial week.

54.1 have now considered those BEDs identified by Mr Justice Fraser (which as |
have previously explained, is not an exhaustive list of Horizon BEDs) and none

of those appear to be possible causes of the discrepancies and losses at

Page 17 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

Marine Drive, nor of the variance between the overnight cash declarations and
the system cash position. As | have said before, | am not aware of any BEDs
which would cause week-on-week discrepancies and losses without leaving

evidence.

55.1 am specifically asked if | considered whether discrepancies might have been
caused by as yet unknown bugs - or whether my method of working as
described precluded that. A discrepancy, in itself, is not an indication of a
system problem. If it has been calculated incorrectly (from the individual
transactions and the declarations made by the branch) then there is a system
problem. | recalculated the discrepancy from the recorded cash transactions
and declarations, using Excel, and got the same result as Horizon. If there are
transactions recorded incorrectly, or omitted, then this could be a system
problem or a user problem. | looked for any obvious anomalies in the
transactions but could not spot any. | had no way of knowing whether what had
been recorded actually matched the business done at the branch, nor whether

the cash declarations were correct.

Post Office Limited -v- Lee Castleton

56.1 have not been involved in any other proceedings against sub-postmasters
involving the Horizon IT system before or since the Castleton case. Before
2006 | had never taken part in any legal proceedings of any kind. It had never
been suggested to me or my SSC colleagues that we might be expected to

become involved in such proceedings as a result of the work we were doing.

Page 18 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

57.On a few occasions over the subsequent years Gareth Jenkins asked me to
double check his figures or to help him locate KELs or reports. | was aware he
was giving evidence in various trials but | do not think | ever knew the details
of those trials and the assistance | provided to him would have been limited. |

have no specific recollection of any particular instances of this occurring.

58.1 am asked who asked me to provide a witness statement in the case against
Mr Castleton. Sometime in 2006, a man | did not know came into our secure
office area, introduced himself as the Post Office Account Security Manager,
Brian Pinder, mentioned a call that | had dealt with over two years earlier and
asked if | would mind having a quick chat with a solicitor about it. No mention

was made of a witness statement at that point, nor, as | recall, of a court case.

59.1 informed my manager Mik Peach of this conversation. He was extremely
unhappy that | had been approached directly and said that no member of SSC
should ever be involved in litigation. He then talked to higher levels of
management, but my name was now in the frame and | seemed to have no
option but to talk to the solicitor which led to them requesting a witness

statement and my subsequent appearance in court.

60.1 am asked about the individuals | had contact with during the drafting of my
witness statement, the nature of any discussions and the drafting process. |
have very little recollection of this, but the various emails supplied
[POL00071093, POL00071051, POLO0069608, POL00069622 and

FUJ00122321] have helped fill in some of the gaps in my memory.

61.1 think there was an initial meeting with a solicitor, presumably Stephen Dilley,

in a Fujitsu office in Bracknell. Mik Peach’s manager, Naomi Elliott, was

Page 19 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

present at that meeting or a subsequent one. It was explained to me, | think in
the initial meeting, that | would be a Witness of Fact, not an Expert Witness,
and the purpose of my witness statement was to document my investigation of

26'" February 2004.

62.1 can see from the documents provided to me that on 8 August 2006
[FUJ00152291] | was emailed a copy of a letter written by the solicitor then
acting for Mr Castleton [LCAS0000974] and that Fujitsu was being asked to
provide a reasoned analysis of the points made in that letter. | can see this
involved a comparison between the transaction logs, which it is apparent | took
to be a reference to the archived messagestore extract, and the cash account.
| can see that | had requested sight of the letter on 7 August 2006
[FUJ00152290] on the basis that | would start the analysis then Gareth Jenkins
would review and present a report to POL. | believe it would have been
suggested that | undertake the task; | do not believe | would have offered to do
it. | note that | remarked that SSC resources were very stretched towards the
end of August. | see that on 8 August 2006 | asked Peter Sewell and then

Gareth Jenkins for the transaction logs.

63.1 see that | produced a document dated 17 August 2006 [FUJ00152295]
accompanied by spreadsheets [FUJ00152293, FUJ00152294 and
FUJ00152296] which addressed the contents of paragraphs in the solicitor’s

letter [LCAS0000974].

64. To provide some background information: the Cash Account was a
complicated document of 2 or 3 pages, summarising all the financial data for a

branch for a week (Cash Account Period or CAP). | was under the impression

Page 20 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

that before Horizon, the SPMs had had to fill in this form manually. It was not

easy to read or understand.

65.When each stock unit in a branch was balanced at the end of the CAP, a Trial
Balance and then Final Balance were carried out and a Balance Report printed.
These were, in my view, easier to comprehend. It was at this stage that

discrepancies were calculated and reported.

66. Once all stock units were balanced, the Cash Account was produced. This did
not use the totals accumulated for each stock unit but went through the
transaction data again, mapping each transaction to a particular Cash Account
Line and Table. If there had been an error in the calculation of a discrepancy
for a stock unit, | think this would show on the Cash Account (for example as

a Receipts and Payments mismatch).

67.1 had previously checked and reconstructed Balance Reports but | had never
tried to manually construct a Cash Account. | started with the transaction data,
in an Excel spreadsheet, extracted from Audit as part of an ARQ data retrieval.
| had all the transactions carried out at Marine Drive during January 2004. This
can be seen at Sheet1 [FUJ00152293]. The section at the top details the
Riposte Query which was used to extract the transaction data from the

archived messagestore. | note that the extract was made in November 2005.

68.Columns of interest in Sheet 1 are: Id branch counter; User the branch user;
Date/Time the date and time the transaction was started; Sessionld the
unique session identifier (this should be the transactions relating to a single
customer, each session should net to zero); Txnld the unique transaction

identifier within the session; Mode SC is Serve Customer for normal business,

Page 21 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

Rxxx remittances in or out of the branch, SAP/SAN stock adjustments,
DDN/DDP acceptance of discrepancies, several others; ProductNo each
product that can be transacted has a unique number, 1 is cash; Qty quantity;
SaleValue. The transactions are ordered by date/time which means that

sessions on the two counters are sometimes interleaved.

69. Sheet2 was also produced by the ARQ extract and | believe shows that in the
full messagestore archive, there are no gaps in the message sequence for
each counter, and that the messages are all in ascending time order. This is
important as it shows that everything committed to the messagestore on the

counters has reached the data centre and the Audit archive.

70. The total sale values on Sheet1 should be equal to zero but actually come to
-£2.47. The sheet SummarybySession was used to identify two non-zero

sessions:

44-213337-2-1163818-2 -0.92 12th Jan (Week 42)

44-213337-1-880853-2 £-1.55 15th Jan (Week 43)

7

.| looked in the full messagestore archive at the first of these and found the
missing transaction was a postage sale within a Smartpost session, and the
Start information had not been included in the message. This was a not
uncommon problem with SmartPost at the time. There should have been a
KEL for it, and a PinICL with development for investigation. The transaction
was included in the branch accounts (otherwise there would have been a
receipts and payments mismatch) and did not cause any discrepancy at the
branch. The message was included in the full set of archived messages but

was not retrieved from the archive by the data retrieval, since that required

Page 22 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

Start Date to be present. So this was a system fault which has affected the

integrity of the ARQ extract but in my view did not affect the branch directly.

72.1 then looked specifically at CAP42. This covered transactions carried out in
the period 8th Jan 2004 08:59:11 to 15th Jan 07:36:14 (these times can be
confirmed from the January event log [POL00082270)). | worked out the Cash
Account Line and Table to which each transaction belonged then produced the
totals for each line / table entry, for comparison with the Cash Account printed
at the branch. While the numbers matched, | did not fully understand how some

of the entries were derived so passed my findings to Gareth with a caveat.

73.In summary:

(a)! was able to find the transactions (“the other halves” as Mr Castleton
described them) for the only two apparently incomplete sessions in January
and so show that the discrepancy in week 42 was not attributable to

partial/missing transactions.

(b) | conducted my own semi-manual reconciliation of all transactions recorded
in the log for Week 42. | do not think | saw the details of Mr Castleton’s
analysis of the transaction logs, so | could not explain why his totals for
receipts and payments (paragraphs 3 and 4 of the solicitor’s letter) were
different from Horizon. My reconciliation matched Horizon. If any products
were wrongly categorised (for example, as receipts instead of payments)

this would have affected every branch transacting those products.

74.On 17 August 2006 [FUJ00152292] | wrote to Gareth in the following terms:

Page 23 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

I've spent some time recalculating the CAP42 cash account for Marine
Drive and addressing the points in the letter from the solicitor. | hope it
makes enough sense to provide you with a starting point not quite at the
very beginning. Subsequent cash accounts, if needed, should be much
easier now | have the mappings set up and some idea of what numbers

need to go where.

I'm now going to look at the loss made in week 42 and demonstrate that
it was due to the difference between system holdings and declared

holdings.

If this isn't at all what you wanted, please let me know - | don't really know

what I'm doing!

This hasn't had my full attention, lots of people are on leave and Martin
landed me with a tricky POLFS/FP issue. Also, yesterday | got my witness
statement which is (as | expect you found) full of things | didn't say or do,

including all those Powerhelp calls.

75.This was not a finished report. Gareth was far more familiar with the Cash
Account structure than | was. He produced the report that was sent to Post
Office [WBON0000027] which referred to the work | undertook as described in

paragraphs 62-74 above.

76.1 thought at the time, and still think, that this was a job for an accountant. | was
surprised that Post Office thought Fujitsu should do it. The BDO Draft Report
that | have only seen recently [POLO0069955] does appear to show that a

forensic accountant did subsequently check the Cash Accounts over a 3 month

Page 24 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

period and found only the very small inconsistencies that | have mentioned

above.

77.1 did not draft my initial witness statement for the Castleton trial but spent some
time (in a meeting, | cannot remember where or who was present) talking
through and attempting to explain what | had done, based on the information
in the call log. | assume Stephen Dilley made notes and produced the first draft,

which | received 16 August 2006.

78.There were various inaccuracies in the technical details, unsurprisingly, so |
corrected those to ensure that the statement was a true reflection of what | had
done. | was not prepared to include in my statement Powerhelp calls of which
| had no direct knowledge. | felt | should include only calls which | knew | had

looked at the time.

79.Looking back at the matter now | see that the process of taking my statement
was effectively going on in parallel to the task | had been assigned of
investigating the points raised in Mr Castleton’s solicitor’s letter. | certainly did

not know, or consider at the time, whether this was appropriate.

80. As the trial approached, | also conducted some revision and checks on my own
initiative, using the full set of messages retrieved from the audit server,
because | wanted to be accurate and absolutely sure in my own mind that |
had not missed anything and because originally | had not looked at anything
since 26 February 2004 and the losses had continued. | stress that from my
perspective, if | had ever found evidence of a bug, error or defect or any
explanation for the losses | would have pointed that out and done so gladly

because it would have solved the mystery.

Page 25 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

81.It appears that by 23 August my witness statement was drafted almost to my

satisfaction [POL00071051].

82.1 remember going up to London for a meeting with Counsel Richard Morgan
on 11 September 2006. | can remember almost nothing about the content of
the meeting and the attendance note [POL00069622] makes very little sense
to me. It appears that we did discuss complaints about the system, and |
explained that there were BEDs which had indeed affected branches, but | was

not aware of any system problem causing continual losses.

83.1 have now seen my draft witness statement dated 22/8/06
[POL00083319_033] which was discussed at the meeting on 11" September
2006. | had not written the statement in paragraph 16 and | did not feel it
accurately summarised the investigation that | had undertaken. Hence the

paragraph was removed.

84.1 see that | was provided with an amended version of my witness statement on
13 September 2006. | was happy to sign the statement on 14'" September,

believing that the facts stated in it were true.

85.1 am asked why | did not mention any of these known BEDs in my witness
statement. My witness statement covered the investigation undertaken, which
had found no evidence that any error, known or otherwise, had affected the
branch. It did not occur to me, nor did anyone discuss with me, that | should
include or omit references to any BEDs which were not, in my opinion, relevant

to the investigation.

86.Indeed, though | was unaware of it at the time, | see that the question of the

relevance of problems at other branches was specifically addressed by the

Page 26 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

Court. It is referred to in The Claimant’s Note of Evidence [LCAS0000444, at
pages 12-13] and is also reflected in HHJ Havery QC’s judgment at paragraph
22. My attention has been drawn to the fact that at [LCAS0000444], at page
12 Mr Morgan is recorded as having made the submission “[Mr Castleton is]
perfectly at liberty to put it to my witnesses. If it's admitted for those purposes,
the court has a piece of paper showing somebody in Scotland has a computer
problem in 2006.” As | refer to below, | was indeed asked questions about
what is known as the Callendar Square Bug which occurred at the Falkirk
branch. My answers can be seen in the partial transcript at
[LCAS0000252_109] at transcript pages 44 to 45. | explained in my evidence
at trial what the Callendar Square bug was and why | could be confident it had

not occurred at Marine Drive.

87.1 have no recollection of being made aware of Mr Castleton’s Defence and

Counterclaim.

88.1 have no recollection of seeing the correspondence and reports in
[LCAS0000945] before May 2023. | can explain that Balance Snapshots did
not recalculate the discrepancy, hence the Discrepancies section at the top of
each Balance Snapshot remained unchanged until a Trial Balance was

undertaken.

89.1 had not seen the BDO draft report [POL00069955] and appendices
[POL00069951] prior to May 2023, and did not know it had been produced. |
have always been concerned that no independent forensic accountant had
been instructed by POL to check the accounts, though | think | was aware, and

know now, that Mr Castleton had had the data for a single week checked

Page 27 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

[LCAS0000974]. | am not an accountant and | consider that interpretation and
checking of the accounts was Post Office’s responsibility, not Fujitsu’s, but |
felt | had ended up doing a lot of things beyond just checking Horizon for errors.

| do not know whether this report was used in the trial.

90.The BDO draft report appears to support what | had said in 2004 but is a full
check over a much longer period. The report also explains some of the
apparent anomalies in [LCAS0000945]. The author of the BDO report did not
appear to realise that the postings to product codes 222 (Shortage) and 145
(Surplus) were made by Horizon during the Stock Unit balancing process,
when the SPM accepted the loss/gain, so in my view section 5.5 of the BDO
report is not quite accurate. The SPM could clear the loss by putting the cash
in the drawer, declaring the increased amount and undertaking another trial
balance. This was done in CAP42 where the loss of £1,103.13 was made good
(see 8.3.3 of the BDO report). In subsequent weeks the loss was not made
good but was carried forward, and on two occasions the loss was posted to
product code 223 Table 2A, which | think was what was referred to as the

Suspense Account.

9

.| can see now that in November 2006 | received confirmation that the trial was
going ahead and that | forwarded that to Gareth Jenkins, and later that month
| and the other witnesses were informed that Mr Castleton was now
representing himself and we would likely all be required for questioning

[FUJ00152297].

92.1 recall that shortly before the trial | was told that | might be asked about the

Callendar Square bug. | would have done some revision in preparation for that.

Page 28 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

| have given a summary of the Callendar Square bug in my first witness
statement. | can see from the trial note that | was indeed asked questions

about it and | gave answers which were accurate.

BEDs, including Callendar Square

93.1 am asked what evidence | gave about known errors, bugs and defects which
had affected or were affecting the functioning of the Horizon IT system at the
Castleton trial. The only errors | had identified which had impacted Marine
Drive were the probable hardware error which resulted in counter 2 being
replaced on 2 February (which | had not included in my witness statement) and
the Windows NT event on 18 February. | answered questions about both of
these. Neither of these errors affected the branch accounts. | do not recall that
any other questions were put to me where any BED could or should have been
included in the answer, apart from Callendar Square in respect of which |

answered questions.

94.1 am asked what evidence | gave about the Callendar Square bug at the
Castleton trial. | was aware of the specific problems at the Callendar Square
branch which had caused a very significant loss in the autumn of 2006 and |
was familiar with the underlying bug, which could have various consequences.
| did not consider it to be relevant to the Castleton case because it had not
occurred at Marine Drive, but as | had been told shortly before the trial that Mr
Castleton was intending to ask questions about it, | was not surprised when it

arose.

95.1 attempted to explain that this bug was not the cause of the losses at Marine

Drive:

Page 29 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

a. As Mr Castleton operated a single stock unit, he could not have had the
same manifestation of the problem which was caused by cash being
Transferred Out of one stock unit then Transferred In twice to the

receiving stock unit.

b. Callendar Square had a Receipts and Payments mismatch reported via
the reconciliation reports. There was no such report entry for Marine

Drive.

c. The Windows NT application event log (which | referred to as the system
event log) would have contained hundreds of events reporting that a lock

was held. These were not present for Marine Drive.

d. Transactions done on the other counter after the events started might
not be included in the balance, but would instead be included in the
following accounting period. | had found no evidence of transactions not

being included when the Marine Drive stock unit was balanced.

96.When Mr Morgan asked me about events in connection with the Callendar
Square problem it became obvious that there was a misunderstanding. Mr
Morgan was taking me to the exhibit of Riposte event messages, which had
been extracted from the messagestore archive as part of the ARQ data
retrieval. These event messages recorded things like branch users logging on
and off, printing reports declaring cash etc. There is an example extract in
[POL00072839]. | and my colleagues would not normally refer to these as
events, and these were not where the Riposte Lock events would be, if they

existed.

Page 30 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

97.1 was referring initially to the Windows NT application event logs which had
been retrieved from the counters and checked in 2004. | knew these counter
logs only held events for a few weeks and were not normally retrieved from
counters or retained. Two weeks before the trial, when trying to answer a
query from Stephen Dilley [POL00070104, referenced in email of 16/12/06], |
had asked my colleague Steve Parker whether the NT events streamed from
all the counters via Tivoli, for SMC to inspect, were archived anywhere. He did
not know, but on investigation found they were. So when Mr Morgan asked

whether the information still existed, | confirmed that it did.

98.Mr Castleton asked to see these Tivoli event logs. | believe it was a significant
amount of work to unpack the files (containing all the events for 3 months from
all branches and all the central systems) and extract the events from Marine

Drive. | was not involved in this process.

99.The logs showed thousands of different NT events, mostly just progress
messages, generated as expected by the various applications running on the
counters. | cannot now remember any detail, but there were none of the

Riposte Lock critical events.

100.1 have reviewed the attendance note dated 22"7 December 2006
[POLO0069659] and | am asked whether it properly characterises my
evidence. Although the attendance note is not very clearly expressed, | think
| agree with it. My evidence was that the document (Tivoli event log) showed
the 18"" February event which did not affect the branch accounts, and did not
show any of the repeated Riposte Lock events indicative of the Callendar

Square type error.

Page 31 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

101.1 was recalled to answer further questions on 11" January 2007. Mr Castleton
asked me about various Tivoli event log entries, which | answered as best |
could. | cannot recall any specific questions but | think they were about events
generated by some of the background processes, not Riposte or the counter

application.

102.1 am asked for my view on how the proceedings were conducted by POL. | am
not in a position to judge the conduct of the litigation but did make a number of
points in a document that | discuss below. No pressure was put on me to
present my evidence in a particular way, or to conceal anything, but there was

nothing found by me to be concealed.

103. After the trial | saw the judgment of HHJ Havery QC and in particular paragraph
23 which | set out here for convenience. This correctly reflected that | had
been able to answer questions about the Callendar Square bug. The judge
accepted my evidence that | had been unable to identify any basis upon which
the Horizon system could have caused the losses at Marine Drive. | think it is
clear that the judge did not take my evidence to be that that there were never
any BEDs within Horizon. My evidence was that | could not find a system error

to explain these losses. Paragraph 23 reads as follows:

“| heard evidence from Anne Chambers, a system specialist employed by
Fujitsu, the company that provides the Horizon service. She has a working
knowledge of the Horizon computer system used by the claimant. She
said that calls from postmasters relating to potential system problems are
initially taken and logged by the Horizon system Helpdesk. | accept

evidence of Mr. Castleton that he contacted the Helpdesk over problems

Page 32 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

with discrepancies in balancing accounts at Marine Drive on a number of
occasions. If the helpdesks are unable to resolve the problem, calls may
be passed to the System Support Centre, where Mrs. Chambers works.
In this case, her first involvement with Marine Drive was on 26th February
2004. Mrs. Chambers examined the questions raised and concluded that
there was no evidence whatsoever of any problem with the system. She
was unable to identify any basis upon which the Horizon system could
have caused the losses. Mr. Castleton cross-examined her about
complaints from another branch, which he did not identify. She
immediately recognized the branch with confidence as being a branch at
Callender Square in Falkirk. The problem at Callender Square had, she
said, arisen from an error in the Horizon system, but there was no
evidence of such a thing at Mr. Castleton’s branch. | found Mrs. Chambers
to be a clear, knowledgeable and reliable witness, and | accept her

evidence.”

104.1 am reminded that in January 2007 | produced a document entitled
“Afterthoughts on the Castleton Case” [FUJ00152299], giving my thoughts and
comments on the way in which | had been put forward as a witness in the
Castleton trial. | was not concerned about the evidence | had given but rather
about the way the matter had been dealt with. Mik Peach supplied that note
to Brian Pinder, but | was not invited to any meeting to discuss its contents
[FUJ00152300]. Looking at this note now | see that | raised issues within four

topics, namely:

a. the use of me, and potentially other SSC staff, as effectively an expert
witness at trial.

Page 33 of 38
WITNO0170200
WITNO0170200

b. the absence of any formal plan for a technical review before a matter

reached court.

¢. concerns around disclosure of evidence. This was not something which
| had any experience of, or responsibility for, either before my

involvement with the Castleton trial or in preparation for it. ‘

d. the division of responsibility between NBSC and the Horizon Helpdesk
which could result in no-one taking ownership of some problems,

especially regarding unresolved discrepancies.

105.1 wish | could have found the cause of Mr Castleton’s problems, but sadly |
could not then, despite investigation in 2004 and many hours of further

checks in 2006, and | still cannot now.
