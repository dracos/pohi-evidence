1.0 Service Summary

11. Fujitsu Services will provide a Reconciliation Service to ensure financial integrity
across all Transactions processed through the Branch Infrastructure and the HNG-X
Central Infrastructure. Reconciliation of these Transactions is completed (a) to
ensure all Transactions processed by a Branch are correctly accounted for within the
POL FS System and (b) to ensure that there is a reconciliation between:

1.1.1. Transactions sent to APS Clients and the POL FS System; and

1.1.2. Transactions sent to Banks and the POL FS System, namely:

(a) deposits into and withdrawals from bank accounts;

(b) withdrawals from Card Account at Post Office (CAPO) accounts;
(c) debit and credit card Transactions; and

(d) Electronic Top Up (ETU) Transactions.

1.2. The Reconciliation Service will provide a number of Reports to Post Office giving a
statement of reconciliation across the agreed boundary points within the HNG-X
Service Infrastructure.

1.3. Where Fujitsu Services is unable to reconcile any Transaction referred to in section
1.1 (such Transaction then being referred to as an 'Exception'), such Exception will
be identified and reported to Post Office and progressed to resolution by the
Reconciliation Service.

1.4. Where Post Office is unable to reconcile any Transaction referred to in section 1.1
(such Transaction then being referred to as an 'Error'), Post Office shall inform
Fujitsu Services and such Error will be progressed to resolution by the Reconciliation
Service

2.1 Service Definition

2.1.1 Branch Reconciliation

2.1.1.1. The Transaction Processing System (TPS) Report set has been designed to enable
reconciliation of the Transactions which are carried out in Branches using the Branch
Infrastructure and are sent (a) to the POL FS System and (b) to Post Office
Management Information Systems (POL MIS). Full details of the format and content
of such Report set can be found in the CCD entitled: “End to End Reconciliation
Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

Transactions i.e. the number of APS Transactions where there is no value attached.
In addition, the Reconciliation Service is responsible for Transaction Corrections
received from Post Office for distribution to the Branches.

In addition to any Exceptions identified by Fujitsu Services within the TPS Report
set, Errors may also be discovered by Post Office when reconciling data within the
POL FS System or which relate to enquiries from Clients.

The investigation and resolution of TPS Exceptions and Errors shall be dealt with
through the Business Incident Management (BIM) reconciliation procedure. Such
procedure shall be initiated by the creation of Business Incidents (as defined in
section 2.1.4) for one or more Exceptions and/or Errors in accordance with the
provisions of section 2.1.4.

Subject to section 2.1.1.6, where an Exception or an Error at a Branch affects the
reconciliation within the POL FS System, Fujitsu Services may be liable to pay
liquidated damages to Post Office in lieu of any financial cost that Post Office may
incur to resolve the Exception or Error either internally within the POL FS System or
as part of a settlement adjustment with Clients. Details of how and when liquidated
damages are applied to Manual Error Reports (MER) are set out in section 2.3.4 of
this Reconciliation Service, Service Description.

Where an Exception or an Error at a Branch does not affect reconciliation within
POL MIS, no liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu Services.

There is no formal reconciliation produced between the POL FS System and POL
MIS transaction stream. The POL MIS stream should therefore not be used to verify
financial integrity and Post Office should ensure the POL FS System Transaction
information is used for this purpose.

APS Reconciliation

The APS Report set and the APS reconciliation have been designed to ensure APS
Transactions completed in Branches are reconciled with the Transaction stream
received by the POL FS System to enable settlement to be made with Clients. Full
details of the format and content of this Report set can be found in the CCD entitled:
“End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

Reconciliation of APS Transactions will include Transactions of zero value. While
these Transactions do not effect financial reconciliation they will be reported in
instances where they were not properly transferred to APS Clients or the POL FS
System.

The APS Report set will be produced daily by the Reconciliation Service to reconcile
those Transactions sent to both the POL FS System and APS Clients.

through the BIM reconciliation procedure. Such procedure shall be initiated by the
creation of Business Incidents (as defined in section 2.1.4) for one or more
Exceptions and/or Errors in accordance with the provisions of section 2.1.4.

Where an APS Exception or an Error does not affect reconciliation within the POL
FS System, no liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu Services.

There is no formal reconciliation between POL MIS and APS Clients. Financial
integrity shall therefore only be reconciled between the POL FS System and APS
Clients.

Banking & Related Services Reconciliation

The Banking & Related Services Report set has been designed to enable Alliance &
Leicester, CAPO, LINK, debit and credit card and ETU Transactions completed in
the Branches to be reconciled to allow settlement to be made with Clients, e.g. LINK,
or direct settlement to specific Clients and/or Banks. Full details of the format and
content of such Report set can be found in the CCD entitled: “End to End
Reconciliation Reporting" (CS/SPE/011).

The Reconciliation Service will produce the Banking & Related Services Report set
for each of the Transaction streams referred to in section 2.1.3.1 of this
Reconciliation Service, Service Description, in accordance with the rules documented
within the CCD entitled: “End-to-End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

The Banking & Related Services Report set will reconcile all the individual
Transaction components constituting a Banking & Related Services Transaction.

In addition to those Exceptions reported by Fujitsu Services within the Banking &
Related Services Report set, Errors may be discovered by Post Office when
reconciling data within its own systems or responding to queries from Clients.

The investigation and resolution of Banking & Related Services Exceptions and
Errors shall be dealt with through the BIM reconciliation procedure. Such procedure
shall be initiated by the creation of Business Incidents (as defined in section 2.1.4) for
one or more Exceptions and/or Errors in accordance with the provisions of section
2.1.4.

Where a Banking & Related Services Exception or Error does not affect
reconciliation within the POL FS System, no liquidated damages shall be payable by
Fujitsu Services.

Reconciliation between Counter and Branch Trading Statement

2.1.3.7.

The Reconciliation Service will reconcile Transactions created at Counter Positions
to the Branch trading statement at summary level. This reconciliation functionality
shall ensure that all Banking & Related Services Transactions (reflected in Cl
Confirmations) are included in the Branch trading statement, but shall not identify
erroneous Branch trading statement mappings which cause such Banking & Related
Services Transactions to be included in the wrong section of the Branch trading
statement, or non-Banking & Related Services Transactions to be included in the
Branch trading statement section intended for Banking & Related Services
Transactions.

Data Reconciliation Service

2.1.3.8.

2.1.3.9.

2.1.3.10.

2.1.3.11.

The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall enable reconciliation of
Transactions arriving at the Data Reconciliation Service Host (DRSH) from the
following three sources:

(a) Cl Confirmation Agent (i.e. the Cl Confirmations received by the
Confirmation Agent from the Counter Position);

(b) Alliance and Leicester, LINK, CAPO, D&CC and EPAY interfaces (ie. D
Messages and C4 Confirmations); and

(c) TPS Host (i.e. the Cl Confirmations harvested by the TPS Agent).

In the event that a CO Confirmation is sent to Alliance and Leicester, LINK, CAPO,
D&CC or EPAY, the relevant C1 Confirmation will indicate that a CO Confirmation
has been generated.

The Reconciliation Service shall monitor the Transactions and report Banking &
Related Services Transaction states which are:

(a) in error, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in end to end Banking &
Related Services Transactions; or

(b) in error in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected duration (e.g.
where Cl Confirmations are received from the C1 Confirmation Agent and C4
Confirmations are received from Alliance and Leicester, LINK CAPO, D&CC
and EPAY but the confirmation from the TPS Host has not been received after
an abnormal delay),

whilst identifying any such erroneous Banking & Related Services Transaction states
which require human analysis for resolution.

The DRSH shall not produce Reports which relate Banking & Related Services
Transactions included in Branch trading statements to Banking & Related Services
Transactions included in the Transaction files sent to the POL FS System and POL
MIS.

Complete Processing

2.1.3.12. The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall ensure that all data
received by it is processed and check for completeness of Transactions together with
reporting Exceptions for resolution by the Reconciliation Service.

2.1.3.13. The Banking & Related Services reconciliation system shall not regard a Banking &
Related Services Transaction as complete until reported as such in accordance with
the CCD entitled “End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

2.1.4 Reconciliation and Incident Management

Business Incidents

2.1.4.1. A Business Incident is defined as the ‘symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the
effect of the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent
to Post Office.

2.1.4.2. A Business Incident can relate to one or more of the Exceptions reported within the
CCD entitled “End-to-End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011)or one or more
of the reconciliation or settlement Errors discovered by Post Office.

System Incidents

2.1.4.3. A System Incident is defined as the underlying ‘cause’ of a Business Incident.

2.1.4.4. A System Incident is created to track the root cause of a Business Incident.
Depending on the impact, nature and scope of the Business Incident the problem
management procedure may be invoked. However, if the nature of the Business
Incident is agreed to be a low priority or a ‘one off, the BIM reconciliation
procedure will suffice. The choice of procedure shall be determined by discussion and
agreement between Post Office and the Reconciliation Service for specific Business
Incidents as they occur.

2.1.4.5. Where there are associated System Incidents and Business Incidents, their
relationship can be either:

(a) one to one; or

(b) one to many, respectively.

Incident Originators
2.1.4.6. Business Incidents will be raised by:

(a) the Reconciliation Service for Exceptions reported via the TPS, APS and
Banking & Related Services Report sets;

(b) Post Office for any other reconciliation or settlement Error discovered by Post
Office that has not been reported by the Reconciliation Service; and

(c) the Third Line Support Service for any system fault, file or Transaction rejection
which cannot be repaired electronically or data base adjustment which is
considered by Fujitsu Services to have a reconciliation or settlement implication
within Post Office.

Subject to agreement by Post Office and Fujitsu Services to the contrary, Branch
raised calls to the Service Desk will not generate Business Incidents.

The Service Desk will, however, monitor potential reconciliation issues from
Branches if it is considered necessary by Fujitsu Services.

of Business Incidents

In line with the generic Incident management policy agreed between Fujitsu Services
and Post Office, Post Office generated Business Incidents will only be recognised as
such if raised via the Service Desk. This ensures that the Business Incident is properly
logged, enabling the Reconciliation Service to ensure that corrective information can
be supplied and any underlying system fault can be rectified.

In all cases the Reconciliation Service will raise a BIM Report to log Business
Incidents in accordance with the Working Document entitled “Reconciliation and
Incident Management, Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0012).

BIM Reports / MER

2.1.4.11.

2.1.4.12.

2.1.4.13.

The BIM system has been designed to report the progress to resolution of a Business
Incident to allow Post Office to complete an accurate reconciliation or settlement
with its internal systems, Clients and Banks.

A BIM Report shall always be accompanied by a MER giving details of the
Transaction causing the Exception or the Error. Depending upon the nature of the
Exception or the Error, Fujitsu Services may be liable to pay liquidated damages to
Post Office in lieu of any financial cost that Post Office may incur to resolve the
Business Incident either internally within the POL FS System or as part of a
settlement adjustment with its Clients or Banks. Details of how and when liquidated
damages are applied to MER are set out in section 2.3.4 of this Reconciliation
Service, Service Description.

A BIM Report is deemed to be ‘cleared’ when the Reconciliation Service has
provided the information required to enable full reconciliation to take place,
including, for example, the provision of Transaction details and actions for Post
Office to undertake to correct a Customer’s bank account.

Resolution

2.1.4.14.

Where the Reconciliation Service corrects an Exception or an Error, one Business
Incident will be raised to cover each Exception or Error, which has been corrected,
or a group of related Exceptions or group of related Errors. A BIM / MER Report
containing appropriate information will be issued relating to that Exception or group
of Exceptions, or Error or group of Errors.

2.1.4.15. Where there is a need to correct Exceptions or Errors, the Reconciliation Service
may make corrective assumptions, based upon the format and content of previous
valid records of the same type, if no other detail is available. For example, where a
Transaction mode is unknown, the mode used may be obtained from a previous
Transaction of the same type. In such cases, the Reconciliation Service will promptly
inform Post Office of the assumption within the Working Day that the assumption has
been made.

Resolving the underlying cause of Business Incidents

2.1.4.16. If required, Fujitsu Services will complete a system bug fix to resolve the underlying
cause of any Business Incident. The Parties shall agree the implementation and
timing of this system bug fix in accordance with the problem management process.

Amending centrally held data

2.1.4.17. If the Reconciliation Service identifies that any Transaction data held on the ‘central
database’ located at the Data Centre is found to be inconsistent when compared to the
records of the Transaction that was completed at the Branch, e.g. a receipt, a
Transaction log or a Branch accounting discrepancy, the Reconciliation Service shall
obtain authorisation from Post Office prior to amending the centrally held
Transaction data.

2.1.5 Service Management

2.1.5.1 Continuous Service Improvement

Post Office and Fujitsu Services will, as part of ITIL service management best practice work
together to identify opportunities for elimination of duplicated effort and rationalisation of
processes with the aim of delivering improved efficiency and / or cost savings as referred to in
section 1.4 of the CCD entitled "Service Management Service, Service Description"
(SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.1.5.2 Service Reporting

The Reconciliation Service will, as required, provide service reporting for distribution to Post
Office as required under the Service Management Service described in the CCD entitled:
“Service Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.2. Service Availability

The Reconciliation Service will be available to be contacted from 9:00 to 17:30hrs Monday to
Friday excluding Bank Holidays. However, the process of reconciliation is provided on an on-
going and automated basis.

2.3 Service Levels and Remedies
2.3.1 General Principles
2.3.1.1. SLTs detailed in section 2.3.4 of this Reconciliation Service, Service Description,
which do not specify a measurement period are:
(a) reported monthly via the SRB; and
(b) measured over a Service Level Measurement Period equating to a Post Office
financial quarter, i.e:
e January to March;
e April to June;
e July to September; or
© October to December.
2.3.1.2. Additionally, all levels of the Reconciliation Service shall be monitored on a weekly
and monthly basis and any failure to meet an SLT assessed over that month shall be
reported to Post Office by means of the SRB.
2.3.1.3. The values applicable to each of the Reconciliation Service SLTs are identified within
section 2.3.4.1 of this Reconciliation Service, Service Description.
2.3.1.4. The performance of the Reconciliation Service during each OLT measurement period
shall be measured against each of the OLT identified in section 2.3.6 of this

hours of 09.00 to 17.30 Monday to Friday excluding Bank Holidays. Post Office may
monitor the performance of the Reconciliation Service OLT on request.
2.3.2 Service Level Relief

The SLT described in section 2.3.4.1 of this Reconciliation Service, Service Description shall
not apply to the extent that a Business Incident cannot be cleared due to:

(a) insufficient information being received from Post Office in respect of a Post Office
raised Error;

(b) _ insufficient information being received from Post Office to allow the Reconciliation
Service to progress a Business Incident to resolution; or

(c) Post Office delay in agreeing to close an Exception where the information supplied by
the Reconciliation Service is correct and fit for purpose.

Service Levels for which Liquidated Damages Apply

The purpose of liquidated damages in respect of MERs is that Post Office shall not be
disadvantaged by failures of Fujitsu Services to provide electronic transmission of
Transaction information to the POL FS System. MER related liquidated damages are
payable in accordance with the rules set out in Table 2 below.

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken to resolve each Banking & Related
Services Priority Exception counting time within Working Days only, as follows:

(a) where no Disputed Banking & Related Services Transaction Notice has been
received by Fujitsu Services and a Banking & Related Services Transaction
persists in system state category number 4 or 12 as set out in the CCD entitled
“End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011), such measurement shall
commence at 08:00hrs on the second Working Day following receipt by the
DRSH of the corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message (as applicable);

(b) where a Disputed Banking & Related Services Transaction Notice is received by
Fujitsu Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been
received by the DRSH prior to the day of receipt of that Disputed Banking &
Related Services Transaction Notice, such measurement shall commence at the
time of receipt of the Disputed Banking & Related Services Transaction Notice
(but not if already commenced in accordance with section 2.3.4.2 (a), in which
case section 2.3.4.2 (a) shall apply); and

(c) where a Disputed Banking & Related Services Transaction Notice is received by
Fujitsu Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message is received
by the DRSH on the same day as that Disputed Banking & Related Services
Transaction Notice or on a subsequent day, such measurement shall commence at
08:00hrs on the next Working Day following receipt of that C4 Confirmation or D
Message (as applicable).

In each case in section 2.3.4.2 the Banking & Related Services Priority Exception
shall be deemed resolved and measurement shall stop at the time Fujitsu Services
sends information to Post Office sufficient to enable Post Office to settle that
exception with the relevant Bank.

In respect of each Banking & Related Services Priority Exception where Fujitsu

(k

The Parties acknowledge that the fundamental commercial assumptions
underlying the provisions of this section 2.3.4.11 are that (i) the total number of
Debit Card Exceptions or Errors in any calendar month shall not exceed 100
and (ii) the total number of Debit Card Exception or Error Reimbursements in
any calendar month shall not exceed 20. Accordingly, the Parties agree that
should these assumptions prove to be incorrect they shall review and negotiate
appropriate amendments to the provisions of this section 2.3.4.11.

2.3.4.12. Debit Card Payment File Delivery

(a) Fujitsu Services’ obligations regarding transmission of Payment Files (as that
term is defined in the CCD entitled “Debit Card MoP Functional Description”
(EF/SER/001)) to the merchant acquirer (MA) shall be as specified in the CCD
entitled “Debit Card MoP Functional Description” (EF/SER/001). In the event
that an attempt to transmit a Payment File to the MA in accordance with that
CCD fails then those provisions shall be supplemented by section 2.3.4.12 (b).

(b

Where Fujitsu Services attempts to transmit a Payment File to the MA and the
attempt is unsuccessful Fujitsu Services shall be required to make one further
attempt to transmit that file to the MA on that day. If such further attempt fails,
Fujitsu Services shall report the same to the Post Office. Thereafter, Fujitsu
Services shall provide such assistance and co-operation as set out in the Working
Document entitled: “Reconciliation and Incident Management, Joint Working
Document” (SVW/SDM/PRO/0012), for the purposes of procuring the transmission
of that Payment File to the MA as soon as reasonably practicable.

(c) In the event that the process specified in section 2.3.4.12 (b) has been followed
by Fujitsu Services, no payment of liquidated damages (as specified in section
2.3.4.12 (d)) will be payable by Fujitsu Services due to the relevant Payment File
not reaching the MA.

(d) Subject to section 2.3.4.12 (c), in the event that a Payment File is not received by
the MA by the time specified for such in the CCD entitled: “Horizon Streamline
Application Interface Specification” (EF/IFS/002) on the day after creation of
the Payment File, liquidated damages will be payable by Fujitsu Services to Post
Office, by Fujitsu Services issuing Post Office with a credit note, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the day on which the MA receives the Payment
File. Such liquidated damages (to be applied by way of credit) will be calculated
in accordance with the following formula:
