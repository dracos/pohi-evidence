OPERATIONAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT:

1. ‘Introduction

This report is produced by the PDA Operational Service Management teain and provides
a high level “in-flight” assessment of any threats to overall business continuity in thé
Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues (actual
or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway
services. It should be noted that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

4. End to End Business Continuity

The volume and impact of problems have reduced over the past three weeks

following the successful introduction of scheduled software fixes to resolve the card
activation and lost transactions problems, plus the actions taken from the customer and
payment file failure PIR (post incident review).

Therefore from an operational point of view there are no major threats to business
continuity.

5.1  Infrastucture

Post Office Relocations/Refurbishments

The proposed relocation of Ellington SPSO and refurbishment of Easton Road are
progressing as scheduled.

Despite from the SW/SW Region, OSM and ICL Pathway work closely together, the .
relocation of Hewelsfield SPSO cannot progress due to BT not being able to install an
ISDN line at the new location. The telephone exchange at the new location is not
ISDNE compliant (an EEC requirement). This has resulted in * being de-
commissioned with effect from 25 February 1998. It is planned to re-commission the
outlet once the ISDN line is available.

Details of this relocation has been cascaded onto the POCL Implementation team for
reference within their domain.

A PIR is to be scheduled during March to access the learning points gained from the
recent relocations/refurbishments.

Definitions for the purpose of this report.

A transaction is a broad description of a customer session.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (in case of
a four- weekly allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the
payment card to returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit
allowance. Thus, a customer may save several payments before visiting their PO. During such a
transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

Appendix ‘B’

1b/1c Upgrade Subpostmasters' Views. Precise = +.~ } ‘

Preamble
50 outlets participated in the telephone survey, 25 in NE and 25 in Swisw.

Compared to July 1997, Subpostmasters now feel significantly better informed about the
Horizon programme. There is also a significant drop in the perception that the system is
easy to use. Users are also less satisfied with the training provided as well as with the
system in general. However users think very highly of the helpline service provided.
Generally, respondents in the North East were more positive about Horizon than their
counterparts in South Wales & South West.

Headlines

From the comments made during the interview the following common areas have been
identified.

System log out; Due to an incorrect parameter the user was logged out after a short
period of inactivity. This has been fixed.

Printer; Loading the receipt was found to be difficult. A software fix has been applied
and no more calls regarding loading of receipts have been logged.

Training

The gap between the end of training and carrying out the first transaction was thought to
be long and caused a lack of confidence by the user.

There appeared to be confusion as to which Helpdesk to call for advice and guidance.
Users were frustrated by the Regional Helplines being unable to answer questions when
the question should have been directed to Horizon System Helpdesk or Payment Card
Helpline.

Subpostmasters found some guides easier to use than others. Other anecdotal evidence

charts, while the ICL Pathway training manuals are preferred as they contain pictures of
the screen menus.

POCL Support; There is a perception that NE Region is not as active in supporting the
outlets as SW/SW.
