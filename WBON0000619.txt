Andy — now attaching my comments on Carpenter, Haworth and Longbottom.

I have no comment on the Trotter or Webb statements and no objection to them being served if considered

appropriate.

I think that still leaves Rimmer, Shields and Beal which I have not yet seen, and vd Bogerd which I have
seen drafts of but have not yet commented.

I note your comment that there are a couple of areas where we don’t have a witness. Do we need a file a
statement to that effect, or can it be covered off sufficiently in solicitor correspondence?
