INTRODUCTION

The first version of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code)
was published in 1992 by the Cadbury Committee. It defined corporate
governance as ‘the system by which companies are directed and
controlled. Boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their
companies. The shareholders’ role in governance is to appoint the directors
and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance
structure is in place.’ This remains true today, but the environment in which
companies, their shareholders and wider stakeholders operate continues
to develop rapidly.

Companies do not exist in isolation. Successful and sustainable businesses
underpin our economy and society by providing employment and creating
prosperity. To succeed in the long-term, directors and the companies they
lead need to build and maintain successful relationships with a wide range
of stakeholders. These relationships will be successful and enduring if they
are based on respect, trust and mutual benefit. Accordingly, a company’s
culture should promote integrity and openness, value diversity and be
responsive to the views of shareholders and wider stakeholders.

Over the years the Code has been revised and expanded to take account
of the increasing demands on the UK's corporate governance framework.
The principle of collective responsibility within a unitary board has been a
success and — alongside the stewardship activities of investors — played
a vital role in delivering high standards of governance and encouraging
long-term investment. Nevertheless, the debate about the nature and
extent of the framework has intensified as a result of financial crises and
high-profile examples of inadequate governance and misconduct, which
have led to poor outcomes for a wide range of stakeholders.

At the heart of this Code is an updated set of Principles that emphasise the
value of good corporate governance to long-term sustainable success, By
applying the Principles, following the more detailed Provisions and using
the associated guidance, companies can demonstrate throughout their
reporting how the governance of the company contributes to its long-
term sustainable success and achieves wider objectives.

Achieving this depends crucially on the way boards and companies
apply the spirit of the Principles. The Code does not set out a rigid set of
rules; instead it offers flexibility through the application of Principles and
through ‘comply or explain’ Provisions and supporting guidance. It is the
responsibility of boards to use this flexibility wisely and of investors and
their advisors to assess differing company approaches thoughtfully.

UKGI00019000
UKG1I00019000

Reporting on the Code

The 2018 Code focuses on the application of the Principles. The Listing
Rules require companies to make a statement of how they have applied
the Principles, in a manner that would enable shareholders to evaluate
how the Principles have been applied. The ability of investors to evaluate
the approach to governance is important. Reporting should cover the
application of the Principles in the context of the particular circumstances
of the company and how the board has set the company’s purpose and
strategy, met objectives and achieved outcomes through the decisions it
has taken.

It is important to report meaningfully when discussing the application of
the Principles and to avoid boilerplate reporting. The focus should be on
how these have been applied, articulating what action has been taken
and the resulting outcomes. High-quality reporting will include signposting
and cross-referencing to those parts of the annual report that describe
how the Principles have been applied. This will help investors with their
evaluation of company practices.

The effective application of the Principles should be supported by
high-quality reporting on the Provisions. These operate on a ‘comply or
explain’ basis and companies should avoid a ‘tick-box approach’. An
alternative to complying with a Provision may be justified in particular
circumstances based on a range of factors, including the size, complexity,
history and ownership structure of a company. Explanations should set
out the background, provide a clear rationale for the action the company
is taking, and explain the impact that the action has had. Where a
departure from a Provision is intended to be limited in time, the explanation
should indicate when the company expects to conform to the Provision.
Explanations are a positive opportunity to communicate, not an onerous
obligation.

In line with their responsibilities under the UK Stewardship Code,
investors should engage constructively and discuss with the company
any departures from recommended practice. In their consideration
of explanations, investors and their advisors should pay due regard
to a company’s individual circumstances. While they have every right
to challenge explanations if they are unconvincing, these must not be
evaluated in a mechanistic way. Investors and their advisors should also
give companies sufficient time to respond to enquiries about corporate
governance.

Financial Reporting Council
UKGI00019000
UKG1I00019000

Corporate governance reporting should also relate coherently to other
parts of the annual report — particularly the Strategic Report and other
complementary information — so that shareholders can effectively assess
the quality of the company’s governance arrangements, and the board's
activities and contributions. This should include providing information that
enables shareholders to assess how the directors have performed their
duty under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) to promote
the success of the company. Nothing in this Code overrides or is intended
as an interpretation of the statutory statement of directors’ duties in the
Act.

The Code is also supported by the Guidance on Board Effectiveness (the
Guidance). We encourage boards and companies to use this to support
their activities. The Guidance does not set out the ‘right way’ to apply
the Code. It is intended to stimulate thinking on how boards can carry
out their role most effectively. The Guidance is designed to help boards
with their actions and decisions when reporting on the application of the
Code'’s Principles. The board should also take into account the Financial
Reporting Council's Guidance on Audit Committees and Guidance on
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business
Reporting.

Application

The Code is applicable to all companies with a premium listing, whether
incorporated in the UK or elsewhere. The new Code applies to accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

For parent companies with a premium listing, the board should ensure that
there is adequate co-operation within the group to enable it to discharge
its governance responsibilities under the Code effectively. This includes
the communication of the parent company’s purpose, values and strategy.

Externally managed investment companies (which typically have a different
board and company structure that may affect the relevance of particular
Principles) may wish to use the Association of Investment Companies’
Corporate Governance Code to meet their obligations under the Code.
In addition, the Association of Financial Mutuals produces an annotated
version of the Code for mutual insurers to use.

BOARD LEADERSHIP
AND COMPANY PURPOSE

Principles

A. A successful company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial board, whose role is to
promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for shareholders
and contributing to wider society.

B. The board should establish the company’s purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy itself that
these and its culture are aligned. All directors must act with integrity, lead by example and
promote the desired culture.

C. The board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet
its objectives and measure performance against them. The board should also establish a
framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed.

D. In order for the company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders, the
board should ensure effective engagement with, and encourage participation from, these
parties.

E. The board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the
company’s values and support its long-term sustainable success. The workforce should be
able to raise any matters of concern.

Provisions

1. The board should assess the basis on which the company generates
and preserves value over the long-term. It should describe in the
annual report how opportunities and risks to the future success of the
business have been considered and addressed, the sustainability of
the company’s business model and how its governance contributes
to the delivery of its strategy.

2. The board should assess and monitor culture. Where it is not satisfied
that policy, practices or behaviour throughout the business are
aligned with the company’s purpose, values and strategy, it should
seek assurance that management has taken corrective action. The
annual report should explain the board's activities and any action
taken. In addition, it should include an explanation of the company’s
approach to investing in and rewarding its workforce.

3. In addition to formal general meetings, the chair should seek
regular engagement with major shareholders in order to understand
their views on governance and performance against the strategy.
Committee chairs should seek engagement with shareholders on
significant matters related to their areas of responsibility. The chair
should ensure that the board as a whole has a clear understanding
of the views of shareholders.

Financial Reporting Council
UKGI00019000
UKG1I00019000

When 20 per cent or more of votes have been cast against the board
recommendation for a resolution, the company should explain, when
announcing voting results, what actions it intends to take to consult
shareholders in order to understand the reasons behind the result. An
update on the views received from shareholders and actions taken
should be published no later than six months after the shareholder
meeting. The board should then provide a final summary in the annual
report and, if applicable, in the explanatory notes to resolutions at the
next shareholder meeting, on what impact the feedback has had on
the decisions the board has taken and any actions or resolutions
now proposed.’

The board should understand the views of the company’s other key
stakeholders and describe in the annual report how their interests
and the matters set out in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006
have been considered in board discussions and decision-making.”
The board should keep engagement mechanisms under review so
that they remain effective.

For engagement with the workforce,® one or a combination of the
following methods should be used:

© adirector appointed from the workforce;
¢ a formal workforce advisory panel;
¢ a designated non-executive director.

If the board has not chosen one or more of these methods, it
should explain what alternative arrangements are in place and why it
considers that they are effective.

There should be a means for the workforce to raise concerns in
confidence and - if they wish - anonymously. The board should
routinely review this and the reports arising from its operation. It
should ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate
and independent investigation of such matters and for follow-up
action.

The board should take action to identify and manage conflicts of
interest, including those resulting from significant shareholdings, and
ensure that the influence of third parties does not compromise or
override independent judgement.

Where directors have concerns about the operation of the board
or the management of the company that cannot be resolved, their
concerns should be recorded in the board minutes. On resignation,
a non-executive director should provide a written statement to the
chair, for circulation to the board, if they have any such concerns.

company updates are available on the Public Register

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

Principles

F. The chair leads the board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company.
They should demonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and promote a culture
of openness and debate. In addition, the chair facilitates constructive board relations and the
effective contribution of all non-executive directors, and ensures that directors receive accurate,
timely and clear information.

G. The board should include an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive (and,
in particular, independent non-executive) directors, such that no one individual or small
group of individuals dominates the board's decision-making. There should be a clear division
of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and the executive leadership of the
company’s business.

H. Non-executive directors should have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. They
should provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold
management to account.

I. I The board, supported by the company secretary, should ensure that it has the policies, processes,
information, time and resources it needs in order to function effectively and efficiently.

Provisions

9. The chair should be independent on appointment when assessed
against the circumstances set out in Provision 10. The roles of chair
and chief executive should not be exercised by the same individual.
A chief executive should not become chair of the same company.
If, exceptionally, this is proposed by the board, major shareholders
should be consulted ahead of appointment. The board should set
out its reasons to all shareholders at the time of the appointment and
also publish these on the company website.

10. The board should identify in the annual report each non-executive
director it considers to be independent. Circumstances which are
likely to impair, or could appear to impair, a non-executive director's
independence include, but are not limited to, whether a director:
¢ is or has been an employee of the company or group within the

last five years;
¢ has, or has had within the last three years, a material business
relationship with the company, either directly or as a partner,
shareholder, director or senior employee of a body that has such

a relationship with the company;

has received or receives additional remuneration from the company

apart from a director's fee, participates in the company’s share

option or a performance-related pay scheme, or is a member of
the company’s pension scheme;

¢ has close family ties with any of the company’s advisers, directors
or senior employees;

* holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other
directors through involvement in other companies or bodies;

© represents a significant shareholder; or

* has served on the board for more than nine years from the date of
their first appointment.

Where any of these or other relevant circumstances apply, and
the board nonetheless considers that the non-executive director is
independent, a clear explanation should be provided.

At least half the board, excluding the chair, should be non-executive
directors whom the board considers to be independent.

The board should appoint one of the independent non-executive
directors to be the senior independent director to provide a sounding
board for the chair and serve as an intermediary for the other
directors and shareholders. Led by the senior independent director,
the non-executive directors should meet without the chair present
at least annually to appraise the chair's performance, and on other
occasions as necessary.

Non-executive directors have a prime role in appointing and removing
executive directors. Non-executive directors should scrutinise and
hold to account the performance of management and individual
executive directors against agreed performance objectives. The
chair should hold meetings with the non-executive directors without
the executive directors present.

The responsibilities of the chair, chief executive, senior independent
director, board and committees should be clear, set out in writing,
agreed by the board and made publicly available. The annual
report should set out the number of meetings of the board and its
committees, and the individual attendance by directors.

When making new appointments, the board should take into account
other demands on directors’ time. Prior to appointment, significant
commitments should be disclosed with an indication of the time
involved. Additional external appointments should not be undertaken
without prior approval of the board, with the reasons for permitting
significant appointments explained in the annual report. Full-time
executive directors should not take on more than one non-executive
directorship ina FTSE 100 company or other significant appointment.

All directors should have access to the advice of the company
secretary, who is responsible for advising the board on all governance
matters. Both the appointment and removal of the company secretary
should be a matter for the whole board.

COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION
AND EVALUATION

Principles

J. Appointments to the board should be subject to a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure,
and an effective succession plan should be maintained for board and senior management.*
Both appointments and succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria>
and, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds,
cognitive and personal strengths.

K. The board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge.
Consideration should be given to the length of service of the board as a whole and membership
regularly refreshed.

L. Annual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively
members work together to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate
whether each director continues to contribute effectively.

Provisions

17. The board should establish a nomination committee to lead the
process for appointments, ensure plans are in place for orderly
succession to both the board and senior management positions,
and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.
A majority of members of the committee should be independent
non-executive directors. The chair of the board should not chair the
committee when it is dealing with the appointment of their successor.

18. All directors should be subject to annual re-election. The board
should set out in the papers accompanying the resolutions to elect
each director the specific reasons why their contribution is, and
continues to be, important to the company’s long-term sustainable
success.

19. Thechair should not remain in post beyond nine years from the date of
their first appointment to the board. To facilitate effective succession
planning and the development of a diverse board, this period can
be extended for a limited time, particularly in those cases where the
chair was an existing non-executive director on appointment. A clear
explanation should be provided.

20. Open advertising and/or an external search consultancy should

There should be a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of the
performance of the board, its committees, the chair and individual
directors. The chair should consider having a regular externally
facilitated board evaluation. In FTSE 350 companies this should
happen at least every three years. The external evaluator should be
identified in the annual report and a statement made about any other
connection it has with the company or individual directors.

The chair should act on the results of the evaluation by recognising
the strengths and addressing any weaknesses of the board. Each
director should engage with the process and take appropriate action
when development needs have been identified.

The annual report should describe the work of the nomination

committee, including:

¢ the process used in relation to appointments, its approach to
succession planning and how both support developing a diverse
pipeline;

* how the board evaluation has been conducted, the nature and

extent of an external evaluator's contact with the board and

individual directors, the outcomes and actions taken, and how it

has or will influence board composition;

the policy on diversity and inclusion, its objectives and linkage to

company strategy, how it has been implemented and progress on

achieving the objectives; and

the gender balance of those in the senior management® and their

direct reports.

AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL

CONTROL

Principles

M. The board should establish formal and transparent policies and procedures to ensure the
independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions and satisfy itself on the

integrity of financial and narrative statements.’

N. The board should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s
position and prospects.

O. The board should establish procedures to manage risk, oversee the internal control framework,
and determine the nature and extent of the principal risks the company is willing to take in order
to achieve its long-term strategic objectives.

Provisions
24. The board should establish an audit committee of independent

non-executive directors, with a minimum membership of three, or in
the case of smaller companies, two.® The chair of the board should
not be a member. The board should satisfy itself that at least one
member has recent and relevant financial experience. The committee
as a whole shall have competence relevant to the sector in which the
company operates.

The main roles and responsibilities of the audit committee should
include:

monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the company
and any formal announcements relating to the company’s
financial performance, and reviewing significant financial reporting
judgements contained in them;

providing advice (where requested by the board) on whether the
annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for
shareholders to assess the company’s position and performance,
business model and strategy;

reviewing the company’s internal financial controls and internal
control and risk management systems, unless expressly addressed
by a separate board risk committee composed of independent
non-executive directors, or by the board itself;

monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s
internal audit function or, where there is not one, considering
annually whether there is a need for one and making a
recommendation to the board;

* The board's responsibilty to present a fair, balanced
and understandable assessment extends to interim
and other price-sensitive public records and reports
to regulators, as well as to information required to be
presented by statutory instruments,

conducting the tender process and making recommendations to
the board, about the appointment, reappointment and removal of
the external auditor, and approving the remuneration and terms of

reviewing and monitoring the external auditor's independence and
objectivity;

reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process, taking
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory
requirements;

developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the
external auditor to supply non-audit services, ensuring there is
prior approval of non-audit services, considering the impact this
may have on independence, taking into account the relevant
regulations and ethical guidance in this regard, and reporting to
the board on any improvement or action required; and

© reporting to the board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.

The annual report should describe the work of the audit committee,
including:

the significant issues that the audit committee considered relating
to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed;
an explanation of how it has assessed the independence and
effectiveness of the external audit process and the approach
taken to the appointment or reappointment of the external auditor,
information on the length of tenure of the current audit firm, when a
tender was last conducted and advance notice of any retendering
plans;

in the case of a board not accepting the audit committee's
recommendation on the external auditor appointment,
reappointment or removal, a statement from the audit committee
explaining its recommendation and the reasons why the board
has taken a different position (this should also be supplied in any
papers recommending appointment or reappointment);

where there is no internal audit function, an explanation for the
absence, how internal assurance is achieved, and how this affects
the work of external audit; and

an explanation of how auditor independence and objectivity are
safeguarded, if the external auditor provides non-audit services.

The directors should explain in the annual report their responsibility
for preparing the annual report and accounts, and state that they
consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is
fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position,
performance, business model and strategy.

The board should carry out a robust assessment of the company’s
emerging and principal risks.° The board should confirm in the
annual report that it has completed this assessment, including a
description of its principal risks, what procedures are in place to
identify emerging risks, and an explanation of how these are being
managed or mitigated.

The board should monitor the company’s risk management and
internal control systems and, at least annually, carry out a review of
their effectiveness and report on that review in the annual report. The
monitoring and review should cover all material controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls.

In annual and half-yearly financial statements, the board should
state whether it considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing them, and identify any material
uncertainties to the company’s ability to continue to do so over a
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the
financial statements.

Taking account of the company’s current position and principal risks,
the board should explain in the annual report how it has assessed
the prospects of the company, over what period it has done so and
why it considers that period to be appropriate. The board should
state whether it has a reasonable expectation that the company will
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall
due over the period of their assessment, drawing attention to any
qualifications or assumptions as necessary.

® Principal risks should include, but are not necessarily
limited to, those that could result in events or
circumstances that might threaten the company's

promote long-term sustainable success. Executive remuneration should be aligned to company
Purpose and values, and be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the company’s long-term

Q. A formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and
determining director and senior management’? remuneration should be established. No director
should be involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.

R. Directors should exercise independent judgement and discretion when authorising remuneration
outcomes, taking account of company and individual performance, and wider circumstances.

Provisions

32. The board should establish a remuneration committee of independent
non-executive directors, with a minimum membership of three,
or in the case of smaller companies, two."' In addition, the chair
of the board can only be a member if they were independent on
appointment and cannot chair the committee. Before appointment
as chair of the remuneration committee, the appointee should have
served on a remuneration committee for at least 12 months.

33, The remuneration committee should have delegated responsibility
for determining the policy for executive director remuneration and
setting remuneration for the chair, executive directors and senior
management.’? It should review workforce’? remuneration and
related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with
culture, taking these into account when setting the policy for
executive director remuneration.

34. The remuneration of non-executive directors should be determined
in accordance with the Articles of Association or, alternatively, by the
board. Levels of remuneration for the chair and all non-executive
directors should reflect the time commitment and responsibilities
of the role. Remuneration for all non-executive directors should not
include share options or other performance-related elements.

35. Where a remuneration consultant is appointed, this should be the
responsibility of the remuneration committee. The consultant should
be identified in the annual report alongside a statement about any
other connection it has with the company or individual directors.
Independent judgement should be exercised when evaluating
the advice of external third parties and when receiving views from
executive directors and senior management. '4

Remuneration schemes should promote long-term shareholdings by
executive directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder
interests. Share awards granted for this purpose should be released
for sale on a phased basis and be subject to a total vesting and
holding period of five years or more. The remuneration committee
should develop a formal policy for post-employment shareholding
requirements encompassing both unvested and vested shares.

Remuneration schemes and policies should enable the use of
discretion to override formulaic outcomes. They should also include
provisions that would enable the company to recover and/or withhold
sums or share awards and specify the circumstances in which it
would be appropriate to do so,

Only basic salary should be pensionable. The pension contribution
rates for executive directors, or payments in lieu, should be aligned
with those available to the workforce. The pension consequences
and associated costs of basic salary increases and any other changes
in pensionable remuneration, or contribution rates, particularly for
directors close to retirement, should be carefully considered when
compared with workforce arrangements.

Notice or contract periods should be one year or less. If it is
necessary to offer longer periods to new directors recruited from
outside the company, such periods should reduce to one year or less
after the initial period. The remuneration committee should ensure
compensation commitments in directors’ terms of appointment do
not reward poor performance. They should be robust in reducing
compensation to reflect departing directors’ obligations to mitigate
loss.

When determining executive director remuneration policy and
practices, the remuneration committee should address the following:

¢ clarity - remuneration arrangements should be transparent
and promote effective engagement with shareholders and the
workforce;

simplicity — remuneration structures should avoid complexity and
their rationale and operation should be easy to understand;

risk — remuneration arrangements should ensure reputational and
other risks from excessive rewards, and behavioural risks that
can arise from target-based incentive plans, are identified and
mitigated;

predictability — the range of possible values of rewards to individual
directors and any other limits or discretions should be identified
and explained at the time of approving the policy;

Financial Reporting Council
UKGI00019000

© proportionality — the link between individual awards, the delivery
of strategy and the long-term performance of the company should
be clear. Outcomes should not reward poor performance; and

* alignment to culture — incentive schemes should drive behaviours
