Subject: Notes from Andy Furey conversation re Horizon

Hi, had a useful chat with Andy and elicited the following, which I think we can take on face value.
CWU is attending the hearing, and it will be Andy.

Position is likely to be a) no impact on Crown network, which is their main concern b) they have 3 members in (or trying to get on?)
the mediation scheme and ere not pleased with the perceived delays.

The CWU research department has been producing a submission and Andy has said he'll send that to me (see my previous email,
Mark).

NB: Mark Baker is currently on leave and not back until Monday so has played no part in things over the last few weeks so it's
possible that he may look to stoke things up on his return.

Hope this helps.

Tom
