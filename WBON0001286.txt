Rodric

You should get a couple more statements tomorrow.

We've also taken a decision today to drop the statements on NBSC (Kendra Dickinson), Debt (Alison Bolsover) and
Fraud Analysis (Kim Abbots), and also significantly cut down the statement on Fraud (Helen Dickinson). Having
drafted the core of those statements for Counsel's review, the decision is that they are too far over the line of
inadmissibility. We may take some parts of them and surreptitiously transplant them into other statements where they

will be less obvious.

We will however proceed to finalise these dropped statements (they are already 80% done) so that we have the
information on the record for later hearings. For example, Alison's statement sets out useful background on FSC and

TCs that might be deployed in the Horizon Issues trial.

Thanks Victoria.

Just a reminder please to ensure you factor in enough time for our review, feedback and sign off etc.

As I’ve mentioned, I am on annual leave on 24 July, so need to receive the statements well before that (and
not all in one go!).

Thanks, Rod

Please find attached the latest draft of your statement. All comments welcomed. This has been restructured from the
last version you saw, added a number of new sections and have cut out some material to make it shorter / where we
have considered material to be to far over the line of admissibility.

Rod — your comments also welcomed. !n particular, there are some comments marked in green for your attention.

Kind regards

Andy
