Chris - I don't think Alasdair saw the insurance paper and maybe the 2 points below (and in particular the second) covers
his point? I'll be in first thing tomorrow to discuss. Charles

Directors and Officers Liability

In August 2012, PO agreed that the existing RMG placed Directors and Officers Liability policy should be maintained for
a further year.

Whilst quotations were provided for a PO stand-alone policy, it was felt that with a joint parent company, coupled with the
additional premium costs, maintaining seamless cover was paramount and that this would be reviewed in 12 months.
This policy provides full cover for PO directors and officers where they are sued as a result of a wrongful act, resulting
from something that they are alleged to have done while acting as a manager of PO.

In addition the policy will respond if there is an investigation into an act that they are alleged to have committed.

This policy is a joint and severable contract between Insurers and each individual who is insured, which means that any
individual has the ability to make a claim under the policy, with or without the agreement of POL or RMG.

This policy has an excess of £25k for each and every claim though if the claim (or series of claims) arise from the same
incident then only one excess cover applies. However a claim against an individual has no excess. The cover is up to
£60m and includes retrospective cover.

Professional Indemnity

This policy has a £10m limit of indemnity. This covers a breach of professional duty by PO resulting in a third party loss.
The policy Civil liability, defence costs and expenses, libel and slander (committed by PO or any person employed by
PO) covers defence costs, breach or infringement of copyright and or intellectual property rights. The policy has a
GBP250k excess.

Charles, please see if there's a straightforward paragraph we can write on this (should go in my name) rather than giving
them the whole insurance paper.

Thanks,
Chris

I'm afraid the para on insurance does not answer the question which was about PI cover for the PO not D&O cover for
the directors.

The key question is does the PO have insurance cover in the event of a material claim (or perhaps a ‘class action’ type
claim)? Probably easiest if I pick up directly with Chris.

Regards

Alasdair

> Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to yesterday's email, which incorporates the
insurance information (at paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes a couple of additional
sentences on accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.

> For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with Susan and Alwen earlier this week focused
mainly on the history and immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I was reassured by the
energy, resource and prioritisation of the work we are doing and I think it's fair to say on this we are working through as
quickly as is practical.

>

> In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only going back to 2010 and the significance of
a Horizon upgrade (full reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on this point as a critical
issue will be determining how far back we need to go.

>

> Also what's the legal position with Fujitsu - do we think they are in any way culpable (and have we had our view
verified) and have we taken any action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?
