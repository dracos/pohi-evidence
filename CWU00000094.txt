Dear Colleague,

Crown Office Staffing Agreement - COSA

BOSA was originally introduced following membership
endorsement in 2001. Key features of this agreement
included the introduction of a shorter working week
aligned with a move from gross to net hours.

In 2008 much of BOSA has either been fully deployed
and is now an integral part of our members terms

and conditions or conversely has been rendered time
expired by events. It is irrefutable that BOSA has served
our members and their representatives exceptionally
well in the intervening years.

It is however incumbent upon us to ensure that
agreements remain relevant and fit for purpose.
Against this background we have undertaken a
refreshing exercise designed to ensure that BOSA
remains contemporary. Consequently without
renegotiating BOSA the refreshed agreement - COSA,
reaffirms the Union’s role in all staffing arrangements
and crucially we have retained all key principles.

All representatives are encouraged to embrace COSA.

It is now our responsibility to deploy and promote COSA
to ensure the clear processes are applied in a consistent
and fair manner, to the benefit of our members.

ntroduction

This agreement has been refreshed and updated jointly by the Post Office
Ltd (POL) and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) to incorporate the
Crown Career Path that was agreed in 2007 and reflect recent changes to
employment legislation.

COSA aims to help support good working practices to ensure our branches
are run efficiently and ensure our customers receive the high standard of
service they expect.

ey principles

This agreement applies to all Crown Office colleagues and is underpinned
by the following key principles.

The future existence of POL, and hence its ability to offer job security,
depends on everyone working together in a way that maximises sales
income growth in the most efficient way possible.

This agreement contributes to POL's commercial recovery, helps to
promote the long term viability of Crown Offices and secure employment.
Customers expect and should be able to rely on Crown Offices for
consistent and good service, supported by a culture of excellence.
Achieving and maintaining this standard is vital to secure POL's future.

POL aims to be a good employer offering long term employment
opportunities to full and part time colleagues, with fair terms and
conditions of employment for all.

POL continuing aim is to introduce change without the need to resort to
compulsory redundancy.

This agreement includes the resourcing of Crown Offices, consistent with the
flexibility, efficiency and service needs of the Business, with fair employment
practices and equality of opportunity for all.

This agreement is designed to support and maintain good Industrial Relations
at local and national level.

Local and Territorial disagreements on the interpretation and application of
this agreement will be resolved through the IR procedural framework, with
points of principle being resolved by POL and CWU headquarters.

lexible attendance system

The system is designed to complement the structured core duties. It’s purpose
is to balance staffing levels to customer flow whilst providing opportunities
for colleagues to flex their attendance. This has to be viewed against the
background of colleagues and managers being prepared to ‘give and take’

The Flexible Attendance System must be applied consistently, with all
colleagues being treated equally throughout the Crown Office network. It’s
aim is to align staffing to traffic flows to ensure good customer service.

The system, is designed to provide flexibility to meet customer requirements
by increasing the resource available to meet forecasted peaks of customer
demand. This will be achieved by recycling hours from times when less
resource is required.

As a consequence full time colleagues will progressively constitute the
majority of the workforce. For some, part time working is a stepping stone to
full time employment, for others part time working is better for a good work/
life balance. Recognising this, a mix of full and part time staffing arrangements
remain the most effective means of addressing the issue of delivering
excellent service to customers.

The system enables colleagues to work in a consistent environment, where
workload is spread throughout the month by using resource at peak times
and reducing staffing during quiet times. This is achieved by the following

key elements:

the ability to voluntarily bank additional hours worked and take at a
later date

the ability to ask for time off and pay the hours back at a later date
» at quieter times

~ colleagues may request to leave early
— managers may also seek volunteer(s) to leave early

In both these circumstances hours owed will be worked at a mutually
acceptable time.

liability for full time colleagues to work their scheduled days off with a
minimum of 6 weeks notice
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

It is the responsibility of the Crown Office Manager to give six weeks notice
of the need to attend on a scheduled rest day. It is the obligation of the
individual to work this attendance. The scheduled duties are an agreed core,
and are therefore subject to flexibility provided all individuals are given the
appropriate period of notice.

It will not be necessary to vary the hours of all full time colleagues from their
scheduled core duties on a regular basis

Part time colleagues may also participate in the Flexible Attendance System
on a voluntary basis.

4.1 Scheduled core duties
Scheduled core duties are agreed for the staffing requirement of the office
and will have a maximum of five scheduled attendances in any one week.

The system allows core duties which do not take into consideration
fluctuations in traffic, such as, month end to be flexed.

Full time colleagues have a liability to be scheduled to work one full day over
and above weekly conditioned hours. It is important to give colleagues at
least six weeks notice of the requirement for an additional day's attendance.

Colleagues requiring a certain day as their compensating day off will also be
required to give at least six weeks notice to the Crown Manager.

A compensating day off for working a rest day must be taken within four
months and can be linked to a scheduled rest day. Colleagues reclaiming
surplus hours worked will be able to on a like for like basis. Where a
compensating day is gained through working a Saturday, another Saturday
may be taken in compensation.

4.2 Banking of hours

The system will reduce the reliance on month end pressure overtime, by

the recycling of hours from mid month. However, it is necessary to retain

the ability to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. This will be achieved
through the banking of hours with individuals voluntarily performing
additional hours to cover unexpected staffing requirements and being
compensated through time off or the payment of overtime, the choice being
made by the colleague.
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

Colleagues may prefer to build up surplus hours to take additional time off for
holidays up to a maximum of 12 days a year. As the additional hours will be
taken as Annual Leave they will therefore be subject to the selection process.
To ensure fairness these days/weeks over and above the basic entitlement
should only be taken once all the actual Annual Leave entitlements have
been selected.

4.3 Recording of hours - Timesheets

It is essential the system is managed effectively with all additional hours
worked being credited. The timesheet at Annex A will be provided to each
colleague. Time owed and banked will be recorded daily by colleagues

and checked by managers. A diary or duty book should be kept to note
daily changes in attendance. It is important to keep accurate timesheets for
conformance audits, and they must be available to colleagues at all times.

It is important that the hours are maintained within sensible limits. Hours
owed or banked should not exceed 24, unless it is for an exceptional reason
and a short period in agreement between the Crown Office Manager and
colleagues. With proper scheduling and planning, a significant surplus or
deficit of hours should not build up, if this does occur on an ongoing basis it
would indicate a need to review the core duties.
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

_

erms and conditions

5.1 Overtime

The principle will be to share overtime opportunities fairly and equally,
allowing all colleagues, irrespective of full or part time status to enhance
earnings. All overtime above contracted hours is voluntary

5.2 Annual leave

The leave year runs from April to March. Colleagues are entitled to take up

to 3 weeks of their annual entitlement in the period May to September, of
which two weeks must be linked. Colleagues with more than 15 years service
will be able to take 4 weeks summer leave of which 2 weeks must be linked.
In recognition of the fact that many tour operators run package holidays
mid-week to mid-week leave arrangements which match this pattern will be
facilitated when this can be planned for.

Selection of annual leave must ensure that all colleagues are treated fairly,
for example using a rotational system. Whatever mechanism is used will
be subject to a majority decision within the Crown office but must not
discriminate against individuals on the basis of age or length of service.

The only blocking off of annual leave will be during the Christmas period
when the four complete weeks prior to the week containing Christmas day
will be blocked off . There may be other occasions when there is a need to
reduce the numbers on annual leave.

5.3 Bank Holiday credits

All colleagues (full and part time) due to work on a bank holiday will take the
day off and regardless of the number of hours they were scheduled to work,
they will not be required to make up any shortfall nor claim any balance of
hours. E.g.

Scheduled duty

(bank holiday

Monday

saturday” a . — — on
Scheduled hours 35.00
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

If the bank holiday scheduled attendance is greater than a fifth of contractual
hours (i.e. 7 hrs) the colleague is not required to work the shortfall. The
colleague is only required to work the remaining scheduled hours ~ 27 hours
in the example above. I.e. everyone follows their normal scheduled duty of the
whole week with the bank holiday being another day off.

Ifa scheduled duty has a shorter attendance on a bank holiday than 1/5th of
contractual hours then the opposite applies - in other words the employee
does not claim back the difference between the scheduled attendance

and a standard day (1/5th contractual hours) and is effectively losing under
these circumstances. However in most cases the majority of colleagues are
seen as benefiting from the arrangements and over the course of a year, the
probability will be that most will gain rather than lose.

Full and Part Time colleagues with only one rest day whose scheduled day off
coincides with a bank holiday have the choice of two options:

A day in lieu that can either be added to the annual leave card or moved
to another convenient time (such as the following week) if operationally
possible.

or

Overtime can be claimed at normal rate - this will be 1/Sth of the weekly
contractual hours.

Part time colleagues that have more than one day off each week should be
treated equally to full time colleagues and are entitled to 1/5th of weekly
contracted hours in lieu or overtime as detailed above.

Days off should not be changed deliberately to avoid paying overtime or days
in lieu.

For colleagues who are on annual leave over a bank holiday the following
arrangements apply:

If the colleague is on annual leave for the whole week then only 4 days should
be shown on their annual leave card with the other day being the bank
holiday absence. In the case of part time colleagues then only 4/5th of their
contractual hours should be shown on their card.
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

5.4 Part time colleagues

Colleagues employed after 1 July 2001 will be contracted to work between
16 and 28 hours per week, the exception to this will be Flexible Working
Arrangements, eg Family Friendly Duties.

Part time colleagues’ terms and conditions are as follows.

All salary earned for hours worked up to full time contracted hours will be
pensionable.

Sick pay will be based on the average of the actual hours worked in the
preceding 3 whole months.

Maternity pay for the first 26 weeks will be based on the average of the actual
hours worked in the preceding 3 whole months.

Pay whilst on annual leave will be based on the average of the actual hours
worked in the preceding 3 whole months that the annual leave was taken.

Where an individual has worked for less than 3 whole months the calculations
will be based on the average actual hours worked preceding the payment.

5.5 Incentive scheme
All Crown colleagues are eligible for payment through separately negotiated
Incentive Schemes.

rown Office staffing arrangements

6.1 Crown Office opening hours
Where opening hours are altered to reflect the local trading requirements,
CWUTCRs will be consulted at Regional Manager level.

6.2 Attendances

The minimum daily attendance is agreed as three and a half hours on
weekdays, three hours on a Saturday with lunchtime closing, and three and a
half hours on a Saturday with full day opening. These attendances will include
a scheduled tea break of fifteen minutes.

6.3 Start and end of day procedures
The following standard times apply without exception:

ten minutes for getting a till out and preparing to serve customers
five minutes for preparing to start serving if the till is already out

five minutes for putting a till away at the end of duty, this will be time
allowed for logging off terminals and putting tills away, recognising that
these tasks can be performed concurrently

» in addition 45 minutes be allowed for the balance of all stock units.

All Crown Offices require security time. Variations in local requirements makes
it impossible to agree standard security times. The BOSS agreement defines
the method of calculating security time.

6.4 Unpaid meal breaks

For a full day attendance an unpaid meal break will be scheduled, and its
duration will be no less than 30 minutes and no more than one hour. A full
day attendance will be regarded as a minimum of 7 hours.

For a full day attendance the aim, wherever possible, will be to schedule the
main meal break during 11.30-14.30. Flexibility will be needed to help meet
operational difficulties which might arise.

Where an attendance is for less than a full day but greater than 5 hours it
must include a 30 minute meal break. The only exception to this being young
workers (l.e. Under 18 years of age) who are entitled to a 30 minute unpaid
break after 4% hours work.

—
12
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

To maintain excellent service levels over busy lunchtime periods, there is a
requirement to match staffing levels to customer arrival patterns. Therefore,

it may be desirable to minimise the number of colleagues away from the
counter because of meal breaks at busy periods, this can be achieved through
the scheduling of shorter 30-minute meal breaks.

The scheduling of shorter meal breaks may create scheduled core duties for
full time colleagues which include 4 day working weeks. Within a four week
reference period, the total hours scheduled in the reference period must equal
4 times the contracted weekly hours.

During unplanned for pressure periods colleagues with a scheduled meal
break of greater than 30 minutes may be asked to volunteer to take a shorter
meal break and be given the choice of banking the additional hours or
claiming overtime. In these circumstances the minimum meal break must be
no less than 30 minutes.

6.5 Paid tea breaks

Colleagues are entitled to have paid tea breaks away from the counter. The
number of 15-minute breaks scheduled into a particular attendance, so as to
ensure colleagues are not required to work at the counter for an unreasonable
period without a break are:

Total scheduled working hours Number of paid tea breaks
Up to Shrs i

Over Shrs 2

Where an individual's duty extends beyond 18.30 and the total hours
worked is greater than seven they will be entitled to an additional 15 minute
paid tea break.

Core duties should not contain a period of greater than two and a half
hours unbroken time at the counter either side of a meal break. During
periods of unexpected customer pressure tea breaks may be brought
forward or delayed.

morning or as soon as possible afterwards.

1/2hr WTL scheduled alongside the Sales Capability Training and supplied
to all colleagues.

Training for Retail Sales Consultants will be limited to a 1/2hr WTL session
each week.

6.7 Filling of vacancies
Where a full time vacancy exists after a check on local supernumeraries has
been undertaken resourcing will be carried out as follows:

» formal transfer applicants offered the vacancy
part time colleagues in the office willing to move to full time working

part time colleagues in a nearby branch willing to move to full
time working

Postshop colleagues in the office willing to progress to counter working

» Postshop colleagues in nearby branches willing to progress to
counter working.
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

Where a part time vacancy exists after a check on local supernumeraries has
been undertaken resourcing will be carried out as follows:

» part time transferees, including full timers wishing to reduce to part time
hours, offered the vacancy

» part time colleagues in the office wishing to increase up to and including
full time status or decrease their hours to fill the vacancy

® part time colleagues in a nearby branch willing to move to fill the vacancy
» Postshop colleagues in the office willing to progress to counter working

» Postshop colleagues in nearby branches willing to progress to
counter working.

Filling of all vacancies is subject to there being no outstanding
underperformance issues from the most recent PDR for those being
considered for the post. If none of the above solutions can be progressed then
the vacancy will be filled through open resourcing. See Annex C and D

6.8 Leave reserves
Leave reserves are allocated based on the following principle;

To calculate the total number of annual leave reserves required, whether they
be full or part time, the ratio will be 1:7 of the total number of colleagues,
(including the Crown Manager(s)), with break points at 11, 18 and 25 which
will bring in 2, 3,or 4 reserves respectively;

A calculator for the precise reserve provision for individual office reserves is at
Annex E.

The above assumes that the reserve(s) is attached to only one Crown Office,
although reserves can be pooled where geographically sensible. In such

cases the provision of reserves should be calculated on the basis of a 1:6 ratio,
which would be intended to cover for both unforeseen and foreseen absence.
However it is not the intention to introduce such an arrangement where the
Business would incur significant travelling costs.

Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

6.9 Redeployment of surplus colleagues

Occasionally it may be necessary to move colleagues permanently from
one office to another. One possible example is that one office could have
supernumerary hours, whereas a nearby office has a vacancy. If this, or any
other reason applies, then it can sometimes be difficult to decide which
colleague should be the one to move. The following procedure has been
agreed in order to introduce fairness and consistency into the decision
making process.

Step 1
The Crown Manager to talk to affected colleagues, outline the reasons for the
move, and seek to develop a solution acceptable to all;

Step 2
Seek a volunteer — if there is more than one volunteer then the choice should
be made on cost grounds;

Step 3

If there is no volunteer, then the Crown Manager will need to consult the
CAM who will make the decision based on the best mix of personal and cost
factors, seeking input from the HR Business Partner as necessary. The cheapest
option does not necessarily have to be chosen where the difference in cost is
minimal and there are more compelling personal factors to be taken

into account.

Step 4

An individual who does not agree with the decision to be compulsory
transferred will be entitled to a formal appeal, with CWU TCR representation,
to the next line manager who must be of a higher grade then the manager
making the original decision. The manager hearing the appeal will consider
the reasons for compulsory transfer, which must be clear, take account of
personal circumstances and consider viable alternative options presented by
the individual making the appeal.

When a colleague is moved compulsorily they will receive the payment
of excess fares and retain their terms and conditions on a mark time basis.
Because of this, there is a cost element to the decision, although equally
it is important that the individual requirements of affected colleagues are
established and considered.
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

6.10 Casual/agency staff

The primary objective is to deliver excellent customer service through the
resourcing of Crown Offices with directly employed colleagues, including the
use of reserves. Resourcing requirements should be foreseen and planned
for. Any short to medium term resourcing requirements should, in the first
instance, be resolved by regular staffing methods i.e.

» use of surplus staff from offices within a reasonable travelling distance
use of the flexible attendance system

part time colleagues being given the opportunity to increase contracted
hours up to and including full time

» use of overtime
use of temporary contract staff, e.g. specific event contract.

Casual /agency staff must only be used once all other methods of staffing
have been exhausted.

6.11 Duty construction
Where appropriate national programmes of duty revisions will be jointly
conducted and be subject to separate agreements.

The principles and process for business as usual duty revisions, presenting
them to the CWU and obtaining agreement, is as follows:

6.11.1 All duty revision consultation will take place within the principles and
procedures laid down in the Industrial Relations Framework Agreement and
the Procedural Agreement Framework.

6.11.2 Atall times both parties must be driven by the objective of seeking to
reach agreement which best serves the interests of the business and
its colleagues.

6.11.3 Itis in the interests of good business that both parties are kept up to
date and well informed and this will require a sharing and exchanging of all
information relevant to any duty revisions.

——
17
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

6.11.4 Formal proposals put forward by either party must be given serious
consideration by the other. They should never be rejected out of hand but
in all cases where they are not acceptable a formal reasoned response must
be given.

6.11.5 There will be full and comprehensive discussions with a commitment
to staff offices to provide excellent customer service, with no preconditions or
preconceptions by either party outwith this agreement.

6.11.6 There must be a determination to reach agreement in local discussions.
Disagreements will not be registered until all avenues of resolution at local
level have been fully and genuinely explored.

6.11.7 The manager involved in local discussions must be fully empowered
to negotiate, be free to make decisions, and where necessary agree
changes to proposals with the overriding objective of reaching agreement
wherever possible.

6.11.8 Duty revisions should not be introduced by executive action until
the procedures outlined in the Procedural Agreement Framework have
been exhausted.

6.11.9 All duties will be constructed on the basis of being MUTE compliant.

6.11.10 Business as usual duty revisions will be required for a number of
reasons, such as:

new business is acquired
existing business is lost

there are regular quality of service failures necessitating the realignment of
staffing to customer traffic

there is a change to opening hours.

impacts of authorised Family Friendly applications
» full time colleagues moving to part time working (or vice versa)
» job share arrangements

retirement impact on duties
Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

6.11.11 Duties will not be constructed on the basis of Crown Office Managers
working on the counter or performing back office work that is appropriate
to CSCs.

6.11.12. Itis agreed that full information will accompany Duty Revision
proposals, including the data listed below.

» Operating Model Outputs
® Mystery Shopper data from the EFFECT programme

» service and efficiency team report/audit

» WTMS 20 week print out (where available)

» Customer Management Data (where available)

» comprehensive existing duties (line charts, rotations etc.)
contractual status of all employees (including contracted hours)
current/new opening hours of the office
balance of staff (for 13 week period)

» Meeter & Greeter usage including number of hours

» details of hours banked and rest days changed under the Flexible
Attendance System in the previous 3 months;

analysis of overtime worked by individuals for the same period
» proposed duties (fully completed line charts)

6.11.13 The above information will be provided along with a short covering
note explaining the reasons why changes are necessary and giving reasoned
arguments to support the proposed duties.

6.11.14 Duties will be constructed fully taking into account the components
contained in the Staffing Arrangements Model at Annex B.

6.11.15 When the Service and Efficiency Team visit a Crown Office as a
preliminary to the drawing up of new duty proposals then the appropriate
CWU representative, in the spirit of ensuring access to all relevant information,
will be given advance notice of the visit and will be afforded the opportunity
to attend the office at that time.

——

Cwuo00000094
cwuo00000094

6.11.16 In order to gain support for any changes in duty arrangements and to
enable them to get a better understanding of the workings of the office, it is
agreed that an essential part of consultation with the CWU involves allowing
time and access for the CWU representative to visit the Crown Office and seek
the views of the colleagues on any duty proposals.

6.11.17 Duty proposals should be processed as speedily as possible. To
facilitate this all the information listed at xii above will be presented in a
standardised form and associated with the initial proposal.

6.11.18 CWU representatives will need to study the information provided,
consult with colleagues, and if necessary, draw up counter proposals, prior to
beginning local discussions with the manager. Planning and timescales will
allow for this.

6.11.19 Timescales will be a matter for consultation and not imposition taking
into account the facility time available for CWU representatives, the number of
ongoing duty revisions, the size of the office and the availability for meetings
of the relevant manager. However, the timescales must always be driven

by the need for prompt resolution with overall objective of completing the
process for reaching local agreement (Procedural Agreement Framework
paragraph 4) within 14 working days and any unreasonable delays will be
unacceptable.

6.11.20 Itis expected that the principles and processes within this agreement
are adhered to and that as a result disagreements will be exceptional.
However, should they occur they will be dealt with through the procedures
for resolving local disagreements contained within paragraph 5 of the
Procedural Framework Agreement.
