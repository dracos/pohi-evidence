Has there been any feedback from the defence solicitors with regards to their recent request on the following
3 points and also in relation to the transaction log printing.

As a result of the meeting that took place between Charles
McLachlan and Gareth Jenkins as directed by the judge, we now need
to have:-

- access to the system in the Midlands where it appears there are
live, reproducible errors. :
- access to the operations at Chesterfield to understand how
reconciliation and transaction corrections are dealt with.

- access to the system change requests, known error log and new
release documentation to understand what problems have had to be
fixed.
