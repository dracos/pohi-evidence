What is the
               issue?




Discrepancies showing at the Horizon counter disappear when the branch follows certain process steps, but will still show within the back end branch
account. This is currently impacting circa 40 Branches since migration onto Horizon Online, with an overall cash value of circa £20k loss. This issue will
only occur if a branch cancels the completion of the trading period, but within the same session continues to roll into a new balance period.

At this time we have not communicated with branches affected and we do not believe they are exploiting this bug intentionally

The.problem occurs as part of the process when moving discrepancies on the Horizon System into Local Suspense.


When Discrepancies are found during Stock Unit rollover into a new Transaction Period, then the User is asked if the discrepancy should be moved to
Local Suspense. if the branch presses cancel at this point the Discrepancy is zeroed on the Horizon; System.

    Note at this point nothing into feeds POLSAP an Credence, so in affect the POLSAP and Credence shows the discrepancy whereas the Horizon
           in the branch doesn't. So the branch will ien believe they have balanced.
system




If at the next screen the rollover is completely can d, then no harm is done. However if the Rollover is re-attempted at this point, the rollover will
continue without any discrepancy meaning Horizo doesn't Match POLSAP or Credence
This has the following consequences:
         There will be a Receipts and Payment mism    h corresponding to the value of Discrepancies that were "lost"
a




Note the Branch will not get a prompt from the             to say there is Receipts and Payment mismatch, therefore the branch will believe they have
balanced correctly..


         When the Branch begins the new Branch Trading period the discrepancies will show at Zero, however the Receipts and Payment mismatch will carry
         over into the next period.


LMRA t

• The branch has appeared to have balanced, whereas in fact they could have a loss or a gain.
• Our accounting systems will be out of sync with what is recorded at the branch
• If widely known could cause a loss of confidence in the Horizon System by branches
• Potential impact upon ongoing legal cases where branches are disputing the integrity of Horizon` Data
• It could provide branches ammunition to b(ame'Horizon for future discrepancies

 The Receipts and Payment mismatch will result an error code being generated which will allow Fujitsu to isolate branches affected this by this
 problem, although this is not seen by the branches. We have asked Fujitsu why it has taken so long to react to and escalate an issue which began in
 May. They will provide feedback in due course.

 Fujitsu are writing a code fix which stop the discrepancy disappearing from Horizon in the future. They are aiming to deliver this into test week
 commencing 4th October. With live proving at the model office week commencing 11th October. With full roll out to the network completed by the 21St of
 October. We have explored moving this forward and this is the earliest it can be released into live'

 The code fix will on stop the issue occurring in the future, but it will not fix any current mismatch!at branch.

Proposal for affected Branches

There are three potential solutions to apply to the mpacted branches, the groups recommendation is that solution two should be progressed.

SOLUTION ONE - Alter the Horizon Branch figure it the counter to show the discrepancy. Fujitsu w' ould have to manually write an entry value to the
local branch account,
IMPACT - When the branch comes to complete ns <t Trading Period they would have a discrepancy, which they would have to bring to account.
RISK- This has significant data integrity concerns nd could lead to questions of "tampering" with the branch system and could generate questions
around how the discrepancy was caused. This soli .ion could have moral implications of Post Office, changing branch data without informing the branch.

SOLUTION TWO - P&BA will journal values from ie discrepancy account into the Customer Account and recover/refund via normal processes. This will
need to be supported by an approved POL comm lication. Unlike the branch "POLSAP" remains balance albeit with an account (discrepancies) that



                                                                                                    in
should be cleared.
IMPACT - Post Office will be required to explain th reason for a debt recovery/ refund even though there is no discrepancy at the branch.
RISK - Could potentially highlight to branches that -lorizon can lose data.

SOLUTION THREE - It is decided not to correct th data in the branches (ie Post Office would prefer to write off the "lost"
IMPACT- Post office must absorb circa £20K loss
RISK - Huge moral implications to the integrity of he business, as there are agents that were potentially due a cash gain on their system
