The son of the late Peter Walker, who was MP for Worcester for 31 years, Robin Walker had
something of a homecoming when he won back his father’s old seat from Labour after 13
years in 2010

He set up his own business after leaving university, joined the Finsbury public relations
company in 2003 and rose to be a partner for a year before his election.
PPS to Elizabeth Truss MP, Sec of State Environment, Food & Rural Affairs

@ Engaged with Post Office nationally and locally, very supportive.

e During the 2013 Debate he said:

Mr Robin Walker (Worcester) (Con): I welcome the Minister’s statement,
particularly the commitment from the Post Office to improve aspects of its
support and training for sub-postmasters. I recently visited St Johns post office
in Worcester, which is an enthusiastic early adopter of the network
transformation programme. Will she join me in celebrating the fact that the
Government are investing in the post office network, rather than running a
closure programme, as the last Government did?

Campaigner for financial inclusion and financial services reform; campaigning for reform of
the business rates regime.
