Dear All

Hi, my comments are on the attached. With apologies for the urgency, I would be really grateful if SG members could
come back with comments including a clear ‘agree/disagree’ for first thing Monday as we need to brief Paula on this
before confirming the position with Andy.

For the record, while I have various questions about the details I agree with the recommendation.

Have a good weekend, all

Tom

All

Please find attached an urgent decision paper on which I should be grateful for your comments. We need a decision by
12noon on Monday (so that we can action this before Freeths are able to submit their own proposal on this subject).

I hope the attached is self-explanatory but if you have any questions, please do feel free to call or email me.

Kind regards
Andy
