Dear Mr Withers
Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme (the Scheme)

Thank you for your letter of 7th May 2015 to Mr Wechsler about the value of
mediation.

The Post Office remains committed to providing you with an opportunity to discuss
the issues raised in your case and Post Office’s investigation at mediation with the
aim of resolving your complaint.

Post Office is willing to discuss the issues which form the basis of your complaint and
believes that you may find some benefit from this conversation. However, Post Office
feels that on the basis of the evidence and investigations that it would not be
appropriate to offer any form of financial settlement and, in the interests of
transparency, wanted to make you aware of that before entering into a mediation.

Whether you decide to enter into mediation is entirely your choice but Post Office
remains willing to do so.

Please advise CEDR whether you wish to proceed to mediation.

Yours sincerely

Angela Van Den Bogerd
Head of Partnerships
