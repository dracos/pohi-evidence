WITNESS STATEMENT OF TORSTEIN OLAV GODESETH

I, Torstein Olav Godeseth of Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 8SN WILL SAY

as follows:

1. I am employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (Fujitsu) as Chief Architect on the
Post Office Account.

2. I am authorised to make this statement on behalf of Post Office Limited (Post

Office), the Defendant in these proceedings, in relation to the Horizon Issues trial
listed for March 2019.

3. The facts set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, or if they are

outside my knowledge, I have explained the source of my information or belief.

4. In this statement I refer to copy documents attached and marked Exhibit TOG1
BACKGROUND
5. I graduated from Oxford University in 1974 with a degree in Natural Sciences

(Physics). I worked for Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd from August 1974 until December
1976 as a Combustion Engineer before joining the Royal Navy as an Instructor
Officer in January 1977 on a Short Service Commission. In my final role in the
Royal Navy I started my career in IT working in systems programming. After
leaving the Royal Navy I joined Forward Trust Ltd in November 1981 to work in

E2/1/1
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

systems programming and technical support for their IT systems. I joined the Post
Office IT department in November 1987 to work on a project to introduce

technology into Post Office branches.

I worked with Post Office as a technical advisor when they, together with the
Benefits Agency, procured the Horizon system. I then worked with Post Office
Limited as a technical advisor when Banking was introduced before being
outsourced from the then Royal Mail IT department to Xansa in 2003 and
contracted to Post Office to act as a technical advisor interfacing to Fujitsu and
other suppliers providing IT services. I worked as an independent contractor to
Post Office from 2005 until 2010, acting as a technical advisor on IT projects
including the change of the Horizon system from Legacy Horizon to Horizon
Online. I then worked as an independent contractor for Fujitsu Services for 6
months in 2010 before joining Fujitsu Services as an employee in November
2010

As Chief Architect I am responsible for ensuring that any changes made to the
Horizon system are implemented without prejudicing the continued operation of
the system. I work with architects and others in the technical community to agree
the appropriate approach for making any changes. A current Fujitsu organisation
chart in relation to the Post Office Account is at {POL-0440075}. As described
below, Horizon is a large system and therefore it is not possible for one person to
have a complete understanding of all corners of the system. I therefore have
consulted with colleagues who work in the areas that are covered by this
statement to ensure that my understanding of them is correct.

I understand from Post Office's solicitors that Post Office has given disclosure of
technical documents about Horizon which describe the architecture of Horizon in
detail, that the Claimants have only provided a high-level outline of their
allegations against Horizon and that the Court has indicated that factual evidence
for the Horizon Issues trial should be limited. Against this background, this
statement provides a simplified overview of Horizon and addresses points that
may (pending a full explanation of the Claimant's allegations) be relevant to the
Horizon Issues to the extent that those points are not covered by the disclosed
technical documents.

9. The following areas are covered in this statement:-

9.1 An overview of Horizon.

9.2 A description of the controls in place to ensure the accuracy of transaction data.

93 A description of Post Office's and/or Fujitsu's ability to remotely "access"
transaction data recorded by Horizon.

9.4 Commentary on the Claimants’ allegations that Post Office and/or Fujitsu
remotely inserted, injected, edited or deleted transaction data.

10. In this statement, I use the following defined terms:

10.1 "Horizon" means both Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online, as explained below
and unless specified otherwise.

10.2 "Transaction data" means the record of transactions entered by branch staff on
Horizon.

11. Where I say below that something is or is not possible within Horizon, I am
describing my understanding of the functionality of the system as designed and
implemented. It is of course possible that an error in the system or misuse by a
system user could cause something unexpected to happen or for the system to
be re-designed to do practically anything. This is the nature of all IT systems.
Save where I expressly say so, I am not including these theoretical possibilities
when commenting below. I understand that the audit processes that Horizon is
subject to will be described in the witness statement of my colleague, Bill
Membery.

HORIZON OVERVIEW

12. Horizon is the core operational and Electronic Point of Sales platform for the Post
Office network. Fujitsu began work on a pilot of the system in 1996 and it was
rolled out across the Post Office network between 1999 and 2000.

13. In 2010 there was a migration from the system commonly referred to as "Legacy

Horizon" to an online version ("HNG-X" or "Horizon Online"). This was the
biggest overhaul in the Horizon infrastructure that I can recall, although there
have been continuous and iterative updates to the system over its life.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

The key difference between Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online is the way in
which data is stored. In Legacy Horizon, transaction data was stored locally on
terminals in a branch and then replicated to the main data centres, usually several
times a day. In Horizon Online, transaction data is recorded in real-time to the
data centres’.

Given that Horizon has constantly evolved and changed since its roll out in 1999,
it would be a very arduous (perhaps even impossible) exercise to describe the
system on every date it has been in operation. My comments below are about
Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online in general and are accurate to the best of my
recollection, recognising that this is a complex subject matter that has changed
over an 18 year period.

Horizon's core requirement is to record the customer transactions and other
accounting actions entered into by branch staff and then copy that information to
Post Office and other organisations that need that information. The principal

recipient is Post Office, but other recipients are, for example, Post Office's clients.
In simple terms, Horizon works as follows:

Auser logs on to a counter in a branch using a unique user ID and password.
The counter is much like any other personal computer with a keyboard for user
input. The counter has a touchscreen and other peripherals such as a barcode
scanner and a magnetic swipe reader. A PIN pad is connected to support
banking and payment transactions.

There are only, and have only ever been, four sources of transactions that make
up transaction data:

(a) The vast majority of transactions are manually entered by a user in
branch at the counter, by pressing icons on the touchscreen, keying in
the transaction on the keyboard, scanning a barcode, scanning a
magnetic card or some other manual interaction with the system.

These are referred to as "counter transactions".

(b) Transaction Corrections (TCs) are described in {POL-0440080}. As I
understand it, they are produced when Post Office compares the data
entered into Horizon by branches with data generated from other
sources in order to identify any discrepancies. TCs are sent to the

' HNG-X is being replaced by HNG-A. There is no functional difference between the two:
HNG-A refers to an implementation of the same counter code as is used in HNG-X to run
on a Windows 10 device (whereas HNG-X counters are NT4 devices).

branch via Horizon? from Post Office and then accepted by a user in
branch. Before TCs, a similar process existed called "Error Notices".
These were sent to the branch in paper form and then manually
entered into Horizon by a user in branch. Either way, it has always
been a feature of Horizon that TCs and Error Notices required branch
user input before they formed part of the branch's transaction records,

(c) Equipment located in a branch other than a Horizon terminal is
required for some transactions, such as a Camelot terminal for lottery
products and a Paystation terminal for some bill payments. These
pieces of equipment communicate information direct to a client or other
supplier, who relay that information to Post Office (or Fujitsu on Post
Office's behalf), who then send a Transaction Acknowledgement (TA)
to the branch via Horizon. A user in branch then needs to accept the
TA on Horizon before it forms part of the branch's transaction data.
TCs (formerly Error Notices) and TAs are known as "non-counter
transactions" because the data does not directly originate from an
interaction between Subpostmaster and customer at the counter ina
branch.

(d) In Horizon Online it is possible for Fujitsu to insert a Balancing
Transaction ~ see paragraph 58 below. In Legacy Horizon it was
possible to inject transactions into branch accounts - see paragraph
58.10 below. In both cases such transactions would be clearly
identifiable in the reports that can be obtained from Horizon in

branches.
17.3 The transaction data is then communicated to the central data centres.
17.4 From there:

(a) One copy of the data is placed into secure storage, known as the Audit

Store.

(b) Other copies (or parts thereof) are replicated to a variety of other
systems, both inside and outside the Post Office's IT estate.

? TCs are incepted in Post Office's POLSAP system before being communicated to
Horizon, via TPS to the BRDB.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

As can be seen from the above, all transaction data comes from, or is confirmed,
by users in branch other than balancing transactions or their equivalent in Legacy
Horizon. When transaction data is aggregated together, it is often referred to (in
business speak) as the “branch accounts". In technical terms, the branch
accounts are the product of a database query being run on the transaction data.
For example, if a branch wishes to know how much cash it should be holding,
Horizon adds up all the positive and negative cash movements shown in the
transaction data since the branch last balanced and produces an aggregated

number to the user.

Due to the different ways that Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online transfer and
store data, I address them separately below when dealing with integrity of data

being transferred through Horizon.

ACCURACY OF TRANSACTION DATA - HORIZON ONLINE

20.

21.

22.

23.

The master record of transactions entered in branch is often called “audit data".

The audit data collection and storage facilities within Horizon Online are
described in the Audit Data Collection & Storage High Level Design document
{POL-0440078/9}. As explained in that document:

"It is essential that the Audit System can both maintain the integrity of data under
its management and subsequently be able to prove that integrity if and when the
data is retrieved for analysis."

The core audit process is described in {POL-0440068}. This process is designed
to ensure that transaction data inputted into Horizon in branch is communicated
from the branch and stored in the Audit Store in a way that ensures the accuracy
and completeness of that data.

When I use the phrase "accuracy" I mean that the data input in branch is faithfully
replicated through the communication and storage process. I do not mean that
the data accurately reflects the real transaction conducted over the counter
between customer and branch staff. Put another way, if a member of branch staff
inputs the wrong transaction on a Horizon terminal, the core audit process
ensures that there is an accurate record of that inaccurate input. Save in limited
circumstances, Horizon cannot know that the user has input incorrect data at the

point when the transaction is undertaken.

POL00000682

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

A high level summary of the core audit process is as follows:

The transactions conducted on Horizon terminals in branches are bundled into

virtual baskets (i.e. one basket of transactions per customer session).

Each basket is transferred over the network to the Branch Database (BRDB).
The BRDB is hosted on a central server farm operated by Fujitsu (there is more
than one BRDB server for resilience, and a set of gateway servers collectively
termed the Branch Access Layer (BAL) are also used). The BRDB holds a live,

but temporary, version of the transaction data used in day to day operations.

The basket is then transferred from the BRDB to the Audit Store via the Audit
Server. The Audit Store is not involved in the live operation of a branch or Post

Office's business; it is the long term repository of audit data.

I note that the above description focuses on transaction data but the Audit Store
will also contain some auditable event data (e.g. log on to a terminal and moving
cash in and out of a branch).

There are a number of controls in place to protect the integrity of transaction data

within Horizon (i.e. from the counter to the Audit Store):
In relation to counter transactions:

(a) A basket must balance to zero, meaning that the value of payments
taken / given by the branch from / to the customer equals the value of
goods and services entered on Horizon. If the basket does not
balance to zero, Horizon will reject the basket and it will not form part
of the transaction data used to provide the branch's accounts i.e. not
part of the core audit process. This control ensures that all
transactions in the basket are recorded.

(b) A digital signature is calculated for the basket using a private key
generated as part of the logon process and held at the counter. The
counter also generates a public key which is returned to the BAL at
logon so the BAL is able to confirm the source of all baskets it receives

as coming from logged-on counters.

> There will be a record kept of the rejected basket in other Horizon logs (for example the
counter log) but it will not form part of the core audit process

(e)

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

Baskets must be atomically written, meaning that the whole basket is
written to the BRDB or it completely fails to write the basket. This is a

control ensures that there can be no partial baskets.

Each basket is given a unique Journal Sequence Number (JSN) of 1
greater than the previous basket so that the completeness (density) of
the baskets from a particular counter in a branch can be checked.
There is always a risk that when transmitting data over a network
information may be lost. JSNs are the main control built into Horizon
against this risk. If a basket were to go missing, there would then be a
missing JSN.*

Baskets are signed by a digital signature, which in accordance with
commonly adopted cryptography techniques, is used to secure the
integrity of transaction data once it has been initiated at the counter
and allows the basket to be checked for subsequent interference once
they have left the counter. This is a control against the risk of a basket
being changed during transmission in such a way that it still "balances
to zero" and has a contiguous JSN. In this scenario, the digital
signature would be broken revealing that the content of the basket had

been changed.

26.2 Non-counter transactions:

(a)

(b)

(c)

4 JSNs run continuously, but as data other than baskets of transactions are
communicated from terminal to the BRDB the JSNs in respect of baskets of transactions

TCs are presented to the branch for action ensuring that branch staff
are aware of any impact on the branch accounts and must be accepted
by branch staff before impacting the branch accounts.

Other non-counter transactions must be accepted into the BRDB by
branch staff by way of a TA in order to affect the branch accounts
(branch staff can obtain reports from the Camelot, Paystation and
formerly Post & Go terminals and compare those reports to the TAs
that they are asked to check that it is the same).

Any processing of TCs or TAs are subject to JSN fingerprinting (i.e. the
basket in which the TA or TC is accepted is subject to JSN
fingerprinting) and signed by a digital signature.

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

All auditable messages (including transaction data and auditable event data) are
written to a single table within the BRDB known as the “Message Log”. Each day
the previous day's Message Log is passed to the Audit Store’ which then “seals”
each file and stores them until they are retrieved (if they ever are) or deleted in
line with the applicable retention period. This seals are cryptographically
generated. Any subsequent change to the contents would invalidate the relevant
seal. The seals are held in a seals database separate from the audit data. A
feature of the Audit Store is that data cannot be amended or deleted until the pre-
defined "Purge Date”, which by default is set to 7 years.

The Audit Store could be seen as the "master record" of the transaction data input
in branch. It is designed to provide long-term, highly secure, storage of data in
the event that any challenge to the data is raised. Save for it being a repository of
data, the Audit Store is not used in live daily operations by Subpostmasters or
Post Office. A copy of the transaction data in the BRDB or in another system is

used for day to day operations.

Post Office (its staff or its systems) does not have direct access to the Audit
Store. Post Office may request data from the Audit Store via a process known as
the "ARQ process" which requires manual intervention by Fujitsu staff to extract
Audit Store data. The components that are used to provide audit data retrieval
facilities are described in the Audit Data Retrieval High Level Design document
{POL-0440079}.

When audit data is extracted a number of completeness and integrity checks are

carried out automatically as a matter of course including:

each entire audit file that contains data for the branch and period in question is

checked to ensure that the digital seal described in paragraph 27 is valid;

the data for the branch in question is then filtered out from these audit files and
checks are then carried out on a counter by counter basis as described below for
the period of the extract:

(a) acheck to ensure that there are no missing or duplicate JSNs is
carried out and the result of the check is recorded on the sheet labelled
"Summary" in the standard ARQ report provided to Post Office. A
template ARQ report which has been populated with dummy data can
be found at {POL-0440087};

© it is at this point that Horizon checks for missing or duplicate JSNs and reports any
discrepancies.

(b) the Log on Message is checked and the digital signature generated by
the BAL is checked by using the BAL’s public key (which is known to
the audit system), which shows that this message was signed by an
application which had access to the BAL’s private key. This then
provides access to the counter’s public key for that log on session (as
this is included by the message audited by the BAL and was signed by
the BAL’s private key); and

(c) All subsequent messages sent from the counter to the BAL during that
log on session are then checked to ensure that their digital signatures
are correct (using the Counter’s Public Key obtained from the Log On
message).

30.3. The extracted data is then provided to Post Office, usually in the form of an excel

spreadsheet as this is the most user-friendly format.

31. I have been informed by my colleague Jason Muir (Operational Security Manager
in Security Operations Team) that the number of ARQs issued since the 2014/15
financial year is as follows (1 ARQ = 1 month of an individual branch data, so one

Post Office request for data could have multiple ARQs):°
31.1. FY 2014/15 = 729;
31.2 FY 2015/16 = 103;
31.3 FY 2016/17 = 323; and
31.4 FY 2017/18 = 364.

32. I am not aware of any instances where data retrieved from the Audit Store differs
from other sources of data, nor am I aware of any instances where the integrity

checks described in paragraph 30 have revealed any issues.

33. As far as I am aware the above core audit process has always been used in
Horizon Online. I am not aware of any bug, error or defect in Horizon Online that

would cause the core audit process not to be effective.

® These figures do not include the ARQs that Fujitsu has issued in relation to these
proceedings.

AUDIT DATA - LEGACY HORIZON

34,

35.

36.

37.

38.

In Legacy Horizon Riposte, a messaging system, was responsible for storing all
data in Post Office branches and replicating it to data centres. As I was on "the
other side of the fence" when Riposte was in use I have consulted with my former
colleague Gareth Jenkins to prepare this section of my statement. Gareth worked
for Fujitsu from 1996 until his retirement in 2015 and his initial role was in the

integration of Riposte.

All counter data was held in a bespoke message store (which was part of the
Riposte product supplied by Escher Inc.). This data was replicated within each
branch to ail counter positions and from each branch to the data centres where it
was held in the correspondence server message stores. Similarly, any data
inserted into the message store at the data centre (for example reference data or
authorisations for banking transactions) would be replicated back to the branch
counters. Selected data was then extracted from the correspondence servers to

update Post Office's back end systems.

Users with sufficient access permissions could inject additional messages (i.e.
data) at the correspondence server. Any additional messages injected at the
correspondence server by users with sufficient access permissions included
information including the identity of the user. That information would not be
visible in the standard audit extracts, but it would be visible in a detailed
examination of the raw audit data. Further, the node ID (see paragraph 38.2
below) associated with the injected message would have been that of the
correspondence server at which the message had been injected and not a normal

counter node ID and that would have been clearly visible in any audit data.

All accounting at the counter was carried out based on the data held in the
message store. The Riposte product managed the message store and it did not
allow any message to be updated or deleted, although it did allow for data to be
archived once it had reached a sufficient age (this varied by message type and
also over time; it was never less than 34 days and by 2009 it was effectively 80+
days).

I understand from Gareth that each message included three key pieces of

information which together provided a unique identification for each message:

Group ID: this was the 6 digit FAD Code of the branch with which the message

was associated.

43,

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

Node ID: this indicated the counter position at which the message was originally
written for messages generated at the counter or the correspondence server
identifier for messages generated at the data centre. Counter node IDs were
between 1 and 31” and correspondence server node !Ds were between 32 and
63.

Message ID: a unique number for each group ID / node ID. This number starts at
1 for the first message written at that node and increased by 1 for each
subsequent message, which allowed checks to be made that no messages were
missing as that would result in gaps in the sequence of message IDs (the concept

of JSNs used in Horizon Online was based on this).

I also understand from Gareth that messages also had an associated “Expiry
Date” which denoted how many days after a message was first written that it
could be deleted. An archive process ran on each counter and correspondence
server at around 3am which deleted all messages that were past their Expiry

Date, thus ensuring that the message store did not continue to grow indefinitely.

Each message also had an associated "CRC", which was basically a checksum
that was included to ensure that the message had not become accidently

corrupted.

I understand from Gareth that due to the size of the Post Office Network,
branches were split into four separate clusters and each cluster included four
correspondence servers (two in each data centre), thus ensuring that there were
therefore four copies of an individual branch's data held in the data centres.

An audit application was run on the correspondence servers to take an audit copy
of all data visible to that correspondence server. The audit application was run on
one correspondence server on each cluster in each data centre. This means that
there were two independent audit trails for each branch. When retrieving the data

only one audit trail was used.

I understand from Gareth that the audit application read every record that was
visible to that correspondence server (i.e. all data in that cluster) and wrote a text
copy of that data to a text file. Each audit application wrote data to 10 text files
(based on one of the digits in the FAD Code). When the text file got to a certain
size it was closed and a new file created for that text stream. The file included a
hash value of the file contents to ensure that should it be accidentally corrupted,

” Counter 31 indicated an exchangeable Hard Disk held in a single counter office as a
back-up mechanism for the data as there was no other counter to replicate data to. No
data should have been recorded as originating from node 31.

then this would be detected. At around 1am each day the file was swapped to
ensure that data associated with a given day was in discrete files.

I also understand from Gareth that once these files had been written they became
visible to the audit server which would pick them up, seal them and store them
until they were retrieved or deleted in line with the applicable document retention

period.

If the audit trail was retrieved, then similar checks to those carried out on Horizon
Online were made automatically and in the normal course of business by the

audit retrieval toolset namely:-

each entire audit file was checked to ensure that the digital seal stored at the time
the audit was produced (i.e. the day after the transactions took place) was valid;

the data for the branch in question was then filtered out from the audit files and
checks would then be carried out on a counter by counter basis for the period of

the extract as follows:

(a) acheck to ensure that there were no missing or duplicate message IDs
for each counter / correspondence server would be carried out and the
standard audit extracts into Excel included a report indicating that this

check had been successfully carried out; and
(b) the CRC was recalculated and confirmed as correct for the message.

As far as I am aware the above core audit process was always used in Legacy
Horizon. I am not aware of any bug, error or defect in Legacy Horizon that would

have caused the core audit process not to be effective.

REMOTE ACCESS TO TRANSACTION DATA - POST OFFICE

47.

48.

I understand "access" to mean read only access to data stored in Horizon. I
understand "remote" access to mean a user, using valid system credentials,
directly accessing data stored in Horizon by means other than physically
interacting with a terminal in branch.

Post Office can look at copies of transaction data recorded by Horizon in read
only (i.e. they cannot modify the data) because that data is replicated to a variety
of Post Office systems. Legacy Horizon fed copies of transaction data into a Post
Office system called POL MI. Horizon Online feeds copies of transaction data to
a variety of Post Office systems. I understand that the main system that would be
used by Post Office to view transaction data extracted from Horizon is Credence,

but Post Office can also access summarised data received from Horizon in

near real time view of some data as it is captured in the BRDB.

Save as described in this statement, Post Office employees do not have the
ability to insert or inject new transaction data into Horizon, or edit or delete

transaction data stored in Horizon.

As explained in paragraph 17.2(b), Post Office can / could send TCs, Error
Notices and TAs to a branch via Horizon but this does not involve Post Office
directly injecting, inserting, editing or deleting data.

Post Office employees can visit a branch and log on to a terminal using Global

User rights ~ described below in paragraphs 53 to 56.

I am informed by Post Office's solicitors that the Claimants have asserted that
Post Office and/or Fujitsu can insert, inject, edit or delete transaction data by way

of:

“global branches" (with branch codes such as 999998 and 999999), which would
enable the input of transactions within Horizon as though it had come from an

actual Branch" ®

Global branches (which relate to Horizon Online only) are physical branches with
Horizon terminals which are used solely for support purposes. Only users with a
role of ADMIN or ENGINEER can log on at a Global branch. Transaction data or
other data in branch accounts cannot be inserted, injected, edited or deleted by

someone logged into a global branch but not physically present in a branch.

Branch 999999 is located in Chesterfield and is used by Post Office. Branch
999998 is in Stevenage and is used by Fujitsu. My colleague Sandie Bothick
(Service Delivery Manager for Major Account Control and Operational Business
Change Teams) has confirmed that the only use of Branch 999998 is to support
Post Office when they are having difficulties in re-setting a password.

® I am aware that these SAP systems have changed in recent years and therefore the
detailed interfaces from Horizon to Post Office ‘Back Office’ systems have changed and
continue to change.

Global users are a category of users that can log on at any branch (with the
exception of users with a role of ADMIN who can only log on at Global branches).
Their username starts with an asterisk to differentiate them from other users. A
number of employees of Post Office have, and as far as I am aware, have had
Global User accounts since they were introduced as part of Horizon Online. I
understand that Post Office uses these accounts to assist with certain branch

operations such as opening / closing branches, training and audits.

The Horizon architecture in relation to global users is described in document
ARC/SOL/ARC/0006 (a copy of which is at {POL-0440076}). There are different
types of global users:-

MIGRATE - used to open new branches, setting the branch state from "New" to

"Open"
AUDITOR - may view users and stock units etc. but not carry out transactions;
AUDITOR E - used by emergency managers to run branches;

ENGINEER - have the test capabilities that are required to perform branch
maintenance and diagnostics; and

SETUP - used for mobile / relief managers.

A global user can carry out transactions in the same way as an ordinary branch
user as allowed by their allocated role. However, a Global User can only log on
to a branch terminal and conduct transactions by being physically present in a
branch. I would not consider this to be a form of "remote" access to (or remote
inserting, injecting, editing or deleting of) transaction data.

Transactions carried out by global users in branches will be shown in the branch
transaction log (that can be accessed by branch staff) against the user ID
associated with the global user and therefore any transactions by a global user

are distinguishable from other branch users.

INSERTING, INJECTING EDITING OR DELETING TRANSACTION DATA — FUJITSU

87.

I address below the allegations raised by the Claimants about Fujitsu inserting,
injecting, editing or deleting’? transaction data. Save as described in this
statement, I am not aware of any other way that Fujitsu could (theoretically) edit

or delete transaction data. I should make clear that this is all largely hypothetical

*° When I refer to deleting transaction data, I do not mean the final deletion of data once it
has passed its set retention period.

- other than the one occurrence of a Balancing Transaction (described below), I
am not aware of Fujitsu ever having edited or deleted transaction data.

Balancing Transactions (BTs)

A small group of Fujitsu users from the Software Support Centre (SSC) (30 users)
have the ability to inject additional transactions into a branch's accounts in
Horizon Online, using a designed piece of functionality called a Balancing
Transaction.

BTs are conducted using the branch transactional correction tool’’. The tool is
described in section 5.2.2 of the document {POL-0219310} and the Host BRDB
Transaction Correction Too! Low Level Design document {POL-0032866}.

BTs do not require acceptance through the Horizon terminal by branch users
unlike TCs and TAs.

BTs are clearly visible in the transaction reports that are available to
Subpostmasters via Horizon as they are stated to have been carried out on
counter number 99."

As far as I am aware there has only been one usage of the tool (i.e. one BT has

been inserted into a branch's accounts).

The TFS" helpdesk ticket relating to this BT (TFS ticket 2091569) {POL-
0440066} was raised by Anthony Vasse of the Horizon Service Desk on 4 March
2010 and transferred to Cheryl Card (Fujitsu SSC Product Specialist). The ticket
states that the clerk had incorrectly doubled a transfer of stock of £4,000 to
£8,000, creating a shortfall of £4000 in the branch accounts. The issue required a
resolution by 17 March 2010 because the branch was due to roll into the next

trading period on that date.

The ticket was updated by Cheryl Card on 11 March 2010 to confirm that the
issue had been resolved by inserting transactions into the
BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION and BRDB_RX_EPOSS_TRANSACTIONS tables to
reverse the incorrect £4000 charge. The ticket confirmed that the Subpostmaster
had been advised to print a balance snapshot of the accounts before and after the
BT took place to ensure the transaction had been reversed correctly. A

" This has nothing to do with TCs despite it being similarly named.

* Counter 99 would indicate that there were 99 serving positions in a branch, which no
branch has, which is why this is readily identifiable.

'’ TFS is the legacy system used by Post Office where branch incidents are recorded.

subsequent update was provided confirming that the issue had been resolved and
the ticket was closed on 5 May 2010.

The Peak Incident ticket raised in relation to the BT (PC0195561) was raised by
Anthony Vasse on 4 March 2010 {POL-0365465}.

An Operational Control Procedure ticket (25882) {POL-0440067} was also raised
which is the solution management system used by Fujitsu which tracks issues
and resolutions. This shows that the BT was approved by Emma Langfield of Post
Office on 10 March 2010 at 15:33. The ticket was raised by Cheryl Card, who
subsequently performed the work and inserted the balancing transaction.

In Legacy Horizon, any transactions injected by SSC would have used the
computer server address as the counter position which would be a number
greater than 32, so it would be clear that a transaction had been injected in this

way.
Privileged Users

Alimited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel (1 am advised by Jason Muir in
the Security Operations team that there are currently 19 at the operating system
layer and 26 at the database layer) who have access privileges that could be
used to edit or delete transaction data in the BRDB in Horizon Online (Privileged
Users). From the outset, I should make clear that this is only a theoretical
possibility (which would require the circumvention of the controls described

above):

(a) Fujitsu has no policy, process, procedure or operational practice that
calls for it to use its privileged access to edit or delete transaction data.

(b) As far as I am aware, Fujitsu has never used its privileged access to

edit or delete transaction data

Privileged User access is required for system maintenance purposes, such as
updating database records to implement change and planned system updates.
Horizon has functionality to resolve the significant majority of imaginable
operational errors in branch or technical errors in Horizon in the form of TCs and
BTs. There is therefore little need to use privileged access to manipulate
transaction data to resolve an error (BTs in particular are a deliberately
engineered process to support the exceptional corrective processing). However,
Privileged Users are still needed because there may be a need to make updates
or changes to the core software that underpins Horizon. In my experience, the
Privileged Users on Horizon have the same role as one would expect to see on

any IT system. I would not consider them to be part of the functionality of Horizon
but a fundamental building block that comes with any IT system built on

databases to ensure unforeseen events can be addressed if necessary.

Hypothetical changes to a branch's transaction data in the BRDB by Privileged
Users would be visible to branch staff. The amended transaction would show up
in transaction reports that can be produced in branch, although it would not be
flagged as a change by a Privileged User. However, Privileged Users can't
change the audit record and so the changed record in the BRDB would now show

up when compared with the audit extract.

Since July 2015 all access and actions carried out by Privileged Users are
recorded to an Oracle audit table. The audit table records information including:

(a) user ID;
(b) action; and
(c) date and time of the action.

While a Privileged User could alter the audit table, the alteration of entries is
recorded. This means that if an entry was removed, for example, the fact of the
removal would be visible. If the audit table was removed, the database would
stop working. All of these would flag improper activity.

Prior to July 2015 the log on and log off activities by Privileged Users were
audited. The process was for a Managed Service Change (MSC)"* document to
be signed off and for the log on and log off records to be attached to the MSC.

The reason for the change in July 2015 was that the BRDB was upgraded to a

newer version of Oracle and we took the opportunity to make the change then.
The Transaction Information Processing Repair Tool

Fujitsu has provided information in relation to this tool in response to Jason
Coyne's Request for Further Information 7.4 (Exhibit TOG1 pages 1 to 2). {C5/21/32}, {C5/21/33}

The tool is described in the document that Fujitsu referred Mr Coyne to in
response to RFI 7.4 (DES/APP/HLD/0020 Branch Database High Level Design)
{POL-0219310}. It can only be used on data that has failed to be delivered
between the Branch Database and the TPS system because it is missing a key

attribute (i.e. one that is mandatory in the output files produced by TPS for Post

** MSCs replaced Operational Control Procedures.

Office back end systems) . This data is quarantined within the TPS system until
the Transaction Repair tool corrects it. The correction is made on the TPS

database and cannot directly affect the branch accounts in the Branch Database.

The tool was part of the TPS system which was moved, with limited functionality
changes, from Legacy Horizon to Horizon Online and is still available in Horizon
Online. In Legacy Horizon the tool could only be used on data that has failed to
be delivered between Horizon locally and the TPS system.

As far as I am aware there are no other ways in which Fujitsu can implement fixes
in Horizon that had the potential to affect transaction data or data in branch
accounts or rebuild branch transaction data.
