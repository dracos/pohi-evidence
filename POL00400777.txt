1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 PURPOSE

This document details the Service Level Targets (SLTs) contracted to by Fujitsu Services in relation to the agreed service levels as
described in Schedule 15 of The Agreement. Furthermore this document identifies those service levels targets which have an
associated Liquidated Damage Threshold and/or Additional Remedy Level.

1.2 SCOPE

The scope of these SLTs is limited to those Service Levels described in Schedule 15 in relation to the Horizon Services and any
other Service Levels which may be introduced via the Contract Change Procedure from time to time.

1.3. CONTRACTUAL PRECEDENCE
The description in the service requirement column is in abbreviated form and is for identification purposes only.

In the event of conflict or inconsistency, Schedule 15 shall have contractual precedence over the table in section 2 of this
document in respect of the description in the service requirement column and the column indicating a related LDT and or ARL.

In respect of the service level descriptions in this document, the actual Service Level Targets shall always be as stated in the
service level target column in section 2 of the latest authorised version of this document as recorded in the CCD entitled “Contract
Controlled and Referenced Document” (BP/SPE/026).

1.4 OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the SLTs is to assure the overall performance of the Horizon Services as they impact upon the business at
post office Branches and the services provided to clients of Post Office Ltd.

1.5 PERFORMANCE MONITORING

Document Date: 05/12/02 Document Type: ccD
Version: 1.0 Ref. Number: SRP/MTG/007

Unless stated otherwise in the table in section 2 of this document, performance against these SLTs will be regularly monitored by
Fujitsu Services and reported monthly to Post Office Ltd in the service review book as described in Schedule 19 of The Agreement.

1.6 SERVICE LEVEL TARGET MAINTENANCE
For the avoidance of doubt, any changes to the SLTs stated in this document may be agreed through the Soft Change Control

Procedure. Changes to the actual service requirement must be agreed through the Hard Change Control Procedure as these
service requirements are detailed within Schedule 15 of the Agreement.
