Audit of West Byfleet Post Office® branch, Branch Code

126023

Section 1 - Introduction

An audit of the above branch, led by myself, was undertaken on
Monday 14 January 2008. The purpose of this audit was to verify
financial assets due to the Post Office® and confirm compliance
with a range of Business processes, procedures and regulatory

requirements.

Section 2 provides a management summary, including the financial

audit result.

Section 3 details a breakdown of the result of the financial audit.

Appendix A details the areas of non-compliance to regulatory
matters and Appendix B details areas of non-conformance
identified during tests of selected policy and procedures. Both

POL00058550
POL00058550
appendices include the actions agreed with during the closing
meeting.

Section 2 - Management Summary

The financial audit revealed a current trading position of £ 77643.87
short, subject to a reconciliation of some figures (undertaken after
the audit). A breakdown of this figure, including any pending
transaction corrections or losses being settled centrally, can be
found in section 3.

Due to findings revealed at audit, and a decision taken by the
Contracts Advisor to temporary suspend you from your role as
subpostmaster pending further enquiries, compliance testing was
not carried out on this visit, therefore there are no appendices
attached.
