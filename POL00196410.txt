I did send a copy of me email to Jo Swinson, whom I have been in contact with over subpostmaster
issues since she was appointed. I have also met with her two predecessors, Ed Davey and Norman
Lamb over this issue.

James Arbuthnot MP for North East Hampshire has been acting as Chairman of the group of MPs.
who have subpostmaster issues in their constituencies, and I am sure he or his PA Janet Walker
would be able to inform you of the latest developments.

Dear Mr Mosely, I am writing to you on behalf of one of your constituents who is lying critically ill in
the neurology department of Fazakerley hospital.

Martin is a subpostmaster who I understand has been in contact with you in the past regarding his
problems with Post Office. Yesterday he tried to take his life because of these problems and the
pressure Post Office had put on him the other day. I don’t know if you are aware, but his doctor has
been treating him for depression and his family have been trying to support him throughout.

I am Chairman of the Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) and yesterday afternoon I received
the email shown below from his mother-in-law. You will find included in the text of an email I sent
shortly afterwards. I wanted to make you aware of what Post Office has driven him to.

Please do not hesitate to contact me o! [ GRO you want to discuss this further.

Regards
Alan Bates

Subject: POST OFFICE READ THIS

This afternoon I received the following email, it is a prime example of the thuggery being exerted on
defenceless subpostmasters (as POL deny legal representation) by arrogant and uncontrolled Post
Office personnel. Despite assurances from on high that this type of thing is in the past, it is clear
from POL’s actions, it is still alive and active through the ranks.

Hello Alan

1am writing on behalf of my son-in-law Martin Griffiths who has recently been in touch with you
about the treatment doled out to him by the hierarchy at the crown office in Chester. He had an
armed raid in May, and the faceless wonders at the crown office have intimated he was culpable.
Had him at the Kangaroo court where he was not allowed any representation of his own, he was a

broken man then.

However, he was sent for last Friday to attend a meeting with the crown post office personnel again,
and all week-end he has clearly not been himself.

This morning he drove off to work, got out of his car and walked in front of a bus.
He is dangerously ill in Hospital at Liverpool, the post office had driven him to suicide.
All the family are at the hospital, I am alone waiting by the phone for further news of him.

! would urge you to publicise this, another incident that has been caused by the Bully Boys at the
crown office.

May God forgive them.

1am aware of Martin’s case, and I know he was terrified to raise his shortages with POL because of
just this type of thing happening to him, but POL got him in the end. Regardless of what may or may
not have occurred with him, why did POL have to hound him to the point of trying to take his own
life? Why?

Despite numerous warnings of never to attend any discussion with POL without legal representation,
Martin, trying to be helpful, didn’t take anyone with him as per the conditions POL demand. If POL
cannot control their personnel, then the very least they can do is authorise and insist ona
subpostmaster taking legal representation with them to any meeting with POL.

1am very, very angry about this, and as per the wishes of the family I will be contacting many of the
media contacts we have built up over the years.
