Nick ,

I could not download the report over the weekend and nor could fv . I received it this morning .

Just to warn you I thought it was a dreadful report - legalistic and uncommercial .
The references to S413 CA 2006 ( Advances to Directors from what I can remember ) ; the signing of the Rem
forms , IAS 24 ( Related Party Transactions ) ; not declaring conflicts of interest ete are just a few examples .

EJ says there had been no contact whatsoever with him on this matter . I asked BF to pursue that in the first
instance and I do not see any real progress .

It will be difficult to express these views with Tracy but I wanted you to know how unimpressed I was with the
Investigation report . They did not do much " investigating it seems to me .
