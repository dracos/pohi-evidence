How about

Thank you for your letter. I have no objection at all to you forwarding this letter or indeed my letter of April 11.

I do appreciate and share your concerns. I am determined, as you know, to ensure that all the cases brought to our attention are
investigated. The Post Office is absolutely committed to this as a business which believes in treating all those with whom we deal
with fairness and honesty.

It may be helpful if I set out the position as it stands (which is a source of some frustration for me).

We have not yet received a report on any individual case from SS, nor has a generic report been received by the working group. This
is disappointing, though we recognise the constraints under which SS are operating.

You may also be aware that the JFSA has written to the minister expressing some concerns over the Scheme. We were surprised and
disappointed by this intervention, which seems out of kilter with the approach we are taking, on which of course JFSA are at the
heart.

I will be responding to the minister in detail on the points raised by the JFSA.

Iam as keen as you are to bring this matter to a close as soon as possible. I am equally committed to considering all the cases
brought to our attention (though I would stress they represent a tiny monitory of all those who use the Horizon system).

In relation to a meeting, I would be happy to ensure your office receives a regular update on potential for a further update, though I
suspect it will not be until the Autumn. If we are able to adjust this timetable we will do all we can to do so.
