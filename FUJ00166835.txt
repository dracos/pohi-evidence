Andrew,

The zip “KELVersions” is now in Hi Q, in the folder “Fujitsu — KELS”. Do not confuse it with the zip “KELComplete”
which was uploaded in March 2018.

14,365 KEL versions have been extracted with Status as follows (see reminder of KEL lifecycle below)

Authorised 6489
Deactivated 1721
Deprecated 6155

Total files in the extract: 14,331 files. This is reduced because the duplicated data is not included (see anomalies
below)

Anomalies

Latest version status
As a reminder the KEL lifecycle is:

KEL Status Explanation

Authorised The current version authorised for usage by the support teams
Deprecated A previous version (that has been updated)

Deactivated Version that has been identified as no longer relevant

On the basis of the KEL lifecycle, you would expect to see the last version of a KEL in this extract to show a status of
Authorised or Deactivated and all previous versions as Deprecated. Unfortunately this is not the case because the KEL
status is not held with each version of the KEL. It is just held as a property of the KEL as an entity. Hence, you may see
the last version of some KELs in this extract as status Deprecated, this is due to there being a new version created
after the 13-Dec-2018 cut off. There are 314 of these.

KELs without a complete version history

There are 1036 KELs without a complete history. Migrated KELs (when we moved from HORIZON Legacy to HORIZON
Online, HNG-X) did not transfer the version history. We only kept the current version of the KEL during the migration.

Some KELs (both Horizon and HNG-X) do not have a full history. We believe this is due to a housekeeping procedure
that was run for an indeterminate time which deleted KEL versions for KELs which had more than 3 versions on the
database.

Duplicates
There are 34 duplicates in the old Horizon KELs. These are a likely to be due to a defect in the KEL system. Since they
represent duplicated data we have not investigated the anomaly further.

Thanks. Please can Fujitsu extract all KELs (of all types and all versions) that existed as at 13 December 2018. This
will result in extracting again KELs already extracted (which is fine because we can de-dupe at our end) and all past
versions. We do not want to extract any new KEL created, or any version of a KEL created, after the above date.

We believe that 13 December 2018 was the date the extraction was last run. Please can you confirm this is correct
before proceeding.
It is really important that this extraction is done accurately because it is likely to be subject to close scrutiny by the
Claimants / Court. If you are at all unclear as to the scope of what is required, please contact us.

issues that may cause the extraction to miss or over capture KELs.

Kind regards

’m unsure where the financial aspects have got in the FJ - POL commercial process, I’ll defer to Pete / Matthew on
that one. Having said that, I now have internal approval to complete the work regardless, once WBD ask us to start
the extract.

In stating earlier that “Given clearance now, we’d have the information to you tomorrow lunchtime” I had forgotten it
was Friday! In mitigation, this is just my second day back from leave. That statement should have been: Given
clearance now, we’d have the information to you lunchtime the following working day.

While I still don’t have the internal confirmation of funding to do this activity I can say that the elapsed time to
produce the data for you would be 1 MD. Is that enough information for now?

Please can you confirm as a matter of urgency (this morning) how long you believe it will take to extract the KELs?
We are expecting questions from the Claimants / the Court about this and need to be prepared to answer them
immediately.

Further to the below and our discussion yesterday, I understand that to extract the previous versions of the current or
deprecated KELS as HTML files it would be necessary to produce a new script. Please could Fujitsu proceed with
producing this script, but not run the script until we provide further confirmation to do so?

If you could let me know and ETA for this script being ready it would be much appreciated.
Many thanks

FUJ00166835

This part: “[t]he KEL only contains the current database entries” ~ I’m not completely clear what that is intended to
mean, but it may be clarified by the following:

This is correct: “is constantly updated and so the current version will not necessarily reflect the version that was in
place at the relevant time”

The second sentence is not correct: “The previous entries / versions of the current entries are no longer available".
You may recall that there are three status categories of KEL: current, deprecated and deleted. For those that are
current or deprecated, they have been updated in such a way that previous content is not permanently overwritten,
but instead a new version is created, with the previous versions being retained and accessible. For those that have
been deleted, only the last version at the point of deletion has been retained.

Matthew,

Post Office is seeking to quote from its Electronic Documents Questionnaire submitted back in 2017. It is seeking to
rely on the following quote in relation to KELs:

"[t]he KEL only contains the current database entries and is constantly updated and so the current version will not
necessarily reflect the version that was in place at the relevant time. The previous entries / versions of the current
entries are no longer available".

Can you confirm that this is definitely the correct position (i.e. that previous entries are no longer available)? We need
to respond to Freeths by 10am tomorrow, so confirmation ASAP would be appreciated.

Kind regards,

Lucy
