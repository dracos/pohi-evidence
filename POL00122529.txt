Andy,

As discussed I have drafted some notes following my recent meeting with Martin Smith. However the italics relate to
procedural points I want us to consider. These notes may aid discussion tomorrow. I will endeavour to be there as
soon as I can following the SLT meeting in the morning.

Regards

Rob
