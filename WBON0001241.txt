Jane, Rod

Please find attached the revised protocol, both a clean copy and a comparison document showing changes from
UKGI's last version and the attached clean version.

We've made three further changes:

I think the S of S should be a party to Appendix B. If we are intending to provide information direct to a BEIS' lawyer
(as opposed to via UKGI) then BEIS should sign up to these confidentiality arrangements as well.

Reinstated para 8 â€” "privileged information on a case by case basis"

Added 1.7(c) to make clear that UKGI cannot disclose privileged information under FOI. In my mind this is the greatest
risk, so we should call it out expressly.

Kind regards
Andy
