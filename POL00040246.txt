Dear all,

Thank you for the comments so far. Attached are the three segments of the response. Numbers 1 and 3 you have seen
previously and the remaining sections (5, 10 — 13) are attached in number 2.

Please can you come back to me with any comments in relation to those sections (and any others) as soon as possible,
and if possible before the end of today. This is so that we can finalise the response before the end of Wednesday. If you
do have any difficulties providing a response please let me know.

Below is a table where I have received cornments or a nil response to each part so that I can ensure we have not missed
anyone's comments. Could you please either provide comment or alternatively just confirm that you have a nil response
for any parts not commented on to date.

Thank you again in advance.

Dear all,

Further to Belinda's email please find attached the first part of the working draft of the response to the Second Sight Part 2
Report.

We have segmented the response into sections to correspond with SS's Report. The draft to sections 14 - 22 are
attached. Sections 4 — 13 will follow shortly. At this stage it is possible that POL may submit only the relevant sections of
the response to applicants according to the issues raised within their cases. In addition, we will submit a covering
note/letter highlighting our general concerns about the Report (such as the lack of evidence to support the thematic issues
and speculation on issues outside of the scope of their instructions and expertise). There are certain parts of the report
where we have asked for more detail about the processes and procedures and I would be grateful if those details could be
provided.

Please can you respond with comments on any relevant sections. If do not have any comments please just confirm it is a
nil response. We will collate the responses and circulate final draft before submission.

If it would be easier to discuss any issues please feel free to call.
Best regards
Andy

Subject: Second Sight Part Two

Hi all,

I think I have now spoken to most of you and very many thanks for your assistance with this. I attach, again for some of
you, a copy of the Second Sight Part Two report. We will need to get a response out on this next week and Andy
Parsons is holding the pen. Although we have a lot of the information we need, we still have some gaps and I think the
easiest way to deal with this is to have a core team of experts from the business who can fill the gaps and also clear the
final document. I hope it will not be too onerous, indeed we do not have time for it to be.

lalso hope I’ve got every area covered but we will soon find out if not. Those of you that already provided some
information for me, I can confirm that I have passed that on to Andy.

The aim is not to produce a critique of the report but a document which would stand alone but which deals with the
themes and sets out the facts related to each one, making sure we address each point. I just wanted to join everyone
up to get us started. Andy will pick it up from here.

Best wishes and thanks again

Belinda

Belinda Crowe
