Tom,

’ve now read it. Judge is critical of both parties, but already sense he is not well disposed to us - the word “aggressive” is
used a couple of times in connection with us, in relation to the inadmissible evidence claim, and the treatment of an
SPM. The tone of his comments on the comments at the end, on the Common Issues trial, and the puported objection
on our part for PR reasons, is definitely not helpful. I’ve asked for an update on whether this ruling and its tone, suggests
any change of tack.

Best

Tim

Have you seen the judgement from the other day? It’s worth a read.
