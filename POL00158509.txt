Jennifer - email extracts re subpostmaster debts below.

The spreadsheet I think adds up to £1m. I wondered how this linked to the £7m or so in FSA? And whether there are
any individual offices in that debt list where there may be significant counterclaims (eg. loss of future earnings where they
claim it was wrongful dismissal)?

Clare indicated that you would have the detail on individual offices.
She also referred to a renegotiation of the Horizon contract to provide better EPOS information on transactions such as

would more flexi rt our case in disputes with agents. Are you aware of and involved in that?
Thanks, Rodi”

I attach a list of postal litigation cases, mainly the collection of debts from ex subpostmasters. The report provided
details of claimed and awarded amounts as well as details of contingencies, compensation paid, stopped & cancelled
cheques, external costs & XSP invoices paid. We are looking at rationalising dealing with these cases, and are
discussing this with the Debt Recovery team. There are just over 400 cases at present.

I hope that this is useful. Do telephone me if you need anything further. I shall be in London in meetings tomorrow, but
you can reach me via my mobile,

Regards

Clare
