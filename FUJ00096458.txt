1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

April saw similar volumes of Major Incidents as in March affecting both Horizon and HNG. Vast progress has been made to
deliver the required fixes into live to address the underlying root causes. A tremendous effort has gone into the event
management service improvement to improve proactivity and ultimately reduce the length or avoid service outages. Service
Delivery ensures best practice is followed across the various service towers and processes and lessons leamed are key to
improve the service. Despite the number of Major Incidents, the majority of SLT were met. Where we have failed SLT the
root cause is understood and corrective actions are in place to address those and are shared with POL Service Delivery.

During April the HNGx rollout programme was still suspended and a number of HNG service impacting incidents were
experienced. The on-going root cause analysis and subsequent corrective actions for the BAL/BDB issues are being reported
on a daily basis by our Problem Manager as part of the Red Alert. Daily progress reports have been made available to both
POL Service and Programme.

Within the Fujitsu Services domain there were 7 Major Incidents and a further 6 service affecting incidents. Outside the
Fujitsu domain there were no service affecting incidents. One Incident affected a VIP site. Major Incident Reports were
produced with the exception of the root cause for the BAL/BDB issue (daily Red Alert update).

The Service Delivery Assurance corrective actions are actively being managed and weekly reviews are taking place between
Fujitsu and POL Service stakeholders. From the 34 identified actions, 26 have been completed or are on track for
completion, with 8 outstanding actions being actively pursued to completion.

HSD received a total of 16,041 calls which is a volume decrease of 3,565 from last month. Call volumes were slightly higher
than average over the past year, notably for software calls as a result of the Major Incidents experienced in April. The HSD
made 1,772 proactive calls to the branches during quieter periods, and have also been contacting back around 20 HNGx
sites on a daily basis, which has received very good feedback from the Post Masters. This work will continue going forward
USAT score increased by 0.1 to 4.5 for April and the FTF is also above target at 91.35%. Various service improvements for
the service desk were progressed in April. The outputs from the service improvements were audited by POL Service and
favourable feedback was received.

April saw relatively low volumes of calls to Engineering. Performance was uniformly good for the majority of the month, with
the exception of the ISDN outage which impacted the comms to around a quarter of Portable Hosted Units (PHUs), meaning
that a large number of A priority calls were logged simultaneously in quite remote geographical areas. The nature of these
calls made it challenging to complete them all within SLT; although 15 were completed in time, the remainder had to be
carried over, which caused the majority of the month’s failure on the Base Unit SLTs. Despite these issues, the recovery
during the remainder of April saw our engineering service achieve 3 of the 8 A priority SLTs, improving on every Peripheral
target conformance from March. C priority conformance also improved on recent performance. Further LEAN activities are
underway to improve the MTBF and those are shared with POL Service Delivery on a weekly and monthly basis.

During April 1,437 network calls were completed by HSD, a 349 call increase over the previous month. 97.8% of these were
resolved within 4 hours against the 96.5% target and 98.5% were resolved within 6 hours against the 100% target. Work is
‘ongoing to provide additional focus to long term incidents as well as to ensure that all the correct diagnostic and on site
checks are performed at the earliest possible point of contact with the branch in order to reduce the overall age of these
complex incidents.

Branch and counter availability saw achievement above target at 99.70% and 99.60% respectively and an improvement on
March availability which also saw targets being exceeded

The data centre operations and reference data service saw all SLT achieved.

There were no Day J failures. 343 reconciliation incidents were cleared during April. This is 6 more than reported in March.
There were 212 priority incidents of which 196 were cleared within the 8 hour SLT. Of the remaining 131 incidents, 114 were
cleared within the 5 day SLT. This month sees both reconciliation SLT fail for the first time in 12 months. The reconciliation
team has been strengthened by an additional 2 team members. We expect the volumes to reduce significantly once the
BAL/BDB issues have been resolved.

2 Incident Overview
Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for April 2010 there were 7 Major Incidents and
associated failures. There were a further 6 service affecting incidents within the Fujitsu

domain.
There was 1 incident affecting VIP sites.
There were no further incidents outside of the Fujitsu domain.

Major Incident: Thursday 1° April. NWB transactions were timing out from 09:40 to 11:35 and the initial
investigations thought this to be SQL issues on the Oracle DB. Further investigations linked
this failure with the MI for the 31° call number 2189248 and the following NWB incident on
the 6th call number 2193667. All the 3 incidents are detailed on the MI 2189248 and are
attributed to Network congestion caused by 3 major factors:

1. The POLFS/SAP local file system back up schedule running during the business day by
design

2. Excesses ‘chatter’ as a consequence of the network design in which All VLANS were
trunked to all BladeFrame uplinks to enable any VLAN to be accessible to any physical
BladeFrame port

3. The firewall reaching the ‘configured’ limit of concurrent connections
These 3 issues have now been resolved.

Tuesday é April. There was failure overnight (Monday to Tuesday) of 1 Debit Card
Authorization Agent, and 1 DCM server, both were restarted. The Agents were re-homed at
02:00 OK. At 08:50 calls were received at the HSD with failing DC transactions.
Investigations showed instability across both Debit Card Authorization agents LPRPDEA001
and 002. NT support decided to reload both servers consecutively and the service was
restored at 09:56. During this period, the number of Debit Card transactions affected was,
10,349 with 2,492 timeouts. A Major Incident report has been generated under MI 2202081
and there were 3 Peaks associated and now complete, they are: PC0195709, PC0196169,
and PC0196336.

Tuesday 6" April. At the same time as the DC failure and to compound the issue there was
a failure of NWB transactions due to a Network Incident from 09:15 to 09:46. This was
identified and attributed to the incidents of the 31%, 1° and now the 6” and the cause was
due to the 3 main factors as listed in the above failure of the 1“. The transactions failing from
08:50 to 09:56 was, Horizon NWB 187,285 with 30,084 timeouts, HNGX NWB 12,322 with
2,722 timeouts and Debit Card 657 with 127 timeouts. NB. This incident has been treated as
a separate MI from the DC failure, but as stated above is linked to the NWB congestion and
covered under MI report 2189248.

Tuesday 6" April. Incident in the ISDN network mainly affecting PHUs which are DOD dial
on demand, incident started at the beginning of the day 08:00 and 119 branches logged
calls. The network team within RMGA, plus Core networks and C&W were fully investigating.
Fault continued into the next day and required the help of the C&W support team to assist in
locating the fault. The problem was due to an incorrect configuration table within the Wigan
Radius server. When the problem was identified a failover to the Bootle Radius server was
instigated into the “Live” service to replace the Wigan server. ISDN Network operational from
17:00 on the Tuesday. There was a total of 167 branches which logged calls for this incident
out of 685 ISDN connected sites. TFS call 2201256 refers.

Friday gt April. Several HNGX branches were phoning into the HSD with “Unable to contact
the Data Centre”. The incident occurred from 15:37 to 15:57. 49 branches logged calls.
Incident identified to the “Streams” being switched back on at 14:00 on BDB1, Streams was
switched off and service returned to normal. A P1 call raised with Oracle and details and logs
sent to Oracle for investigation. Call 2220375 refers. NB. At the time of this failure it was not
declared a MI but as further investigations showed that “Streams” was a contributory factor

and not the root cause, and this was the start of the Branch Data Base Hanging LCK Error,
an MI report was produced. The LCK Errors are still occurring. (This is being managed by
Problem Manager Jim Singh as part of the Red Alert). We have a P1 call with Oracle and we
have installed extra tracing on Oracle's advice to gather more evidence.

Wednesday 28" April. HNGX branches reporting “Unable to contact Data Centre” 104 calls
logged from 16:11 to 18:00. Major Incident report has been written and is awaiting internal
approval before distribution. Call 2287209 refers. NB. Forms part of the MI for the LCK
Errors.

Thursday 29" April. Re-occurrence of the above incident HNGX branches reporting
“Unable to contact Data Centre” 13 branches logged calls from 12:12 to 12:21. This incident
forms part of the MI report from the previous day. Call 2290796 refers and is linked to the MI
call 2287209. NB. Forms part of the MI for the LCK errors.

Other Thursday 4% April. Moneygram service appeared to be unavailable, investigations showed
incidents in that 1 of the Moneygram Web servers had a corrupt Agent Mapping file so 50% of
Fujitsu Moneygram calls were failing. Reload of the Web server and a re-load of the Agent mapping
Services file was required. Service outage from 11:47 and was successfully restored at 15:40 after the
domain: reload of the server and mapping file. Call 2195095 refers.

Friday gt April. Incident raised on the T&T Track & Trace service as Parcelforce not getting
all the T&T messages. Investigations showed that 2 of the T&T Agents were out of service
and had been since the 31° March and the 1* April. As the NPS only holds 3 days worth of
messages some will be lost. OCP was raised to restart the Agents 1 at 18:00 and the other
at 20:00. There are some 600,000+ messages waiting to be transferred once the Agents are
restarted. Call 2220784 refers.

Wednesday 14th April. There was a late surge of calls at the HSD from HNGX branches,
they had issues rolling over. The issue appeared to be unable to rollover a stock unit and this
was due to a lock from another counter, required re-boot and then the failing counter to
release the lock, there was timing and procedural issue here. As the calls started late and
ran past 18:00 when the HSD should normally close, we kept 3 agents available to take calls
up to 18:30, as we had 11 calls queuing. Only 8 calls logged to the incident and some calls
carried over to the next day. Call 2236908 refers.

Friday 16th April, A sudden influx of calls to the HSD at 16:45 from branches reporting
unable to contact the Data Centre. Calls lasted for about 10 minutes with up to 11 calls
waiting. Initial indications were that it was an IP Stream failure but a more detailed
investigation showed a BDB 2 issue regarding Lock Manager. This is the subject of a Peak
fix under morning Prayers. Call 2245774 refers and 6 branches logged calls. NB. See above
incident on Friday 9"" re LCK Error.

Wednesday 21st April, (Occurs every day since). Whenever Post Offices stop using their
counters (usually at end of day), we are being informed by the SMC, that alerts are being
generated by the ISDN failing sites in the tabletop report as being over threshold following
the generation of the “Ping” scripts.

Whilst investigations continued every morning during a Technical Bridge, it soon became
apparent that the supposed failing ISDN Sites were returning to service as soon as the PM
used their counters. In fact every day, the ‘failing sites’ were under the threshold by about
08.30 to 08.45 hrs each morning.

Investigations at the weekend proved that the ISDN connected branches were working fine
as they could all connect to the Data Centres. However this proved that the Data Centres
were unable to “Ping” outwards to the branches and therefore the ISDN reporting scripts
were wrong. Investigations continued and the root cause was due to a change made in the
CNIM s/w. This has subsequently been resolved on the HNGX ISDN routers under
OCP26695 but has yet to be applied to the Horizon estate, so the alerts still continue and are
monitored. Call 2267113 refers.

3 Business Continuity

3.1 Business Continuity Testing

A Business Continuity walkthrough of ‘Loss of STE04’ was completed on 15" April. The test report has been
distributed to Gary Blackburn and Andrew Harley.

3.2 Forthcoming Testing
Walkthroughs for the loss of BAL server and SAN switch are scheduled for 5” May.

3.3. Business Continuity Incidents and Issues

On Thursday 1* April a corrupt Moneygram mapping file caused 50% of the Post Office estate to be unable
to perform Moneygram transactions for the duration of the fault. There was insufficient evidence to identify
how the corruption occurred.

Also on Thursday 1 April NWB transaction timeouts were caused by an Oracle database issue that has
since been resolved by patches applied onto Live over the weekend of 3/4"

Tuesday 6” April saw instability across both debit card authorisation agents which was caused by a known
memory issue currently awaiting fix. The workaround consists of a daily reboot out of trading hours. Later on
that day there were NWB timeouts attributed to the late running of POLFS/ SAP backup schedules.

An ISDN issue was seen on Tuesday 6" April mainly affecting Dial on Demand PHUs. A configuration issue
in the Wigan Radius server was fixed to resolve the problem.

On the 9", 16", 28" and 29" April we saw further blips relating to HNG-X branches being unable to contact
the data centre. Fujitsu continue to work with Oracle to resolve the root cause and prevent further
occurrences.

See incidents in section 2 for further information.

5.2 Engineering Service

April saw relatively low volumes of calls to Engineering, a reduction of 26% from March, with no single cause for
the reduction. The reduction was evenly spread across all hardware types with the exception of PHUs and
Vans; as the PHU estate grows with the luggable to PHU programme, we anticipate a related proportional
increase in this type of call. Performance was uniformly good for the majority of the month, with the exception of
the ISDN outage which impacted communications to around a quarter of the PHU estate, meaning that a large
number of A priority BU calls were logged simultaneously in limited, quite remote geographical areas. The
nature of these calls made it challenging to complete them all within SLT; although 15 were completed in time,
the remainder had to be carried over, which caused the majority of the month's failure on the Base Unit SLTs.
There was also some confusion in Northern Ireland branches over which days were being taken for the Easter
weekend- different branches chose to take either Thursday and Friday, Friday and Monday, or Monday and
Tuesday. This potential difficulty was not recognised until UK Bank Holiday Monday, meaning that some SLTs
had expired. Despite these issues, thanks to consistent good performance for the rest of the month we achieved
3 of the 8 A priority SLTs, improving on every Peripheral target conformance from March. C priority
conformance also improved on recent performance.

Extended build times for Horizon base units continue due to additional immediates; however it has been
established that HNG-x base units take an average of 32 minutes to build, approximately twice as fast as
Horizon.

PHU 1.5

23 luggable units were converted to PHUs in April meaning that the number of PHUs in the estate at month end
stood at 391, leaving 62 luggable units to convert. There were 201 Branch Routers installed at existing PHU
sites throughout April meaning in total 343 have now successfully migrated to Branch Router.

The number of network calls logged in April saw a significant increase from those logged in March. This is due
to the ISDN outage on 7 April which resulted in approximately 25% of PHU branches logging a call with HSD.
Excluding these incidents the number of network calls logged in April saw a very small increase, and hardware
and software call volumes remained consistent despite the rise in the number of counters in the estate.

The work to replenish PHU sites’ emergency cable packs has completed and we have now re-stocked all sites
that were found to have no spares at all as a result of the Postmaster not informing HSD of emergency cable
use. We are continuing to ensure Postmasters are aware that they need to contact HSD if any of the cables
from their pack is used in order to maintain a quick resolution to issues that can be resolved over the phone by
the Postmaster rather than requiring an engineer visit.

We are introducing a dedicated team on the Horizon Service Desk looking into call trends and working to find
better resolutions. Part of the work they are carrying out will include looking into PHU builds/revisits and
engineer issues on-site. Once relevant data has been produced analysis work will take place to identify the area
of focus to improve the MTBF and reduce and counter down-time.

5.3 Branch Network Service / Central Network

5.3.1. Branch Network Service

During April 1437 network calls were completed by HSD, an increase of 349 calls over the previous month.
97.8% of these were resolved within 4 hours against the 96.5% target and 98.5% were resolved within 6 hours
against the 100% target. Work is ongoing to provide additional focus to long term incidents as well as to ensure
that all the correct diagnostic and on site checks are performed at the earliest possible point of contact with the

branch in order to reduce the overall age of these complex incidents.

5.3.2 Central Network Service

Fujitsu Central Network

There was a single Service Affecting fault within the Central Network in April. The failure was related to a Radius
Authentication failure in Wigan and affected 20% of the ISDN Estate, Calls were received from 167 Branches
between 5" April March between 11:25 and 7 April 17:15. Due to the nature of the incident a Major Incident
was Called and managed under TFS 2089529.

BT VSAT Service
During March there were no major network faults affecting the VSAT service.
Although there were no major issues reported in April

Cable and Wireless ISDN Service
During April there were no reported incidents within the Cable and Wireless domain.

BT/Core ISP ADSL Service
During April there were no issues affecting the central DSL or ADSL network.

Summary and Management Information
BT has continued to progress 21CN across the Branch Infrastructure which has not resulted in additional faults
being reported.

The RMGA network team are continuing to work closely with the project team to ensure seamless transition into
HNG-x. During April Orange and Vodafone WWAN services have been used in the Branch Estate. The network
team are also involved in validating and negotiating the decommissioning of service out of the Wigan and Bootle
data centres.

Project Acti

We are working with C&W, CSC and Post Office to deliver the upgraded circuits into the NDC and Sungard. The
C&W circuit installation has been completed @ Sungard, we have also completed the first phase of the circuit
installations @ NDC and hope to complete circuit installation by Mid June.

During April we have also been assisting the project team in the installation of the AEI Interim solution. This
work has involved a number of CNS teams including the NOSS and Core ISP. We have ensured that the
Service elements of the AEI Interim solution remain separate to HNG-x and have worked with Core delivery
units to install the completed Central Network Infrastructure components.

All Geller Tills have been removed from Post Offices.

5.6 Data Centre Operations Service / Data File Transfer

5.6.1 Day J Failures

There were no transactions failing Day J during April.

5.6.2 Reconciliation Service

343 reconciliation incidents were cleared during April. This is 6 more than reported in March.

There were 212 priority incidents of which 196 were cleared within the 8 hour SLT. Of the remaining 131
incidents, 114 were cleared within the 5 day SLT.

Reconciliation issues in April

At the beginning of April there were delays with the reversals of transactions completed at Horizon Branches.
This led to an increase in A priority calls and the root cause behind this increase is still being investigated.

Further delays in reversals being sent to the Fl caused 4,002 transaction exceptions for CardAccount. These
were all successful but late reversals. There were also problems for Link Interchange, where there were 273
State E23 transaction exceptions. 27 of these were failed reversals, needing manual reconciliation.

In the month of April there has been an increase in branches not rolling over their stock units within the 42 day
period. In particular, one problem branch has not rolled over their Stock Unit for over three weeks, which causes
hundreds of exceptions on a daily basis. This has been escalated but remains unresolved.

Further issues with Network Banking timeouts caused circa 62,000 transaction exceptions for CardAccount for
both Horizon and Horizon On Line. Development have written a script to bulk F99 the exceptions, requiring no
input from Post Office Ltd.

Throughout April there have been large numbers of TPS exceptions on the TPSC257 — POLFS Incomplete
Summaries report. This began on the reports produced on Monday 42" April and the root cause was
investigated. Until the fix is deployed to Live a workaround is in place to ensure that all held back files are
captured and sent to POLFS the following day.
