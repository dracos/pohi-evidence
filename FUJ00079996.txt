2.3.4.2 Branch and Counter Availability

2.3.

1 Branch Availability

The availability of a Branch is measured across the network of Branches where those
Branches are able to perform all Transactions and communicate with the HNG-X Central
Infrastructure. A Branch will be deemed unavailable if it is not able to perform all
Transactions (except during an agreed fallback condition as defined in section 2.3.4.2.5
(Table 3)) or communicate with the HNG-X Central Infrastructure. The Branch Availability
metric is defined as the number of Branch hours available as a proportion of the maximum
number of Branch hours available based upon the Post Office Core Day and the Post Office
Critical Period. The Branch Availability metric will be reported daily, one day in arrears.

2.3.4.2.2 Counter Availability

The availability of a Counter Position is measured across the network of Counter Positions
where those Counter Positions are able to perform all Transactions. A Counter Position will
be deemed to be unavailable (except during an agreed fallback condition as defined in section
2.3.4.2.5 (Table 3)) if it is not able to perform all Transactions, or communicate with the
HNG-X Central Infrastructure. The Counter Availability metric is defined as the number of
Counter Position hours available as a proportion of the maximum number of Counter Position
hours available based upon the Post Office Core Day and the Post Office Critical Period. The
Counter Availability metric will be reported daily, one day in arrears. Any liquidated
damages payable by Fujitsu Services in connection with the Counter Availability SLT shall

apply to periods after (and including) the first day of the first month following signature of
CCN1200.

2.3.4.2.3 Method

(a) The Branch Network Service will extract data from the Service Desk Incident
Management System to show all Hardware, Software and Branch Telecom
Infrastructure faults logged via the Service Desk on the previous Working Day, by the
Branch or Fujitsu Services, irrespective of whether or not they are open or closed at
the time of extraction.

(b) The Branch Network Service will match this data against the Fujitsu Services view of
the status of each Branch and Counter Position. This will establish if the Branch or
Counter Position experienced an outage during the Post Office Core Day and Post
Office Critical Period. Where an Incident remains open for more than one (1) day,
the total Downtime will be used to calculate the Branch and Counter Availability

SLTs.

(c) The total number of hours of Downtime is then calculated.

(d) Downtime will impact:

. Branch Availability - only where it is deemed that the whole Branch is
unavailable. i.e. an outage of four (4) hours would show four (4) hours of
Branch unavailability; and

. Counter Availability — only where it is deemed that all the Counter Positions in
the Branch are unavailable, i.e. a ten (10) Counter Position Branch with an
outage of 4 hours would show 10 x 4 hours equalling 40 hours Counter
unavailability.

2.3.4.2.4 Reporting

(a) For both Branch Availability and Counter Availability, Fujitsu Services will report
daily against both the Post Office Core Day and against the Post Office Critical
Period. Both Post Office and Fujitsu Services will periodically review the allocation
of the Post Office Critical Period and jointly agree to adjust this period, if necessary,
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

(b) Fujitsu Services will provide daily management information in respect of all Branches
and Counter Positions that are unavailable for whatever reason, even if caused by
factors outside of Fujitsu Services’ control, e.g. power outages and agreed SLT
exclusions, to assist Post Office in managing Branch expectations and to direct the
appropriate service management practices within Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will monitor the effect of MTBF changes across the
Branch Hardware and will periodically review the Branch and Counter Availability
SLTs and, if necessary, jointly agree new targets, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld.

2.3.4.2.5 Qualifications

(a) The availability of a Branch or Counter Position is defined by the ability to complete
all Transactions including those related to the operation of the system, (e.g. logging
on to the system). Where an adequate method of fallback can occur, (e.g. where a bar
code reader fails and information can be input via the screen or keyboard), such
failures are excluded from the calculations and do not count against availability.
Additionally, where a fault occurs on a peripheral which disables the Counter Position
in a single counter Branch, (e.g. the monitor), this will count against Branch
Availability in this type of Branch but will only count against Counter Availability in
a multi-counter Branch.

(b) The calculation is based upon Post Office staff being able to use 100% of the Counter
Positions 100% of the time.

(1) The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of calculating the liquidated
damages payable in respect of the Counter Availability SLT:

(a) Failure Event means an event or series of connected events which causes one or
more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network Wide
Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such Failure
Event until the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure process
which is set out in the Working Document entitled “Major Incident Process”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) (Incident Closure Process).

S

Liquidated Damages Amount means the amount specified in the column entitled

“Liquidated Damages payable per hour or part thereof in excess of Network and
Local Allowance per Counter position per calendar month” in Table 5 of section

2.3.4.2.7.

(c)

Counter Unavailability means, in respect of a Failure Event, either:

i. in respect of a Local Failure, the total obtained by adding together all
Individual Counter Unavailability Periods for all Counter Positions affected by

the Failure Event; or

ii. in respect of a Network Wide Failure, the Network Counter Unavailability
Period multiplied by the number of Counter Positions rendered Unavailable by

the Failure Event.
(d

Individual Counter Position Unavailability Period means the time for which an

individual Counter Position is Unavailable (rounded in accordance with the Local

Rounding Table set out below).

(e) Network Counter Position Unavailability Period means the time the affected
Counter Positions are Unavailable (rounded in accordance with the Network Wide

Rounding Table set out below).

(f) Monthly Allowance means the "Network and Local Allowance per Counter Position
per calendar month’ shown in column 4 of Table 5 (as amended from time to time
pursuant to section 2.3.4.2.7 (j)) multiplied by the average number of Counter
Positions in use during the relevant month. For the avoidance of doubt, at the end of
each calendar month, any unused Monthly Allowance shall expire and shall not be
rolled over into the next month.

Unavailable means, in respect of a Counter Position, that it is not able to perform all
Transactions, or communicate with the HNG-X Central Infrastructure (and that an
agreed fallback condition as defined in section 2.3.4.2.5 (Table 3) does not apply)
during a Post Office Core Day.

g.

(2) Subject to sections 2.3.4.2.7 (3) and (4) below, the liquidated damages for failure to
meet the Counter Availability SLT in a month shall be calculated by:

(a) adding together the Counter Unavailability in respect of each Failure Event that
occurred in the month (the date of occurrence being deemed for this purpose to be the
date on which the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident Closure
Process);

(b) deducting the Monthly Allowance from the total in (a); and
(c) multiplying the remainder by the Liquidated Damages Amount.

(3) For a Failure Event:

(a) the Incident Closure Process will require Post Office and Fujitsu Services to agree the
number of Branches and Counter Positions affected and the duration of the outage;

(b) if the value of the liquidated damages for a Failure Event which gives rise to a
Network Wide Failure would be in excess of £400,000 then:

(i) Fujitsu Services shall have the right to not count its Monthly Allowance towards
the Counter Unavailability in respect of such Failure Event if it so notifies Post
Office in writing. In such cases, the Monthly Allowance shall not be deducted
from the Counter Unavailability in respect of that Failure Event; and

(ii) only £400,000 shall be counted towards the liquidated damages payable for that
month in respect of that Failure Event.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, Unavailability is only counted once, so that for so long as
a Counter Position is rendered Unavailable by a Failure Event it shall not be counted
in calculating the number of Counter Positions affected by a second Failure Event.

(5) Liquidated damages will be reported, measured and agreed monthly and paid
quarterly in arrears.

(6) The Local Allowance element of the Monthly Allowance will be varied as follows:
