Yes. However, he is out of the country at the moment but I will revert on that point.

Belinda - just to check, are you also fixing the meeting with Tony Hooper? I think Paula was still keen to meet him too ideally before
the Board.

Give me a call if useful to discuss.

Thanks, Martin

Hi Paula, sorry for delay getting this to you.
This is just a rough sketch and is based on functional options. This needs to be overlaid with a process. We will work this up in
more detail today. An important part of that process, as you suggest, should be a fact-finding meeting between you and SS. I have

spoken to Theresa and will try to set up that meeting with $S today for early w/e 24th.

Iam also copying Chris. He has been in touch over the weekend and will want to see, and have the opportunity to comment on,
whatever goes to the Board.

Best wishes
Belinda

Thanks for this Mark. This will be a tough shout and I really appreciate the support and attention of everyone.
I haven't seen David's note - if I was copied, could someone pls resend, it will save me trawling through the inbox.

Looking at my diary, I am happy to clear it on 24/25 (other than Richard Callard and Alice) to meet with SS. It could be used to fact
find, which might also help reassure the Board.
