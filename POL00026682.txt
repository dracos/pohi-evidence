Thursday 9" January, 13:00 — 14:00

AH queried the following in the last (03/12/13) Working Group’s minutes and actions:

Point 5.1 - the wording did not quite reflect what had been discussed. The idea that AVDB and

SS should discuss the possibility of a generic statement was discussed but the wording suggests
that the report on each case should be generic which is not correct.

Point 8 - the wording did not reflect the discussion - it suggests the wording only required

tweaking whereas the discussion and subsequent decision was that the clause 4.9 of the ToRs
needed a total redraft.
