Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance

The Rt. Hon. Theresa May, MP 30¢ April 2019
Prime Minister

10 Downing Street

London

SW1A 2AA

Reference: Letter to Kelly Tolhurst MP, Minister for Postal Affairs Regarding the Judgment of the

‘ id i urt between Alan her: ffice Limited

Dear Prime Minister

Iam writing to you with regard to the enclosed copy of a letter that I have sent to Kelly Tolhurst
MP, the current Minister for Postal Affairs, as I have real concerns that the department is being
misguided over the legal position on this matter which it reflects in that department's letter to
Members of the House of Commons dated 18 March 2019 (enclosed).

I ask you to make a request of that department to seek the independent legal and IT expert advice
that I suggest in my letter to the Minister, which may lead to negating the need for continuing our
legal action against Post Office Limited. The content of that letter and its accompanying binder, a
copy of which I have also included for you, clearly demonstrates that a matter Post Office Limited
has been trying to dismiss and keep hidden for many years, is now, albeit slowly, heading towards
a conclusion which, with the attitude of the present Board of Post Office Limited, will leave the
Post Office network in tatters.

Over the years we have received significant cross-party support, which of recent has been on hold
because of the legal action. However, we are now beginning to emerge from the other side of this
action and the evidence that has been exposed in court about Post Office Limited and its Horizon
system, has been utterly damning, resulting in Parliamentary Questions already starting to be
asked.

I do appreciate that your time is valuable and the enclosed Judgments are lengthy, but I do hope
that you at least manage to read my letter to the Minister and can see why the current path we
have been forced to follow could eventually destroy a major British institution.
Sincerely

“Alan Bates
Chairman
