Dear Mr Bristow,

Thank you for your email of 8 October. I appreciate your bringing this matter to my attention, as I
was not aware of your predicament and am most concerned to hear what you say.

Thank you for letting me know of David Jones’ contact with you. I have been in contact with him and
1am ready to help in any way I can.

Should there by further developments I shall be in touch again, and I trust you will do likewise.
Yours sincerely,

James Arbuthnot
