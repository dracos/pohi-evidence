                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAN ROBERT HOLMES




I, JAN ROBERT HOLMES, will say as follows:




   1. I have been asked to provide a Rule 9 Witness Statement in regard to my

      involvement in the Cleveleys Post Office incident. The request also asked me to

      identify the individual in Pathway who became responsible for audit data

      extractions and associated witness statements after the responsibility passed

      from me in May 2000. Finally, the request asked for me to set out any matters

      that I would like to address to the questions posed by Mr Edward Henry KC

      during my hearing. I was also asked, at my hearing on 16tt' November 2022, to

      provide any further Witness Statements that I had produced while I was in post.

   2. I shall deal with Cleveleys first, the other Witness Statements next and the other

      matters at the end of this Statement.

                                                                                    WITNO4600200




   Cleveleys (August 2003 to August 2004)

3. My first involvement with Cleveleys was via an email from a Pathway colleague,

   Peter Sewell who worked in Security, asking if I would be able to take on the

   task. The email, dated 15th August 2003, included preliminary emails from Kevin

   Parker (POL) and Jim Cruise (POL) (Email from Peter Sewell to Jan Holmes re:

   Cleveleys, WITN04600201).

4. On 21st August 2003 I responded to Jim Cruise with our preliminary observations,

   including a statement of what we could do to help (Email from Jan Holmes to Jim

   Cruise re: Cleverleys â€” Horizon Equipment, WITN04600202).

5. Nothing further was heard until 6th February 2004 when we received a letter from

   Post Office Limited (POL) containing a copy of the Expert's report (Note: I do not

   have a record of this report). On 12th February 2004, following a discussion with

   Jim Cruise (POL), who was critical of the Expert's report and was looking to

   challenge it, I produced a review of the report for internal Fujitsu Services Post

   Office Account consumption (Note re: Pathway internal response to Expert's

   report, WITN04600203). This would form the basis of a more formal response to

   POL issued by Colin Lenton-Smith (Pathway Commercial and Financial Director),

   sent to Keith Baines (POL Contract Manager) on 20th February 2004 (Letter from

   Mr Colin Lenton-Smith to Mr Keith Baines re: Post Office Counters Ltd v Mrs

   Julie Wolstenholme, FUJO0121512       ). Keith Baines asked if he could share our

   response with the Expert, which we agreed to, but as can be seen it did not alter

   his opinion (Email from Jason Coyne to Weightman Vizards re: Post Office

   Limited v Mrs J Wolstenholme, FUJO0121535        ). A further response was

                                                                                     WITNO4600200




   produced by me for Fujitsu Services Post Office Account dated 12th March 2004

   (Note re: Response to The Expert's Reply to Fujitsu Services' Submission,

   WITN04600206) but my understanding is that this was not forwarded to the

   Expert as explained in the Jim Cruise email of 19th March 2004 (Email from Jan

   Holmes to Colin Lenton-Smith re: Cleveleys Update, FUJO0121571         ). Keith

   Baines was made aware of this.

6. Nothing more was heard until 6th April 2004 when Jim Cruise provided an update

   (Email from Jan Holmes to Colin Lenton-Smith re: Cleveleys PO Mrs J

   Wolstenholme, FUJO0121602       ) regarding POL's latest offer to the PM. Again, all

   went silent so I made my own enquiries with POL in June 2004 and was

   surprised to hear that Jim Cruise had taken early retirement and the case was

   being handled by Mandy Talbot (Email from Jan Holmes to Colin Lenton-Smith

   re: Cleveleys, FUJ00121637    ). Mandy was herself critical of the Expert's report.

7. A conference Call was held on 3rd August 2004 (Email from Jan Holmes to Keith

   Baines re: Actions post Conference Call - Cleveleys, FUJ00121686       ) involving

   POL, Pathway and Pathway's lawyers Masons where a series of actions were

   accepted by Pathway to provide information relevant to the forthcoming court

   case. On 4th August 2004 Keith Baines provided a POL statement as to how

   they, POL, assured themselves that Horizon was `Fit For Purpose' (Email from

   Keith Baines to Mandy Talbot re: Wolstenholme case, WITNO4600211 and Note

   re: How Post Office Confirmed that Horizon was fit-for-purpose, WITN04600212).

   I was not involved in the production of that document and it describes the `what'




                                    Page 3 of 10
                                                                                         WITNO4600200
                                                                                      WITNO4600200




   of POL's assurances about `Fit For Purpose'. I was not privy to the full extent of

   POL's actions so cannot comment on their efficacy.

8. On 11th August 2004 I received a draft Witness Statement from Suzanne

   Helliwell at Weightmans, which was based on a draft document sent to her by me

   that described the four levels of support offered by the Horizon solution (Draft

   Witness Statement of Jan Holmes for Post Office Counter Ltd v Mrs Julie

   Wolstenholme, WITN04600213) which I subsequently signed and returned

   (Email from Jan Holmes to David Barker re: Cleveleys WS - Final,

   WITN04600214) notifying Masons. I do not recall any conversations with POL

   regarding the production of this statement.

9. I attended court but was not required as POL had made an increased offer to the

   PM and she had dropped her case. My email to Bill Mitchell, the then Security

   Manager at Pathway on 16th August, effectively closed this down from my

   perspective (Email from Jan Holmes to William Mitchell re: Cleveleys,

   WITN04600215). I was not briefed as to my `witness role' which I assumed to be

   providing oral evidence in support of the written Witness Statement.

10.1 think it's fair to say that I was exasperated with POL and their handling of this

   issue, not Cleveleys per se but their handling of their Expert witness and their

   lack of communication, including a 3 year delay in involving us. POL, specifically

   Jim Cruise and Mandy Talbot had both verbally expressed concerns about

   precedent should the Expert's report become common knowledge and had asked

   for our assistance in challenging it. We expended considerable time and effort

   into assisting them, I was in contact with Pathway Customer Services Help Desk

                                                                                   WITN04600200




   staff, Reconciliation staff and Technical Support to provide relevant information.

   However, POL did not subsequently pass on our final response and offer of on-

   site assistance to the Expert for his consideration.

   Camberwell Green (January 2001)

11. In January 2001 I was asked to provide a Witness Statement for an investigation

   that was being conducted at Camberwell Green. This was at the request of POL

   (Consignia) under Change Request CR0214 raised by Charles Leighton, then

   Internal Crime Manager, Post Office Network, PON Security, on 20th December

   2001 (ICL Pathway Change Request (CR0214): ICL Pathway to provide evidence

   in a Consignia prosecution case, WITN04600224). The request was subject to a

   Change Control Note (ICL Pathway Change Control Note (CCN 910): ICL Pathway

   to provide evidence in a Consignia prosecution case, WITN04600216). The

   resultant Witness Statement (Witness Statement of Jan Holmes re: Camberwell

   Green, WITN04600217) was produced but I do not know what happened to it post-

   production or if it ever found its way into Court.

   Department of Works & Pensions (January to March 2003)

12. In January 2003 1 was notified by Graham Ward (POL) of a series of Audit Data

   Extractions that were required by the Department of Works and Pensions to

   support a number of investigations in the Coventry region (Email from Jan

   Holmes to Colin Lenton-Smith re: Recent DWP Prosecution, WITN04600218).

   The resultant Witness Statement (Witness Statement of Jan Holmes re: DWP,

   WITN04600219) was produced but as with Camberwell Green I do not know

   what happened to it or if it was used.

   Holderness Road (June 2003)

13.On 16t1i June 2003 a Detective Constable Allen wrote to Peter Sewell (Pathway

   Security) requesting assistance with a criminal investigation into the outlet on

   Holderness Road, Hull. I do not know how DC Allen obtained Peter's contact

   details but I suspect we accepted the task on the grounds that it was a Police

   matter. The resultant Witness Statement (Witness Statement of Jan Holmes re:

   Holderness Road, -i joy ::         ) was despatched to DC Allen under cover

   letter (WITN04600219) on 24th June 2003. As with Camberwell Green and the

   DWP work I do not know what happened to it or if it was used.

   Additional Matters

14. When I left Pathway in May 2000 my responsibilities in all Audit matters,

   including audit data extractions, passed to Brian Mooney. When I returned in

   2001 Brian Mooney had left and I retained all Audit matters apart from audit data

   extractions. This activity had passed to Customer Services, headed by Stephen

   Muchow, under the Security function, then managed by Graham Hooper. The

   individual conducting audit data extractions and producing supporting Witness

   Statements in that unit at that time was Jane Bailey.

15. In the matter of Mr Henry KC. I was under the impression that this Inquiry was

   about finding the facts about what happened back in the 1990s and 2000s. This

   was reflected in my Witness Statement and questions from Counsel which were

   based on my knowledge and the facts applicable to me and my role at the time. I

   was not expecting to be taken down a string of `what-if scenarios that I could not

   possibly answer without applying hindsight or speculation, which could raise


                                    Page 6 of 10
                                                                                         WITNO4600200
                                                                                     WITNO4600200




   doubts about the decisions and actions actually taken at that time. My knowledge

   of the facts at that time were as they were and that cannot be re-written.

16 There were a number of areas where I felt that he used terminology that

   devalued what we provided to POL and our efforts in providing it. For example, I

   did not "deride" the Expert's opinion in my Cleveleys report. Scrutiny of

   documents (-} ~ ri :1 i2      & WITN04600206) will show that we expended a

   considerable amount of time and effort putting together a challenge to some of

   his assertions. An activity that we were asked to do by POL (WITN04600203 &
   FJJ)0'21=37


17. His assertion that if Bob Martin was requesting 200 data extractions to

   investigate a population of 18,000 outlets and that it must equate to a 1% failure

   rate which would be 'reputationally disastrous to Fujitsu' is simply incorrect. His

   conclusion is invalid since we had no knowledge of what Bob Martin's

   investigations might be about. It could have been missing pencils following a

   stocktake.

18. There was a suggestion from him (and from Counsel) that perhaps

   I/Pathway/Fujitsu could or should have done more to challenge or query the

   volume of POL's audit data requests, and the use they were being put to. We

   were not there to run due diligence over POL's various litigations and

   prosecutions and I'm certain that had we tried we would have been told where to

   go in no uncertain terms.

19. Finally, he wanted to take issue with what Pathway provided to POL in terms of

   data retrievals and the presentation of data from the audit solution. In June 1998,

                                                                                                             WITNO4600200




             ;in the absence of any lead from POL, I had to instigate correspondence with POL.

              Internal Audit (and BA who were still involved at that time) in an attempt to get

             themmto articulate what they wanted and what they were expecting to see in their

â€¢             retrievals (Letter from Jan Holmes to Hilary Stewart re. Audit Data retrieval

              Scenarios, WITN046002 2). Their general inability to specify form, content or

              volume: meant we had to m ake certain assumptions. The retrieval requirements

             were eventually captured in the document IAJREQ/002 (iCL Pathway Audit Data

          Retrieval Re uirem nts lA/PEc 1002, W iiTN046002                             ) and included such

             information as had been received from POD, end BA. His assertion that, and 'l

â€¢            paraphrase, we gave the customer yr hat we 1 anted to give them as opposed to
          what they wanted' is unwarranted and does not efect the efforts. made to
