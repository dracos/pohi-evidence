Dear Jane

I have not heard from you since I sent you our press notice yesterday.

If the BBC is planning any coverage in relation to the Post Office, I do hope you will let me know as
soon as possible.

We published yesterday a very full report on this issue, setting out the position not least that:

- all investigations have now been completed

- no evidence has emerged to suggest that Horizon is not working as it should

- we are putting all cases without a court ruling forward for mediation

- we will be working with Second Sight to complete their part two report. This report will be made
available to individual applicants and to their professional advisors

- Second Sight has also been asked provide individuals going in to mediation with reports on their cases

Mel will forward the report to you. I am surprised given your interest in this issue that you have not
requested a copy.

We are fulfilling - to the letter - our commitments on this matter.

I am aware that the issue was raised at PMQs today. The position is not as suggested in that session. It
is clearly important, therefore, that the full picture is reflected as I know you will agree.

Best wishes

Mark
