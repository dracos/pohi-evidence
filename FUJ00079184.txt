ACCEPTANCE PREPARATION & TESTING

Overall Summary

Progress against plan for the 13 former Acceptance Incidents forming the bulk
of the Acceptance Resolution Timetable is reviewed below in Acceptance
Resolution Timetable order:

211: This is now resolved and in its monitoring phase until 31/10. A list of
potential 211 incidents has been provided and will be investigated in the normal
way. Experience indicates these incidents will be the result of Cash Accounts
being first migrated on to Horizon in an unbalanced state.

342: Closure was due for approval on 2/10.

390: A change to AP counter is due for distribution by 30/11. Development
stages are now complete and distribution is to be scheduled.

376: Interface stability: The problems arising from Pathway-provided Reference
Data caused the production of eight incorrect Cash Accounts in week 28 and a
necessarily matching set of eight in week 29. The associated transactions
streams used by TIP were correct, as the Transfer transactions involved are not
processed by TIP. Correction and prevention are complete. A further incorrect
Cash Account was notified for week 28. A single empty, but correctly
structured, electronic Cash Account was produced. The printed Cash Account
was correct. This is being investigated.

Additional Reconciliation: The Testing Strategy document was issued. The
single HLTP is scheduled for issue on 26/10. The first Integration and Cycle 1
are expected to have started on 25/10.

OBC procedures: The activities in this segment are already complete.
378: The diagnostic fix has found no null pointer-type problems.

369: Eleven book covers were sent to PIRA (Printing Industry Research
Association) by DSS. The provisional PIRA report shows that one cover, in poor
physical condition, was sent in error but had been capable of being scanned.
All of the ten covers in the test proper were non-conforming, with the bars being
too thin, probably, PIRA reports, because of insufficient printing density. Books
are continuing to be impounded at the two sample offices, Saltwell Road and
Felling, and the covers sent to PIRA for holding for testing in the future if POCL
and DSS agree to do so.

372: The reports for both the Riposte 5.4.10 and EPOSS 3.20 release

packages, together with their supporting documentation, were issued to POCL
on 15/10. By 15/10, 99% of counters, including those newly-automated to that

date, were installed with these packages and several had been moved forward
to EPOSS 3.22. CP 2116, to automate monitoring of executables during CSR,
has now completed development stages and is about to be tested prior to
distribution.

298: The four-week observation period of 1777 counters started on 21/10
(CAP31). The target is a figure of merit of four units per counter per year, a unit
being an authorised reboot or various numbers of workaround. All previously
defined fixes have been distributed and monitoring of them was completed on
8/10.

Regular reports are being issued, the most recent on 21/10. The actual
achievement figure for CAP 30 was 137.5 units as compared with the weekly
average par figure of 137.

The testing policy document was incorporated in the Al 376 testing strategy and
is available to go forward to CSR+ testing.

218: The Pre-Entry Event actions are complete. POCL has made amendments
to its contribution and the event will be signed-off on 28/10 as planned.

The CCN to redefine the RNM training has now reached revision 543b. The
courses themselves have been in satisfactory production since 6/9.

Trainer Quality Monitoring will complete this week, when the last of the cohort of
the 5/11 users have their training.

Activities to support situations where users do not meet the PSA are forecast to
complete 12/11.

Post Training Consolidation actions allowing POCL to promote the use of
Training Mode are expected to complete 27/10.

The first joint check step for the plan as a whole has been brought forward to
22/11.

391: Work to extend card access controls to the Wigan back gate started on
16/10 and should complete at the end of October. The fence work on the
Wigan exclusion zone has also started. The procedure material for both Bootle
and Wigan is in course of incorporation.

314: The first four chapters of the API document specified by CR/SPE/007 had
been produced by 18/10, representing about half the material. The manual is
due for first delivery by 23/11 and Appendices planned by 28/12.

408: The first line refresher courses are complete. The first audit of the Level 3

Cash Account operations was completed and a workshop to discuss the basis
of conformance and a second audit have been scheduled for 25-28/10.

412: Ad hoc service reports. Actions are forecast to complete 5/11.

There is now just one former Al, Al 232, where there is a disagreement as to
severity - None (Pathway) and Low (POCL). This has been referred in the first
instance to the POCL and Pathway Commercial departments. One-line
resolution plans for the, now 53, agreed Low Als are in preparation.

2. NATIONAL ROLLOUT PREPARATION

2.3

National Roll Out

Revised Rollout Programme

The revised rollout profile from the Second Supplemental Agreement has now been
captured in a detailed Installation Programme Plan (IPP) thereby providing the rollout
volumes by IP region and geography. ‘This version of the IPP has been released for
comment and approval.

Implementation of the obligations in CCN 561 has also been progressed with the second
(final) workshop having been held on 20" October. All necessary documentation revisions

to reflect these obligations have planned dates that meet the required deadlines and are on
track. This includes the Rollout Strategy, Scheduling Strategy, Installation Requirement and
a number of training communication product
obligations have been made effective will take plz

A final joint review to conclude that all
e on 27" October.

Further changes to the rollout profile have been requested by POCL (Major Offices and
RNM Clusters). These are currently being assessed for impact.

POCL Implementation management team visited Pathway’s installation rollout operations at
Kidsgrove, Celestica and Exel on 14" October which proved useful for both parties.

Pathway is progressing with installation scheduling for the year 2000 offering a single
installation date to postmasters. It is understood that this has been progressed by POCL
and scheduling postmaster appointments on this basis is acceptable.

Infrastructure Programme

Trolley surveys and preparations are currently being scheduled and it is
envisaged that all surveys for trolley sites will have been completed this year.

Further releases of suspended outlets into the infrastructure programme are
continuing although there appears to be some delays occurring in these
releases being apparent to the Pathway scheduling team.

Very few outlets are entering the infrastructure programme at the RGM letter
stage since the vast proportion are now in the programme. The majority are
suspended outlets being released into the programme from suspension into that
stage from which they were suspended.

Installation Programme

As of 15" October 99, 1181 outlets had been migrated to Horizon and are now operating
live. Installations continue to run to schedule with the rate of suspensions and aborts, over
the 16-week process, having reduced to be consistently less than 15%, which was the
predicted level. Joint reviews of the dropout rate indicate that this is likely to fall further
and that progress is being made on most causes of aborts.

2.4

Reduced numbers of ISDN line faults are now evident following action taken by Energis
and sub-postmaster refusals have also reduced. Counter discrepancies continue to occur
and a further meeting to progress this item is planned for 22" October. Pathway are
implementing a further level of pre-installation checking which should help in reducing the
occurrence of counter discrepanci

Continued discussions with suppliers are taking place in order to improve productivity and
effectiveness on an ongoing basis. Lessons learnt from recent installation issues have
already established an improvement in issue escalation and communication. Pathway will be
undertaking a further review of installation processes once pre-Xmas rollout completes and
will keep POCL advised of progress made.

A much-improved understanding of the boot server installation delays has been achieved
and has been shared with POCL. Contingency to protect against future occurrences has
been established.

Fluctuations in weekly, daily and geographic volumes continue to be minimal following the
improvements reported a fortnight ago. It is understood that for the last month the
distribution and volume levels have been satisfactory for POCL Implementation.

User Implementation and Migration

A rance Incident 21

The dry-run of the pre-entry event took place and POCL have agreed that ICL Pathway
need to do no further work on this event. However, POCL are conducting further work to
enhance their elements of this event. Progress against AI218 resolution plan continues to be
on schedule.

Training Schedulin,

Resolution of the causes of training schedule failures has now been completed preventing
reoccurrence and a full explanation has been provided to POCL. Recovery action to
minimise impact to postmasters caused by these failures has been taken. This includes
providing weekend training, prioritising training dates to maximise notice to postmasters
and providing installation dates which will maximise notice for training. Pathway recognises
the inconvenience this has caused in many cases and a letter apologising to all postmasters
affected will be sent.

Although Pathway have taken corrective action and action has been taken to minimise
disruption caused by scheduling difficulties, until all affected offices have progressed
through training there will be a small number of outlets where short notice of training is
given. The steps taken by Pathway will minimise this and will ensure that all future outlets
entering the programme will receive the standard period of notice for training.

Tt should be noted that a proportion of outlets receiving reduced notice for training were
affected as a result of the shortened installation process instigated by POCL for all
installation weeks in 1999. A further contributory factor was the requirement to re-schedule
suspended outlets and NRO week 2 outlets prior to the earlier scheduled NRO completion

Migration

The HFSO’s are gaining experience as we go through this phase of National Rollout and
issues concerning migration have eased during this period. A meeting has been held

berween ICL Pathway, POCL and Knowledge Pool to consider improvements to HFSO
training following HFSO experiences in the early weeks of NRO.

Management Information

1. As part of Al298, MSU are continuing to work jointly with POCL to
analyse HSH calls relating to systems instability. Call volumes and
categorisations have been agreed for the main monitoring period against

782 offices, which commences 21/10/99 for four weeks.

1. A Service Review was held with POCL on 20/10/99. No major issues

were raised.

Business / Reconciliation Incident Management

1. There are currently 130 PinlCLs assigned to MSU. The majority of these

concern the 'Non polling’ of live outlets. Under the rectification plan for Al376
an incident must be raised on each office that hasn't polled. At least 75% of
these are resolved within the next 24 hours. It would therefore seem more

realistic to only raise them as incidents after 48 hours. Discussions are

taking place with POCL to try and find a more efficient way of dealing with

these incidents.

MSU attended the September incident review with POCL on 15/10/99 at
Chesterfield. This forum meets to discuss our handling of business incidents
and provides an opportunity to discuss and develop the incident handling
procedures. All parties felt that this review has occurred at the right time in

the roll out schedule. An incident management workshop to be attended by

POCL and Pathway has been arranged for 02/11/99 to address any shortfall
in the process.

3.2 Operations Services

3.2.1 Service Availability

Systems Operations

1.

Host/EMC System

The first Host failover to a NUMA server took place at 0500 on Friday
15/10/99 when we failed over from Bootle to Wigan. The Bootle upgrade to

NUMA was successfully achieved by early Sunday and the Host then failed
over back to Bootle.

Correspondence Servers

a) The Wigan Cluster 1 Primary and Secondary were re-introduced back
into live service on Friday 15/10/99, after eliminating all known causes of

failure. On Wednesday 20/10/99, the Primary failed with what appeared
to be a main disc problem. This is currently under investigation.

b) The review meeting scheduled for 21/10/99 with POCL BCM and
Support/Design has been postponed.

Data Warehouse

Date Warehouse is currently up to date and running from Wigan. There is a

problem with BVC back ups that is currently being investigated.
Audit Server

The Audit Server at Wigan has had a fix applied to cure the “Blue
Screen” problem and is to be restarted ASAP, to begin the process of
gathering the backlog of files.

3.2.2 SLA Management

1.

The non-polled office report is a concern. CS have approached the POCL
AP Product Manager to discuss the possibility of revising the process in
order to prevent the heavy workloads created through investigating offices
that are only on the report for one day. It has been agreed to review the
process and a meeting is to be arranged.

No file delivery issues.

Pathway has responded to criticisms of the quality of its service and
personnel made by the POCL OSG manager, by writing, on a number of
occasions, to request background information that would allow Pathway
to investigate further. A reply was received on 18/10/99 but with
insufficient detail to warrant investigation. The response stated that the
issues were too numerous and complex to provide details. The Pathway
Service Manager is pursuing the suggestion to hold a workshop to
address the issues. Pathway is disappointed by the way this matter has
been handled and feel that it has a negative impact on working
relationships.

CR71 for CTO Backlog testing has been responded to and CP2256/CCN
is to be presented at PCCB (21/10/99).

A response to CR69 for redefinition of the Token Verification Service has
been presented to POCL. This CR has been withdrawn by POCL after
the Pathway response and a revised version is awaited.

A report on the Eastern Energy token problem has been produced and
sent to POCL. It is believed that a batch of rogue tokens is responsible
for the problem.

AP Client Migration

1.

“kK

Pathway wish to remove the outline plan from the Strategy Document
(IM/STR/018) and the POCL Product Manager has not objected to the
principle. Version 5.02 of IM/STR/018 has been produced and is
currently being discussing with POCL AP Product Manager.

First client meetings arranged for early November. POCL are now happy
for Pathway to be part of the initial presentations. Very positive
response received back from POCL about the Pathway approach,
following a meeting held with key Account Managers.

Work on the scope and agenda of the TIP Operational Review meetings
is continuing. A draft OLA is being addressed by POCL and a new CSR+
Risk Register has been opened.

It is planned to create a contingency Disaster Recovery (DR) plan but no
feedback has been received yet from POCL on their interim
requirements. This is now becoming urgent. POCL also need to present
their long-term DR requirements to Pathway in order for a formal
proposition to be made.

3.2.3 Change Management
Reference Data

1.

A total of 277 reference data changes have been released to the live estate
since the last report. This includes the release of a significant number of
outlet changes, the backlog of which is now being addressed. In the last
two weeks there were 35 correction files and 46 migration special files
representing approximately 17% and 25% respectively of the total number of
files received. The migration specials are considerably higher than had
been anticipated.

Pathway is becoming increasingly concerned with the quality of Reference
Data supplied by POCL and the errors being made. At present the effects
of these errors are relatively small, however there is an increasing risk that a
significant change will be delayed because of errors in the supplied data.
The number of correction files received into RDMC each week is one
indicator of the problem; another is the fact that a recent Cash Account
spreadsheet had several errors in it. RDT have requested that this be raised
at the Horizon Service Review Forum.

There is also concern about the ability of the RDS system to produce
incremental data for SIP16 and subsequent major system changes. Pathway
understands that the issues with the supply of incremental updates to
Reference Data for SIP16 are unlikely to be resolved before November.
The precise effect on delivery of SIP16 is still being discussed within
Pathway.

. The total number of PinICLs outstanding on POCL with regard to Reference

Data has decreased by 5 to 25. There has been noticeable activity recently
and a further decrease is anticipated.

. The number of changes to outlet information awaiting authorisation for

release from POCL NCAs has improved to 85 and many of these will be
released as the NCAs catch up. POCL have arranged a meeting next week
to help the NCAs fully understand their role.

. The data required to resolve the reconciliation problem with products 196

and 197 (cash account line 9015) was released to the live estate on 20th
October.

An investigation into problems with SWALEC bar code payments discerned
that the bar codes being presented to the Horizon counter were incorrect
(check digit in error). OSG Farnborough has confirmed that they have the
same problem with the legacy system. The error therefore appears to be
with the issued token.

. A further meeting is to be arranged with POCL BSM regarding changes to

the Interface Agreement for Operational Business Change (Product).
Pathway has submitted a discussion paper for POCL’s consideration.

The corrective actions for the problems within the RDMC, with loading new
data whilst earlier versions are still being verified/released, are progressing.
The additional reporting mechanism has been developed and is currently in
testing. RDT are using most of this report through an SQL worksheet.

CF expressed some concern in the apparent lack of MC
robustness in rollout processes at this early stage. MC said 27 Oct
that despite the individual incidents a reduction in dropouts
had been achieved and the fall out rate was in line with
expectations. Pathway would continue to review rollout
risks and lessons learnt. MC would provide an update at
the next meeting.

Specifics are covered in the Pathway report and a
verbal update will be given by Jim Flynn at the next
meeting.

Action closed.
Reference Data Problem - Pathway said the recent SM
incident was due to the concurrent verification of 27 Oct
successive versions of reference data for the same
product. This had been caused by a design fault. A new
temporary program will flag if this event occurs again in
the near future but a change will be brought forward from

CSR¢+ to prevent reoccurrence.

It was noted that the problem may impact this weeks cash
account. Also the consequences would have been far
more serious if the problem had occurred when many
thousand of offices were live. AR said he had asked Audit
to review the implications of Pathway having to make
changes to the message store to rectify this incident. SM
said Pathway would support this and would always advise
PO of such interventions. SM to confirm actions.

The following text was supplied to Jeremy Folkes

Message Store corrections
Background

An error in reference data had rendered the special
"TRANSFER" products unavailable, and instead the
system had used the ‘default' settlement product,
which was "CASH". The reference data that controls
the settlement behaviour for the Transfer In and Out
Modes was also deleted with the result that no
automatic receipts were produced for Transfers out.

When Users performed the transfer out function, the
settlement product (now "CASH" rather than
"TRANSFER OUT") was recorded with a value equal
and opposite to the total value of the transferred
item(s). In effect, no transfer out had actually taken
place, the system had done a stock adjustment into
"CASH" from the transferred item(s).

When Users performed a transfer in, the stock of the
transferred item was increased, and a balancing
transaction for cash was written by the system.
Because the "CASH" product used to settle the
transfer out was already a negative value, this resulted
in a second 'minus' sign being added to the sale value
attribute. These transactions with double negative
signs were subsequently ignored by accounting
functions because the value was non-numeric,
effectively causing the transfer in to be a ‘one-sided
transaction.

Response to your specific points
1) The solution involved additions to the message

store against the stock units RECEIVING the transfer
which inserted replacements for the rejected ‘double

Page 16

FUJ00079184
FUJ00079184
ICL Pathway Progress Summary

for Input to Horizon / Pathway Delivery Meeting

27 October 1999

negative’ records which would cause a reduction in
"CASH" equal to the value of the transfer. This
effectively restored the office to a position of balance
as though the transfer had not taken place.

2) A custom-written tool was used to effect the
solution. This tool was developed specifically is
response to the occurrence of the problem, and was
developed by the Pathway development team, and
tested by them prior to use.

The source of the amending data written back to the
message store was the error messages produced from
the TIP harvester, subsequently confirmed by analysis
of the message store. On detection of the ‘double
negative’ transactions, the harvester placed an ‘event'
in the event log. These messages were extracted from
the event log and accumulated into a file for analysis
and action.

3) Messages were inserted into the correspondence
server for each cluster (dependent upon to which
cluster the affected Post Office was connected). These
messages appear with the Node number of the
correspondence server.

4) The messages were inserted using a null user name
and an attribute was added to each message indicating
that this message had been inserted by the SSC in
order to correct this problem. Therefore they are
obvious to any audit.

5) The process used was the SSC Operational
Correction Request process, which has been audited.
In this process, in addition to the audit trail that is left
