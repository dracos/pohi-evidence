Susan,

Please find attached Harry Bowyer's Response to Brian Altman QC's Interim Report. I asked Harry to
draft the response in Simon Clarke's absence given the urgency of the situation.

I would be grateful if Harry's Response could be sent to Brian Altman QC together with the Review
Protocol and Simon Clarke's Advice on Disclosure.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin Smith
