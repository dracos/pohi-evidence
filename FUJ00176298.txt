Dear Colin GRICE

Re: Lost Data and Audit Trail

“an essential part of everyday life” wi
Without Prejudice Subject to Contract

Further to my letter of 28 August 2002, I am writing to you with an offer
on a ‘Without Prejudice’ basis in an attempt to close off this current
issue which has the potential to consume disproportionate resources in
both our companies.

Post Office Limited would be prepared to waive your failure of the
obligations set out Schedule A16, Solution 699 to which I referred in my
letter of 6 February in return for a contribution by Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) to the cost of the upgrade of the Audit system from DLT
drives to the Centera solution which you have now proposed.

The upgraded system will support both the Network Banking Service
and the Existing Services. Although I understand that it would not
strictly comply with your obligation to use optical media, Post Office
Limited considers that it would give equivalent data security to optical
media — which the current system does not - and on that basis would
agree a change io the Soiution for the Existing Services.

Taking into account the relative transaction volumes, values and
retention periods required over the remainder of the contract, our
assessment of the Fujitsu Services contribution to costs that we would
accept is £200,000.

RRELEVANT ‘until 23 September 2002 I IRRELEVANT

annon will able to deal with this issue for me.
