Please see below a list actions agreed during yesterday’s discussion:
* Kelly and POL agreed that the CWU data on NMW should be shared with the BEIS Labour Markets
team for awareness.
+ POL agreed to present Kelly with the details of their strategy. This included details on the scenarios as
to how the litigation will play out and how it could be settled, the potential costs of the litigation.
+ POL seemed open to having another Government representative joining the POL litigation
subcommittee and Richard Watson from UKGI was suggested.
* POL agreed to meet with Nigel Boardman, chair of the BEIS Audit and Risk Committee, to discuss
POL’s litigation strategy with them.
+ A short discussion was held about the information-sharing arrangements between BEIS and POL.
Both parties agreed to speed up the agreement of the proposed Shareholder Framework Agreement as
soon as possible.
+ Kelly agreed to try and come along to the board meeting on 30-31 July, however the date is during
summer recess so she will have to make a decision on whether to attend.
+ Al agreed to send over the total cost of the litigation so far which we have already received.

Hi Gordon,
See attached for a Briefing for Kelly in advance of her meeting with Tim Parker and Al Cameron on Monday, 4-5PM.

As noted in the briefing, myself and Carl will attend from the policy team and Tom Cooper and Richard Watson from
UKGI. Note that we expect POL will be accompanied by their Legal Counsel, which we think will be helpful.

We will also follow with an insert by the end of the week with further detail on what we expect POL to present in
relation to their litigation strategy.

Best,
Eleanor

Hi Eleanor

The Minister has agreed to meet with Tim Parker and Al Cameron of POL on Monday 24 June 16:00 — 17:30.

As such, I’d be grateful if you could provide briefing for this meeting by COP Wednesday 19 June, including the
following:

Attendees (External and Internal)

Purpose of the meeting and handling

* Agenda

Points to make (please divide by Agenda item)
Relevant Context

* Media Handling and Social Media

Biographies

Grateful if you could liaise with Comms as to any media issues. Please find attached meeting briefing template.
UKG100010295
UKGI00010295

Grateful if you could endeavour to keep the document concise and liaise with Press Office and SpAds (cc’d), to ensure
they are content with external lines and briefing.

Please could you suggest an official (or officials) to support the Minister at this meeting.

Nb: This meeting will cover the Post Office Litigation, and therefore it makes sense that it will also cover the recent
exchanges of letters the Minister has had with both parties on this matter.

Happy to discuss further.

Many thanks,
Gordon
