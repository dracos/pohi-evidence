Updated version of the brief with the changes discussed with Alwen earlier. Have also integrated Mark’s additions.

The structure and sequence reflects what I understand is our expected position with James — i.e. we’re on strong
ground asking him to restrict the number of cases and this should be our first focus; he may be more reluctant to limit
the review to Horizon glitches rather than wider process issues - we should test this, but if that’s the case what we do
need to make absolutely clear that there can be no confusion between the two in the headline conclusions. Alwen — is
that a fair summing up?

Hi Alwen

I've had a look, see attached. I am confused as to whether we are agreeing to the second sight view that they need until end of
October for the full review where they can, or whether we are being firmer and saying they finish after the three cases. Can you
clarify?

Suggest you send to Martin Edwarda as well before Paula. I have added various bits here and sorry they are not in tracking - on
the iPad.

Thope your day hasn't been too grim.

Best wishes
Mark
