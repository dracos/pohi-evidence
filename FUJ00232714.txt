This Testing & QA Report covers the Test activities and complements the “SDLC Report”
(COM/MGT/REP/4168), which covers the lifecycle from Requirements to Release.

The current Fujitsu Testing & QA process, with the associated test rigs, used as part of the full SDLC,
provides a high quality test service for the validation of changes for a safe deployment into LIVE.

Testing & QA and been the topic of numerous collaborative discussions between POL and Fujitsu over
the years and during recent meetings. Fujitsu and POL recognise that there are constraints imposed by
using the current approach and that there is a need for both POL and Fujitsu to focus on improvements.
Accompilation of recommendations for improvement arising out of these meetings has been collated into
a single list (set out at Appendix D to this report) so that POL and Fujitsu can work jointly to improve the
Testing & QA capabilities. The recommendations should be prioritised and the most relevant ones
actioned as promptly as possible.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. Fujitsu
reserve the right to make changes to the way we work in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this report. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before

2 Purpose & Scope

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain the current Fujitsu application Testing & QA approach
This Testing & QA Report explains the current processes, procedures and controls that Fujitsu operate to
manage the testing of Horizon and to support Horizon’s systems and applications, consistent with
Fujitsu's obligations set out in the Horizon Contract. The report explains the different environments and
shows how each environment supports the end-to-end Software Delivery Life Cycle.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcome the opportunity to provide this report and looks forward to a constructive dialogue with
POL.

3 Background & Introduction

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of Horizon by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled “Horizon
Audit’. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that Fujitsu
would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu was to share content that would allow both
organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and to identify ways to
make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working relationships and hopefully ensure a
better experience for the POL branches and their postmasters. Fujitsu believe in collaboration and
welcome constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains the current Fujitsu Testing & QA approach (“Testing & QA Report’). It follows the
“Expanded Table of Contents for the Testing & QA Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4161) which was shared
with POL on 01 December 2020.

This Testing & QA Report covers the Test activities and complements the “SDLC Report”
(COM/MGT/REP/4168), which covers the lifecycle from Requirements to Release.

As a general comment, Fujitsu is only one supplier involved in the overall delivery of end-to-end
services to POL in relation to Horizon. The Horizon application also relies on the working partnership
between POL and its chosen partners — such as Verizon, Computacenter and Atos — as well as external
service providers such as banks and affiliated organisations. This applies to both the IT systems and the
operational processes in Horizon.

Although every effort has been made to avoid confusing jargon in this report, the very nature of this
aspect of the service delivered to POL necessitates the use of many acronyms and phrases that may
need expanding upon to ensure the correct understanding. Fujitsu accepts that further explanation may
be necessary and encourages POL to seek these clarifications.

The topic of Testing & QA is a current open and active topic that results in continued communications
between POL and Fujitsu. This report aims to collate those interactions and communications in order to
provide a common baseline for any future discussions.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. This
report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any statements
made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors have collectively
characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have also described processes
and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be in written form. Many of
the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are continuously updated and Fujitsu
reserve the right to make changes to the way it works in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this document. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this document in the future as well as bearing in mind the
requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section 8 below.

4 Testing & QA
4.1 Testing Overview & Approach

Fujitsu has a Test and Validation (T&V) organisation who are the main providers of testing resource.
Fujitsu also has a corporate testing process within the Fujitsu Europe Business Management System
(EBMS). This includes a Testing Policy, Organisational Testing Strategy and Testing Methodology.

« The Testing Policy states the expectations Fujitsu has for the way testing will be conducted.

e The Organisational Testing Strategy defines the high level test approach to be adopted for all
programmes and projects.

e The Testing Methodology supports the Testing Policy and Organisational Testing Strategy by
identifying the supporting testing methods to facilitate achieving the defined goals.

The EBMS testing process provides document templates which the Post Office Account (POA) has
implemented where appropriate.

For POA this testing process impacts Solution Validation and Integration (SV&I) Testing and Live
System Testing (LST).

Development (DEV), Component Integration Testing (CIT) and Integration Testing (INT) all form part of
the Development phase of the Software Delivery Life Cycle and follow their own processes.

Section 4.5 describes in detail the environments used on POA. A summary is provided below:

e DEV - Used for developing code and performing Unit testing and code review. There is an
environment located in BRAO1.

e CIT-An extension of the DEV environment based in BRAO1 where components of code can be
Integrated for the first time e.g. Counter, Branch Access Layer (BAL) and Branch Database
(BRDB).

e INT - Used for packaging and testing the deployment of the code baselines and the regression
path of those baselines that make up change to individual platforms, which in turn make up a
release.

e SV&l - Used to test change from a solution perspective bringing together many components of a
change for the first time to validate the full requirements of a change.

e LST - Used to support the LIVE environment focussing on the patching and maintenance of the
individual components that make up the Horizon solution.

« RDT - Used to validate the REFDATA associated with the Horizon solution with the associated
tooling.

4.2 Defining the Test Approach

The Test Approach on POA is risk-based where changes are analysed by Subject Matter Experts (SME)
and as a result, tests, including regression tests, are derived.

The Horizon changes fall mainly into two streams: “Major” release or “Project” releases; and
“Maintenance” releases.

Major releases are those derived from POL Change Requests, which typically impact multiple platforms.
These go through the full SDLC and all test environments:

e ~=Test Planning
e Test Preparation
* Test Execution
o Including defect management

re) TESTING & QA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

e —Reporting/Monitoring
e Test Completion

Maintenance releases are incremental updates to the LIVE environment.

4.2.1 Test Planning

At this stage, based on the details of the change, the required test environments will be identified. If the
change will follow the Major release path then Test Plans for DEV/CIT/SV&I/LST will be produced
describing what will be tested as part of a change for that test environment.

The key sections are:
e The scope of testing — both in and out of scope features
« RAID items
e Environment description with any constraints
° Test tools to be used
° Test resource
e Test schedule
e Requirements traceability.

These plans will use the POA document template and are subject to the document management process
for review and approval using Dimensions.

Test Planning will also involve attendance by key test resources at impacting and planning sessions to
assess the change against current workload.

An example Test Plan can be found in document reference TST/SOT/HTP/4072 which has been shared
with POL separately.

4.2.2 Test Preparation
Test preparation is where the Test team prepare for the testing activities.
4.2.2.1 Test Environment Preparation

The Test environments each have their own purpose and capability and the environments may need
specific preparation activities. For example, the SV&I environment is the first environment that has a
working Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS). TWS manages jobs that run at certain times during the day
(e.g. reconciliation of Counter data). TWS has a customised configuration as SV&I is not identical to
LIVE.

Test environment preparation follows a process of understanding the change and also the activities that
need to be completed during the preparation phase.

4.2.2.2 Test Cases

The SME for each area of change uses all relevant documentation (requirements/designs), design
review sessions and ad hoc conversations to determine what Test Cases need to be generated to
validate the change and test the agreed business requirements.

Test Cases will then be written as test scripts detailing:
e The definition of what is being tested
e Step by step process describing:
e Data input
* On-screen messages
e Keystrokes

e Test data / cards / branches / pinpad combinations.
4.2.1.3 Test Readiness Review

For Major releases, a Test Readiness Review (TRR) will be performed, and chaired, by the Test Lead
with assistance from some of the other delivery leads. The TRR will gather all relevant information to
confirm that the Test phase is ready to accept the change and start test execution.

Each point will be assigned a “RAG” (Red Amber Green) status where: Green indicates the point is
complete; Amber indicates the point has a plan to “Go Green”; and Red indicates that the point requires
actions to plan.

A risk-based approach will be used to determine which activities are “showstoppers” to the process and
which activities have enough containment to move forward.

An example TRR mail can be found in Appendix A — Example Test Readiness Review mail.
4.3 Utilisation of environments (within the Change &
Software Delivery Lifecycle)

4.4 Major & Maintenance Release Flow

The Horizon changes fall mainly into two streams: (1) “Major” release or “Project” releases; and (2)
“Maintenance” releases.

Major releases are those derived from POL Change Requests typically impacting multiple platforms.
These go through the full SDLC and all test environments.

ie) TESTING & QA REPORT -
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

Maintenance releases are focussed changes for individual components that make up the Horizon
solution e.g. Counter, BAL, and BRDB.

These releases go through a subtly different process where changes “skip” the SV&l environment but get
“topped up” once a month. “Topped up” is the process whereby any changes that were deployed, tested
and signed off by LST are delivered back into the SV&I environment. These include Maintenance
releases, security patches and Hot Fixes.

The following diagram (4.4.A) represents the flow of a Major release in context to the Test environments.
Each row represents the next step in the progression of a release through the environments.

R1/R2/R3 are fictitious release numbers. Green represents delivery of new change to an environment.
Pink shows where change is yet to be deployed. Red starts the cycle again. So, in diagram 4.4.A below,
we can see that new release “R2” starts in Dev, then moves to CIT, then moves to INT etc.

The overlay bubble comment relates to the point in time where we do not have an environment which is
representative of LIVE as RDT and LST have the new release deployed ready to go to LIVE. At this
point, environments become out of sync with LIVE. The POL Live Service team is aware of this (see
Recommendation 1).

The Maintenance release is shown as a “point” release and uses the same colour scheme as described
for Major releases above.

Again, each row represents the next step in the progression of a release through each environment. The
overlay bubble comment highlights the sequence of deployments which “misses” out SV&l as per the
current process.

4.4.1 Test automation coverage

4.4.1.1 Counter Business Application (CBA) Test Tool

The CBA test tool is an in-house developed tool that was originally used by the Development team as a
way of simulating Counters to verify changes.

The Test team use this tool to automate tests across each area of functionality to formulate a regression
test pack which shows a stable Counter delivery, but would also “seed” data into the Data Centre for
those apps to consume, which enables a wider set of tests to be performed.

For each Major release there is potential for Counter changes and therefore enhancements to the CBA
test tool. If a change to the CBA test tool forms part of that release it would follow the SDLC for the
relevant environments (and the Testing process where appropriate).

The approach for this area of testing is to run the current test pack against a new version of the Counter
as part of the testing cycle. The tests are run, failures are investigated, defects are raised and changes
are made to the tests, if needed, to get an outcome which is a “clean” run of passes and therefore a
known state.

Note: Testing of REFDATA is a POL responsibility. REFDATA is fundamental to the operation of the
CBA. See Recommendation 13 in Appendix D.

re) TESTING & QA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

A joint review by Fujitsu and POL is currently underway of the CBA test tool, test pack and process
output as part of CWO0223.

4.4.1.2 SOAPUI

Although POL and Atos are responsible for testing the NCR Self-Service Kiosk hardware and
application, Fujitsu have responsibility for testing the interface of the SSK to the Horizon solution.

SOAPUL is the tool used to simulate these SSK messages across the Fujitsu interface. A regression
pack has been formulated and is run when specific changes are made to the Fujitsu interface or as part
of a wider solution regression pack.

This tool and scripts are used across the CIT/SV&I & LST test environments.
4.5 HNG Test Environments
4.5.1. Component Integration Test (CIT) environment

The Component Integration Test environment (CIT) is used by the Fujitsu Development team. It was
initially in place to integrate the Counter Business Application with the Data Centre BAL/BRDB to ensure
a stable Counter/Data Centre interface.

The environment capability has now been increased to cover more services.
This environment does not have:
e Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) so batch scheduling cannot be tested
e Estate Management capability
e REFDATA Supporting systems
e Any Computacenter software distribution.

The environment components are physically located in the BRA01 office. The team that manage and
use this environment are located in the Fujitsu GDC India Bangalore office and BRAO1.

4.5.1.1 Scope

The current scope of testing is to validate Counter/BAL changes in isolation with the flexibility of
incorporating changes swiftly as and when issues arise.

The testing is driven by JIRA where the testers allocate verification test(s) for the changes delivered by
the development team.

Elements of the testing process used in SV&I are being implemented for CIT including expanded
resource in the UK to give focus to testing with representative hardware/peripherals.

4.5.1.2 External Users/Use cases

There are currently no external users of this environment.

4.5.1.3 External End points & Simulated services

There are no external end points. Counters are simulated along with the branch peripherals.
4.5.1.4 Interfaces to Third Parties

There are no interfaces to POL third parties.

4.5.1.5 Testing from a Counter perspective

There is currently no use of physical Counter/peripherals from the Fujitsu GDC India Bangalore office
due to a constraint imposed by GDPR/PCI. However, all Counter variants and peripherals can be
simulated.

4.5.2 Integration (INT) environment

re) TESTING & QA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

The Integration environment is a “technical” rather than “functional” test environment with servers based
in the BRA01 office.

In this instance, the technical testing relates to how a packaged piece of code is proven to be delivered
successfully onto a Data Centre platform and the regression steps for this package. There is no
functional test capability in this environment.

The resources are based in BRAO1 and the Fujitsu GDC India Bangalore office.
4.5.2.1 Scope

This environment is used for packaging and testing the deployment of the code baselines that make up
changes to individual platforms which make up a release.

Each baseline needs a particular ordering and verification to determine how the change is best delivered
to the individual platforms in the Data Centre.

Some baselines come with accompanying deployment steps/details which need formulating and
packaging along with code.

The environment is made up of servers with the different operating systems representative of the LIVE
environment. Integration has at least one instance of each Data Centre platform type. They are on a co-
ordinated rig and in cases where a product is deployed to multiple platforms they are tested together.

4.5.2.2 External Users/Use cases

This is an “unmanaged” environment. It does not have any platforms located in the Belfast Data Centres.
It is used specifically by the Integration Team with members based in the UK and our Fujitsu GDC India
Bangalore office.

4.5.2.3 External End points & Simulated services

This environment does not have any external end points or simulated services. Its purpose is to test the
delivery of code rather than Horizon functionality.

4.5.2.4 Interfaces to Third Parties
This environment has no interface to third parties.
4.5.2.5 Testing from a Counter perspective

This environment does not have Counter testing capability. Its purpose is to test the delivery of code
rather than Horizon functionality.

4.5.3 SV&l environment

The Solution Validation and Integration environment has been specifically tailored / designed to support
functional testing to validate customer business requirements for project related change.

It is representative of LIVE in that it has many of the capabilities that operate in the LIVE environment:
“Real” Counter and peripheral hardware supplied and managed by Computacenter, with Verizon
managed Branch networking integrated with a fully managed Data Centre and real interfaces to third
parties — albeit with test end points.

It is used by many user groups and is seen as the “busiest” of test environments servicing multiple
requests on a regular basis.

The resources that make up this test team are all based in the UK.
4.5.3.1 Scope

The purpose of SV&I is to provide an environment that can test change from a solution perspective
bringing together many components of a change for the first time.

It has a Counter estate based in BRAO1 (Fujitsu Test) and Winnersh (Atos Test) interfacing with a
Belfast Data Centre. This Counter estate is representative of LIVE for hardware and Branch networking
including peripherals (Scanner/PinPad/weighscales/printers etc.)

It is the first environment where TWS changes are implemented. TWS run scheduled jobs to replicate
the processing of data through many Data Centre components with reconciliation processes which
consolidate the data for onward processing to external POL systems.

Its capabilities and constraints include:
+ Data Centre components fully managed Monday-Friday (this refers to all code deliveries)
*  TWS schedules running Monday-Friday
+ PODG, GWS and HBS Services
+ Representative hardware
* Customised REFDATA delivery mechanism
+ Simulated end points with other systems
+ External endpoint connectivity
+ Extends to Winnersh (Counters)
+ No clustered BRDB
+ Not scaled to LIVE
+ No BRSS platform
+ No HORIce capability
+ Usage managed by a Forward Schedule.

This highlights a number of areas that have been discussed between POL and Fujitsu where
improvements can be considered. See Recommendations in Appendix D.

4.5.3.2 External SV&l Users/Use cases

Over a number of years the SV&I environment has proved capable of supporting other user groups’
testing and development activities to enable better utilisation of its resources to support POL change.

The current user groups and their typical activities are described in the following table:

User Group Description of usage

Atos + Path of a transaction / data from the Fujitsu “Boundary” to POL third
parties including Banks / Online services and also POLSAP

+ Testing of NCR changes to the SSK, using physical SSK

+ Support of Computacenter testing Build changes / patches
* POL UAT — Hosting and / or performing

+ — Integration Testing of CDP changes

+ REFDATA changes - APADC (Automated Payment Advanced Data
Capture) / new products

NCR + Develop changes to their SSK application using SV&I (interface to
HBS) as a stub

Accenture + — Supporting Atos testing

Ingenico * — Providing integration to environments to support the testing of PCI
changes

HIH Project + Multiple test environments integrated with SV&I (INT 1 & 2,

Performance, RPOS)
+ Accessed by POL team in Moorfields
+ Focus on end-to-end testing

re) TESTING & QA REPORT
FUJITSU FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL

+ More recently Performance Testing

Horizon Development + Test fixes prior to formal delivery (under guidance from the SV&l
Teams support team)

These user groups are all managed using a simple Forward Schedule of Change workbook which is
updated on a weekly basis where details of who is using the environment and for what purpose are
noted. This includes details of any scheduled outages (maintenance release top ups, DR rehearsals) that
may impact the access or availability to these groups.

There is also a local Support Guide used by all users that describes how the environment is supported
and how user groups can raise observations, request evidence etc. See document reference
TST/SYT/PRO/3862 (currently v0.3), which has been shared with POL separately.

4.5.3.3 External End points & Simulated services

In order to validate some of the Horizon functionality/requirements it is necessary to simulate a number
of POL’s other third party end points to provoke responses or send information.

The detail of these external endpoints and simulated services can be found in Appendix B — External
Endpoints.

4.5.3.4 Interfaces to Third Parties

SV&I is the only environment that is used to connect externally and this is only relevant for Atos/POL
testing of Payment and Banking changes.

Where third parties have a Test end point, these are managed via requests to the SV&l Rig Support
team to implement a change to a configuration file where a “switch” is made to change from the use of a
simulator for traffic to the desired Test end point.

4.5.3.5 Testing from a Counter perspective

The approach to the testing of Counter Business Application changes in this environment follows the
approach detailed in section 4.2.

The Counter estate has the following configuration capabilities:
+ Single Counter outlets
+ Multi Counter outlets
+ Multi language
+ Counter Training Office
+ Global Office.

The Counters are not managed by the Computacenter software distribution tool. This allows for the
flexibility, during a Test phase, to make rapid deliveries of the application as and when required.
Additionally, the Computacenter compliance check is not enabled in order to further support this
approach.

Note. The compliance check is a tool that Computacenter use to determine which is the most valid
version of the CBA and if “new” versions are deployed for Test purposes. This check will remove that
version and rollback to what it believes is the most valid.

4.5.4 LST environment

The Live System Test environment is in place to support the LIVE environment, focussing on the
patching and maintenance of the individual components that make up the Horizon solution.

As part of the SDLC, this is represented best in Section 4.4 where these changes by-pass the SV&I
environment.

For Project change, LST is used primarily to rehearse the deployment/migration activities with the same
tooling/teams and process that would be used for LIVE.

The resources that make up this team are based in the UK and our Fujitsu GDC India Bangalore office.
4.5.4.1 Scope

The LST environment is a representation of the LIVE environment with Counter and peripheral
components located in the BRAO1 offices and the Data Centre capability in the Belfast Data Centre.
There is DR capability for Counters at the Fujitsu Stevenage office.

Monitoring of the supporting Data Centre systems is done using the Systems Management Monitoring
toolset to look for new expected and unexpected events/alerts. Checks are also made on the systems
that manage how the Counter estate is monitored when branches and Counter positions within branches
are added or removed (Estate Management database and Branch Change Management System
(BCMS)). BAL / BMX logs are also checked.

The following list gives a high-level view of the LST environment capability:
+ Data Centre platforms fully integrated
+ Data Centre components managed 24/7
+ TWS schedules running 24/7
+ Real Counters / peripherals
* Counters managed by Computacenter
+ Formal REFDATA delivery mechanism
+ Simulated end points with other systems
+ No external endpoint connectivity
* Clustered BRDB environment
+ PODG and HBS services
+ Scaled where appropriate
+ BRDB Standby Server (BRSS)
+ Goldengate replication from BRDB
+ HORIce — Software Support Centre tooling
+ Independent systems monitoring by SMC team
+ — Subject to full change control.

The only external interface is to Postcode Anywhere to be able to run tests that require address
information.

4.5.4.5 Testing from a Counter perspective

The Counter estate in LST has the capability of testing with the following configurations based on the
specific requirement for the change and what is required to be tested in the LIVE estate:

+ Single Counter outlets

+ Multi Counter outlets

+ Multi language

* Counter Training Office

+ Global Office

+  Computacenter monthly patch testing

* Computacenter build and regression testing with current LIVE Counters
+ HBS/PODG services.

The Counters are managed by the Computacenter software distribution tool in order replicate the
mechanism used in LIVE. Additionally the Computacenter compliance check is enabled.

4.5.5 RDT environment

RDT is the Reference Data Test environment. In the Software Delivery Life Cycle it is the final
environment before LIVE. This is only in terms of keeping its Counter and Data Centre components up to
the most recent versions of code. It is not to test the actual reference data (REFDATA) itself.

4.5.5.1 Scope

This environment has been established to validate the REFDATA associated with the Horizon solution
with the associated tooling. This REFDATA is used to “drive” much of the functionality that the CBA can
perform but has also been used to deliver “code” e.g. updates to the HBS service.

The following table reflects the various types of REFDATA that are currently processed.

PAF Postcode Address Data

RDT has Counter and Data Centre capability. However, its focus is to consume the Data Centre services
and verify REFDATA processes correctly to the Counter / Data Centre components.

The Data Centre components are hosted on the same infrastructure as LIVE.

There are 4 streams of work that are hosted within the RDT environment. The first 3 in this list are used
by Atos information services, the fourth by Fujitsu.

1. RDDT —- Terminal Verification for Reference Data Validation, integrity checking, and automated
testing

2. RDDIV - Interim Verification (Code Changes). Each change individually (Product, token menu
hierarchy rules scripts)

RDDOV - POL Outlook Systems Group verification of full packages of REFDATA

4. RDDPL (Pseudo LIVE REFDATA environment) for the investigation of any Live Reference Data
issues.

Some elements of the environment are managed locally e.g. the Tivoli Workload Scheduler that manage
the batch processing.

Data Centre components are managed by the Fujitsu Belfast teams, with Counter software being
managed by Computacenter.

4.5.5.2 External SV&l Users/Use cases

Outside of Fujitsu resource, the user groups using one or more of the RDT “Streams” are Atos
Information Services and Atos Test.

The Atos Information Services Group “key” the REFDATA based on POL requirements which is “fed”
into the REFDATA tooling for processing before going through the delivery process.

The Test Team are currently used to generate and test APADC scripts again, before being “fed” into the
REFDATA tooling.

The only external interface is to Postcode Anywhere to be able to run tests that require address
information.

4.5.1.5 Testing from a Counter perspective

Each of the four streams has two physical Fujitsu Counters which are both Single Counter Outlets
(SCOs). The only peripherals being used are the back office and tally printers to verify REFDATA
changes on receipts and reports.

N.B. Atos have a number of Counters:
e 2SCO in RDDT
* 1SCO in RDDIV
* 6SCO in RDDOV.

4.6 Platform differences

Fujitsu maintain a Platform Hardware Instance List (PHIL) which lists the available platforms for
LIVE/LST/SV&I/RDT. DEV/CIT/INT are a consolidated entry.

Not all platforms are available in all environments. This is based on the intended use of the environment
and the test purpose, and has evolved over years and through numerous changes.

There are a number of recommendations made which refer to opportunities to increase Test
environment capability. See section 7.

Appendix C — Environment Platforms shows the differences between the environments at a Data Centre
level.

4.7 Transaction types

For Counters to transact, they need the Fujitsu Counter Business Application and REFDATA delivered
by POL. They also need the hardware and peripherals.

The REFDATA determines which transactions a Counter can complete. This is based on many factors
including geographical location.

The Counter functionality is split into several main areas as defined below. These are further broken
down into 82 sub categories, which are not listed here due to the size but can be provided to POL
separately, if requested.

= BAC - Branch Accounting

= BAD - Branch Admin

= BDC - Bureau de Change

= BNK - Banking

= BOF - Back Office

= CSM - Cash and Stock Management
=» DVLA-DVLA

= ETU - Electronic TopUp

= EUM - Enhanced User Management
= GLB - Shared

= _GWS - Generic Web Services

= IOP - In and Out Payments

= PAF - Address Find

* POCA - Card Issuing

= POS - Postal Services

= RSS - Retail and Stock Sales

= SDB - Settlement by Debit or Credit Card
= SM - Smart Metering.

SV&lI is the only environment capable of testing this full set of transactions (see section 4.5.3).
CIT/LST/RDT can perform some of these transactions but is limited (see earlier sections).

4.8 Model Office - Live Proving

There is currently no formal engagement with the Model Office team by the Fujitsu Test organisation.

Model Office for LIVE proving is conducted by the POL project team.

5 Formal Audit Reports

POL has commissioned an ISAE3402 audit as well as quarterly PCI Prioritised Approach audits on POA.
Both audits examined the topics discussed in this report. Furthermore, POA are periodically requested to
contribute to internal Fujitsu corporate audits to support Fujitsu UK in attaining and maintaining a variety
of certifications such as 15027001, 1S09001 and 1SO22301.

6 Conclusions

The current Fujitsu Testing & QA process, with the associated test rigs, used as part of the full SDLC,
provides a high quality test service for the validation of changes for a safe deployment into LIVE.

It is, however, recognised by both Fujitsu and POL that there are constraints imposed by using the
current approach, and that there are areas for improvement. It is therefore acknowledged that there is a
need for both POL and Fujitsu to focus on improvements. (see Recommendations).

7 Recommendations

Testing & QA has been the topic of numerous collaborative discussions between POL and Fujitsu over
the years and during recent meetings. A compilation of recommendations for improvement arising out of
these meetings are contained in Appendix D. This list in Appendix D is aimed at collating the various
action items into a single list so that POL and Fujitsu can work jointly to improve the Testing & QA
capabilities. The recommendations should be prioritised and the most relevant ones actioned as
promptly as possible.

Appendix D — Master Recommendations List

We set out below the list of Recommendations, the majority of which have been the topic of
conversations between POL and Fujitsu over the years and during recent meetings. This Report
presents an opportunity to collate all of the action items into this single list so that POL and Fujitsu can
work jointly to improve the Testing & QA capabilities. Recommendations should be prioritised and the
most relevant ones actioned as promptly as possible.

Ref I Recommendation Additional Notes

1 Review options to ensure there I As described in section 4.4 above, there are times when there is no
is always a test environment single environment which is at the LIVE version of code / REFDATA.
representative of the LIVE This poses a risk of issues being found in LIVE with no guaranteed Test
environment rig available to retest/verify the issue. Although this situation rarely

exists for more than 2 weeks, consideration is needed to build/support
a dedicated replica of the LIVE environment.

2 Review options to keep the « As described in the SV&I environment section above, the SV&I
SV&I environment “in step” with environment is not “in step” with LST/RDT as monthly security
LST/RDT even when monthly updates/maintenance releases/Hot Fixes do not get deployed until ~1
security updates/maintenance month after they have been signed off by LST.
releases/Hot Fixes are being Increase the rig capability so that all change can be managed through
deployed the full SDLC e.g. additional BALs, clustered databases, full Estate

Management capability
e Plan for all change to go through the full SDLC.
3 Review options to extend SV&l « — SV4&lI's ability to replicate LIVE is decreased as there is no out of
support hours — perhaps to 24/7 hours/weekend support. TWS schedules are not run at the weekend
and the rig is effectively shut down.
«The LST environment currently has a fully functioning TWS schedule
and is supported 24/7
¢ _SV&I would be an addition to this.

4 Review options to provide « — Early testing of Counter changes in the CIT environment are restricted
counters/peripherals within the because physical Counters/peripherals are not available to the GDC
CIT environment India development team

« Implement a CIT UK team where this capability could be established.
« Implement full testing in the SV&l environment.

5 I Review and agree options to «Early testing of change is not always possible in the CIT environment
enhance the scope of the CIT because it lacks solution capability e.g. no TWS schedules run,
solution capability environment is not “managed”, not all end points are simulated.

« Fund a review to determine what this better capability looks like.
e Implement full testing in the SV&l environment.

6 I Review viability and value in *  Ifany non-functional testing is required, there is no dedicated

to truly simulate LIVE levels of I ¢ — Build/support a dedicated replica of the non-functional
activity test environment.

* Scale up SV&l on a change by change basis.

7 I Review SV&l to identify options I This is a topic of regular discussion between POL and Fujitsu
for less conflict of use and « There are multiple user groups using the SV&I environment and we
hence higher throughput of have seen instances of project timescales being impacted due to
testing clashes with maintenance schedules (downtime).

¢ — Build an environment reflective of the needs of the current non-Fujitsu
user groups.

8 Expand scope of Counter * Some sets of functionality are not regression tested e.g. APADC, APOP
regression testing to always due to dependency on Atos.
include Atos Atos is not regularly involved in the Counter regression test phase.

* POL to engage with Atos for every release to confirm whether there is
scope for additional effort.

9 Review the approach to « A specific defect retesting cycle is not always included when planning
impacting/testing to include how testing in SV&I. This is done partly to improve the view of the downtime
defects are managed in terms required to maximise throughput through the environment.

GlobalPayments UK to supply This became a caveat for 20.92 and at present will not change for
"Test" files for Fujitsu 20.94
processing « POL should engage GlobalPayments so that this gap is filled.

13 I Enhance Fujitsu visibility of «There are potentially changes to Counter functionality made via the
Atos REFDATA testing and BAU REFDATA process (by Atos) which Fujitsu do not have sight of
output results which affect the maintenance of existing tests. (An example would be

APADC scripts).
14 I Review and improve interaction I ¢ Review interaction with Model Office. Although Model Office / LIVE
with Model Office Proving is a POL responsibility, this activity has "dwindled" to the point
of being invisible as part of a delivery process.
*  Task(s) added to plans for engaging Model Office through the "journey"
and sharing information about the changes to determine whether a
LIVE proving task would add value.

15 I Review the OBC19 process and I « _OBC19 does not currently apply for PODG route definitions going into

the Counter estate hardware (including peripherals) and have tested with this setup for many years.
(including peripherals) However, that has built an expectation that Fujitsu have the latest

versions of hardware and that that is what is tested which leads to
confusion.

« A formal RACI should be created to determine the scope of testing for
Fujitsu highlighting potential gaps.

preferred.
