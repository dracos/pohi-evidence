Minutes and Matters Arising

TABLED and NOTED were draft Minutes from the Board Meeting of 1 November 2022.

and be signed by the Chair.

The Board NOTED the action log and status of the actions shown. SI queried progress in
relation to item 2 which had been marked as closed. ACTION BT requested that this item
be re-opened and re-assigned to MR, with a view to resolution come January 2023. AC
suggested that SI re-draft the action item and provide this to RS for inclusion in the action
log.

TABLED and NOTED was a report, ‘NBIT — Customer Facing Screen Options’. NR observed
that this was a cost issue balanced against a customer service issue. LH noted that a
Postmaster might choose to pay for this option, although capability for this option would
still then have to be built.

Nominations Committee
LH updated the Board as follows:

© The Committee has resolved that the Chairman be recommended for appointment
as Chair and a member of the Nominations Committee, as well as a member of the
Remuneration Committee;

@ The Board and Committee Evaluation process for 22/23 had been considered, and
an internal review process would be instigated with responses due by the end of
December, given ZP’s departure in early 2023;

© The NED recruitment process was progressing. The CEO Report had referenced
potential challenges to attracting suitable candidates, and whilst a number of
candidates had departed the process from the longlist, the Evaluation Panel were
pleased with the calibre of applicants on the shortlist.

Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee

BT noted that CS was an apology to the meeting, however CS had provided BT with a
summary of the ARC meeting of 5 December. BT spoke briefly to the note outlining key
highlights. In relation to Project Pensions Assurance, it was RESOLVED that the ARC
recommendation to the Board that Board delegate authority to the Group Executive to
determine the most appropriate rollout of the communication and reduction in pension in
cases of overpayment be and is hereby APPROVED.

CEO Report
Minister Hollinrake MP, C Creswell and assistant joined at 13:30.
TABLED and NOTED was the CEO report.

The Chairman welcomed the Minister and passed over to NR to present the CEO Report.
NR spoke to the report advising that the Company had had a very good half year in terms
of trade, and that the Company’s travel and bill payments businesses had continued to
perform well. The mails business was behind however, and we were seeing a tightening in
consumer confidence, with a slowdown in banking and travel. The Company was losing
approximately £250k a day in mails trading due to RMG industrial action, and this was
anticipated to be significantly higher as December progressed and RMG industrial action
continued. There was anxiety about the FCA deposit limit issue. With the slow-down in
the mails trade a shortfall in our funding over the next few years was forecast. The
Inquiry, extending now potentially into 2024, was going to cost the Company more,
however we wished to support the Inquiry to the best of our ability. One of the
implications of the Inquiry was in relation to the roll out of NBIT; the technology needed to

work first time, the roll out exercise was vast, and the exercise was massively time bound.
This compression of activity within a very short time frame would have many impacts.

BT noted that parts of the business were positive, however the Company had significant
issues to face including the Inquiry and wider external factors. An issue of some urgency
for the Board was determining the optimal size and shape of the network, which needed
to be co-ordinated with BEIS and the Minister.

The Minister replied that as a constituency MP he was well aware of how important Post
Office was to the community, particularly with other services being withdrawn such as
banking. The Minister advised that he wished to understand the social value of the Post
Office further, and that he was keen to work on the next 3YP to facilitate the network size
and preserve the Company’s commercial value. The Minister referenced the Energy Bill
Relief Scheme and advised that he was hopeful that this would extend to the Post Office.
The Minister advised that he appreciated the support given by Post Office in relation to
resolving historical issues and in relation to the Inquiry.

SI detailed some of the headwinds for Postmasters including an anticipated increase in
minimum wage, rising energy prices, RMG industrial action, and the FCA imposition of
banking limits. Postmasters did not feel that there was any government assistance that
was specifically for Postmasters; could Postmasters be permanently classified as
vulnerable business status? The pandemic had demonstrated how important Post Offices
were in the community. Many Postmasters were hanging on for peak December trading,
however some may not be able to continue into the new year. The Minister replied that
these were going to be difficult times, however he was hopeful Post office would see some
benefit from an extension of the Energy Bill Support Scheme. In terms of limits on deposit
payments, the Minister had written to HM Treasury suggesting that there should be a risk-
based approach applied not a blanket approach. The Minister advised that he would be
agreeable to receiving suggestions on how the work the government provided to Post
Offices could be better.

LH referenced the strategic direction of the Company and that the Board was interested to
understand early ideas on the BEIS policy review. The Minister replied that he was keen to
work with Post Office on this and invited the Board to come to the Minister with
recommendations. AC advised that there would be difficult and unpopular decisions to be
made in the near future, such as closing rural branches that were loss making that sat
outside the access criteria. ZP contributed that the Board needed to keep sight of the fact
that the mails business was in structural decline and that in 5 to 10 years-time Post Office
needed to be a different business which delivered a good income for Postmasters, as well
as being commercially sustainable. BT advised that the Board would value the support and
advice of the Minister; the Minister replied that he would be pleased to work with the Post
Office to achieve what was necessary.

Minister Hollinrake MP, C Creswell and assistant left the meeting at 14:07.

BT called for questions on the CEO Report. ZP referenced the Employee Survey results and
queried whether these could these be shared. NR spoke to the results, advising that he
was due to work through these with J Davies, and that he was acutely aware that he would
need to attend the Inquiry in September 2023 and advise of cultural changes at the
Company.

EJ referenced point 36 in relation to SSKs and queried what the approach was between
now and the roll out of NBIT. EJ noted the value that could be extracted if customers
could self-serve for returns using NBIT. NR replied that there was no further funding for
SSKs, however we were exploring options for a prototype and funding via our partnership
with WH Smith plc (‘WHS’). EJ pointed out the risks associated with not progressing with
the development of SSKs. LH queried, when negotiating with WHS, whether we had
settled if any solution would be proprietary to them? NR replied that it could not be,
however this part of the ongoing discussions with WHS.

TC noted the Metropolitan police investigation and queried whether this involved any
current Fujitsu employees. BT suggested that TC ask BF.

Finance
Financial Performance Report

TABLED and NOTED was a report, ‘P7 — Performance Overview’.
NB joined the meeting at 14:28.

AC spoke to the Report noting the financial impacts of the RMG strikes, and the analytical
work and practical steps proposed in relation to reviewing Postmaster losses.

LH noted that she had met with Z Partos earlier in the week, and that there was a need for
the business to become more analytical and that this capability needed to be built
internally. AC agreed with this, however advised that there was no funding available to
develop this. TC referenced previous practices that had been undertaken by the Company
in relation to reviewing Postmaster losses and queried why these were no longer
undertaken. AC advised that there had been significant staff turnover in the relevant
teams in Chesterfield. In addition, the pandemic had caused the business to pause
different practical activities, however these had never been re-commenced, and remote
working was not conducive to the collaboration required for these activities. NR
contributed that recruiting to Chesterfield had been difficult however the Retail
Operations Director was now in situ and would be assisting.

AC advised that the current forecast was that branch numbers would be below 11,500 if
Drop and Go’s were not included. TC noted that this was anticipated by BEIS.

In relation to Postmaster remuneration, the expectation of this increasing was
deteriorating due to Mails trading. NR noted that the Postmaster variable remuneration
rate was down for the first time this period, and this could be flat by the end of the year.
In terms of any trading profit, the Board would need to think carefully about how this was
distributed. TC shared his view that there was a significant issue here; with minimum
wage increases set for April 2023 and the impact on Postmasters, yet the Company would
be in discussion with BEIS at this time; increasing Postmaster remuneration at the same
time as requesting funding would be a difficult position to maintain, however. AC replied
that we were very clear at the Postmaster Business Update that a review of Postmaster
remuneration would be undertaken again in Q4, and that any additional remuneration was
likely to be in the form of a one-off payment; we were very conscious of BEIS’ reaction. EJ
shared his view as to the need for the Company to act promptly in relation to Postmaster
remuneration in order to preserve branch numbers. BT observed that there were 2 parts
to this issue, firstly, what was the correct quantum of any increase and secondly how any
increase would be communicated to the shareholder.

ACTION SI queried the position on the value of non-barcoded stamps in the network. AC
advised that he would issue SI a note on this. AC

BG referenced our relationship with RMG and thought that coming out of the Industrial
Action RMG would be desperate to re-build their volume; this could present an
opportunity for us, in helping RMG rebuild their business. NR took the point, however
advised that the Post Office was the most expensive channel for RMG.

Three Year Strategic Plan
TM joined the meeting at 14:57.
TABLED and NOTED was a report, ‘Three Year Strategic Plan/ 3YP Update’.

AC spoke to the paper advising that the approach to Phase 3 of HI, Copper Stop Sell, the
NBIT roll out plan, and HMU and Inquiry spend, which comprised major building blocks for
the 3YP, would be brought for consideration at the January Board. In terms of applying for
additional funding, this could be sought in a less traditional way, given the usual process
could take a significant amount of time, we may not receive the totality of the funding
needed, and there could be conditions imposed. Given the funding requirements for any
of the above items could get materially worse we would need to propose ranges, and the
approach could be speaking to BEIS about funding in tranches and repurposing unapplied
funding allocated for historical compensation schemes.

ZP emphasised the need for the draft 3YP to be credible and for the Board to have
confidence it was executable. ZP shared her view as to the 2 major areas of risk, being
firstly the Inquiry, and queried the must do activities of the Inquiry for example disclosure,
and raised opportunities for savings in relation to engaging cheaper external legal
resource. The second major area of risk as ZP saw it was in relation to NBIT where a well
costed plan was crucial; the Board needed more oversight and to be sure that any funding
ask was as robust as possible. TC advised that he was concerned about the timing for
seeking additional funding; whilst we were in discussion with BEIS we could cross critical
points of no return, and decisions could be required without clarity as to the funding
available. TC further advised that an option could be to apply for emergency funding for
NBIT and the Inquiry now to support activities for a 12-month period, and to raise the
position on Postmaster remuneration. TC shared his view that he thought parts of BEIS
could be receptive to this approach at this point in time. AC advised that in practice there
would be activities we would not scale back on if it meant we were approaching security
headroom such as the Inquiry and NBIT.

NBIT Training Deepdive
AMH, ZM, GC and MR joined the meeting at 15:35.
TABLED and NOTED was a report, ‘Training for NBIT full-counter roll-out’.

EJ noted that the vast majority of the group of Postmasters that would require NBIT
training were not otherwise skilled in IT and queried whether Postmasters could be
involved in delivering the training as well, given their incisive practical knowledge. AMH
replied that for the virtual training there was the intention to use Postmasters to assist to
deliver the learning, and that the approach was very much designing and implementing
the training for NBIT in collaboration with Postmasters.

EJ advised that he had attended the Aldwych Post Office last week, and the feedback from
the Postmaster there and staff was that the learnings had come when they were able to
access the screen in the NBIT environment. GC replied that there would be an option for
Postmasters to go into a simulated NBIT environment, and that the approach was not
going to be training every single transactional journey; the feedback received was that
once teams saw one transactional journey completed, they were comfortable.

NR advised that risk assessments were being undertaken via the area managers to assess
which Postmasters would likely need more assistance than other. LH stressed that we
could not underestimate the importance of Postmaster competency in relation to NBIT,
and that she was supportive of pausing the go live to NBIT for Postmasters who had not
demonstrated competency. LH noted that costings for the NBIT training programme
would need to come back to the Board. LH noted the current training in place for new
Postmasters in respect of Horizon, however commented that the sooner we could move
training across for new Postmaster to NBIT the better. LH queried whether we had a date
in mind for commencing training for new Postmasters solely on NBIT. AMH replied from
April 2024.

BT referenced the action to be addressed in relation to NBIT training costs; this was not
just the cost base, it was also information as to the difference in costs as against the NBIT
training originally proposed. ZM advised that this information would be provided to the
Board for the January meeting.

SI raised utilising the NFSP to assist in delivering the training and shared his view that
providing access to simulated training for Postmasters as soon as possible would be
valuable. SI queried the use of Area Managers to assess training needs. NR took the point,
however advised that the purpose of this was to have a preliminary assessment as to what
might be required.

SI emphasized the need to implement the training correctly the first time. AMH advised
that a learning management system would be opened to all, and that Postmasters would
be able to see how many of their team had undertaken the training ahead of the NBIT go
live date for that branch. GC contributed that the feedback the team were getting was
that the front office side of the journey was pretty intuitive, however some of the back-
office processes were more difficult and represented more of a change so the training was
aimed more at this aspect. EJ raised the issue of Postmasters who solely ran rural
branches and who may not have a separate device for undertaking the training. GC replied
that the training could be undertaken piecemeal and that the team were looking at
additional device options. TC noted that a timetable for training implementation would
have been a useful addition to the paper. TC queried how the team were collating
feedback from Postmasters in relation of the proposed training. AMH advised the Aldwych
branch training had consisted of providing training for every journey; the feedback was
that the Postmaster and staff did not need training for every journey, so the team had
reduced the number of journeys trained, which should position the team to moderate the
level of training required. ACTION As to TC’s comment in relation to a timetable for the
training implementation, the team had this and this information could be shared. 2M

AMH, GC, and ZM left the meeting at 16:02. LH left the meeting at 16:03.
