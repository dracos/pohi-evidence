Dear Lee
Re: Entries at top of Final Balance

I am writing to clarify the entries at the top of the final balance. The final
balance shows the discrepancies in that balance period. During the week,
if snap shots are taken then the NET discrepancy is brought forward from
the previous week. If you look back to when the office was balancing you
will see that the NET loss or gain flows through into the next week, until a
final balance is produced. The final balance shows the discrepancies for
that cash account week.

Transferring an amount into table 2a in the suspense account means that
the system then puts the loss to one side and you continue with a straight
balance.

On the first week that you transferred the loss into the suspense account,
‘the previous weeks Net loss flowed through, as would be seen if
snapshots were taken. Then when a final balance is produced the

. discrepancies are shown for that week. You produced a perfect balance
e.g. no loss or gain, therefore the net discrepancy was nil.

On the week that you transferred the second amount into the suspense
account, you had a further loss so the net discrepancy was this further
joss. That is why the two final balances don’t look similar.

Please also find enclosed a copy of the interview notes.

Yours sincerely
