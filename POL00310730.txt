Subject: RE: BIS Committee hearing 3 February 2015

I have explained to the Clark that we should give evidence separately to SS for the reasons Mark set out in his email
yesterday. They are not budging — citing time restrictions, questions will be about process rather than individual

cases.
Belinda’s shorter email looks fine to me.
Can we discuss the way forward at 5pm?

Draft response from Chris to lan of Second Sight - grateful for views on whether any more is needed. I
think we should keep it short and simple.

Best wishes

Belinda

Dear lan

Thanks for your email and for forwarding me the email from the Clerk. I understand why you have
checked with me and thank you for doing so. Post Office would, of course, not object to Second Sight
speaking with the Committee as part of a panel of witnesses.

Regards
Chris

Chris

I have been invited to appear before the BIS Committee at 10:30 on 3 February 2015. The subject is “PO
mediation scheme: evidence to BIS Committee”.

This would appear to a be matter where I require the written consent of Post Office Limited, as the
information being considered falls within the terms of Section 6 of our Engagement Letter dated 1 July

2014.

I assume that POL will not object to Second Sight giving evidence to BIS, but I would be grateful for your
written approval to do this, in accordance with the terms of our engagement.

lam copying this email to Jessica Montgomery, Second Clerk, Business, Innovation and Skills Committee.
I would be grateful for a prompt reply to this letter.
With best wishes
