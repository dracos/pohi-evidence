>> As expected, the programme made some very serious and unsubstantiated allegations about the business. It overlooked some key
pieces of evidence in doing so. It was very disappointing in its partial and sensationalist nature. However it did not throw up any
allegations we had not expected.

>> We were monitoring it very closely and will be assessing next steps, whether legal or through formal complaints to the BBC.

>> We will also consider wider tactics and strategy to seek to get a more accurate picture out in the open.

>> In doing so we will assess the level of follow up to the programme over the coming hours and days.
