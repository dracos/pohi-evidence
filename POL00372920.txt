PART 2 — OPERATING A LOCAL BRANCH

The Operator and the Branch

The Operator agrees to operate the Branch on behalf of Post
Office Ltd in accordance with the terms of the Agreement
(including for the avoidance of doubt the Manual).

The Agreement is a contract for services and the Operator is an
agent and not an employee of Post Office Ltd. The Operator
acknowledges that no relationship of employer and employee exists
between Post Office Ltd and the Operator, or between Post Office
Ltd and any Assistant.

The National Federation of Subpostmasters (the NFSP) is an
independent members organisation supporting operators of Post
Office branches across the UK and is solely acknowledged by Post
Office Ltd as a representative body of operators. The NFSP is the
only body with which Post Office Ltd will seek to discuss and
consult on matters affecting operators, subject to any legal,
regulatory or political obligations. Such discussions will take
place within the existing and developing relationship framework.

For clarity, the Operator is permitted to provide the Products
and Services from the Branch Premises but not from any other
location (unless otherwise agreed in advance in writing between
the Parties).

The Operator shall open the Branch to Customers during at least
the Minimum Hours.

Post Office Ltd shall provide:

1.6.1 a helpline to enable the Operator to consult with Post
Office Ltd about running the Branch (details of the helpline
are contained within the Manual);

1.6.2 the Operator with stocks of Products and documentation to
use in the Branch,

Post Office Ltd has the right to enter into contracts or
arrangements with Clients for the handling of Products or the
supply of Services by the Network (including the Branch) on such
terms as Post Office Ltd considers fit. Post Office Ltd retains
the discretion as to where within the Network particular products
and services are offered.

Where the Operator is a partnership, each partner shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the performance or non-
performance of the Operator’s obligations in the Agreement.

ROLL OUT PHASE
The Operator shall notify Post Office Ltd of any changes to the
nature of the Basic Business (including through the addition of
any new category of business), and Post Office Ltd may terminate
the Agreement on not less than 1 months' notice, or immediately
if Post Office Ltd reasonably regards such change as bringing
Post Office Ltd and/or the Branch and/or its business into
disrepute.

Assistants and Training

The Operator shall ensure at all times that only Assistants have
any access to or involvement with the Branch and Post Office
Ltd’s information systems, but this shall not restrict any access
by Post Office Ltd and/or its authorised representatives to the
Branch and Post Office Ltd’s information systems.

The Operator shall comply with the Manual regarding obtaining
Post Office Ltd’s approval of prospective Assistants and shall
also cooperate fully in any ongoing periodic checks of Assistants
required by Post Office Ltd during the Term.

Where Post Office Ltd considers it necessary, it shall initially
train the first Manager and such number of Assistants as Post
Office Ltd shall determine, in the operation of the System at the
Branch.

The Operator shall ensure that the first Manager cascades the
training to all other Assistants and to any replacement Manager
in order to ensure that all subsequent Managers and all other
Assistants receive sufficient initial training from properly
trained Managers.

Post Office Ltd may require the Manager and/or the Assistants to
undertake further training at any reasonable location and time
during the Term if Post Office Ltd:

2.5.1 reasonably considers such training to be essential; or

2.5.2 wishes to train them in new and improved techniques which
have been devised and which the Operator will be required to
use in operating the System.

The Operator shall ensure that Managers and Assistants attend the
training provided by Post Office Ltd under clauses [ REF
_Ref321143299 \r \h \* MERGEFORMAT ] and [ REF _Ref300218610 \r
\h \* MERGEFORMAT ].

Any failure by the Operator to comply with its obligations
pursuant to this clause [ REF Ref198641682 \r \h \* MERGEFORMAT
] shall be deemed to be a material breach of the Agreement and
any failure by the Operator to comply with clause [ REF
_Ref324768356 \r \h ] only shall be deemed to be a material
breach of the Agreement which cannot be remedied.

2.9.5 itself provide, and procure from all its Personnel an
undertaking, in the form specified or referred to in the
Manual, not to use or disclose to any third party any
Official Information or Personal Data which they may
acquire. The Operator shall provide all Personnel with a
copy of their undertaking as a reminder of the obligations
contained in it. The Operator shall take such steps at its
own expense as Post Office Ltd may require in order to
enforce this undertaking and/or to restrain any breach of
ity

2.9.6 immediately notify Post Office Ltd of any request made to
the Operator, an Assistant or any other Personnel by any
person for information which may be confidential (including
any Official Information and/or Personal Data) or any
request for information under the Freedom of Information Act
2000 relating to the Branch, Post Office Ltd, the Agreement
or any related matter and shall not comply with such a
request until it has obtained Post Office Ltd’s written
consent to the disclosure;

2.9.7 if there is any allegation or evidence of fraud or dishonest
conduct or criminal activity on the part of the Operator,
the Manager, the Assistants, any Customers or any other
person, including any practice undertaken by the Operator

his duties, including by making reasonable and responsible
statements to the media, provided that any such statements
are in accordance with the requirements of clauses [ REF

PART 3 - FINANCIAL DETAILS
Equipment, Works and Funding

The Operator shall be responsible for the cost of the Operator
Funded Works and the Operator Funded Equipment and for ensuring
that they are carried out or obtained in accordance with the
Agreement.

Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for the cost of the Post
Office Ltd Funded Works up to the Investment Amount and for the
costs of obtaining and installing the Post Office Ltd Funded
Equipment, in accordance with, and subject to, the process
outlined in this clause [ REF _Ref332965279 \r \h ]. In addition,
Post Office Ltd shall also be responsible for the costs of any
making safe or associated works at the Branch Premises that are
required as a result of the removal of Post Office Ltd's
equipment by Post Office Ltd's contractors, up to the amount
agreed in writing by Post Office Ltd, and in any event capped at
a maximum of £1,000 (inclusive of VAT). For the avoidance of
doubt, where such an amount is agreed by Post Office Ltd, it
shall be in addition to the Investment Amount. Any cost of making
safe or any associated works in excess of such agreed amount
shall be borne by the Operator. Clause [ REF _Ref323107700 \r \h
J] of this Part 3 shall apply to these works.

Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for ensuring that each item
of the Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment is obtained and installed
in the Branch Premises in accordance with the Agreement and in
particular, entering into contracts with the relevant suppliers
and contractors for the supply and installation of the Post
Office Ltd Funded Equipment and making payment directly to such
suppliers and contractors engaged by Post Office Ltd.

The Operator shall be responsible for ensuring that each element
of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works is carried out in accordance
with the Agreement unless Appendix 1 to the Preface specifically
and expressly indicates that Post Office Ltd is responsible for
arranging any element of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works.

Where the Operator is responsible for ensuring that any Post

Office Ltd Funded Works are carried out, the Operator will:

1.5.1 prior to the Commencement Date, have obtained, in accordance
with the instructions and format prescribed by Post Office

Ltd (including as to the number of quotes that the Operator
is required to provide), quotes for each part of the Post

Office Ltd Funded Works that the Operator is required to
arrange, for Post Office Ltd to review and approve.

For the avoidance of doubt:

(a) Post Office Ltd's approval of a quote is not an approval
of the relevant contractor or its work; and

(b) the Operator shall only engage a contractor in relation
to whom it has provided a quote to Post Office Ltd in
accordance with this clause [ REF Ref346097609 \r \h ];

1.5.2 having received from Post Office Ltd, in writing, approval
of the relevant quotes and/or confirmation of the amount
which Post Office Ltd is willing to spend on the Post Office
Ltd Funded Works which the Operator is responsible for
arranging, and subject to any obligations in relation to
the start of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works in the
Preface, enter into contracts with the relevant contractors
for the supply of those Post Office Ltd Funded Works which
the Operator is responsible for arranging;

1.5.3 ensure that the Post Office Ltd Funded Works which the
Operator is responsible for arranging are completed with
reasonable care and skill by reputable, competent
contractors which hold all necessary qualifications,
registrations, accreditations and certificates in order to
be able to carry out the Post Office Ltd Funded Works, and
which have in place insurance that, as a minimum, covers all
risks which the contractor is obliged by law to insure
against. If requested by Post Office Ltd the Operator shall
provide reasonable evidence of any such qualifications etc.
and insurances to Post Office Ltd;

1.5.4 notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or
Appendix 1 to the Preface, at Post Office Ltd’s request, the
Operator shall engage Post Office Ltd’s preferred
contractors to undertake that part of the Post Office Ltd
Funded Works (if any) which the Operator is responsible for
arranging; and

1.5.5 subject to clause [ REF _Ref322010000 \r \h ] of this Part
3, pay the relevant contractors directly for their work.

Subject to clause [ REF Ref322010030 \r \h ] of this Part 3,
Post Office Ltd shall reimburse the Operator for the costs
actually incurred by the Operator in respect of the Post Office
Ltd Funded Works which the Operator is responsible for arranging,
up to the Investment Amount, and any making safe or associated
works agreed by the Parties in accordance with clause [ REF
_Ref346098635 \r \h ] of this Part 3, provided that:

1.6.1 at the time of seeking reimbursement, the Operator must
provide Post Office Ltd with a valid VAT invoice from each
of the Operator’s contractors, identifying a breakdown of
work, together with evidence acceptable to Post Office Ltd
that the Operator has paid such invoices;

1.6.2 Post Office Ltd is satisfied that the Post Office Ltd Funded
Works have been carried out to the required standard, in
accordance with the relevant specification and completed on
time and the Operator shall allow Post Office Ltd or its
agents access to the Branch Premises to enable it to make an
inspection for this purpose;

1.6.3 if the total costs of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works are
more than the Investment Amount (or in the case of any
making safe or associated works, the amount agreed by the
Parties in accordance with clause [ REF _Ref346098635 \r \h
] above) and Post Office Ltd incurs the excess cost, Post
Office Ltd shall invoice the Operator for such excess cost
and the Operator shall reimburse Post Office Ltd within 7
days of the date of such invoice; and

1.6.4 if the actual final cost of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works
(as determined by Post Office Ltd on production by the
Operator where required of all relevant documents, including
receipts, invoices etc.) is less than the Investment Amount
the Investment Amount due from Post Office Ltd shall be
reduced accordingly.

If the anticipated costs of the Post Office Ltd Funded Works are
higher or likely to be higher than the Investment Amount because
of unforeseen circumstances (for example, if asbestos is found at
the Branch Premises), or any additional works are required, the
Operator will promptly notify Post Office Ltd. The Parties shall
discuss any such additional anticipated costs prior to such costs
being incurred, and endeavour to agree which of the Parties shall
be responsible for meeting the costs. For the avoidance of doubt,
Post Office Ltd shall not in any circumstances be liable for the
cost of any Post Office Ltd Funded Works or additional works
(whether arranged by Post Office Ltd or the Operator) in excess
of the Investment Amount, unless otherwise expressly agreed in
writing by Post Office Ltd.

Repayment of Set Up Costs

If the Agreement is terminated at any time prior to, or within 18

Premises,

the Operator shall, if required by Post Office Ltd, on demand,
pay to Post Office Ltd a proportion of the Set Up Costs incurred
by Post Office Ltd in respect of the Agreement.

For the purposes of this clause [ REF _Ref327799737 \r \h ], Set
Up Costs means the costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in relation
to the Post Office Ltd Funded Works, the Post Office Ltd Funded
Equipment and any other costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in
respect of the Operator, the Branch and the Branch Premises
pursuant to the Agreement prior to the Start Date.

The amount to be paid under clause [ REF _Ref327799694 \r \*

Costs in the same proportion as the number of days from the date
of termination to the date falling 18 months after the Start Date
bears to the full 18 month period, but in any event the pro-rated
amount to be paid by the Operator shall not be more than £8,000.
Post Office Ltd will notify the Operator in writing of the pro-
rated amount owed and provide a breakdown of the relevant Set Up
Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Agreement is
terminated prior to the Start Date, or prior to Post Office Ltd
notifying the Operator of the Start Date in accordance with the
Preface, the Operator shall repay any Set Up Costs to Post Office
Ltd in full.

Fees Booklet

The Fees Booklet (and the Products, Services and Fees referred to
in it) may be varied by Post Office Ltd at any time by an
amendment or addition to the Fees Booklet or otherwise by written
notification by Post Office Ltd to the Operator. Any such
amendment or addition to the Fees Booklet shall take effect on
the date set out in the notification to the Operator, and it is
acknowledged that any such change may take effect immediately.

The Operator acknowledges that it shall not be entitled to
receive any compensation or other sums in the event of any
variation to the Fees Booklet (and the Products, Services and
Fees referred to in it).

Those Products and Services listed in the Fees Booklet and marked
with an asterisk (*) (Direct Sale Products and Services) are
those in respect of which either:

3.3.1 sales cannot be concluded in the Branch by the Operator
and/or its Assistants but can only be concluded as a result

of Customers subsequently contacting internet websites or
call centres operated on behalf of Post Office Ltd; or

3.3.2 (where Post Office Ltd has specified this to the Operator in
writing in respect of any Direct Sale Product or Service),
sales can be concluded both in the Branch and as a result of
Customers subsequently contacting internet websites or call
centres operated on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

In relation to Direct Sale Products and Services, the references
in the Fees Booklet to “per Transaction”, “per policy”, “per
bond”, “per £1 sales”, “per loan” etc. are references to the
actual conclusion of the sale of the relevant Direct Sale Product
or Service, whether through such websites or call centres or
(where Post Office Ltd has specified in accordance with clause [
REF _Ref324769152 \r \h ] of this Part 3) in the Branch, and do
not refer merely to any introduction of Customers to the Direct
Sale Product or Service made by the Operator or its Assistants in
the Branch.

Provided that the Operator complies with the Agreement, Post
Office Ltd will pay the Operator the Fees as follows:

3.4.1 the Fees payable in respect of each Transaction (or series
of Transactions) of Direct Sale Products and Services which
is attributable to an introduction made by the Operator or
its Assistants, shall be paid no later than 3 calendar
months following the date on which the sale of the Direct
Sale Product or Service is concluded;

3.4.2 the Fees payable in respect of each Transaction (or series
of Transactions) of all Products and Services conducted
using a Horizon, paystation™ or other terminal shall be paid
by the end of the calendar month following the Accounting
Period in which the relevant Transaction (or series of
Transactions) took place.

For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any
provision in the Fees Booklet, Post Office Ltd shall not pay any
Fees to the Operator in respect of any Transaction which Post
Office Ltd reasonably believes to have been undertaken by the
Operator (or any Assistant) with a view to artificially inflating
the Fees (and where such Fees have already been paid by Post
Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd shall be entitled to deduct an
equivalent amount from any future payment due to the Operator).

Unless otherwise specified in the Preface with regard to the Fees
payable in the first and second Accounting Periods following the
Start Date:

3.5.1 the amount of Fees payable from the Start Date shall be a
variable monthly payment, calculated on a “per Transaction”

accordance with the Fees Booklet; and

3.5.2 the Operator shall not be entitled to receive Fees after the
date of termination of the Agreement for Transactions
carried out during the last one (1) Accounting Period of the
Term. The Operator acknowledges that this is reasonable in
view of either the First Fees Payment(s) made by Post Office
Ltd to the Operator in accordance with the Preface (if any)
or the Fees otherwise paid to the Operator in the first two
calendar months in respect of transactions carried out at
the Branch by the Existing Subpostmaster prior to the Start
Date. The Operator may receive Fees in the last calendar
month during the Term for Transactions carried out in
preceding Accounting Periods.

If the Operator is not registered for VAT on the Commencement
Date and is subsequently required to register for VAT he shall do
so and shall notify Post Office Ltd of the registration in a
timely manner. If the Operator fails to register for VAT when
required to do so or fails to promptly notify Post Office Ltd of
his VAT registration, the Operator, and not Post Office Ltd,
shall be responsible for the value of any claim from HMRC for VAT
on the payments made to the Operator under the Agreement and the
Operator shall reimburse Post Office Ltd on demand and in full in
respect of any such claim.

Where the Operator is registered for VAT, the Fees are exclusive
of any VAT (which shall be payable by Post Office Ltd in addition
where applicable).

Post Office Ltd and the Operator agree that a self-billing
arrangement will operate in respect of the Fees due under the
Agreement. Therefore the Parties agree that:

3.8.1 Post Office Ltd will issue self-billing invoices showing the
Operator’s name, address and VAT registration number (where
applicable), together with all other details which
constitute a full VAT invoice, for the Fees due to the
Operator;

3.8.2 the Operator will accept each self-billing invoice raised by
Post Office Ltd and agrees not to raise VAT invoices for
Fees due to it under the Agreement;

3.8.3 the Operator shall promptly notify Post Office Ltd if it
becomes aware of any error in the amount of VAT (if any)
shown on any self-billing invoice produced by Post Office

3.8.4 the self-billing arrangement will continue until the

3.8.6 the Operator will provide Post Office Ltd with its VAT
registration number and will notify Post Office Ltd
immediately if it changes its bank details, becomes VAT
registered, changes its VAT registration number, ceases to
be VAT registered, or sells the Basic Business or part of
the Basic Business;

3.8.7 the Operator is responsible for accounting to HMRC for the
output VAT (if applicable) shown on each self-billing
invoice produced by Post Office Ltd.

Training costs

The cost of the initial training referred to in clauses [ REF
_Ref291248177 \r \* MERGEFORMAT ] and [ REF _Ref300218610 \r \*
MERGEFORMAT ] of Part 2 shall be met by Post Office Ltd in

accordance with those clauses. The cost of all other training
provided by or on behalf of Post Office Ltd in respect of the
Branch shall be met by the Operator. Such cost shall be as
notified to the Operator at the time and shall be payable by the
Operator to Post Office Ltd within 7 days of receipt of an
invoice.

No benefit received from an Existing Subpostmaster

The Operator warrants to Post Office Ltd that it has not given
to, or received from, the Existing Subpostmaster (or any
Connected Person on behalf of or connected with the Existing
Subpostmaster) any benefit in money or money's worth in
connection with the Operator’s appointment pursuant to the

purposes of clause (I REF _Ref325987588 \r ] of Part 2.

For the avoidance of doubt, clause [ REF _Ref305679720 \r \h ]

In this clause [ REF _Ref329252706 \r \h ], Purpose shall mean
paying suppliers for the Post Office Ltd Funded Works and/or

applicable). If the Investment Amount paid by Post Office Ltd to
the Operator or any additional amount paid by Post Office Ltd to

such part of the Investment Amount or other amount paid by Post
Office Ltd which Post Office Ltd determines has not been properly

If the Operator at any time owes any money to Post Office Ltd
under the Agreement or any other contract or agreement, Post
Office Ltd may deduct such money from any amount due to the
Operator under the Agreement or any other contract or agreement

PART 4 — EQUIPMENT FOR A LOCAL BRANCH

Post Office Ltd will loan to the Operator the Post Office Ltd
Funded Equipment for the Term for use in the Branch, subject to
the Operator complying with its obligations in this Part 4.

The responsibility of each of the Parties for procuring and
maintaining each item of Equipment is summarised in Appendix 2 to
the Preface.

Post Office Ltd may from time to time after the Commencement Date
add or remove items of Equipment for use in the Branch in
Appendix 2 of the Preface by issuing a Notice to Amend but the
obligations to maintain and/or repair any item of Equipment in
Appendix 2 as at the Commencement Date shall not be varied. Post
Office Ltd shall be responsible for the cost of supplying and
maintaining any such additional items of Equipment.

The Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment shall at all times remain

the safe). The Operator shall be liable for any loss of, or

damage to, any Equipment where Post Office Ltd reasonably
believes such loss or damage is the result of any negligence by
the Operator, his Personnel or otherwise or any breach of the
Agreement, wilful default, error or criminal act of the Operator
or any Personnel.

Where Appendix 2 of the Preface so specifies, the Operator shall
be responsible for arranging and ensuring all repairs and
maintenance of, and shall observe all statutory obligations and
regulations in respect of the operation of, the relevant item of
Equipment. Post Office Ltd will maintain the Horizon equipment
and Post Office Ltd shall be responsible, at its cost, for
repairing inherent defects in any other item of the Post Office
Ltd Funded Equipment which are not caused by the act or omission
of the Operator or its Personnel.

The Operator shall:

unless otherwise agreed by Post Office Ltd in writing, ensure
that all Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment is used exclusively for
the operation of the Branch but the Operator may use the bidi
safe for the Basic Business as well as the Branch but only in
relation to small amounts of cash, on a short term basis and at
the risk of the Operator;

not move any item of Post Office Ltd Funded Equipment (other than
items which are intended to be moved as part of their day to day
use or for the purposes of maintenance and repair) without the
prior written permission of Post Office Ltd. The Operator shall
be responsible for the cost of moving any Equipment where such
move is at the Operator’s request or is necessary to comply with
legislation or regulatory requirements, unless Post Office Ltd
agrees in writing, at its sole discretion, to contribute to such
costs. Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for the cost of
moving the Equipment where such move is at Post Office Ltd’s
request;

be responsible for the continued operation of all Equipment
throughout the Term and shall ensure that any Assistants are
trained in basic operations, replenishment of consumables and
follow security procedures. The Operator is responsible for
reporting system faults and failures to the appropriate helpline

the Horizon equipment, Post Office Ltd may from time to time loan
the Operator (and the Operator shall accept) a paystation™
terminal for use in conducting Transactions and/or additional

Office Ltd will discuss with the Operator the position within the
Branch Premises where the PO Terminals are to be located, but, in
the absence of agreement, Post Office Ltd (acting reasonably)
will determine such location. Where Post Office Ltd does provide
PO Terminals, the Operator shall ensure that they are used solely
to conduct Transactions. Post Office Ltd will arrange (whether
directly or through the Operator) for the PO Terminals to be
installed at the specified location.

The Operator grants to Post Office Ltd, its agents and employees
an irrevocable licence at any time during the opening hours of
the Branch Premises, or at any time in the case of an emergency,
during the Term or any time following the termination of the
Agreement, to enter any premises or vehicle where the Post Office
Ltd Funded Equipment is or may be kept for the purpose of
inspecting it or recovering it.

Post Office Ltd will supply certain consumables (being those
which can be ordered via Horizon for use in the Branch) in
reasonable quantities free of charge to the Operator. Any such
supply shall be subject to such conditions as Post Office Ltd may
determine and Post Office Ltd may limit or withdraw such supply
at its discretion.

Any consumables which are supplied to the Operator free of charge
by Post Office Ltd or on Post Office Ltd’s behalf must only be
used in the operation of the Branch and must not be resold or
transferred to a third party. Where the Operator has surplus
consumables it should advise Post Office Ltd of this fact and, as
appropriate, arrange with Post Office Ltd for the return of the
excess quantity.

Where there is a dedicated official telephone line at the Branch
Premises, which is used in the operation of the Branch, the Post
Office Ltd split billing policy (as contained in the Manual or
otherwise notified to the Operator from time to time) shall apply
in respect of such official telephone line. If Post Office Ltd
determines that a second telephone line (which is in addition to
the one provided by Post Office Ltd) is required in order to
operate the Branch, such second telephone line shall be arranged
by the Operator but will be paid for by Post Office Ltd unless
Post Office Ltd determines that such second telephone line is
only needed because the Operator is using unnecessary equipment
on the first telephone line which has not been approved by Post
Office Ltd.

Approval of fixtures and fittings and equipment
1 The Operator shall use only fixtures and fittings in the
operation of the Branch as shall have been previously approved in

writing by Post Office Ltd.

Signage and point of sale equipment

1 Immediately prior to the Start Date, the Operator shall at Post
Office Ltd's direction ensure, at its own cost, that any existing
obsolete Post Office internal and external branding and signage
is removed from the Branch Premises. If the Operator fails to do
so, and then fails to within 14 days of a written notice from
Post Office Ltd requiring the Operator to remove such obsolete
branding and signage in accordance with this clause, Post Office
Ltd may enter into the Branch Premises during the Minimum Hours
and without the consent of the Operator, remove any such items at
the expense of the Operator. The Operator shall pay such expenses
to Post Office Ltd on demand or Post Office Ltd may, at its
option, deduct the value of such expenses from the amount of the
Investment Amount or other sums due to the Operator.

2 The Operator shall display in such manner and upon such external
part or parts of the Branch Premises as Post Office Ltd may
reasonably direct, a sign or signs bearing the title of the
Branch (in the format “{blank] Post Office®”) (or such other
words to similar effect as may from time to time be specified by
Post Office Ltd) and if the Branch Premises are in _ the

Manual up to date. If there is any dispute, the authentic text of
the Manual shall be the copy or copies kept by Post Office Ltd at
its head office. The Manual shall at all times remain the
property of Post Office Ltd.

1.3 Post Office Ltd may amend the list of documents set out in this
Part 5 and amend the contents of any manual or documents on that
list by giving written notification (which may be by electronic
means) to the Operator. In the Agreement, unless otherwise
specified, a reference to the Manual is a reference to it as
amended, consolidated or extended by Post Office Ltd from time to
time.

1.4 The Operator shall operate the System properly so as to achieve
the performance standards in accordance with the provisions of
the Manual current from time to time. The Operator shall not make
use of the Manual for any purpose other than for the operation of
the Branch. The Operator shall ensure that its copy of the Manual

complying with its obligations in clause [ REF _Ref324769324 \r
\h ] of this Part 5.

1.5 In addition to the Manual, Post Office Ltd may issue to the

and Services to be transacted at the Branch and the design and
operational standards required to run the Branch.

1.6 All such instructions must be complied with immediately (unless
otherwise notified by Post Office Ltd) and must be kept up to
date by incorporation of updates issued by Post Office Ltd. They

Assistants. No breach of instructions will be excused on the
grounds of ignorance.

PART 6 — NON COMPETE RESTRICTIONS AND HOW THEY AFFECT BRANCH PREMISES

A. During the Term of the Agreement, the following provisions
shall apply.

1.1 The appointment of the Operator gives the Operator the right to
transact, and to receive payment for, certain items of business
on behalf of Post Office Ltd. The conditions of the appointment
also involve such non-compete restrictions on the private
activities of the Operator in relation to the Branch Premises as
are fundamental and necessary to ensure the continued viability
of the Network.

1.2 It is important to the future of the Network that all operators
support Post Office® products and services. An operator who
offers products or services in its private retail business from

the Branch Premises which compete with Post Office® products and

ROLL OUT PHASE

services can reduce the revenue generated by the Branch and the
Network. This revenue is essential to provide a contribution to
Post Office Ltd’s fixed costs of maintaining the Network. Without
this contribution, Post Office Ltd might not be able to sustain
the Network. It is therefore also in the interests of all
operators to support this principle.

It is also in the interests of all operators that Post Office Ltd
is able to seek and negotiate business opportunities for the
whole Network and that it does not allow Clients or suppliers to
enter into arrangements directly with selected Post Office®
branches only to the disadvantage of the rest of the Network.
This would adversely affect Post Office Ltd’s ability to maintain
the Network as a whole.

Operators benefit from being part of the Network. In addition to
payments which operators receive from Post Office Ltd, Post
Office Ltd invests in advertising that brings Customers into Post
Office® branches, it ensures that Post Office® products and
services meet regulatory requirements and it provides customer
and business services such as helplines to support operators.

Accordingly, except as permitted by and in compliance with any
waiver granted by Post Office Ltd in accordance with clause [ REF
_Ref324769348 \r \h ] of this Part 6, the Operator must not
undertake in a private capacity, or allow anyone else to
undertake in relation to the Branch Premises, the types of
business listed in clause [ REF _Ref324769358 \r \h ] of this
Part 6, as amended by Post Office Ltd from time to time in
accordance with clause [ REF _Ref324769369 \r \h ] of this Part
6.

The non-compete restrictions on private business activities in
relation to the Branch Premises are as follows:

(i) business concerned with the provision of services relating
to the collection, conveyance and/or delivery of letters,
parcels and packages (collectively called “Packets” in this
clause) including without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing: the sale of stamps, pre-paid postage labels and
stationery with prepaid postage; the acceptance, retention,
sortation, return and redirection of Packets (including
Packets containing mail order or other home shopping goods
and other Packets); and the acceptance of payment for such
services;

(ii) services for the payment of bills, the collection of
payments (including pre-payments) or the collection of
revenue (whether by the sale of stamps or meter tokens, the
charging of budget keys or by other means) in connection with
services for the supply of water, gas, fixed line telephones,

electricity, cable or satellite television, or local
authority services;

(iii) the sale of National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking, Building, Industrial and Provident Society,
Friendly Society or Credit Union business or otherwise making
available banking facilities including, without limitation,
cheque-cashing, bureau de change (including the selling and
buying back of currency, on demand and pre-order services),
collecting deposits or providing withdrawal facilities on
behalf of deposit-takers whether over-the-counter or through
an automated teller machine (ATM) or providing loans, credit
cards or other forms of credit or credit brokerage services
but not including the provision of cash-back transactions or
the provision of basic saving stamp schemes which do not
involve the return of cash to participants in the scheme.
For the avoidance of doubt, a cash-back transaction is the
withdrawal of cash via a debit card scheme, from the account
associated with the card used, as part of a transaction for
the purchase of goods or services through the same scheme;
and

(v) any financial services business or otherwise making available
facilities which may compete with the financial services
activities carried on or to be carried on by operators at any
time for or on behalf of Post Office Ltd or through Post
Office® branches or which may compromise the regulatory
status of Post Office Ltd (including for this purpose, its
operators) in its role as appointed representative of Post
Office Ltd’s financial service product providers, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the promotion of competing
financial services but not including the provision of basic
savings stamps schemes which do not involve the return of
cash to participants in the scheme.

These non-compete restrictions apply to all methods of
transaction of the areas of business set out above. This
includes, without limitation, the use of smartcards, ATMs and on-
line terminals.

The categories of business listed in clause [ REF _Ref324769358
\r \h ] of this Part 6 constitute the current non-compete
restrictions but Post Office Ltd reserves the right to review
these restrictions in the light of changing business
requirements, varying them if necessary. All operators will be
given at least 12 months’ notice in writing of any such changes.
No restrictions will be introduced on products or services other
than Key Products and Services, as defined in clause [ REF
_Ref324769403 \r \h ] of this Part 6.

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend this list of Key
Products and Services from time to time. No new products or
services will be introduced to this list which are not current or
future key sources of revenue and/or contribution for Post Office
Ltd.

0 If the Operator is considering taking up a new private retail
business opportunity which may fall within the scope of the non-
compete restrictions specified in clause [ REF _Ref324769358 \r
\h ] of this Part 6, it should, before taking up any such
business, inform Post Office Ltd of the circumstances and seek
advice as to whether the work concerned falls within the
restrictions described above.

1 The Operator may apply for a waiver from the non-compete
restrictions in clause [ REF _Ref324769358 \r \h ] of this Part
6. Post Office Ltd’s waiver policy is available on request from
Post Office Ltd. The waiver policy sets out the circumstances in
which a waiver may be granted and the procedures that must be
followed. This policy is subject to amendment by Post Office Ltd
from time to time. If a waiver is granted subject to conditions,
the Operator must comply with these conditions. A failure to do
so will result in the waiver being invalid from the date the
Operator ceased to comply with the conditions.

2 The Operator must not use and must ensure that no third party
uses the name “Post Office” in connection with any of its private
business activities (or the private business activities of a
company with which it is associated in any way) or in such a way
as to imply that Post Office Ltd is in any way connected with

business in a way that might lead Customers to conclude that Post
Office Ltd is in any way connected with that business.

1.13 The Operator must not engage Post Office Group employees to
undertake any work whatsoever connected with the Operator’s
private business (or the private business activities of a company
with which it is associated in any way) at any time when they are
employed in Post Office Ltd or Post Office Group duties.

1.14 The Operator shall promptly inform Post Office Ltd of any
approach or enquiry made directly by a third party (including any
Client or supplier of Post Office Ltd) concerning the Products or
Services or any similar products and services.

B. For the period of 12 months following the date of termination of
the Agreement the Parties shall continue to be bound by the

provisions of clauses [ REF _Ref324769447 \r \h ] to [ REF
