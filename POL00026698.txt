We have made improvements to training and support, with postmasters directly involved in
designing these.

® more visits and calls to new postmasters;

* earlier help for any balancing problems;

new online training planned for everyone — flexible and available anytime and in addition to
onsite training.

We are successfully mediating some cases.

@ In some cases postmasters admit failings in their management of their branch
* And in some cases we admit we could have done better.
e Weare agreeing compensation where this is fair.

Mediation is voluntary and it is about compromise. It cannot replace the Courts. We consider each
case on its facts but cannot mediate in some cases.

51 cases have been recommended for mediaion.

There have been [45] criminal cases and [36] convictions. There have been no Appeals through the
Courts in any of these cases.

Second Sight’s role is to investigate Horizon and associated issues raised in the specific complaints
put forward.

Confidentiality is essential in mediation because:

e Sensitive personal information, such as details about people’s health, finances and criminal
records must be protected.

© Mediation itself is always confidential — this is a requirement of the independent mediator
the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR).
