Dear Sirs,

HMA v. Aleid Kloosterhuis
P.F Reference: CM11000422

We have now had the opportunity of discussing the disclosure received by us
with our client. We are instructed, on a without prejudice, to enter into
negotiations with you with a view to agreeing a plea of guilty and the
narrative to be presented to the Court.

Our client is aware from the National Newspapers that the accounting system
used by Post Office Counters is currently being questioned on its accuracy.
With that in mind we are offering a plea of guilty, on an entirely without
prejudice basis, to our client embezzling not more than £20,000. Is such a
plea acceptable to you? If so we can obtain our clients instructions in writing
and thereafter provide you with a Section 76 Letter. We await hearing from
you. Please note that our Mr Kane is on annual leave from 1“ to 23" July,
2012. We will respond to you thereafter once we receive your reply.

Yours faithfully, I

Christian E. Kane
