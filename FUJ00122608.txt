Andy,

Statement looks fine to me, though I've copied Jon Longman (officer In Case) for his info. My only query
would be that the log of 107 calls may need to be produced as evidence or be disclosed as unused
material. If produced as evidence then it could be incorporated in your statement now or produced in a
"further to' statement later. I'11 let John comment on this though, as the court may be happy as it is.

John,
Can you give Andy the green light and/or comment on my thoughts above.

Regards,
