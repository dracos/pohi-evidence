--Lam in-receipt of your-letter.dated-14" April-2003-eonfirming-our-conversation regarding —-
losses and gains at our office which have always been rolled over since the installation of
Horizon. I appreciate that you may well have been unaware of this practice at the office but can
assure you many others Post Office staff knew of it.

My comments regarding this were well documented in a number of letters to Post Office
Counters Limited such as that dated 19" December 2000 to my then Retail Line Manager,
Gerry Hayes, which like all letters was sent recorded delivery.

The problem with rolling over the losses and gains is that I presume I would be accepting
liability for them which is something that I have pointed out in writing to you since the
introduction of Horizon here, I am unable to do until such time as I am able to access the data
that I am being asked to be responsible for. As I have written previously “The totally
inadequate report system has been made so complex it lacks the ability to interrogate the
system when you know the information is inside”, if 1 am unable to access the data to check
items it is totally unreasonable to expect me to accept the liability from uncheckable data.
