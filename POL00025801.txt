No Systemic Issues with
Horizon system

Statement:

It did not find evidence of systemic failures;
that is not to say there has never been a
bug in the system, but I defy anyone to find
an IT system that has never had a bug.
What is important is that when bugs are
found, they are dealt with and the problems
are rectified. What has not been found,
however, is any systemic problem leading to
the issues faced by sub-postmasters,
although there have been issues with the
support and training provided alongside
Horizon.

complete the review of cases started by
Second Sight, and will consider all 47 cases
brought forward by the Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance—the JFSA—and
MPs

Independent figure will chair a
review

Statement:

Secondly, an independent figure will chair a
review to determine how best to adjudicate
disputed cases in future. The JFSA and other
stakeholders will also be invited to take part
in this process.

Independence of process

Statement:

It is important that any further work is not
only independent, but seen to be
independent

Second Sight to be part of the
Working Party

Statement:

I shall happily give the hon. Gentleman that
assurance [That Second Sight will be part of
the working party].

Further work on cases is
independent

Statement:

we need to ensure that the further work on
cases where there are outstanding queries
is independent

Working Party must be
independent

deny them the opportunity for

On the hon. Gentleman’s first point, I can
certainly give an assurance that if there are
other cases that need to come forward, we

opportunity for that to happen.

JFSA represented in Working
Group

Statement:

The independent working group, which will
include representation from the Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance, will help to ensure
that that happens swiftly and without
compromising the details that need to be
gone into.

James Arbuthnot and JFSA
recipient of further cases

Statement:

I should point out that one avenue for
highlighting any further cases would be to
bring them to the attention of the Justice
for Subpostmasters Alliance, which will be
part of the independent working group. I
hesitate to suggest, although I am probably
safe in doing so, that my right hon. Friend
the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr
Arbuthnot) would also be happy to continue
in his role as a recipient for any such cases.
