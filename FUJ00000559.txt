EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:

This CCN is in response to Horizon Change Request CR R008 1.

The development as set out below is estimated to require a total of 19 days effort. The
development is targeted to take place during July, with the intention of intercepting Sept/Oct
system regression testing. Delivery is targeted for November but cannot occur until after
migration to Cl4.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: _ HIGH-+MEDIUM / LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE: The change is being proposed in response to CR RO081, which
asks Pathway to "... develop the system to reduce the number of errors beings made on table
12."
The CR identifies the two main causes of error as:
1) where outlets omit to enter the details into the system but they have transacted
parcels and have values on the associated Discrete Parcel Income (DPI) schedules.
2) where the outlet enters the value of the transaction but omits to change the
volume, i.e. they leave it at the current default value of 1.
The CR continues "However in addition to the errors outlined above, the change should seek
to reduce / eliminate other types of errors being made such as where the volume and value do
not relate, e.g. where the maximum price of a parcel is say, L6 but the user enters 3 parcels at
£25 which is outside the maximum possible range."

A number of discussions have been held to identify a suitable mechanism for delivering the
results requested and Mark Burley (POCL) confirmed to John Pope (Pathway) by e-mail on
12" May 2000 that the only change Pathway was now being asked to make is the one detailed
below. This does not address all of the issues raised in the original CR.

CCN No: 631 Page:

FUJ00000559
FUJ00000559
DETAILS OF CHANGE:

A check that Parcel Traffic transaction values have been entered will be introduced at the
point when the ‘Balance Report’ option is selected for the last active stock unit in the office to
roll over into the next CAP (this check will obviously need to ignore ‘dormant’ stock units and
the 'Default’ stock unit). This check will be a ‘Mandatory’ check and the user will not be
allowed to continue the balancing process unless Parcel Traffic transactions have been entered
(even if these are for '0.00' value);

This CCN is based on the assumption that to minimise costs the training systems will NOT
be updated. Pathway will update the training course and workbooks and will introduce the
new work books when the current ones run out. The training course will simply warn users

of the forthcoming change. A full rebuild of all training counters would add something of the
order of £60,000 to the costs.

It is assumed that the change will be briefed to outlet staff using, for example, Counter News,
with no input from Pathway to this process.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF CODIFIED AGREEMENT:
NONE

ACCEPTANCE / IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE: Delivery of this change is
targeted for November 2000 but cannot occur until after migration to CI4.

Charging Mechanism:

Where cost estimates are included, these are quoted as a mid-point estimate of the work to be
carried out by ICL Pathway. The eventual charge will be made on an ‘actuals’ Time and
Materials basis using the same man-rates. A 20% contingency has been included in the CCN
to allow for reasonable variation around the mid-point estimate. The estimate is set so that
the ICL eventual charge is as likely to be lower as higher than the estimate excluding
contingency. The contingency is included to provide allowable headroom for invoicing
purposes against a purchase order. Above this level, ICL Pathway would have to apply for
additional approval via a new CCN.

Action Number: 2 Date Apr 11 2000 14:33:28 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CCB DECISION (MTG NO 109): CCN-PENDING, CCN631 AGREED (SUBMIT)Previously reviewed by
PCCB 6/4, this CP and associated CCN were escalated to CCB as outstanding impacts prevented PCCB
agreeing the construction of a CCN. As a result, CCB were asked to consider both CP and CCN. Both OTT
and a revised TI impact were still in progress. J Pope gave some background information and stated that
although costs were to be confirmed, he expected the total to be cA£SOK. G Chatten highlighted the
outstanding issue regarding whether OTT or BTC should test work post Cl4 (i.e. CI4R). M Coombs requested
that G Chatten investigate the number of CPs currently targetted after CI4 and investigate testing resources and
planning for OTT/BTC. He also requested that T Austin review the OTT/B&TC issue re’ post CI4 testing. J
Pope assumed that development would not begin until July and therefore delivery scheduled for November.
J.Pope to ensure CCN is clear on delivery dates. There was some discussion surrounding the training impact
statement from D Felix. T Oppenheim requested that the CCN clearly stated that workbooks would be updated
without updating the training build. J Flynn took an action to ensure that this statement was correct and a viable
option for the programme. P Jeram stated that there should be no System Test impact on this CP as
development do not system test CPs that OTT test. He undertook an action to clarify this and stated that B&TC
have a regression test cycle for DWH scheduled for Sept/Oct. P Jeram to investigate if this change can be
included within the DWH cycle. It was agreed that the CCN should state a release of Post CSR~ and a target
delivery date of November 2000, post CI4 migration. CCB agreed the submission of this CCN once all actions
have been completed and resultant changes have been incorporated. Actions:1. OTT and TI impacts to be
provided to CM by 12.00 noon 11/4/00.2. G Chatten to investigate post CI4 CPs and associated testing
implications.3. T Austin to review situation surrounding post Cl4 testing.4. J Flynn to review training statement
and forward outcome to CM by 12.00 noon 11/4/00.5. P Jeram to review System Test impact and forward
outcome to CM by 12.00 noon 1 1/4/00.6. P Jeram to liase with B&TC to determine if CP can be tested in
Sept/Oct regression testing and forward outcome to CM by 12.00 noon 11/4/00.7. J Pope to update CCN to state
Post CSR+ and apply changes from above actions.8. CM to submit CCN once changes have been applied.

Action Number: 2 Date Apr 13 2000 11:33:39 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

UPDATE FROM JOHN POPE:Pete Jeram and I discussed the testing side of this several times yesterday. We
concluded that if OTT were going to quote 15 days to do complete testing themselves then we would dispense
with system test. I have therefore gone with 15 says for testing. Exactly who will really do it will depend on
the testing strategy post CI4 that evolves in the next weeks, so I have been deliberately obscure in the CCN,
describing it as system/release testing. 13.4.00

CHANGE CONTROL:Email received from Mark Burley (POCL) to John Pope 26/4/00 as follows:I have just
returned from leave and have been discussing the above CCN with someof those areas most directly impacted.
Whilst the CCN goes some way to answeringthe CR, it does not do so in the way we agreed at our meeting and
the way youagreed in your note of 7th March (copy attached).(See attached file: DPI-JP.doc)The CCN does not
appear to cover the first change outlined at 'l' in your noteand whilst it covers the remaining areas, it does not
separate the costs norgive us any indication of the difference that selecting different options wouldhave on the
implementation time-scales. For example, if we just opted forchanges outlined at 'I' and '2' in the CCN, what
would the cost be and wouldthat enable the change to be implemented earlicr?Could you please provide us with
a breakdown as agreed to enable us to respondto the CCN.

CHANGE CONTROL:Email sent from John Pope to Mark Burley 26/4/00 as follows:following our meeting I
had further conversations with John Plowman and issued the attached memo setting out the proposed basis of
the CCN. I will endeavour to split the costs out, but this may take several days, as it was not the basis set out in
the note referred to above. I can assure you that (referring to the original note of mine attached to your mail) that
omitting items 1(a) and 2(a) would not bring forwards the delivery date - we can not at this stage accept such
changes into CI4.

Action Number: 4 Date Apr 26 2000 17:07:31 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Email received 26/4/00 from Horizon as follows:Lisa, Horizon request for one weeks
extension on CCN listed below due toPathway providing incomplete details on the CCN. John Pope (Pathway)
and MarkBurley (Post office) have discussed this so if you need any more details pleasespeak to John Pope.*
CCN 631: Amendment To Parcel Traffic Input To Reduce Table 12 ErrorsPlease confirm that this is also your
understandingl await your response. (CM - this has been forwarded to John Pope for acceptance of the
extension period).

Action Number: 5 Date May 8 2000 09:44:01 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Email received from Horizon 5/5/00 as follows:Lisa, CCN 631 has been rejected by
Horizon reason being that the CCN isincomplete. This has been previously discussed between P, John Pope
(Pathway)and Mark Burley (Horizon business owner) and there are correspondence betweenthem dated
27/04/2600 which we request that John Pope refers to.Lisa, can you ask John Pope for a copy of the
correspondence mentioned abovedated 27/04/2000 (and forward onto me) because I cannot get hold of Mark
Burleyfor a copy.Can you also advise me on the way forward to this rejection and whether weshould expect a
revised version of the CCN to include what was initiallyommitted.

Action Number: 5 Date May 8 2000 09:52:14 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Following text was emailed from J Pope to M Burley (POCL) on 27/4/00 after approval
from T Oppenheim."Mark, following our conversations, the split of the 49.5 days (before contingency) would
be as follows:(1) To display an error message if an attempt is made to roll the last non-dormant stock unit
without entering parcel traffic. The user will not be allowed to continue until this is done - zero entry
permitted. 19 days(2) In addition to (1), to replace the current 4 button sub-menu with a pick-list of 8 lines, to
permit entry of quantity and value for each of the 4 parcel traffic types without using the quantity button. If
value is entered then non-zero quantity not allowed. This will require POCL ref data to define the pick-list
content. 41 days(3) In addition to (1+2), to calculate the average value of parcels for each (non-zero) of the
four products, compare it with maximum and minimum values to be supplied by POCL and implemented by
Pathway in type C ref data. Warning message to be displayed if computed average for a product is outside
range, with options to re-enter or continue without amendment. If the user selects re-enter the pick-list will be
redisplayed with the entered values still showing. 49.5 daysAs we discussed, if you do just (1) and then come
back and ask for 2/3 separately the total effort will greatly exceed 49.5 days, as much of the effort of building
and handing over work packages for testing, setting up and running test environments, and revising and re-
issuing documentation for comment is almost independent of the scale of change involved. When you confirm
exactly what you want we can issue a revised CCN.

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:53:34 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Email from John Pope 8/5/00 as follows:Mark Burley informs me that last Thursday he
told his contracts people to formally ACCEPT part 1, with confirmation one way or the other to follow in the
next few days on parts 2.He is phoning his commercial people as I type!

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:55:34 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Email received to John Pope via Mark Burley from Dick Brazear 8/5/00 as
follows:Mark, The advice that the CCN needed to be revised before it could be signed off came from me, after
consultation with John Cook, and arises from the fact that the salient points of the change that you have with
agreed with John Pope arecovered in correspondence and aren't included within the CCN or reflected in

CCN No: 631 Page: 7
FUJ00000559
FUJ00000559

anycaveat to it. The rejection of the CCN is not about the acceptance of option I and the potential acceptance
of the other option, but relates to the fact that there is no reference to the options in the CCN and that what you
are agreeing to is not properly documented in terms of the joint change process between the Post Office and
ICL. I think some of the message has been lost between ourselves and Pathway, but what is needed is for the
CCN to be revised to reflect your agreement, and we can then immediately proceed to sign off.

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:56:18 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:J Pope response to Mark Burley 10/5/00 as follows:Mark, We can't do anything at all on
the basis that you want option I and might want the others but don't know yet - the prices we discussed only
apply if we do all the bits at once If you do want all of it then the CCN does not need changing. When you
know what you want please let me know, and I will issue a CCN that contains only those options.

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:57:30 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE CONTROL:Email from Mark Burley to John Pope 12/5/00 as follows:John, Please raise the CCN
just for option 1 for the parcel traffic. The bureau team can not give me an answer yet and are unlikely to be able
to do for some time. We will raise another CR if required.

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:58:19 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)
CHANGE CONTROL:Email from John Pope to Mark Burley 12/5/00 as follows:please confirm that PON
understand that if I do this, and later you want the other options, the sum of the two CCNS is likely to be well in
excess of the CCN you have rejected.

Action Number: 5 Date May 17 2000 11:59:07 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)
CHANGE CONTROL:Email from Mark Burley to John Pope 12/5/00 as follows:I acknowledge this and much
as I am disappointed that we are not going for allthree, there is not a lot more I can do. Thanks

Action Number: 9 Date May 000 16:30:14 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CCB DECISION (MTG NO 114): AGREED (SUBMIT)L Burchell stated that this CCN had been revised by J
Pope following discussions with M Burley (POCL). T Oppenheim confirmed that he had visibility of these
discussions and that POCL were expecting this revised CCN. L Foley highlighted that the Executive Summary
of the CCN needed to be amended to reflect revised total of days - 19 rather than 49.5. CM took an action to
amend the CCN and ensure that the associated CP2524 was updated to reflect option offered in CCN. CCB
agreed the submission of this CCN once the above change has been made.Action:1. CM to ensure J Pope
updates CP2524 with option identified in CCN.2. CM to submit CCN once above change made.

Action Number: 10 Date Jun 7 2000 09:46:47 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)

CHANGE MANAGEMENT:Email from D Felix to J Pope 2/6/00 as follows:with regard to the advice below, I
understand that we have gone for the "cheap" option, i.e. we update the workbooks and training course, but not
the training systems.Our strategy for training will be this: * we will add a one liner into the training course to
say that at some time in the future the process will change, and you will be forced to declare parcel traffic when
you balance the final active stock unit. and POCL will inform outlets of when the change will start. But for the
now, this is the process for dealing with parcel traffic ... etc. etc.* As we train staff who will see the new process
we will tell them what the new procedure will be* When the development work is completed and approaches
go-live, we will change the workbooks to capture the new screen and picklist, and amend the stock unit balance
section.Clearly we cannot do the last point until development work is done as we need a system to take screen
captures and write the procedure from. We will not do the middle change until we are ready to train staff who
will use the new procedure immediately. Any other approach may confuse staff on what is already a complex
procedure on an intensive course.As the change is aimed at CI4R (i.c. sometime in the future, date to be
decided) I will be looking out at Release management Forum for the application of this change to live and will
inform KPL accordingly.
