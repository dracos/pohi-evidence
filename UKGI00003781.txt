Year Vince I

In Prime Mister's Questions today the Prime Minister told me that he would ask you to write
to me about the Post Office Mediation Scheme. While there are many things that are very
worrying about it, what particularly concerns me is that the Post Office has recently been
refusing to give to Second Sight the documents and information that Second Sight feel they
need in order to determine whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. I believe that the
only legal folder, for example, that Second Sight has seen is that relating to my constituent
Jo Hamilton - but that folder did show that there was no evidence (as the Post Office knew
at the time) of theft. Yet the Post Office charged her with theft. And as a result she then
pleaded guilty to false accounting, having untruthfully been told that she was the only
person going through these difficulties.

That suggests to me that there is more disclosure of documents that need to take place,
and that our constituents will never believe that the truth has been reached without that
disclosure. Equally, that disclosure needs to be made to Second Sight, who have now built
up the expertise to deal with it.
