ID Use Cases owned by this team

BAD-11
2.1.1 Log On to system
To provide a 'Clerk' with secure access to the system and to the permitted functions for which he has the necessary privileges.

BAD-2900
2.1.1.1 Description
In order to prevent unauthorised usage of the system the 'Clerk' is prompted to supply a <Username> and <Password> (which is obscured on
entry). The <Username>/<Password> pair are verified. On successful verification, the system notifies the 'Clerk' of the <Username> logged on,
the last logon date and time and the number of previous failed logon attempts. Where the 'Clerk' provides an incorrect
<Username>/<Password> pair then the 'Clerk' is prompted to re-supply or correct the erroneous input.
For branches and users that are subject to training controls, an additional check is applied that the ‘Clerk’ has completed the necessary
Essentials training. If the requisite training has not been completed then the user will logged on with the COURSEWORK role. Note: Some
users are not subject to training controls e.g. global users or local users.
Once <Username>/<Password> verification is complete the 'Clerk' may be prompted (if the BAL deems it necessary) to confirm that the first
and last name shown on the message prompt is the user's name. If the user refutes the identity displayed then the user is logged off otherwise
the user is prompted to reconcile any incomplete transactions outstanding from the previous <Session>, so that the view of the central system
coincides with that of the 'Clerk' and the actual outcome of the transaction. This process is followed whenever a 'Clerk' is commencing a new
session or following a forced logout scenario. A number of other checks are carried out as part of the logon process and these will result in a
variety of prompts being presented to the user.

BAD-3189
2.1.1.2 Context
The purpose of this use case is to open or recommence a <User Session> for a 'Clerk' to carry out transactional and/or administrational
functions.
The primary scenario for Log On to System demands that the following system checks do not trigger any exceptions, which prevent or interrupt
the log on process to complete and log the permitted branch user on to the system successfully:
# the Is user already logged on to other counter position check passes, (at BAD-3126)
# the 3am system maintenance reload check passes, (at BAD-3564)
