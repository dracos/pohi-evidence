That sounds a sensible idea.

May I also suggest (ultimately a matter for you) that I see a draft of the letter before it goes in case there is
anything you propose saying that is unsupportable? I think it might be helpful also for me to see what the
claimants' allegation is on this issue and how it is being couched.

The context is that we are submitting a substantive letter in the civil Group Action on 28 July. That letter will address
the allegation of POL having insufficient evidence to charge theft in a general sense and also address Hamilton's
case — being the only specific case raised so far to support the general allegation.

The current working assumption is that POL will be broadly ok on this point, at least in the sense that we have seen
no evidence of systemic failing in the way Post Office conducts prosecutions (accepting that in individual cases there
may be specific points of weakness).

If we can't get a full report before 28 July, it would be really useful if you could flag anything that suggests our above
working assumption is incorrect.

Thanks
Andy

lam, as I said starting batch 2 this week, but I am pessimistic about getting you the final document by the
25th, looking at my diary and some other commitments I have during the period.

I may be being unduly pessimistic, and while I acknowledge there are 6 rather than 8 case files, I think just
looking at the number of Lever Arch files I have to get through (Misra, Wilson and Holmes being the most
voluminous but Misra by a long margin) and then writing the review as I go along may make the

25th tight for me. That said, Misra may be worse than it looks and there may be some avoidable files.

I shall do my best, but if I can steal, say, 1 or 2 days from the week of the 25th if I need them that may
help.

Sorry for the late response.

If you were able to send us your final review by Monday 25 July, that would give us a few days in which to digest
your findings and amend our response on the group action as necessary.

Please can you let me and Andy know if, at any stage, you think this timeframe will pose a problem.
Kind regards

I have now received the boxes of papers, for which I thank you, and hope to get to them by the end of
next week. The case I told you about in Exeter at the back end of the month has now gone away which
gives me a little more time than I had anticipated when we were first looking at the timing.

It would in light of that help me to plan the next few weeks if you were able to give me a steer as to
the absolute latest date by which you would wish me to send you my final review of all these case files.

Best wishes,
Brian

All noted — thank you.

I appreciate you have other commitments so thank you for trying to accommodate our timeframe on this.
Thanks for sending the extract from your draft — we will only use it as a guide.

I will be in touch once we have more detail from Millnet on the volume of documents.

I will do my very best to complete the review by the end of July but I'm sure you will understand that
although I have found a week or so in early July I do have other advisory commitments during the

month as well as, towards the end of the month, a tricky 1-2 week case in Exeter. That said, if I average a
day per case file then that suggests 8 days to read and (I hope) write each section of the outstanding case
reviews; I expect I'll probably require around a day or two, possibly more, as a margin of error and to
proof-read and finalise the review document so around 10 days but please don't hold me to that. Misra
could occupy some time by itself! So I'd appreciate some wiggle room if I need it.

lam, as you request, and subject to the caveats, attaching the extract from my draft review on Hamilton.
Please do not t rely on it as anything more than a guide; It should not be quoted from.

Thank you — that's great.

One quick point to start - since sending you the email below I have received the list of cases from POL and I am now
aware there are 8 further cases to review, not 7. The 8 cases are those involving applicants to the scheme that were
convicted, had multiple charges brought and have referred their case to the CCRC.

On the volume of files point, I am in the process of asking Millnet (the provider of the CCRC data room) to download
the relevant documents so I will have a more precise idea of how many files we are dealing with when I get a
response. I'll update you asap. I expect the average number of files will be similar to the cases already provided (3/4)
with some exceptions. For example, Misra will likely involve more files whereas Hall looks to be more contained.

On timescales, we would now hope that your review would be done by the end of July because all 8 cases are
relevant to the group action and our letter of response is due by 28 July. There will be no further cases to come after
these 8.

On the Hamilton case files, we understand that the document is not in its final form but if we could see it anyway, it
would be a helpful indicator. We will look at it in light of the caveats you have spelled out below.

Many thanks

Paul

Thank you for your email.

Yes, looking at my diary I can set aside some days in the first two weeks of July to do that. Can you

kindly give me any idea of how many files for each of the 7 further cases I might be receiving as that'll give
me an idea of the real time I may need. Andy and I had discussed telling POL I'd hope to be done by

the end of August or so, but if the 7 cases is the final lot POL want me to review, then that changes
matters? Or will there be more yet to come?

As for my review into the Hamilton case files, the problem with my extracting part of what I have done is
(1) it is still only in draft; (2) the substance of it may yet need to be altered in light of anything I later
discover; and (3) it is a section only of a larger document.

Do you still wish to see it in light of this?

Thanks for confirming you have completed your review of the Hamilton/McDonald files.
I thought I'd drop you a note to outline our plan for the coming weeks.

Having spoken with Andy, I understand you are busy for the next couple of weeks on something else. We'll use that
time at this end to bundle up the documents for the 7 further cases which POL would like to be reviewed and send
them over to you. Would it be possible for you to set aside some time from the end of June/early July to work through
these further cases please?

Separately, I would be grateful if you could send us a copy of the report you have already drafted on
Hamilton/McDonald as Hamilton is one of the cases we are looking at as part of the Group Action.

Many thanks
