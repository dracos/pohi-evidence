Commercial Forum

JC 26/05/04

Noted and I CLS provided an analysis of the “quick turnaround”(QT) CT’s,
Agreed I which provide the reason why the QT were required.
KB stated QT’s needed to be kept to the minimum, especially with
the onset of summer leave commitments etc. With better planning it
should be possible to reduce the number of bridging CT’s, for
example for Impact and Banking, necessitating turnarounds of less
than 2 weeks. [PP — do you think we should notify DPF on these
minutes? I

to know what commercial issues FS anticipated if that were done.
CLS outlined his understanding of discussions covering this at the

TSD capacity to cover the over limit status of the HSH.

16.05 CLS to provide a financial analysis of the consequences of ceasing CLS 14/05/04

Noted KB explained, his understanding of how the new discount would
work, this was 20% from each CT (and a year end discount up to
7.5%), it was agreed that a memo amount would be put on each CT
to estimate the 20% element. The details of the discounts need not be
shown on CT’s as they will be added to Schedule 10 of the
Agreement,

KB also wanted to know, when the new grading structure was going
to be introduced. CLS said that CT’s should be using the new
grading structure, and would be effective from 01/04/04.

HF said that until the new grading rates were introduced into the
contract nothing should be changed. It was also agreed that the
Demand Planning Forum would need to have detailed information
for resource purposes.

16.08 HF to raise the necessary CCN to introduce the appropriate new HF 14/05/04

grading structure and the discount mechanism for additional SI

[PP ; we did not agree any date for this. When do you think you can
et it done by? Or is it on my list? in which case make it June! I

Noted CLS stated that the rates quoted in Liam Foley’s letter of 10
December 2003, would be subject to an RPI increase (2.8%)

KB said that the letter stated that the rates applied until 31 March
2005, so no adjustment was due this year.

16.09 CLS and KB to check with Liam Foley and Ian O’Driscoll CLS/KB I 07/05/04
respectively whether the rates in the letter would be subject to the
RPI increase of 31/03/04

25/03/04 to Tam Curran)

Noted KB explained that POL may wish to exercise the option of increasing
the number of Audit Record Queries, however Schedule 10 para
5.12, was unclear about any increased costs which may apply if this
option is taken.

To get nearer to the volumes that POL now wanted we would need to
go up 2 steps on the published scale. [no it wasn’t was it? I think KB
said he might do this when he had the info he asked us for!I . It was
agreed that FS would provide details of the notice period needed to
go up 2 steps at the same time, the possibility of amending the
contractually prescribed limits resulting from “step 2”, the
availability of any capacity to provide additional Audit Record
Queries for DWP probably until 2007 and any additional costs that
might be incurred.

16.13 CLS to provide costs if we progress to 720 Audit Record Queries and CLS 10/05/04
15000 Query Days ,[it is not ths simple ! we could put the limits WE DID
above and then say here to provide info asked for in point above] NOT

Noted and I HF explained that following a number of suggested improvements to

Agreed I the existing CT form from Post Office it was agreed that the first
page of the revised CT form would be introduced, with one of the 2
requested sets of check boxes (specifying the Development
Lifecycle Stage), but with “other (Specify)” replaced by “not
applicable”. FS would propose changes to the deliverables list that
had been requested.
