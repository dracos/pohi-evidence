I have been sub postmaster at Fazakerley Post Office branch since January 1999. I am the
sub postmaster of Tower Hill and my wife is the sub postmaster of Seaforth.

When I took over Fazakerley Post Office both Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD were already
employed at the Post Office and I kept them on.

Anne NIELD was the manager and Angela the clerk. My brother ion law use to help out at
the Post office on an ad-hoc basis to cover for holidays.

Denise JONES is the manager at Seaforth and would visit Fazakerley on a weekly basis
normally on a Thursday or Friday. However during the busy period of December, Denise
would not visit the branch as often.

Anne NIELD was responsible for balancing the cash and stock on a weekly basis and
producing the Branch Trading Statement at the end of the month.

Anne NIELD would tell Denise JONES how the office had balanced during her visit. I cannot

recall any problems with the balancing prior to 2009 and any shortages would be made
good with money from the retail side.

In 2009 there was a shortage of £4,000. I do not know how this shortage occurred. I
informed both Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD that I would pay half and they would be
responsible for the other half. I recovered their half from their holiday pay.

It is at this time that I told them they would be responsible for all losses in the future and
issued them with new contracts that they both signed.

I do not have copies of these contracts with me, but will forward copies together with copies
of their previous contracts to Stephen BRADSHAW of Post Office Ltd.

Daily cash declarations would be performed by either Angela SEFTON or Anne NIELD and
they both would do the balance on a Wednesday.

Denise JONES on her visits would check the paperwork and obtain a balance snapshot to
check that everything was OK in the branch. She would also give sales coaching to them.
Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD both had a set of keys to the branch and nobody would be
allowed behind the counter. The retail staff would come to the secure door to pay in the
lottery and pay station money.

Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD did not have any keys to the retail side.

I do not hold any keys to the POST Office, I only hold keys to the retail side.

Continuation of statement of Ali ASKAR

I have asked both Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD if they wanted to work out of individual
stock units but they informed me that they were happy to work out of one stock unit.

Anne NIELD was paid £6.50 per hour and Angela SEFTON was paid £6 per hour.

Angela SEFTON and Anne NIELD were responsible for recording the shortages and payment
of any bills in a book held at Fazakerley Post Office. I will pass this book to Stephen
BRADSHAW of Post Office Ltd.

I became ill in 2008 and from this date only worked occasionally behind the counter. I was
found to have a tumour in 2010 and have not worked behind the Post Office counter since

this date.
