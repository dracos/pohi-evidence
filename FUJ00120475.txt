2 POLSAP

2.1 POLSAP System

POLSAP will follow the same landscape model as POL-FS, with four tiers:
1. IRE11—- Production (PLP)
2. IRE19 — Development (PLD)

3. IRE19 - Two QAS/Test environments
PLQ for technical integration testing
PLE for Post Office testing and sign-off

Any new POLSAP functionality will be unit tested in Development, then migrated to PLQ for integration
testing and on to PLE for User Acceptance testing. After sign-off the functionality will be migrated to
production.

Post Office acceptance test users will access the PLE environment from the Royal Mail SAP Enterprise
portal.

Please see the POL SAP System Landscape Overview document (FS/ERP/SSL/0001) for the rationale
behind the four tier landscape and the SAP Practice Operational Level Agreement (see
POLSAP/SVM/SDM/OLA/0874).

The majority of work to put in place the infrastructure and technical services required to host POLSAP.
will be achieved through deployment of the Horizon Online service in the Ireland Data Centres by the
HNG-x programme, together with the migration of the POL-FS system from its current hosting
environment in Bootle and Wigan.

The design for the migrated POL-FS solution is described in a separate High Level Design document
(POLSAP/DES/INF/HLD/0001).

Figure 1 shows a high level view of the POLSAP Infrastructure and Infrastructure Services at the
implementation of Phase 1.

The production system is hosted in the IRE11 data centre. Development and QAS/Test are hosted in
IRE19, with that environment providing a production failover capability for POLSAP as part of the HNG-x
Disaster Recovery model.

The migration steps that lead up to the convergence of POL-FS and SAPADS on a single platform are
described in a separate POLSAP Migration High Level Design (POLSAP/DES/MIG/HLD/0001).

Fujitsu are responsible for all POLSAP application and SAP Basis support for POLSAP.

Figure 1 —- POLSAP Technical Landscape

2.1.1 Version of SAP
POLSAP is based on SAP R3 IS Retail 4.7 extension set 110.

The R3 application consists of the SAP Database (also known as the SAP Host) that is at the core of the
business application and a number of Application Servers that take processing load away from the SAP.
Host.

The Database Server controls all the majority of the SAP R3 processing activity and where batch jobs
are to be processed they are triggered (by Tivoli Workload Scheduler) on the Database Server, all other
jobs are triggered through Business Connector.

2.1.2 Other SAP Elements

SAP XI

SAP XI (Exchange Infrastructure) is SAP's enterprise application integration software and facilitates the
exchange of information between the SAP application and external end points. XI supports a range of
connectivity methods, data formats, and communication protocols.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

For POLSAP, SAP XI is a requirement to support processing of key POL-FS interfaces including the
Branch Ledger Entry data from HNG-x.

In a Disaster Recovery situation SAP XI services will continue to be required at the failover site.
SAP XI will also be used to process certain SAPADS interfaces as they are converged into POLSAP.

SAP Business Connector (BC)

SAP Business Connector is a legacy mechanism (integration server) that sits outside SAP R3 and uses a
SAP adapter for BAPI and IDoc communication and processing.

For POLSAP R 1, the solution will have the capability of supporting SAP Business Connector interfaces.
The SAPADS system currently uses Business Connector for interfacing to Transtrack and the large Note
Counting machines.

In a Disaster Recovery situation SAP BC services will continue to be required at the failover site.

SAP Solution Monitor

SAP Solution Manager is used to manage the complete POLSAP SAP environment (Production,
Development, QAS Test) for technical support and monitoring.

In a Disaster Recovery situation the SAP Solution Manager service will continue to be required at the
failover site.

SAP Archiving Solution

The long term POLSAP archiving requirements have been documented within the POLSAP Archiving
Strategy Document (FS/ERP/SAS/0001).

Please see the SAP Practice POLSAP OLA POLSAP/SVM/SDM/OLA/0874 for further details)

3.4 POLSAP Platform Hosting

« Fujitsu hosts the Development POLSAP System and Production SAP System within its Data
Centres in Ireland (IRE11 and IRE19)

« The QA/Test SAP System acts as the fail-over system for the Production POLSAP System.
There is no fail-over system for the Development or QA/Test systems. The time taken for failover
and the QA/Test POLSAP System being re-configured for use as the Production POLSAP System
will take approximately 48 hours.

e Inthe event that we failover to the QA/Test system, there is no further resilience for the DR
Production Service.

e Fujitsu has extended its standard Datacentre hardware and operating system maintenance and
administration functions to encompass the POLSAP System. These are detailed within the Data
Centre Operations Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0003)

e Fujitsu will at all times maintain the integrity of data within the POLSAP System.

and backup schedules. All others are triggered through the Business Connector.

« Scheduled Weekly full backups will be taken by Belfast Operations of all platforms. For the
volatile business data a full backup will be taken weekly using RMAN software, with cumulative
incremental daily backups in between.

e All data that is backed up will be held on SAN Tier C (CLARiiON) Storage. Backup images are
replicated between data centres using a step in the workload schedule. This gives a resilient
solution to backup that effectively has built in ‘off-site’ storage without taking tape backups or
utilising a non Data Centre location for tape storage. The two most recent copies of the weekly full
backup are retained for safety,

« The POLSAP Oracle database has been initially sized for 5Tb.

3.5 Network Connectivity (WAN)

POLSAP has capability of being supported remotely by Fujitsu Infrastructure and Application teams. All
Fujitsu support teams will be connected to the Fujitsu corporate network.

Online end user access to production POLSAP is primarily through the CSC/Steria managed
presentation:

e The majority of on-line users access POLSAP via CSC/Steria hosted and managed SAP E-
Portals.

e There are a number of on-line users who access a Citrix server, hosted and managed by CSC,
and then use SAPGUI to access POLSAP

All printing will be by one of two routes:

e Reports directed from POLSAP to a CSC hosted/managed File/Print Service, then on to specific
printers

« Browser-based display of reports by end-users, sent by users for printing on local CSC managed
printers

(Note Printing is not the responsibility of Fujitsu)

The majority of file transfer activity between POLSAP and Royal Mail systems will take place using the
File Transfer Management Service (FTMS). This is an existing service.

Fujitsu manages the WAN links to Ireland Data Centres, through the provision and support of required
Network circuits, routers, switches, firewalls and other associated hardware.

The solution is hosted within the HNG-x Corporate/RMG Connection Domain

The Service provides on all days of the year including all English Bank Holidays but excluding Christmas
Day. The Service Centre will accept calls from CSC on behalf of Post Office Limited internal
departments, and Post Office Clients (and calls from internal Fujitsu Services capability and support
units).

Post Office Limited Help Desk will provide 1st line Service Desk support functions to its end-user
population (This service is provided by CSC (Call Logging). Fujitsu's SMC will provide 2” line support
and for 3rd line Incidents, these will be passed to Fujitsu support groups for action (e.g. incident/problem
resolution or implementation).

The 1* line CSC service desk will be able to contact the FS Service Desk either by telephone or through
the Triole service.

CSC should log a call on the Triole system and pass the call through the SMC stack (POLSAP SMC.
stack) who will then triage the call and pass it on to the relevant SDU.

All Severity 1 and 2 calls must be accompanied by a telephone call (i.e. warm handover) rather than just
being passed over as these calls are more time sensitive and require an immediate response.

4.3 Incident and Problem Management

e Fujitsu is responsible for all POLSAP Application support.

e There will be a Fujitsu Services Duty Manager available for problem escalation 24 hours a day, 7
days a week.

« SMC support for scheduled batch activity will be available overnight, as well as during the working
day.

e For the Systems Management Service Description see SVM/SDM/SD/0006.

Incidents may arise relating to the POLSAP. Post Office will be responsible for ensuring that all incidents
reported by POLSAP Users are initially reported by telephone to the CSC helpdesk.

Incident management for POLSAP will be managed in accordance with the Incident Management
process as described in POLSAP/SVM/.SDM/SD/0873.

The CSC service desk will log the incident on their call management system and carryout an initial
investigation on the incident root cause/resolution. If the incident is deemed to be within the
responsibilities of POL/CSC as defined in this document then they will manage that incident to closure.

Where the cause of such an incident is within POLSAP under the responsibilities of Fujitsu, the CSC
helpdesk will log the call in Triole and pass the call onto the POLSAP SMC stack. In doing so, the CSC
helpdesk will continue to manage the interface with the POLSAP User; when a resolution or update for
an incident is available, CSC will have visibility of the update and be able to pass that information to the
POLSAP User.

The SMC may also pass calls to the CSC helpdesk stack, for example, where the fault is determined to
be in the SAP Front End E Portal or where the fault is deemed to be outside the control of Fujitsu.

The SMC will route calls internally within Fujitsu as appropriate. Calls may be routed to:
a) the Fujitsu development or testing teams;

b) the Fujitsu POLSAP support team;

c) the Fujitsu hardware and operating system maintenance teams; or

d)_ the Fujitsu networking teams.

level Capacity Management on POLSAP will use the HNG-X solution. Metron Athene will be used to
capture CPU, Memory, I/O (disk and network), Oracle and process level data on all systems. This data
will then be collected by the HNG-X performance database and stored on it. Such data will then be
regularly analysed by the HNG-X Capacity Management Service to make sure there is sufficient
capacity, indicate any opportunities for consolidation, and will be crucial for diagnosis in the event of an
issue. Automated reporting will highlight any issues and thresholds that have been breached. In
addition to the standard data captured by Athene, various supplementary data will also be captured
including for Network (NNM), Storage (EMC Performance Manager) and BladeFrame. As well as helping
to understand the solution operation in more depth, this data will also be used to measure and manage
capacity of shared components that the POLSAP uses. Forecasting will include usage and projected
usage for the service.

4.9 Business Continuity and DR

« Fujitsu Services is responsible for maintaining business continuity arrangements for the Service
Management Service and sharing this information with Post Office as requested.

e Fujitsu Services and Post Office Business Continuity Managers will agree a plan of action in
accordance with the Major Business Continuity Incident Management Process (MBCI) as defined
in the described in the Working Document entitled: “Major Incident Process”,
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).
