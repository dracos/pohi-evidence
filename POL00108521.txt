T've copied Neil into this email trail as this has been escalated within FJ and I've asked Neil as the relationship
lead to have oversight of this issue.

Ihave asked for a summary position of where we are today and the plan going forward from FJ. We do need
certainty.

If we're clear on the ask, commercial cover can be agreed through Neil and Haydn(FJ) whilst you/the
programme agree the detail. I just want to be clear that commercials and process can not hold this up, however
we need to be clear what we are asking FJ to implement.

Hope this helps.

IT will speak to Fujitsu tomorrow and get back to you on what can be done to give us greater

assurance. I am aware of some of the risks/issues they are managing so will continue to monitor as they
progress.

{agree with all of this but surely we need to be able to pin Fujitsu down in terms of a timescale. We
want it doing but asap. I just want us to pin Fujitsu down to a timescale for delivery.

To avoid further delay can we just tell them to start but pin them down to a timescale? If not do it
anyway.

We need to act more quickly and make decisions more effectively. We have had the information about
this change for well over a month and not made a clear decision whether to proceed.

Does this change stifl add value if it is delivered at the end of June (or if it slips further into July)?

We only have a ‘rough order of estimate not detailed contractual terms so we will have to progress with
the risk that these dates could change. We can be involved in the detail of these projects and
understand current plans, risks and issues. We can also steer these activities so that we make the best
decisions in terms of business value/impact.

Let me know you decision. As requested Fujitsu are waiting for your approval before proceeding. if you
want more information or engagement with Fujitsu ! will sort this.

Regards

Andy

I think this needs to be escalated. I have copied Lesley and Chris for information. I do not see
how Fujitsu can keep putting back the date. They are expecting us to pay for this and we need to
know exactly what we are getting.

Chris/Lesley

This concerns an ongoing attempt to get Fujitsu to stop destroying data for a temporary period to
ensure they do not destroy data relating to cases in the Scheme between the time of the original
application into the Scheme and the submission of a full case questionnaire which will indicate
exactly what data we need to extract from Fujitsu to properly investigate the case.

Pete, Andy,
Due to various issues with dependencies, we need to revise the likely date that we would expect
to be in a position for you to approve suspension of data purging.

It is now unlikely that we would be able to implement the change any earlier than the last week
in June.

In view of the attached email from the Change Sponsor, can you confirm that you do still want to
proceed?

If so, our Change Management need you to contact your Commercial and Change Management
teams, to convert the ROM (3170) into a Change Request.
We can then convert our present CP into an ‘implementation’ CP and proceed accordingly.

Many thanks, and regards,

Further to our conversation yesterday, I have discussed with Chris and we have agreed that we
should proceed with the proposal from Fuzitsu to stop destroying data for a period of 6 months
(with the possible extension to 12 months) as set out in the attached ROM.

However:

I understand that the ability to do this is on the basis that the audit data migration strategy
is accepted (referred to in the ROM as 'Change to Audit Data Migration Strategy; acceptance of
new Storage (Fujitsu CSHE) to store new Audit data as early as possible, ahead of completion of
copying historic data from old storage to new (which will also take longer)') and that you are
proceeding with this project with the agreement of Chris Aujard. Could you please resend him
the email that you sent him setting out the details of this project.

T understand that Fujitsu have not provided us with an exact timescale within which they
can actually start the suspension of data purging but estimate that this can start no later than the
back end of May. We must have some indication of when that might happen before we finally
sign this off - if there is a danger that there will be slippage on this then we should not
proceed. Is there any guarantee about the timescales, and, what is the risk that the data migration
strategy is delayed.

But subject to that, good to go asap.

Belinda, Andy,

Fujitsu have finally produced a ROM for this work.

If you are happy with the content and costs, we need to raise a new CR for them to do the
work. Am I right to assume that budget is available as part of the Branch Support Programme?

Please advise.

Both

lam now going to raise a formal Change request (via Dave/Gerry) to get this assessed so we can
make an informed decision. My informal conversations with Fujitsu have unearthed some
challenges to implementing the request, we have a dependency on a project to upgrade the audit
log data servers as these are currently running out of space. It will be a few months before these
servers are ready and our request could not be implemented until then. There will also need to
be some work to impact assess other aspects of the system, once the request is submitted Fujitsu
will inform us whether we there will be a charge for this impact assessment.

POL-0106618
POL00108521

Can you both confirm the requirement I am going to include in the CR. I am specifically
interested in the timescales as this will affect how much disc storage is required. I am out next
week, if there are any updates or decisions required (e.g. spending money) Gerry will be in
touch.

Retention of Fujitsu data
Request that Fujitsu stop purging

- audit log data
- help desk call data (HSD call logs)

Post office envisages this policy will remain in place for 6 months but would like the flexibility
to extend this for additional months (up to a maximum of 6).

At the end of this time PO would like Fujitsu to return to the current policy on purging
data. Any additional data retained during the above period would need to be purged in the usual
way.

Belinda/Angela

Ihave asked Fujitsu if this is an easy thing to do and if not to provide an approach/rough costs
for progressing. For now I have asked for this to cover both Help desk call log data and branch
transaction data. So that we can give Fujitsu a clear requirement will you start considering and
capturing your requirements so they have something clear to deliver against. We will also have
to think about how we test and assure this work.

Belinda, I agree with your programme board comment below. I think the programme should
consider doing a wider review of data (both physical and electronic) so it can ensure there is full
understanding of what is retained and what is not as well as decisions made to date. For example
we have already made decisions about email data e.g. the meeting where we discussed and agree
the change request from CSC.

Re future cases, my view is that we should get a proper decision about suspension of destruction
about non-scheme cases. A proper retention policy exists for a purpose and I do not think we
can put a blanket ban on destruction. The issue is to make sure no information is destroyed
relating to cases in the current Scheme.

I think we should get the prog. board to consider this, get a proper decision and then implement
it.

Belinda,

So was I; I remembered having the conversation but couldn't recall the output and couldn't locate
an e-mail chain to support my understanding hence my note to Andy.

You will recall that this was raised at our Dec meeting with the investigators. For this particular
case I believe the info was located from another source (Kath will confirm). From this point on
Shirley and Kath have assessed their cases and made the necessary requests to Fujitsu - hence
Andy's comments about the cases on the cusp. So for the cases in the Scheme this shouldn't be a
problem. Shirley and Kath - please action Belinda's request in her note below.

Future cases that might come our way via whatever replaces the Initial Scheme might be a
challenge. The question therefore is for how long do we want to stop destroying information? I
suspended destruction of paper files at Iron Mountain over a year ago and this naturally adds to
our cost base. We should be able to take an informed decision on this once we know what
follows the Initial Scheme.

I agree that we must do this and ask Fujitsu to make sure this happens and urgently. I was under
the impression that it had already been done. I had thought that it had been.

I would also like to know of any cases in the Scheme where we request data but cannot access it
because it has been destroyed and when the data was destroyed. Would that be possible?

We have not asked for this to happen, we agreed to prioritise cases on the cusp so we got the data
required.

Ican raise a CR requesting this but will probably need some impact assessment, there will also
be a cost associated.

Let me know if you want this to happen.

Andy,

I know we discussed this but I can't recall the detail of the conversation. Have we now asked
Fujistu to suspend destroying data when they reach the 7 year point? Tony Hooper has asked for
reassurance on this across all our date/information storage points.

Thanks,

Fujitsu have not been asked to retain records for longer. Fujitsu did however ask (in the
scheduling meeting) for any cases falling close to the 7 year retention limit so they could extract
these.
