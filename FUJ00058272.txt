Purpose:
1 To review data prepared by Post Office Network Unit and ICL Pathway detailing the

number of outlets that have dropped-out of the Installation Programme during the 16 week
cycle and the reasons for the drop-outs. The review will determine trends for outlet drop-
outs, from the available data, and consider measures to limit the number of drop-outs by
managing the causes. In addition the review will look at the number of outlets that are
being capped and consider whether any changes need to be made to the number of outlets
being cut into the Installation Units at the start of the 16 week period.

2 To review Installation Programme activities and issues.

Format:

A formal meeting will be held every two weeks, alternating between Kidsgrove and London.
Meeting duration will be a maximum of 3hrs.

Minutes of the meeting will be taken and circulated.

Attendees will be:

PON: Martin O'Toole
Barry Evans

ICL Pathway: — Rom Zbieranowski

1. Drop-Out Analysis

Install Teams Timing Out:
PON have raised concerns over the number of outlets being aborted on Install day due to
delays at earlier installs. The actual number of instances of Install teams timing out is
slightly higher than shown in the Drop-Out report. TS made the point that the Install teams
timing out are not due to delays caused by Exel, the root cause is due to delays encountered
during the install process at an earlier site. The tactics being deployed rely on the IP teams
moving the Install teams onto the next outlet if significant delays are being encountered.
TS will look at the details for the 2 outlets that were aborted on Monday 22/5/00.
08/06/00 - TS handed over details of outlets that had been aborted due to Install Teams
timing out over a period of 4 weeks (8" May to 2" June). MO/BE to analyse the information
outside the meeting.

Action 25/05/01_ TS CLOSED

The number of outlets suspended and ready for re-scheduling is now shown on the report. In
order to give a complete picture of re-schedules it was agreed to introduce the following
figures into the next report:
ap) No. of outlets suspended and not ready for re-scheduling
(2) Actual no. of outlets re-scheduled.
22/06 - Figures were provided at the meeting, but will be included on the next report.

529 offices suspended

179 offices Suspend/Release

2. Trends:

23/08/00 - Number of installed outlets fell below the 306 planned level during w/c 14/08.
[302 outlets installed]. 13 outlets aborted on install day due to ISDN problems.

BE raised PON's concerns about the level of ISDN faults and asked what actions Pathway
were taking to improve the situation. Pathway have escalated the situation within Energis at
director level and RZ will be responding to Douglas Craik on this subject.

27/07/00 - 7 outlets were lost due to Install Teams timing out during w/c 17/7/00.

This was partially attributable to several Boot Server problems at the Data Centre.

7 Postmaster resignations, and 4 MTC PSA failures occurred during the same week.
22/06/00 - No change in the trends.

Installation Programme Issue: 13
Review Date: 13/09/00

08/06/00 - No change in the trends. PON are concerned about the number of ISDN faults
leading to Install day aborts.

25/05/00 - Slight increase in the number of drop-outs due to ISDN faults and concern from
PON raised about outlets aborted on the day due to Install teams being delayed at earlier
installs; PON's view is that there should be some contingency for these situations. The actual
number of instances on Install teams timing out is slightly higher than shown in the Drop-
Out report.

11/05/00 - No significant change in the trends. Key trends from the report continue to show
drop-outs due to ISDN related problems and issues with the Postmaster/outlet, e.g.
resignations, relocations and closures.

2/04/00 - No change in the trends from previous report.

31/03/00 - The number of drop-outs over the 16 week period is still showing a slight
downward trend. Main reason for drop-outs prior to install week continues to be ISDN, and
resignations, relocations and closures.

MO stated that PON will be running a series of workshops for the HFSO's during September
(4 week period), which will have an impact on installs. The contractual level will be
maintained.

17/03/00 - No change in the trends from previous report.

01/03/00 - Key trends from the report continue to show drop-outs due to ISDN related
problems and issues with the Postmaster/outlet, ¢.g. resignations, relocations and closures.

06/07/00 - No change in the trends from previous report

4. Scheduling Issues:

Relocated Offices coming back into the Programme:

Relocated offices will come back into the Install Programme as Horizon Compliant. They

may come back with the same FAD code. Clarification of the process is required.

MO agreed to check with the HIMs as to what will be the next event when these offices are

released.

11/5 - MO reported that the "next event" will be the next event that has not yet commenced.
Action: 12/04/04. MO CLOSED

(relative to the Install Programme) that take place when the office is released.

22/06 - BE stated that PON shall ensure that the process is amended. PON shall inform
Pathway on the activities that have been completed at an office when it is handed over. It
was agreed to close the action.

Action 11/05/03 BE CLOSED

Re-scheduling Priority Offices:
We may need to go outside the geography to install priority offices, this side of the second
sweep. ( e.g. Leigh-on Sea, Kings Lynn) MO will discuss the concept with the HIMs and
an escalation process. Any existing offices in this category need to be identified.
11/5 - MO reported that the HIMs would like to do this.

Action: 12/04/05 MO CLOSED

Pathway need to consider whether this can be done.
11/5 - It was agreed that Pathway could incorporate this into the re-scheduling process. The
priority offices would normally be ECCO. A waiver would be required from PON on
travelling to courses and course occupancy. The volume would have to be very low and
controlled through PON Central (specifically BE/MO). The re-scheduling document needs to
be amended to reflect these changes.

Action 12/04/06 _RZ/TS CLOSED

Rescheduling document may need amending. SB to check.
22/06 - The document will be re-issued next week with amendments.
Action: 11/05/04 SB CLOSED

PON raised the question on whether release information was passed across to PON.
SB to check and to liaise with Jonathan Bissett on transfer of information on suspends and
release of outlets.
25/5 - SB reported that data was not automatically passed to PON. SB needs to re-align the
Activity Tracking Database and the RODB then pass the lists at periodic intervals to PON
(i.e. every 2 weeks).
Target for completion for next meeting.
08/06/00 - Should be complete next week
22/06/00 - Aiming to complete before next meeting.
Action: 05/07/06 SB CLOSED

Proposal for Phase Y (Installs):
SB briefly discussed Pathway's proposal for the second sweep, known as Phase Y. This
involves entering outlets into the Install Programme where there may be Infrastructure work
still outstanding, on the basis that this work will be complete before the Install date.
SB to produce an outline proposal prior to the next meeting, to allow time for PON to
consider the proposal.
08/06/00 - To be completed end of next week (16/6/00)
22/06/00 - Proposal has been sent to MO and has been approved.

7. Installation Activities

ISDN

22/06 - Daily reviews between Pathway and Energis have now started to review recent ISDN
faults.

08/06 - Meetings have been held between Pathway and Energis at Director level.

Energis have given assurances that they are dealing with the problem of high numbers of
ISDN faults. There is a need to determine the root cause analysis of ISDN fails on install
day. Daily reviews with Energis/BT are to be started.

25/5 - There has been an increase in the number of "on the day" ISDN faults leading to
aborted outlets. Pathway have had meetings with Energis seeking an improvement in the
situation. Energis have re-affirmed their commitment to reduce the number of faults.

The automated ISDN line test process was found not to be working properly which meant
that a manual process had to be used. This may have contributed to the recent increase in the
number of ISDN faults.

TS to advise on resolution, and confirm whether the day -10 check is automated or manual.

08/06 - The process is robotic with manual input.
Action 25/05/03_TS CLOSED

ALPS offices may require the ISDN point to be extended. A script needs to be compiled for
these offices.

Action 25/05/04 TS CLOSED

11/5 - We are still seeing some failures on install day. No new issues raised.
12/04/00 - Two different problems were recently experienced with BT/Energis:

(a) ISDN Lines were not configured into the Closed User Group (CUG),
which was a process failure.
(b) 5 ISDN Wrong Numbers were notified to Pathway too late for recovery action

resulting in lost outlets.
Energis have been tackled about both incidents.

31/03/00 - ISDN circuits now being checked at day -10 and day -2. This has resulted in a
decrease in the number of aborts due to ISDN faults.

TS to provide input to the meeting by end of July to illustrate the results of the initiatives
underway to better understand and avoid ISDN failures.
27/07/00 - Data still being collected. Carried forward to next meeting.

Action complete. Action 06/07/07 TS CLOSED

8. Counter Discrepancies

25/05 - MO stated that there have been recent incidents where a Counter Discrepancy has
occurred and the install has gone ahead by Pathway over-installing. PON are concerned that
information on the correct number of counters had been passed to Pathway but had not been
processed in time.
RZ to check with ROHD on what's being done to address these concerns.
08/06 - RZ stated that the ROHD had significantly reduced their backlogs of Calls and fax's
waiting to be processed. Therefore the existing processes should be sufficient to prevent a re-
occurrence of request for changes not being processed in sufficient time.

Action 25/05/05 RZ CLOSED

12/04: Change Counter Numbers confirmations are now coming through. Some of the IP
regions are phoning each office to confirm the number of positions prepared for Horizon,
RZ/SB to check what's coming through into Pathway from the regions, and to run offa
report from the RODB.

11/5 - Check was undertaken and the results show a small decrease in the number of

discrepancies. Action 12/04/07 _RZ/SB CLOSED
BE agreed to ask Jonathan Bissett to send a new list that Pathway could compare with the
RODB.

22/06 - Carried forward. Action 11/05/09 BE CLOSED

31/03: The number of outlets with discrepancies is reducing. The various checks are now
making an impact.

TS agreed to look at a process to define liability for a Counter Discrepancy.
31/03 - TS recommended that initial discussions should occur within PON central, rather
than the IP regions. MO will discuss this with the HIMs.

9. PON Issues

Outlets with Restricted Vehicle Access:
Due to recent problems with vehicle access to outlets, the question was raised on the level of
information within the Completion Packs relating to parking restrictions. TS agreed to
check. It may be necessary to modify the Call script to outlets.
11/5 - The check revealed that parking restrictions were in force and that there was suitable
parking nearby, however this was unsuitable.
BE raised the problem of ‘red-routes’ in London and how were Exel going to manage this
situation. TS agreed to check. It was proposed that the Call scripts are revised.
25/5 - TS has asked Exel to provide a Strategy for operating in London and to look at
modifying the Call scripts. Update at next meeting.
08/06 - Waiting for information from Exel.
22/06 - Some information has been obtained from Exel. Ongoing

Action 12/04/08 TS CLOSED

ECCO BOP Removal:

PON raised the issue of too many BOPs being left behind by the Exel Install teams which
results in HFSO's having to pick them up. TS stated that Exel will leave the BOP if the
HFSO's do not free them up.

The HFSO's need to be told to ensure that they tell Exel that the BOP is available for
removal.

Freeing up the BOP on a Wednesday night is likely to take longer than other days due to
weekly balancing activities. This could threaten the "ECCO on Wednesdays" CCN. (Note:
CCN has not yet been received by PON, RZ to chase)

BE agreed to check with Farnborough for times of polls, and to communicate with the
HFSO's the need to free up the BOPs.
08/06 - Ad hoc polls must be requested and confirmed by 18:1Shrs.

Action: 25/05/07 BE CLOSED

TS agreed to obtain data from Exel on BOP's being left behind and the reasons.
08/06 0 Action ongoing.
22/06 - The reporting is ongoing, it was agreed to close the action.

Action: 25/05/08 TS CLOSED

TS to provide early visibility of process for BOP removal on Wednesday's.
22/06 - Details of process sent out. MO stated that he is happy with th process which is to
commence from next Wednesday.

Action 08/06/06 TS CLOSED

ALPS Outlets: ISDN Extensions:

A list has been compiled of next week’s outlets which may require a temporary solution, as
the date for installing extensions may be way out.

PON need to understand the BT date for installation. OSD engineers will rectify the
temporary solution.

TS agreed to provide the additional information to BE.
