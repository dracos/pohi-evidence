Tony

Please find attached a short commentary on the documents in your bundles which you should have hopefully received

this morning. This is just to place some of the documents in context.

Once you've had a chance to quickly review the bundles, please could you let me know approximately when you might
be available for a con with the client (as per my email attached)? I can then speak to POL about fixing a date.

Kind regards
Andy
