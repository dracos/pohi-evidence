Dear Charlotte and Purvee

I attach copies of both the Second Sight report which - to stress - we are making available to you , and our full
response to it.

I would like to know why it is that it necessary to broadcast on this issue tomorrow, and only to provide notice
of that to us now, when it was offered to the BBC on Thursday?

This does not reflect fair treatment of our organisation, particularly as we acted in good faith in offering to
provide copies of both reports last Thursday.

Best wishes

Mark
