1.0 Process Introduction

The following terms are defined to assist understanding of this process:
e An Incident is defined as:

“Any event that is not part of the Standard Operation of a Service and that causes,
or may cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that Service’

e A Problem is defined as the underlying root cause of one or more Incidents.

e A Known Error is an Incident or a Problem for which the root cause has
been diagnosed and a work round or cure has been identified.

¢ A Trend is an identifiable pattern or tendency.

1.1 Principles of Problem Management

The principles of Problem Management may be stated as:

Problems are investigated and diagnosed in order to identify their
root cause and provide a resolution.

Problem Management must be centralised.
Problem Management will work reactively.

Problem Management will work proactively.

The Problem Management process provides the ability to identify and resolve the
root-cause of incidents quickly and effectively.

The process also provides a way of identifying problems that may cause several
incidents by proactively analysing incident and problem trends.

Problem Management must be closely related to Incident Management in order to
ensure end-to-end management of customer issues. It is responsible for accepting
unresolved incidents escalated from Incident Management.

Problem Management is focused on finding the solution, whereas Incident
Management is focused on restoring the service.

2.0 Identify and Resolve Problems

2.1. Functional Overview

The purpose of this process is to investigate and identify the root cause of
unresolved incidents and to provide resolutions to those problems. In the course of
these investigations, the process may also identify short-term fixes or workarounds
to resolve incidents.

Problems identified are thoroughly analysed using (where available):
© Problem correlation tools,
¢ Internal and external knowledge databases;
e Information from management information,

Until an accurate diagnosis can be made. A workaround is devised where the
resolution is unknown or there is a Known Error. In order to affect a resolution to
the problem, it may be necessary to raise a Change Request to implement the
necessary change.

2.2 Process Benefits

This process provides the following benefits:

e It reduces the recurrence of service affecting incidents;
. It reduces business impact of problems by timely resolution.
2.3 Scope

The scope of this process includes the investigation of the underlying root cause of
unresolved incidents and the provision of resolutions.

It does not include the implementation of resolutions, nor does it include the
management of changes necessary to effect those resolutions.

2.4 Process Description

2.4.1 Identify Potential Problems

Problems can be identified from many sources: major incidents, recurrent incidents, incident
trends, requests from customers, requests from suppliers and, very importantly, through pro-
active investigation of management and incident data to look for possible new problems.

Process Details
Version: 5.0

COMPANY-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 20-JAN-2005

2.4.2 Raise and Assign a Problem Record

A request to raise a problem record has been received by the PAM, Problem &
Availability Manager or a recognised Service Manager who will manage the
Problem.

The Problem Manager will raise the problem on the PMDB, classify it as one of
three:

¢ Cross Domain Problem (Obtain a POL Reference Number to do this)
¢ Problem Branch
¢ Internal Problem

The PAM may well manage the Problem. If he assess, that the Problem is best handled by a
specific Service Manager, (one responsible for the Service area the Problem relates to), he will
allocate that Service Manager as the Problem Manager.

2.4.3 Problem Investigation

The assigned Problem Manager will initially investigate the problem to see if he can
identify the root cause of and a solution to the problem.

If he is unable to do this he will decide which support or development teams will be
able to assist. He will then manage these resources until the root cause has been
identified and a solution identified. A plan and timescale should be agreed with the
solution resources to ensure progress to conclusion.

2.4.4 Resolve the Problem
Following identification of a solution it must be implemented.

For technical changes this is likely to require a Change Request. In the case of
software changes this will mean liaising with Release Management.

For people and/or process change a change request is not necessarily required.

The required changes should be planned and implemented according to the plan.

Following implementation there should be an agreed period of monitoring and review in order
to ensure that all involved agree that the problem has been finally resolved.

2.4.5 Problem Closure

When it has been agreed by all parties that a problem has been fully resolved it
should be closed.

Also, when a problem is a duplicate or is not accepted as a problem it should be closed.

All relevant parties must be informed that the problem has now been closed.

3.0 Process Indicators

The introduction of an integrated Problem Management process and function should
have a noticeable impact on the levels of service provided to the users of the
infrastructure. It is however vital that the effectiveness of the process is measured
on a regular basis in order to highlight areas for attention as part of an ongoing
Service Improvement Plan.

The following are typical of Indicators that may be used to measure the
effectiveness of the Problem Management process.

Total effort for this process (FTEs)

Time Sheet data

Number of problems received (by priority)

Incidents and Problems database

Number of problems resolved (by priority)

Incidents and Problems database

Number of outstanding problems (by
bracket of elapsed time to date, by priority)

Incidents and Problems database

Resolution time (by priority)

Incidents and Problems database

Percentage of problems resolved within
agreed thresholds (by priority)

Incidents and Problems database

Number of incidents and problems to be
analysed
