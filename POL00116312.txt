Hi thanks - really helpful.

Could you also send a word doc to me and Theresa as I had a couple of my own overnight notes I will add.

The only option not mentioned and checking therefore if deliberate is that we find a face save exit for SS eg., the
finish the themed report, hand it over and back out with grace and thanks. (They could be asked to stay on the
WG.) We use it to put cases through but via Grant Thornton or other well resourced supplier. (And ideally, we
would triage and review all reports first before going into a combination of mediation, adjudication, and ongoing

disclosure/ criminal case review.
