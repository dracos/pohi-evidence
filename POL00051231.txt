Dear Jarnail,

Post Office Limited ~ v — Susan Jane Rudkin.

Mrs. Rudkin attended Burton-On-Trent Magistrates’ Court yesterday repres~
ented by Miss Lawrence of the local Firm of The Smith Partnership as agent
for Richard Nelson of Nottingham.

On a Plea Before Venue basis Mrs. Rudkin pleaded guilty to the single count
of theft. After hearing an outline of the circumstances she was inevitably
committed for sentence to Stafford Crown Court on a date to be notified.

She was granted unconditional bail. A copy of the summary of facts was given
to the Probation Service to facilitate preparation of the pre-sentence
report.

The Defence advises that arrangements are currently in hand to repay the
stolen money at the rate of £1,000-00 per month, Please confirm this and
let me know whether, given this instalment plan, there is to be any applic-
ation for compensation at the Crown Court and, if so, its amount.

Please also let me have a schedule of the investigative and administrative
costs to be claimed and a copy of the signed Admission statement referred
to in paragraph 5 of the Summary of Facts.

Please note that I will retain the papers in order to continue prosecuting
the case for you in the Crown Court and will arrange to serve the usual
bundle of documents well before the sentencing hearing. I will also liaise
with the Court's Listing Office as to its date.

As this concludes the summary proceedings I enclose my invoice which I trust
is in order and, if so, please pass it to your Accounts Department for pay-

ment.

Yours sincerely

_ GRO _

JOHN H. DOVE.

Encl,
