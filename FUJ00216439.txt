Hi Gerald,

Thank you, far as we can see the duplicate records are already showing in the ARQ data.

We will send the data to POL with a covering statement to explain why there are duplicate
records.

Hi Andy,
If you redo the queries as slow ARQs then you can produce the spreadsheets but with the duplicates listed.
You then need a separate explanation to be set to the Post Office as to why there are duplicates in this case.

Gerald Barnes

Can’t remember what we did at the time.
Can you think what we did Gerald ?

; Dunks, And

Farzin - Your problem with duplicates in an ARQ is another occurrence of the problem detailed below.
Andy — Can you remember if/how this was worked around last time?

Alan,
This was the issue.

Gerald subsequently told me “It turned out that the share on which they sat was migrated that day and the audit
configuration file was modified by hand with two separate paths to the same migrated share which caused the files to
be copied twice. It was incorrect procedure to modify the audit configuration files by hand.”

Hi Andy,

Yes it is something to be concerned about. Please raise a PEAK. I am copying all the transaction files to the
local disk of an audit workstation right now.

I have already got on a USB stick two files which contain the first set of duplicates so that can be examined by
anyone who wishes right now.

I have studied the first message, 5026965, in detail and it looks like the complete and same transaction is in
both files.

Regards,
Gerald Barnes
