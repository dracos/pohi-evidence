1.1. Service Hours

The Application Support Service (Fourth Line) is not directly available to Post Office. It is a service
internal to Fujitsu Services and is available between 09:00hrs to 17:30hrs Monday to Thursday and
09:00hrs to 17:00hrs Friday.

The Application Support Service (Fourth Line) is available on-call during other times for pre-planned
events as agreed between Service Operations and the respective Development Managers.

If Ad-Hoc out of hours support is required to respond to, for example, a major incident, then any 4LS
Application Support response will be on an availability basis.

1.2 Incident Management

The Application 4LS and 3LS work closely together in the analysis and resolution of Software Incidents.
The Application 4LS will provide Software support by:

(a) Receiving from the 3LS, Software related Incidents which cannot be resolved by the 3LS.
Such Incidents will have been originally logged by the Service Desk following a call from a
Branch, or having been logged by the Systems Management Service, the Central Network
Service or the Data Centre Operations Service.

(b) Ensuring the internal Fujitsu Services Incident Management systems are updated with the

Incident resolution details prior to return to the 3LS_ together with the method of recreating
the problem;

(C) Ensuring that the known error log is updated with the detail of the resolution for that
incident.

(d) Ensuring that any resolutions which are returned to 3LS have been tested and have been
correctly authorised in accordance with the Release Authorisation Proce

1.2.1 System Incident

The 4th Line team will assist 3° Line Support to resolve any system incidents in accordance with the
incident management process (as described in SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 and detailed in section 3.2 of this
document).

All incidents must have been logged in Triole for service (TFS). It is the responsibility of the HSD or
SMC to understand the severity and status of the incident - then the call is passed to Peak for 3LS if
necessary. It is the responsibility of the 3LS to determine the status of the incident and whether it
requires further analysis in which case the analysis details will be logged in Peak.

1.2.2 Major Incidents

Major incidents affecting the HNGx service delivery to Post Office Ltd

In the event of a major incident affecting the HNGX services, an incident will be logged and managed in
accordance with the SVM/SDM/PRO/0001 and Fujitsu CPM31 processes to ensure that all
communication is clear, concise and occurs quickly. For a definition of a Major incident please refer to
section 3 of SVM/SDM/PRO/001.

Investigation and diagnosis of the incident may require attendance at technical bridge teleconferences.
The team will be required to provide updates on the current impact of the incident, perform corrective
actions and record information in the major incident template at regular intervals for the duration of the
incident.

As part of an on-going service assurance activity, team members will be mandatory participants in
regular Major Incident and Post Incident Reviews.

Major incident affecting the delivery of the 4LS service from IND49.

These are incidents that affect the provision of the 4LS service from IND49 and should be raised by the
GDC Operations Manager to the UK 4LS Applications Manager.

1.2.3. Service Targets

This section describes the operational service targets that have been agreed with Service Operations to
underpin operational delivery of the service. The identified targets will be measured at 95% achievement
over a rolling 3 month period

The 4LS is not subject to contractual SLAs or Operational Service Targets. To ensure that appropriate
timely response is enabled incidents managed between 3LS and 4LS will be subject to the following
conditions and timeframes:

3LS will ensure that all incidents passed to 4LS will be transferred within half life for each of the
identified priorities and timescales defined below:

¢ A Priority - 2 working days

© B Priority - 4 working days

« C Priority - 7 working days

¢ D Priority - 28 working days
For example:

« Will be passed to 4LS within 2 days of receipt by 3% Line Support

«An incident resolution, as agreed with 3LS, will be provided by 4LS within the overall 4 day 3LS
window.

It is essential that incidents are proactively managed and that regular updates are provided on Peak to
ensure that all parties are kept informed on progress to resolution. To achieve this, the following
guidelines are provided:

« A Priority —- ongoing review, incident update provided at least once day
« B Priority — review and update at least once every 2 working days.

« Cand D priority should be reviewed and updated when the peak is actioned.

3LS will endeavour to pass incidents to 4LS at the earliest opportunity within the agreed half life and
provide early warning for higher priority incidents.

3LS will ensure that any incident passed to 4LS will contain the minimum data set of information as
required by any associated support guide for the application area of concern.

The incident clock related to 4LS support will start from the point that 4LS receives the incident as a
Peak.

The 4LS incident clock will stop when the incident has been identified resolved as agreed with 3LS.

It is expected that although calls may enter 3LS at high priority, in the majority of cases, 3LS will
produce a resolution for the incident. 3LS will subsequently review the priority of any peak related to a
resolved incident that requires further root cause analysis and update that priority in agreement with
service operations.

1.3 Problem Management

The 4LS team will be actively involved in the problem management process (as described in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0025) to proactively perform investigations into the root cause of incidents.

All known errors should be recorded and changes should be proposed to resolve problems. These will be
discussed at the regular service review.

1.3.1. Service Targets

There are no Service Targets applied to problem management and root cause analysis of resolved
incidents, although Service Operations may determine a priority of a root cause based on service
impact. These priorities will be determined on a case by case basis.

1.3.2. Business Impact Review

Prior to 3LS passing any resolved incident to 4LS for root cause analysis or code fixing, the peak will be
reviewed by Business Impact Forum to agree that a root cause analysis or a coded fix are required to
maintain the operational service. It is expected that BIF will ensure that a business impact statement is
provided on peak prior to the peak being passed to 4LS.

1.3.3. Known Errors

In most cases 3LS will have raised an entry in the KEL identifying a “known error” following receipt of the
incident. Where 4LS identify a KEL has not been raised for a peak passed to 4LS for root cause
analysis, 4LS will raise a KEL as required and determined by the analysis.

Where a KEL has been previously raised by 3LS then 4LS will update the KEL based on the analysis and
further update the KEL where the root cause is identified

4LS will ensure that KEL information is communicated to 3LS who will approve that the Known Error Log
(KEL) has been appropriately updated and confirm the information is disseminated to the Service Desk
to enable the resolution of similar Incidents;

1.4 Change Management

This section covers:
e Change Proposals for change that will affect the whole service delivery model and
e Managed Service Change (MSC) raised for operational change in the delivery of the service by
ALS teams
« Managed Service Change required to GDC support services infrastructure (for example
changes in infrastructure/operation in IND49).

4LS will follow the defined framework for Post Office Account change management (as defined in
PA/PRO/001) Change Proposals (CPs)

As part of the major release process 4LS teams will participate in, provide feedback to and undertake the
activities identified during the planning of major releases.

For operational changes (MSC) 4LS teams will create and impact MSCs (Managed Service Change
Process on Café Vik) for operational changes being carried out on the Post Office Account’s
infrastructure for the services.

For GDC support service change a MSC will be raised to allow proper impacting of any change and
authorisation as required by the relevant GDC SoW

1.4.1. Change Proposals (CPs)

4LS will impact CPs (as described in PGM/CHM/PRO/0001) with an accurate prediction of the time and
expenses required to perform the proposed activities. Where there is ambiguity then the team will seek
to clarify with the CP author before submitting their impact.

Where required, 4LS may be requested to implement urgent change proposals as part of a maintenance
release. This will be on the authorisation of the account's operations and programme management
teams.

1.4.2 I Managed Service Change (MSC)

4LS will create and impact MSCs (Managed Service Change Process on Café Vik) for operational changes
being carried out on the Post Office Account's infrastructure for the services (as described in 1 Service
Summary).

e No changes will be carried out without an approved MSC. Any changes related to an incident
should be authorised via MSC. Only if the change is extremely urgent and there is not enough
time for formal MSC approval should the MSC be raised retrospectively — this change would still
require authorisation from service operations.

e No changes will be carried out that will cause an interruption of service.

e The change originator is responsible for ensuring that the change is completed in accordance to
best working practices and operational standards. Appropriate levels of implementation,
communication, regression and test planning must be completed.

« Team members may be required to support MSCs raised by other teams.

e Following the successful completion of an MSC, the team will update any localised working
instructions and documentation to ensure the detail reflects the service being provided.

1.5 Configuration Management

4LS will comply with the POA Configuration Management procedures and policy statements (
PGM/CM/MAN/0004).

4LS are expected to maintain a high level inventory of the support infrastructure and tooling for the
purposes of call-logging, security vulnerability checking etc. Each member of the team is expected to

work with other teams to gain a good working knowledge of exactly how the Infrastructure underpins the
delivery of services to the Post Office Account.

4LS is to create and maintain an asset register of all inventory associated with the 4LS service.
This includes any additions and amendments to, and removals from:
e A Support Infrastructure Host, Server or process

« Changes to the configuration of the existing Software/ hardware configurations across the
Support Infrastructure.

e Backup Schedule.
1.6 Release Management

The team will support the Release Management function within the Post Office Account in consulting on
planned releases. All new releases will be implemented as planned changes performed under the MSC.
Process and in accordance with the POA Release Management Procedure: SVM/SDM/PRO/0030.

4LS will support the Release Management function by attending the Release Management/Fault
Management forums on a regular basis. The forum will review the forward schedule of releases and
agree prioritisation.

2  4LS External Interfaces and Service Commitment

The following sections define the interfaces to parties external to the 4LS Application Service and the
commitments between the parties in delivery of the service.

2.1 3LS Commitment in support of 4LS

Commitment

Measurement/Metric

To ensure that all incidents or problems passed to
4LS are logged on a call management system
(currently Peak)

No incidents or problems are progressed or chased
with 4LS that are not first passed on Peak.

To “filter” all incidents for which the problem is
already known to the support community and for
which a resolution is already known or has been
generated. This includes problems for which a
resolution is known to 3LS but not yet incorporated
into the known deficiencies register available to
HSD/IMT/SMC.

No incidents passed to 4LS which are
subsequently identified as known errors, except in
cases where the resolution was known to 4LS, but
this information had not been passed to 3LS in the
form of a KEL or diagnostic guide.

To retain in the Peak system, under the 3LS
“stack” duplicate incidents - i.e. incidents which are
repetitions of an incident which has already been
passed to 4LS, and to ensure that when the
resolved incident is received by 3LS, the
duplicated incident records in peak are closed.
Under normal circumstances, where a duplicate
incident is identified by 3LS, this will be reported
back to the HSD/IMT/SMC and closed as a
duplicate incident on Peak.

No duplicated incidents passed to 4LS unless no
KEL exists containing the PEAK number i.e. the
duplicate incident could not have been found.

basis that the evidence was _ inadequate.
Specifically excluded from this measure are
instances where, although the evidence was
inadequate, 4LS had not indicated to 3LS that the
evidence that would be required for such an
incident. E.g. In a KEL or support guide.

To ensure that any incident which requires
investigation by 4LS is assigned to the correct
Peak team dependent on the specific product in
which the incident has occurred.

No calls misrouted because of
assignment by 3LS

incorrect

To ensure that any incidents passed to 4LS units
are passed in a timely manner. The timings will
vary according to the total time allowed for
resolution of the incident in the contract between
Fujitsu Services Post Office Account and the
customer. These timings will therefore be
dependant on the priority of the incident, with (for
example) less time allowed for an “A” priority call
than will be permitted for a “C” priority.

Incidents are passed within the times specified in
section 2.2.3

To ensure that the priority of any incident is
assessed and recorded correctly

No incident is passed to 4LS whose priority does
not conform to the specification defined in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0875.

To “filter” all incidents and problems for which the
anticipated resolution or root cause is not one of
the following -

i) Software error
ii) Documentation error.

iii) Design Error

No incidents or problems passed from 3LS to 4LS
units to be subsequently resolved or root cause as
anything other than software, documentation or
design issues.

To ensure that for any incident passed to 4LS, the
exact area of the incident or problem has been
identified, and wherever possible a resolution
already produced and the peak updated.

No cases identified by 4LS staff of inadequate
diagnosis by 3LS

To create and maintain a register of known errors
with the RMG Account solution, which include
detail of the resolution for these incidents (where
known), and to allow access to this register to 4LS
units so that they can enter details of resolutions or
root cause identified within their area

“Known error” record to be created and populated
by 3LS with access provided to all of the support
community.

ALS will assist the POA Applications Service Manager by ensuring that the 4LS service provided
supports the service level targets underpinning the HNGX contract and will notify the POA Application
Service Manager of specific issues in aspects of the 4LS service being managed by 4LS.

Development systems availability refers to both onshore and offshore support environments. If an
activity or process specifically relates to either offshore or onshore services, then that will be clearly
identified in the appropriate text.

ALS teams will recommend appropriate service improvement through CSIP activities for the life of the
ALS service.

As part of the 4LS service, ongoing support for the 4LS development infrastructure will be carried out.
This ongoing support shall include the key elements as defined in Appendix C:

3.1. Capacity Management

4LS will ensure adequate controls are in place to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to run the 4LS
Development services (scope as described in Service Summary).

4LS GDC services will implement a simple script based performance monitoring approach on the 4LS
servers in IND49 to ensure that server utilisation does not exceed acceptable levels. This will be part of
the standard server monitoring activities to be provided by the GDC server support team. Alert
thresholds will be defined for the servers to clearly set out circumstances requiring escalation to
management.

4LS will ensure that they have the appropriate resources necessary to deliver the 4LS service.
4LS GDC will use the BT Reporting Facility to monitor the ODC to UK connection.

3.2 Supplier Management

The 4LS teams will be responsible for supporting POA Application Service Management at 3” party
supplier service reviews and working alongside 3” parties to resolve incidents across the system.

The team have no direct ownership of suppliers underpinning the HNGX service; all contracts with 3°
parties are managed by the POA Application Service Manager.

3.3 Security Management

The 4LS teams will be responsible for working within the framework provided by the account in relation
to the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the services (as described in 1.0 Service Summary)
and will adhere to security policies defined by the account and Corporate Infrastructure Services and the
POA security policy.

The GDC provided 4LS support infrastructure is a shared space environment, providing a number of
shared services including user Anti Virus, Active Directory, Email and printing.

To meet Post Office security requirements the 4LS GDC Support environment will be physically
separate environments.

The Developer users in the 4LS GDC Support environment will be members of the GDC domain, and
will use the existing domain controllers and exchange servers for authentication and email traffic. PGP
encryption has been identified as a requirement to encrypt any confidential data sent via email. Two
instances of PGP will be deployed within the environment in the 4LS GDC Support environment on

relevant Administrator/Managers desktops. If at that point the 4LS support team need to send any
confidential documentation, this will need to be packaged up using the PGP desktop software to be a self
extracting mechanism. Passphrases must be issued by a second means of communication and follow
the POA Security Policy standards (e.g. SMS).To ensure that any data being printed does not leave the
secure 4LS LAN a dedicated Print Server will be provided.

The RED Hat and Solaris servers in the environment will not integrate with either Fujitsu or GDC Active
directories or any other LDAP server for authentication or access control. Consequently all user accounts
and groups will be local ones.

The GDC 4LS LAN will be protected from the GDC network by the Cisco ASA pairs, which will in turn be
protected from outside the GDC by the Checkpoint firewall pairs in the GDC.

The GDC firewalls will control access to the 4LS GDC Services and to the internet. Incoming access to
the 4LS GDC network will be restricted to the reference data team in Bracknell. A restricted internet
access will be allowed to named sites from the GDC 4LS LAN.

The internet VPN for backup of the main MPLS WAN link will use agreed security parameters, with the
shared key issued and communicated by Fujitsu Services Core ISP implementation team to the partner
company engineers on phone.

4 Documentation

4LS will be responsible for the maintenance and management of local working instructions and support
infrastructure documentation and will perform the following associated activities as required by the area
of the service and the level and type of documentation:
