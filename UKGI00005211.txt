Dear Lady Neville-Rolfe,

Further to my letter of 15 June 2015, we have become aware that the National Federation of
Sub Postmasters has voted to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Post Office
Ltd.

In our view this is potentially problematic because of the mechanisms that underpin the
Memorandum of Understanding.

Our greatest concern is that the Memorandum of Understanding fundamentally changes the
relationship between Post Office Ltd and Postmasters. We believe that it is arguable that the
Post Office's conduct effectively infringes the rights held by our members under Article 11 of
the Human Rights Act.

Our understanding is that a number of clauses in the Memorandum are intended to rule out
collective bargaining and are wholly contrary to the general functions of a trade union. It is
clear to us that the Memorandum is intended to establish an exclusive relationship between
NFSP Ltd and the Post Office in relation to contractual and representative issues for
Postmasters.

We believe that this latest development, and the legal advice we have received in respect of
it, reinforces the points made in my letter of 15 June 2015 and emphasises the need and
value of an early meeting between us.

I hope to receive a positive reply from your office on these matters shortly.

Yours sincerely

Dave Ward
General Secretary
