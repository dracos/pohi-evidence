Hi Tracey,

There is no specific training for Whistleblowing, however, it is covered in our annual Anti-Bribery & Corruption training.
All new joiners must complete this training within 30 days of joining. For reference I have attached a copy of the last
email I sent regarding PB policy Q&A back in April.

!am happy to answer any PB AML, CTF, ABC and Financial Crime queries. However, I would advise that going forward it
is sent to our team inbox (financial.crim jas this is always monitored and will help ensure you get a
quicker response.

Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks.
Kind regards,

e Vitor Camara

Hi Tracey,
Can you let Vitor know what the query is in relation to and we can repsond.

Georgina - what training was delivered last year on Whistleblowing? It is included in the ABC training due
to roll out this September (which I believe is mandatory for all new employees within 30 days of joining)
and there was a One/Intranet article on whistleblowing in April this year, but I am not aware of anything

else?

Morning Georgina

Ihave 1 further follow up question on the answers you provided in May

e You say the Whistleblowing training is annual and not included in the induction. Does this mean that someone
who joined the day after the annual training would not receive any whistle blowing training for a year? What
would happen in this instance?

If you could please respond by Friday please as Lloyds have a meeting they require the information for.

WHISTLEBLOWING

21.1 - PLEASE UPLOAD YOUR WHISTLE
BLOWING POLICY AND PROCESS.

Post Office will not release this
internal-only policy

DOES YOUR WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

21.2 - REGULAR TRAINING FOR ALL
EMPLOYEES ON THIS PROCESS
INCLUDING UPON INDUCTION?

Annual training is provided, but is
not included as part of induction

21.3 - SPECIFIC TRAINING TO
ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO REPORT A
CONCERN THAT IMPACT THE BANK'S
EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR THE BANK
AS A WHOLE?

No

21.4 - CONTROLS TO ENSURE THAT ANY
ALLEGATIONS IMPACTING THE BANK'S
EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR THE BANK
AS A WHOLE ARE REPORTED TO THE
BANK VIA AN INDEPENDENT ROUTE?

There is a process in place to
enable third parties to whistleblow
