Saheed has asked me to do some investigations into this Branch and most of the relevant data will have been archived
from BRSS by now.

Therefore please can you retrieve the data as for an ARQ. I would appreciate the data in the normal ARQ spreadsheet
format (transactions and Events please) plus the raw XML that I believe that you get from the audit system as part of
the process (I can then dig through that for any further info I might need — this will be a useful exercise to see how
easy it is to find things in the HNG-X XML format!).

Details are:

1. Branch 159632
2. Dates: 13/7/10 to 19/8/10 and 13/9/10 to 15/10/10

Thanks.
Regards

Gareth

Saheed,

\’ve had a quick look at the info that Mark has already provided to POL about the Discrepancies issue last year and
how it relates to this Branch.

It looks like this Branch hit the problem twice — which may be why there is confusion.

Initially there was a £393.35 Trading Discrepancy at the end of TP 04 detected on 18/08/2010 (the problem could have
occurred at any time from 14/7/10 to 18/8/10).

There was then a further Trading Discrepancy of -£729.01 at the end of TP 06 detected on 13/10/2010 (the problem
could have occurred at any time from 15/9/10 to 13/10/10).

These put together result in a net discrepancy of -£335.66.

The data relating to the first period will now have gone from BRSS as will some of the data from the second period.

FUJ00229039

Given that it is now clear that this Branch hit the bug twice (as did Branch 208020), is that sufficient info for POL, or do
we need to retrieve the audit data for the relevant periods and carry out a more complete analysis?

Regards

Gareth

Saheed,

It is probably technically possible. However given that this is a normal SU it is likely to be significantly more work that
on the other one I did, since I deliberately chose a branch where the problem was ina little used SU to keep things
simple. I may need support from SSC and Audit to get the relevant info. I’m also conscious that as data is held for 6
months, then we are close to losing the relevant info.

Regards

Gareth

Please see below. Is it feasible to create a story board for this branch?
POL are still drafting the formal letter of response. It was on version 27 yesterday.

Hi

I've only been doing part of a job again. This branch had a loss of £713.11 in October when the recorded the £729.01
gain was not accounted for. The branch has rung in relation to this and the branch discrepancy has been blocked.

My letter is based upon netting off the two values. In this case an overall loss of £377.45 will remain on the Customer
Account. Whilst I am loathe to write off a loss and pay back the gain I appreciate others may have a more strategic
view! Trouble would be that we would either end up sending them some money or just doing an inaccurate fudge to
get the Customer Account to zero.
