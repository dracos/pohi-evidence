FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN

1 Introduction’

1.1 Process Objective and Scope

The objective of this document is to define the process for Problem Management in the POA
environment to support the contracted infrastructure and application services described in the HNG-X
Contract. Other infrastructure and services used by POA to provide and support delivery of the HNG-X
contract are also in scope of the process. For the purpose of this document a Problem is defined as the
unknown underlying root cause of one or more Incidents.

The Problem Management Process covers both reactive and proactive functions of Problem
Management.

The scope of Reactive Problem Management is from identification of a Problem through to closure and
includes root cause analysis, identification of Known Errors, initiation of any necessary Change Requests
and the provision of management information to POA & POL. Problem Management is responsible for
ensuring that resources are prioritised to resolve Problems in the appropriate order based on business
need.

The scope of Proactive Problem Management includes trend analysis and investigation to identify
potential Problems, which are then progressed through the Problem Management process to be removed
from the estate.

The aim of Problem Management is to investigate, eliminate or prevent causes of Incidents and Known
Errors regarding POA & POL Infrastructure/Information System and to prevent the recurrence of
Incidents related to these Errors. To achieve this aim, Problem Management seeks to establish the Root
Cause of Incidents and then start actions to improve or correct the situation. The objective of Problem
Management is:

« To minimise disruption to the business by proactive identification and analysis of the cause of
service Incidents and by managing Problems to closure

e To ensure escalation as part of a defined escalation process

e To efficiently and effectively identify the Root Cause of Incidents/Problems

e To define Known Errors and their permanent fixes and/or temporary Workarounds, associated
with all incidents

e To track and maintain relationships between Known Errors and existing incidents

e To identify Problem trends, to assess the performance of the Problem Management process and
the quality of services delivered to POL.

For clarity it should be noted that:

The POA Problem Manager role exists within the POA Problem Management and Major Incident
Management team and that Problem Managers have ‘multiple roles’ including the management of Major
Incidents.

Individual Problems are owned by POA Problem Managers responsible for managing problems within
the POA environment and liaising with POL and POL Third Party Problem Management teams for
problems in other environments.

‘ This whole document comprises text that has been identified to POL as evidence to support
Acceptance by Document review (DR) for Requirement SER-2144.

1.2

Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Problem Management process is to minimise adverse impact of Incidents and
Problems on the Post Office Estate, and to proactively prevent the re-occurrence of Incidents, Problems
and Errors. Problem Management focuses on finding the root cause of Incidents, creating Known Errors
and permanently removing Errors from the estate through the Change Management Process.

Although a Problem may be identified at any time, the management of Problems is essentially
conducted during office hours; i.e. 09:00 — 17:30 Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays.

1.3

1.3.1

Roles and Responsibilities

Process Owner

The owner of the process is the POA Service Delivery Manager responsible for Service Operations.

resolve the problem. The Problem Manager's responsibilities include:

.

Ensuring problems are clearly defined, contain all relevant information and are recorded in TfS
Ensuring appropriate information pertaining to a problem is gathered from all sources

Checking problems against Knowledge Database and ensuring the knowledgebase and KELs are
updated

Identifying and coordinating resources required to investigate and resolve problems

1.3.3. Problem Resolver

The Problem Resolver is responsible for finding a resolution to the problem, and is assigned by the
Problem Manager. There could be many resolvers involved in the investigation and resolution of a
problem. Additionally, the Problem Resolvers may exist within other Fujitsu Services delivery units or
within POL or associated POL Third Parties.

1.4 Process Metrics and Key Performance Indicators

The following metrics, to be reported monthly, will be used to measure effectiveness of the process and
drive performance of the process and overall service in general:

« Number and impacts of incidents occurring before root problem is identified and resolved
e Number of repeat incidents following corrective action

e Number of problem records arising from pro-active actions and trend analysis

e Number of changes arising from proactive actions

e Percentage of problem records without an action plan

e Average length of time to resolve problems

« Number of incidents closed without a KEL

« The number of Problem Records arising from Managed Changed (MSC,CP) activities.

e The number of Problem Records arising from the implementation of new services/major
releases.

1.5 Problem Information Management.

1.5.1 Problem Records
The Problem Records for POA are held on the TRIOLE Service Desk application.

The POA Problem Managers are required to select the Role - POA Resolver to access POA incidents
and problems

To access the POA problem Record Databases authorised individuals, including the POA Problem
Managers will need to:

Select ‘Service Desk’ tab
Click on ‘Search’ and select ‘Problem’

Select the ‘Tenant’ field and ensure the applicable POA Problem team is selected. By selecting Empty
on the ‘Active’ field all open and closed Problem Records for the selected POA Problem team will be
display.

To check for open Problem Records follow the same process but select Open on the Active field.

1.5.2 Problem Action Plans/Reports

CONFIDENCE)

Within the POA Service Management Portal
(http://sites.cafevik. fs. fujitsu.com/sites/00672/Service_Management/BCP/Forms/Allltems.aspx)

Problem Managers can access the Problem Action Plans by:

Selecting from the left-hand column - Service Support, select Problem Records, select Weekly Problem
Logs YYYY (enter the current year), then select the applicable report, e.g., the latest date.

These reports are held within a spreadsheet which contains three tabs; Horizon, POLSAP and Closed.
Select the appropriate tab on Horizon and POLSAP to see the latest status of the planned actions for
open problem records.

Problem Managers can provide updates to the Action Plans by ‘checking out’ the latest spreadsheet, and
incorporating updates to existing problems within the spreadsheet and creating new entries for applicable
new problems. After updating the spreadsheet it must be checked back-in with the current date and a
brief note.

1.1.3. Known Errors (including Problem Information).

Knowledge Database entries (also referred to as KELs) for POA products are held on the SSC Web Site.
It should be noted that the Knowledge facility within TRIOLE Service Desk is not used for POA products.

Problem Managers on being allocated a Problem Record should undertake a search of the KELs held on
the SSC Web Site prior to instigating Problem Resolvers to investigate the reported problem further.

KELs can be searched on the SSC Web Site via http://deathstar/SSC2/SSC_KEL/kel_search_menu.jsp

On resolution of a problem record the Problem Manager must liaise with the Problem Resolver to ensure
that an appropriate Knowledge Entry is documented in the KEL database on the SSC Web site.

POA Problem Managers have been provided with access details for the SSC Web site.

(For awareness; the HSD and IMT refer to Knowledge Database entries as Knowledge Articles)

3.1

Risks & Dependencies

Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

3.2

Insufficient time and resource to build and maintain a Knowledgebase

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Containment is to invoke escalation
procedures

Resistance by parties to carry out pro-active recommendations to reduce number of Incidents.
Containment is to investigate and address any issues, before escalating to senior management
Increased business and operational impact through lack of Problem progress updates to POL.
Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for problem diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering

Loss of any infrastructure component which links support systems to the live estate

Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

« Effective use of the process by IMT and SDUs
e Effective routing of Problems to SDUs and third parties
e Effective escalation procedures within Fujitsu, POL and third parties
«POL acceptance of feedback, contributing to end user education and reduced Incident rates
e Effective collaboration diagnosis between SDU’s and third parties
