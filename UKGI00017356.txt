Ok useful to know

Agreed re Howard, and worth him meeting them in the context of the need for the next SR
deal too (which I'll give him a bit on). The one thing we need to be careful about is that
actually SROC has approved both proposals on POL pay we have taken to it. So it's more
the threat of SROC which has dragged the process out and been used to negotiate them
down. Howard could legitimately say he's not knocked anything back.

Ihave given Neil a rather frank briefing re Howard at the Board dinner.
Presumably it is actually not unhelpful if she moans re pay to him given how
hard the whole process is.

Re Alice I think what's useful is if u take the same line I did if it comes up
which is to say: (a) I am the shareholders representative on the Board so it is
unrealistic to imagine there wouldn't be a dialogue between you and me or me
/ Whitehall (b) because I am out of the office now I am probably talking less
to you guys than I would otherwise (c) I am well aware of my duties re board
and conflicts etc and perfectly capable of managing them.

I agreed with her I would try and be clear especially in e mails about what I
was referring to so eg on the results thing I should have said "as Sarah said at
arc, ShEx got Wednesdays draft". However I said I would not agree a more
detailed protocol about when I spoke to you and about what (and effectively
everyone need to be a bit more grown up about all this).

She did raise the whole roger thing with me and I said once I knew what I
would do on return maybe we could streamline that a bit...

She's keen that u r as frank with her as poss so if I were you I would mention
the Paula ft piece and say u were a bit disappointed she was engaging with the
press on things like timing and financial sustainability when there has been no
interaction formally between ShEx and pol on this

I am having a catch-up with Alice on Tuesday so let me know if there is
anything you'd be keen for me to impress. She's also coming in to see

Howard, where I've no doubt she'll whinge about pay. Not sure how far
she'll get with that. I'm going to do Howard a note today.

I sent an email about the results before we had spoken
saying I didn't know what draft you guys had but that u
needed to see the latest. It was purely based on a comment
Sarah made at risk committee so was not reflecting any
conversation between u and me so put Alice squarely back
in her box; and the other thing was that I emailed Chris
ages ago to say I thought he better double check on
contracts signed v open on ntp. So remind me to tell u the
full story on that latter one

Really?! What was it that prompted that?

Ps can't remember if I told u but most of
my lunch with Alice was about pol
feeling unhappy about me talking to you
which is about the craziest thing I ever
heard, so we should touch on that too

Hi Susannah,

That's a good idea and

Emma - please can you
find us a room for two
hours from 10 to 12 on
Wednesday of next
week?

Thanks,

Hi Will

Strangely my mind
wandered to POL
yesterday and I was
thinking that actually
there are quite a few
issues it would be
good to get your
views on and have a
discussion about. Any
chance you ahve a bit
of time next week? I
could maybe come
into the office and we
could do a session
(with Tim or whoever
too if helpful). I am
meeting Paula at lpm
on Wednesday at Old
St so could come in
about 10 am Wed and
do a couple of hours
if you are free? If you
can't do then, lets try
and find another time.

Things I would like to
cover are:

(i) Strategic direction
and funding

(ii) Competitive
threats and likely

(iii) Evolution of

POL

(iv) Mutualisation and
how that plays out (cf
Paula's latest
comments in FT)

(v) FS and strategy
