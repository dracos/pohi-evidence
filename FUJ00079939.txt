1.0 Introduction

11 Process Owner

The owners of this process are the Fujitsu Service Desk Operations Manager and the POA
Service Manager responsible for the Fujitsu contract.

12 Process Objective

The objective of this document is to define the process for Incident Management of the POA
environment. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may
cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

This process applies to all Incidents received by the POA Service Desk, whether or not they
are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the Service Desk, through to the
successful workaround or resolution of the incident.

13 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation
as quickly as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn this ensures
the highest level of service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as
service operation within Service Level Targets (SLT).

This process takes account of the requirements of improved service to be delivered to POL,
through the introduction of the HSD. The implementation of the IMT is documented and is
aimed at delivering improved understanding and communication between POL and POA
leading to an increase in the perceived service level within POL.

2.0 Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

¢ All Incidents reported by Contact with the POA Horizon Service Desk. Contact is defined
as voice or Tivoli Alert as the methods of communication with the Horizon Service Desk
and fall into the following categories:

© Business process error

© Hardware or software error

o Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
o Network Error

e Severity and SLT information.

e Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from OMDB. Due to the urgent nature of these
alerts they will be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or resolution
supplied to HSD. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step 3, and are
not subject to steps 1 & 2 of this process.

3.0 Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

© Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation
procedures.

e Non-availability of the Powerhelp or HSH ONE systems. Mitigation is given in the
Service Desk Business Continuity Plan.

e Lack of information given to the Service Desk regarding changes, POL Business updates,

request for changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this

risk, such as the Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the HSD, SDU’s or 3" party suppliers

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

eoceee

3.2 Dependencies
This process is dependent on:

e Effective Incident handling by the Service Desk
e The Known Error Database being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root
cause becomes known to Problem Management

1.2 The caller may be enquiring about an existing Incident. Details are provided and if the
response is satisfactory, Contact is ended, moving the incident to step 5. If the caller
is not satisfied with the response, the relevant Escalation Procedure is invoked
(CS/PRD/122 Customer Service Major Incident Communication Process). In cases of
Incidents that are either taking a long time to resolve or involve multiple SDU’s, the
Service Desk alerts Problem Management to provide focused management of the
Incident.

1.3 For a new Incident, Contact details are recorded if not system generated. Details
taken are dependent upon the error reported. Typically they may include:

The user’s name and unique ID number

Location and contact details

Alternative contact details (where appropriate)

Hardware details as appropriate

Software error details, including application use at point of failure where known

Business and User Impact

Description of Incident

Location access times

Caller assessment of the priority of the incident.

Ce

1.4 Classification of Call determined as one of the following:

e Error Incident — invoke Incident Management Process Step 2

© Quality — record details of complaint or compliment and invoke relevant Escalation
Procedure (CS/PRD/122 Customer Service Major Incident Communication
Process)

e Advice & Guidance — refer to NBSC.

© Out of scope — if the call is not within scope for the services provided by Fujitsu
advise the caller of the correct number or refer to POL NBSC and close incident.

1.5 The caller is advised of call reference number and the incident follows the process as
appropriate for the nature of the call.

2.1 The Service Desk agent collects additional information in order to determine the
nature, impact and urgency of the Incident.

2.2 Call Severity is assigned based on the impact and urgency as per the following
criteria:

Severity I Importance I Definition

A Critical e BUSINESS STOPPED, a Post Office down, unable to
process any business, or central system failure which will
result in a number of Post Offices being unable to process
work.

B Major ¢ BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its
ability to transact business, e.g. one counter down.

Cc Medium e NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a
known disability, e.g. an interim solution (workaround) has
been provided.

D Low e INTERNAL, an internal HSH/HIT/SMC problem, e.g. a help
desk PC or a phone set inoperable.

2.3 If the incident is considered a Major Incident as defined in CS/PRD/122 Customer Service
Major Incident Communication Process, Escalation Procedures are invoked to alert:

Fujitsu Service Management
POL Service Management
Fujitsu Service Delivery Units
Third Parties.

The agent should also be aware that a Serious Complaint should also follow the
Escalation Procedure, to enable the HSD Problem Manager to make a professional
judgment concerning the severity of the complaint. In this context a Serious
Complaint is defined as one threatening contact with Media, Politicians or threatening
violence of any form.

Problem Management is also alerted to assist in the management of Major Incidents.

2.4 The Service Desk agent then attempts to resolve the Incident using the resources
available. This starts by interrogating HSH ONE to find all information related to the
Incident symptoms. If the Incident is routine, i.e. there is a predetermined route for
resolution, then the Incident is referred to the relevant SDU using the Service Desk
Support Matrix in HSH ONE.

If the Incident is not routine, the Service Desk agent checks for Known Errors listed
in HSH ONE and the SSC KEL against records relating to the Incident symptoms. If
a match is found, the agent informs the caller of the workaround or resolution
available and links the call to the master Incident record.

2.6 If there is no match in HSH ONE or the SSC KEL, the Problem Database is checked
for current incidents outstanding. Ifa match is made, the caller is then advised of the
status of the Problem and the call is then linked to the master Incident record given in
the Problem details.

2.7 Ifno match is made against the Problem Database, the Service Desk continues with
first line resolution of the Incident assisted by the Product Support Engineers (PSE’s).

2.8 Ifthe PSE’s cannot resolve the Incident, it is referred to the relevant SDU using the
Service Desk Support Matrix in HSH ONE.

3.1 2" line support stage. The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the
Incident, based on information already taken by the Service Desk, together with
any new information. The SDU also coordinates where sub-contract third
parties are involved. If the Incident has no associated KEL, or it is complex
and involves multiple SDU’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended
period, the IMT initiate a Problem record to be raised by the Service
Management Team to bring it to the attention of Problem Management and for
a Problem Manager to coordinate all the parties involved.

4.1 A workaround or resolution is produced by the SDU.

4.2 The SDU then either applies the workaround or resolution or passes it to the
Service Desk to implement. The Master Incident Record remains open at this
point.

4.3 The SDU checks the workaround or resolution has been successful. Horizon
Service Desk are responsible for updating details recorded in HSH ONE, from
details supplied via the KEL created by SSC. If details from this Incident
should be added, a flag is set to bring it to the attention of the Service Desk
support staff. HSH ONE should be identical to SSC KEL in relation to
Application Software, but will also contain additional information.

4.4 Where this Incident has a number of Calls referenced to it, or where there is a
probability that proactive action is required to prevent further occurrences of
this Incident the IMT initiate a Problem record to be authorised by the Service
Management Team and passed to Problem Management.

4.5 The Incident is then passed to the Service Desk to manage the closure.

5.2.5 Step 6: Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and Communication
Responsible: Service Desk

6.1 Throughout the Incident, the Service Desk retains ownership for monitoring
and keeping the user informed of progress. The Service Desk manages the
complete end-to-end Incident process.

Activities include:

e Regularly monitoring the status and progress towards resolution of all open
Incidents

e Note Incidents that move between different specialist support groups,
indicative of uncertainty and possibly a dispute between support staff

¢ Give priority for Incident monitoring to high-impact Incidents

¢ Keep affected users informed of progress without waiting for them to call, thus
creating a pro-active profile

¢ Monitors SLT and escalates accordingly. If an Incident has no associated KEL
or, it is complex and involves multiple SDU’s, or if it has been unresolved for
an extended period, IMT initiate recognition and a Problem record is raised by
the Service Management Team to bring it to the attention of Problem
Management and for a Problem Manager to coordinate all the parties involved.

e Updating HSH ONE from information supplied from SSC KEL. This may be
applied as a direct copy or amended for use by the agents, dependant upon the
technical complexity of the update.
