Subject: Meeting with Post Office 9/6/09

Attachments: 9June POL V1 0.ppt

Dear All
Today we formally presented the HNGX re plan to Post Office.

From Post Office there was Mike Young Operations Director, Dave Smith, Head of Change and IS and Mark Burley
programme Manager.
From Fujitsu we had Peter Rowley, Lester Young, Mike Wood, Alan D'Alvarez and myself.

The meeting opened up with Mike Y reminding Fujitsu with considerable force that despite a re plan
e Post Office remained unhappy with Fujitsu.
° That this was the very last chance for Fujitsu.

We then presented the slide deck (attached)
Post office had the following questions / observations / comments:

e Could we further optimise the plan to achieve a March end date?
o We responded that we would not look at further plan optimization before we had completed integration
testing in the next two months
o That we were not prepared to commit to April 21% 2010 until the integration testing was completed.
e Why was the test manger only 50% on this project if this was the most important project in Fujitsu?
o PRcommitted to get back to Dave Smith with an update.
e We agreed to provide Mike with the organisation structure for:
o The Fujitsu Services Executive layer, assume this to show Business Assurance
o The POA Account
o How this all reports/hang together. Action AH to co-ordinate
¢ Mike Y recognised the importance of getting through the integration plan before publicising go live dates to the
PO Network. To do this:
o Requires next steps for 2-3 weeks (Milestone completion to the satisfaction of Mark Burley to give
confidence to the critical two months)
o Forward reporting monthly between Mike Young and Peter Rowley
co Peter offered that POA will report directly to himself to maintain focus
« Mike Y was complimentary about the BA report , unhappy with the contents but felt assured that it is was a sign
that Fujitsu were getting on top of the issues.
e Mike Y stated that his main drivers for the next year / year and a half:
o HNG-x (Horizon) Versions 1 2 and 3
o Plug and Play Globe
o CRM -— SAP (Cloud solution as opposed to ‘own the software’)

Peter, Lester Mike or Alan have I missed anything?

1 do NOT want this note circulated to the rest of the account; indeed I will draft a slightly different note for my team’s
consumption. After discussion with Mike W and Alan we need to drive people forward with the message that 21% April
2010 is the committed date.

Regards
