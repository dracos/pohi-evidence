A reflection.

I am uncomfortable about committing ourselves too firmly to arrangements post the Interim Report when
everyone is tired and up to their ears trying to handle the immediate issues.

If we can leave that somewhat open while committing to the principle of working with the users including
JFSA, that would be helpful and it fits with JA's suggestion that we should see what ideas come out of
Monday's meeting.

If we have to continue with ss, my firm belief is that we need a totally different approach to managing
and rewarding them and that the significant over-run in the budget to date should feature in our
negotiations.

I think a fresh pair of eyes on this could be very helpful and picking up your earlier suggestion of the
ARC leading a post-mortem, I am wondering about asking Alasdair to give us a bit of time on this. what do
you think?
