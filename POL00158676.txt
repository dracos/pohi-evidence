David has also put together a pack of background documents which we will bring to the meeting (the latest Second Sight
engagement letter, ToRs for the Working Group, Tony's letter of engagements etc.) which we will bring to the pre-meet.

I hope the above makes sense. Please let me know if you have any queries.

Best wishes
Belinda
