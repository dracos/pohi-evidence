Managing Director’s Summary

1 PROGRESS AND ISSUES

1.1 BUSINESS PLAN

We are ahead of plan on revenue, costs, profit and cash. Forecasts for full year revenue,
costs, profit, cash and headcount are all either on of ahead of budget. Risks are well
understood. We are on schedule forthe next £90M milestone iri March 01.

CSR+ counter migration has been largely completed. Acceptance of CSR+ has
triggered payment of the first £60M retention starting in January 2001 at £1.25M per
month, The quality of CSR+ appears robust (as evidenced by help-desk calls). Work is.
underway to crystallise and achieve the requirements for the second £60M retention
due in Q2 next year.

The Business Plan has been revised in line with this years experience of costs and
progress and a lower risk plan produced with a reduced new business requirement
(€£36M Vs £62M) and a lower unallocated task. It includes a clear set of metrics
(revenue, cost, task, risk etc) for fexXt year-and draft budgets have already gone through
a'second iteration with the line units.co underpin the task and cost down requirements:
There are the first signs that PO are considéring the implications of contract “renewal”
as they go into their own business planning cycle.

1.2 PROGRESS AND ISSUES

Good progress is still being made. CSR+ migration has béén achieved with only 140 (out of
15,200) still to go. Product quality is acceptable. M1 testing is progressing to play and will be
issued co the estate in February/March.

Rollout is.on track and, we have entered the Christmas break. We have migrated over 15200
post offices (>85% of the estate), about a week‘ahead of plan. We have trained in excess of
50000 Post Office staff: Solutions for Satellite and Mobile technology have now been agreed
with PO, tested and the implementation of Satellire outlets starved.

Weekly service. performance remains ‘a key issue. Although we are demonstrating consistent
performance we are missing some of the very challenging SLA’s and as expected PO have
placed us in formal Breach of Contract (they can do this if we miss any three-quarters in 24
months). We are trying to negotiate a reduced SLA breach trigger for the future thar also
sweeps up the training dcctipancy igssu¢. A. proposal is currently being corisidered by the Post
Office.

Headcount management remains a critical success factor. We have reduced by over 70
heads in the fast three months and the downward: trend continues through the rest of
this year. We will finish the year with 150 less people than when we started. We have
now entered a vulricrable phase where we are highly dependent on key skills and
motivation but at the same time are in a heavy cost down program, particularly
amongst freelance staff. Freelance headcount is planned to reduce by 100 in the year.
With regard to new businéss opportunities; we are in a fluid scenario that makes
resource planning very difficult. We are planning to transfer 91 e-Apps core heads to
Pathway on 1* January. This is will result in a more stable and motivated workforce.

1.3 NEW BUSINESS

The outlook for this years incremental revenue (£3M target) has improved with the
achievement of a.£1M order for 12 consultants to be dedicated to ERA through until
February. This is important and will help to pump prime this strategic business for the
future. We are still engaged in joint working groups on Network Banking and now
EFTPOS.

We: were unsuccessful in ICL’s bid to be short-listed for the six e-Business work
package areas, as were IBM, Andersens, CapGemini, Microsoft and PWC!! However
PO have made it clear that e-Business work around existing contracts will be done by
the existing contractors (e.g. Pathway for Horizon)

Post Office has selected CGEY as their preferred supplier of GGP and we intend to
engage with them to evaluate opportunities to utilise Horizon, probably post pilot.

1.3.1 NETWORK BANKING

Post Office has been struggling with. its business case and with conflicting pressures
from government, the banks and their own objectives and also internal PO differences
of opinion on the technical solution (web based or nor). We are now engaged in 7
chargeable work packages to provide.a level of detail on the requirements and on thé
implications to the Horizon system. Negotiations with Escher are at a critical point and
a firm decision on web or non-web approach is planned for next week. This has key
financial and strategic implications for Escher and for our relationship with them in the
future.

1.3.2 RE-ENGINEERING/ERA

As with Network Banking, this initiative has run into some difficulty as Post Office plan
their investment priorities. There are difficult decisions facing PO as they balance cost
reduction requirements with the investment needs of ERA. They have authorised
further spend (£1M) to extend the consultancy contract that places us at the heart of
this initiative. Their next key investment committee decision is in March.

EFTPOS

PO wants to fast track this development and have indicated their preference for an
increased operating fee to pay for it. Revenue estimate is circa £3M.

Quantum Step

We plan to hold our first internal workshop next weck to Consider options to move the
goal posts with Horizon and develop into significant additional areas.

1.4 NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE

We understand that the PAC will review the Benefit Card/Horizon situation in the New
Year. John Bennett‘will front this for us.

Development Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

. CSR-+ in general continues to perform well. Problems have been experienced
with slow running counters in circa 50 offices. This along with other issues is
generating:a large support load on the TDA.

e Migration of counters from CSR to CSR+ has continued apace. The majority
wili be migrated by Christmas althougli the tail left outstanding may be larger
than the 100 target.

° Testing of the M1 maintenance release has completed Cycle 4 on time.
Although progressing weil the level of issues identified is too great to enable
them to be. resolved prior to the start of cycle 5.

° The ‘amount of activity on New Business has increased, whilst this is welcome
the ad hoc nature by which PON identify work packages coupled with the short
or no notice given makes it impossible to plan effectively. This is stretching the
resources available particularly in the TDA.

. The ISO pre-assessment in November was successful in that there were only a
small number of observations-and a few minor non-conformities.

2 PROGRESS

. RTR is now live.in all Directorates with the exception of Implementation which
is scheduled for December.

. The new Change: Order process (required to manage the progress of CCN’s to
enable effective changing to PON) has gone live after a training: programme.
Focus is now being given to Management reporting.

. A ross Directorate ZBB (Zero Based Budgeting) exercise for post M1 has
started. The intention is t6 ensure the “core” requirements for resources have
been correctly identified and balanced. First ourput will be available at 18"
December Finance Review.

° AP Client Migration is making good progress with DITs completed for
Hampshire, Mid-Kent, Girobank and Knowsley.

. The Maintenance Release (M1) has completed the third and fourth cycles of

conformance testing. Cycle 4 exercised 48% of M1 CP’s for the first time.
Problems were found’ across all areas such. that code changes will not be ready
for the start of cycle 5. It will, therefore, be necessary to introduce an
additional cycle. This can be achiéved without impacting the dates given to
PON for Data Centre Migration. In addition, the release rig has completed its
first 2 test cycles and has trialled the TDA M1 Migration Strategy.

° The changes to the Data Warehouse to support Schedule A12 Invoicing
Requirements completed testing and were implemented into live,

° Directorate Project Managers for the major elements of new business, (i.e.
Network Banking/EFTPoS and ERA) have been identified and will be fully in
place for 1* January 2001.

° Progress is being made towards the targets for the end of the company year
covering both cost down and freelancer replacement with a significant reduction
occurring prior to the end of November that were in éxcess of the Direcrorate
target.

3 ISSUES

e The current live support load being generated for the TDA is starting to
impact their ability to support M1 testing and new business activities.

. The ad hoc way PON identify with short or no notice new business work
packages make them impossible to plan effectively. New processes for the early
stages of the life cycle (covering Business Development and the TDA) need
defining ‘as those currently in place are not

Commercial & Financial Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

° Financial performance to end October has continued to track better than
Plan, Budget and forecast, albeit November fell slightly short on revenue
reflecting the:recent‘slowdown on rollout. This will not be an issue unless the
trend continues.

° Work and negotiations continue to resolve the breach condition on SLA
performance.
° The training course CCNs have now-all been agreed ‘without prejudice’ to

who pays for the shortfall. The expectation is that most of the ‘cost will be
borne by Pathway as part of. the SLA ‘deal’. Meanwhile, the new measures
are beginning to bear fruit and the cost projection is slowly improving against
prior forecasts. We are now actively pursuing Energis and KPL for
recompense for their failures in roll out which have impacted training course
occupancy.

. Improvement of the management processes at the TIP interface (specifically
solving POCL’s client settlement problems) has also moved forward. Again
on.a without prejudice basis related to the SLA ‘deal’, we have started work
on two agfeed sets of. change (CCNs 728 and 729) on the basis that a related
work request (CCN 730) will instead be done. by TIP in a different (and
bétter) way.

. We have agreed in principle the contractual interpretation of the criteria we
need to meet to secure the second £60m retention. These are based on TRT
targets and not the more stringent MAT targets which are the basis of the SLA

problem.

° Agreement has been reached with nel: regarding their £800k claim. The
outcome is circa £350k. This is very close to the latest (tasked) forecast.

. Departmental Budgets for 2001/02 continue to cotiverge on where they need

to be for nexr year. CS and Implementation are both now very close. A
combination of a new man-rate database and the ZBB work in Development
is expected to resolve the gap which currently exists in Development. Risk has
been reduced with successful CSR+ roll out, and’ task has ali been ‘subscribed
to’ within the units leaving none unallocated for next year. Budgets should be
all bur fixed at the Finance reviews next week.

. The ‘new business’ revenue plan for ‘next year has been de-risked to £7m.
Overall profit for 2061/02 has been maintained by increasing the recognition
margin from 13% to 13.5% compared with 11% this year and 9% last, and
15% beyond next year. If the SLA issue is resolved satisfactorily and roll out
substantially completed by year end, and if risk and unallocated task continue
to reduce and new business continues to take shape, there will be a strong
argument.for increasing this year’s margin also.

° Qualifying the web based Network Banking proposition such that a decision
is taken by POCL next Tuesday on whether to go ahead on this-basis is taking
up a considerable amount of [many people’s] time and attention. The ‘decision
is strategic for Escher. There is a difficult to define but significant business
risk for us if it goes against them.’ There.is also.a significant performance risk
for us if we go ahead without a proper appreciation of the issues. We have to
steer a careful path down the middle of these two risks such as to avoid both.

° Propel and OPA/ Oracle Gold Build are not going to meet our immediate
business needs: we are looking at 12 months away for both. Interim-solutions
ate’ now well’advanced to plug the gap and reduce dependency: We: remain
actively involved in trying to shape both.long term solutions.

° Work on the DTI audit of the £8m interim government funding of April/May
last year is in train.

2 PROGRESS.

° New business is definitely picking up. POCL have asked us to fund. the
development of EFTPOS (circa £3m) with recovery ‘of costs plus interest at
15% through transaction charges with,a guatanteed minimum. This has
significant attractions but is not facrored into the current Business Plan,

. We await customer response as to whether they find our proposals. on the
SLA ‘package’ acceptable. They are taking their time to consider it, which is
probably a good sigi but it is unlikely that they will settle for our offer
without some further concessions-on our part.

3 RISKS”

° SLA rectification will require a second (albeit smaller), maintenance release.
This.is factored into the Budgét. plan bur maybe not at-a sufficient level of
cost. The on-going costs of operation may also be insufficiently
comprehended. I .

* ° The Web Riposte decision (Network’ Banking) as 's above.

. POCL-demand for instant work delivery after months of indecision: risks to
expectations and satisfaction, to utilisation during thé faliow periods, and -
poteritially performance relative ro new commitments undertaken. We have
proposed a retainer scheme as part of the SUA deal.proposition.

Customer Requirements Report

1. MONTHLY SUMMARY

Good progress has occurred this month on all new business streams. Within Network
Banking work. has recommenced in earnest, although there are now resource issues to
be resolved to meet delivery réquiréments.set by POCL.

Work on EFTPoS has advanced significantly during the month with delivery to POCL
of alternative implementation proposals and subsequént positive feedback oni the
preferred functional capability.

The work on ERA also continues to plan with 11 Pathway staff currently involved. All
staff were briefed on the organisational changes associated with Requirements work
transfer to Business Development unit. This is intended to be the final free-standing
Customer Requirements report; future reporting will be consolidated into the Business
Development report.

This simmary report was compiled in John’s absence and all Customer Requirements
staff wish John.a speedy recovery from his current hospitalisation.

1.1 DETAILED PLAN ACTIVITIES

1.1.1 NEW BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

Network Banking Workpackages

Work has recommenced in earnest on Network Banking, and PONU have
commissioned 11 Work Packages intended to define the end to end Network
Banking requirements and top level solution. Tony Hayward has prepared. and
circulated Product Descriptions for 4 of these Work Packages.

I. Covering the cop level design of transaction states and message flows.

2. Covering review of operation considerations (co-logation of the Network

Banking Enginé on Pathway campus, helpdesk, resilience, performance,

security and system management issues).

Performance modelling.

Ss. Requirements and solution workshops covering fallback, reconciliation
& settlement, MIS and.reférence data.

we

Work package descriptions for 7a & 7b have been produced by POCL, aid
require Pathway work and Escher/ IBM_ involvement as a subcontractor.

7a Web Riposte and JBM CBTF integration for the desktop and counter
application.
7b = Web Riposte integration & deployment into the Horizon estate

Workpackages 4 and 6 involve POCL only and are concerned with defining
business rules and the scopé of applicability to the pilot and extended trial.

Workpackage 9 has been produced by POCL and is to examine the impact of
other requirements on the Network Banking programme, particularly chose
arising from EFTPOS and Universal Bank. Pathway resources will be needed on
this work package, although a start may be.deférred for a few weeks.

Workpackage 10 (review of contract & SLA issues) has also been produced by
POCL and will involve effort by Pathway and Masons.

A first internal review was held to identify work package resourcing and
interdependencies. Further work is needed in this area since there are significant
resource commitments required and limited resources (TDA, CR and others)
given other commitments and leave entitlements. Planning are involved and
RTR assignment codes and recording are in placé.

Although work has been proceeding.satisfactorily we aré-still waiting the formal
CRs from POCL and this remains a potential exposure.

Network Banking Outputs.

Workshops have been held with PONU and IBM concentrating on Work
Package I (Transaction States and Data Flows), for which an initial specification
has been delivered.

Workshop meetings have also been held covering fallback, reconciliation &
settlement (a major part of Workpackage 5)

Workpackage 7a has been proceeding on the basis of meetings: between Escher,
IBM and POCL. Tony Hayward has visited Escher (in Dublin)- to review
progress with Fionnuala Higgins and Stevé Taylor (NBU). A Web Riposte
application framework ‘interim report has beén produced and this was presented
to a wider Pathway audience ata 2 day workshop last week.

This has also provided the opportunity to review with Escher the main
implications this would have on the Horizon infrastructure. Systems
management would require some significant extensions since Java code objects
and associated DTDs would require distribution via Riposte replication, whereas
at present code is distributed by Tivoli. There are also several !oose ends to tie
down in the operation ‘of the application framework. Further interaction with
Escher is planned on these topics.

Work is also in progress on Workpackage 10, which ig being driven by Finance
& Commercial, with support where necessary from CR.

ERA
After some doubts about the funding of ERA the Project is still progressing at
full speed.and appears funded to the end of March,

There are 35. to 40 people now working on ERA (11 from Pathway) and these
are divided into 11 workgroups covering all aspects of re-engineering the Post
Office processes. The aim, by March, is to have updated the ERA Vision and
Blueprint, produced a cost benefits statement, defied the Migration Strategy and
produced detailed design documents for the components ‘of the first
development stage (as proposed by the Migration Strategy). All this will be
presented to the investment board in order to gain ongoing funding.

The majority of Pathway Staff are producing detailed functional specs for the a
new counter architecture and continuing on ro produce detailed design specs for

oné component, Stock Sale. From all the other work being carried out on ERA, om
a new EPOSS service is the lowest priority so the work may (should) charige Bd
direction. # Ed
There are two areas of concern, ore for ERA in general and one for Pathway. ea .
. fd
e For ERA, it is not clear how the proposals fit in with the Service
Development plan. If all requirements of the SDP are met then it would tu
meer a lot of the sérvices required by ERA without a major redesign of the .
front end (although ir would not have adopted the "generics prodtict"
principles.

¢ — For Pathway, the detail specs thar the ICL team produce will give the Post
Office all the detail required to allow other vendors to bid for the contract
renewal. Some safeguards need to be initiated or re-emphasised.

GGP

Work in Pathway has-néw tailed off; a small contingent from Requirements.and
Client Management met with POCL to review a specific, but limited,
opportunity for early work in Scotland — outside the main work plan being
handled by CGEY. This proved of limited interest unless further funding were
available in 2001/2002, this is being followed through within POGL to ascertain
whether: this ‘is feasible.

Following this meeting contact was made with CGEY. and further interaction is
expected at some time over possible implications-on thé Horizon infrastructure.

ICL Pathway Customer Requirements Report Ref: PA/REP/OS6
Version: 1.0

Date; 13/12/2000

EFTPOS

Major progress has been achieved during the month with a substantial response

to the consultancy assignment produced and sent to PONU for review. This ~-
includes two levels of implementation approach with indicative development
and operating costs. Both John Coakes and Dave Cooke have been heavily
involved.

Several review meetings were held with PONU and Nat West representatives in
an attempt tO identify the EFTPoS requirements, which were continually
changing up to and after the delivery of the indicative development and
operating cost paper (CR/REP/025).

Following delivery of the report the customer held a business case review
meeting and feedback indicated that this resulted in a positive response from
PONU management to move forward and progress EFTPoS. For ICL Pathway
it is not yet clear what this will entail though the next logical activity, should be
to generate a complete requirements specification (PONU with ICL Pathway
assistance) that-can then lead to a costed outline:design.

Throughout the exercise it became clear that the current Horizon architecture
will need. to migrate to-accommodate the EFTPoS real time requirement. This
also has considerable impact on the reconciliation model where new, more
comprehensive and potentially costly. PONU requirements are evolving. Both
aspects have some relationship to similar requirements within Network Banking
and there is'a possibility of adopting a common approach for reconciliation.
Recent workshops have been positive, although time to market will be a big
factor.

EFTPoS fallback is another area that needs careful thought.

1.1.2 CSR+
APS
AP Client Migration

AP Client Specs for Welsh Water, NIE, SWALEC, and now RSA have been
approved. The CCN associated with DVLNI has been rejected principally on
the basis of cost, and so the Client spec is not approved.

The interface for BT is now expected to be handied via the POCL DPC and so a
DPC Client Spec has.been produced and is in review.

Siemens liave advised that they will again not be ready to support the Quantum
end to end testing, so Quantum introduction will again be delayed.

POCL have asked us at very short notice to support a testing exercise (starting
11th Dec) to verify that data files sent to us from HAPS are error-free. We
cannot make the testing environment available that quickly, but can in early
January.

A GR has been received to introduce a new AP Client - Standard Life -who will
be supporting the government Stakeholder Pensions initiative. We will need to
have resolved our pricing disagreements that surfaced with DVLNI before
responding on this one.

A CR will be sent to «us soon requesting that Pathway write the business
requirements specification for Talexus, the smart key system ‘operated by

Schlumberger. 4

The E-topup opportunity associated with a pre-payment service for mobile
phones: continues in the background. We are reviewing the NDA prior to
getting more.fully involved.

TIP Interface

CCNs 728, 729 & 730 were generated. These are all concerned with changes
to the sending of exception files, and the re-sénding of rejected files, to TIP.
POCL need enhancements’ to facilitate AP client settlement reconciliation.
Generation of the CCNs has involved considerable design effort, as they are
fairly complex changes. John.Pope continues to follow through with the-aim of
getting fesolution of thé issue. POCL (through Keith Baines) has now confirmed
that CCNs 728 & 729 are what they want and although funding responsibilities
remains:an issue, Pathway will proceed with this work on a no-prejudice basis.
CCN 730 remains under review within POCL, bur the Pathway
recomméndation is that this work is not taken up and alternative
implementation approaches within the TIP domain be followed.

SADD 6.0

This has been submitted to POCL for approval, and we have been advised that
such approval.is anticipated in the near future.

Progress continues; nothing exceptional to report this month.

Contractual Eailure to Meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds (MAT)

Tony Hayward has continued his involvement to support work designed to
address the failure to mect Day D inward data file deliveries from 100% of
outlets. :

This includes a Workshop called by Simon Fawkes to review the development
activities being scheduled for post M1. in this area.

Process Review Forum

Work on quality activities has taken a back seat. There has beén a Customer
Requirements Process Review Forum. held in addition to the ongoing project
Process Review Forum activities. Actions arising from this relate mainly to
interpretation and adoption of the CSLC Stages 1-6 model and its impact on our
existing standards and procedures. The New Product/Service Introduction
(NPI) process is to be evaluated against CSLC. Even though there are recent
organisation changes these CSLC/NPI review activities are likely to be relevant
to the new organisation under Business development though such needs have yet
to be discussed.

CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

ISSUES

other than those nored earlier - outstanding CRs for Network Banking work and

the availability of appropriate resources.

Customer Service Report

1 SUMMARY

° There have been 3 operational. problems this month with regard to Data
Delivery SLA achievement. One problem causéd.a small number of TIP files not
to be transferred by the 03:00 deadline. This will cost us approx. £20k in
penalties. The 2 other problems should have no SLA impact.

. Severe congestion of the Energis network lias been identified around 18:00. A
fix has now been distributed and results are being analysed.

. AP Glient take-on service provided by RDT will stop unless we have a clear view
of the CSR+ requirement.from POCL. This has been.escalated within POCL.

. The live FTMS gateway has been installed and accepted by Mid-Kent and the
Girobank DIT has been successfully completed.

° As at 8" December, 13,095 Outlets ‘had been ‘successfully migrated to Cl_4. A
number of sites are reporting perceived slow running of CI_4. This is taking a
variety of different forms and 3 sites have been visited to gather information.

° APS Reconciliation is still, giving problems. We are confident we are sending the.
corréct transactions to HAPS and APS clients, however TIP aré unable to
reconcile the APS content of the files they receive. Both PON and Pathway have
completed a significant amount of work to attempt to identify where the process
is falling down.

° We are currently on target to achieve the BIMS SLA of 100% this month for thé
first time.
° Service Review Book for'October SLA conformance was completed and sent out

to PON in accordance with agreed timescales. Most SLAs have shown an
improvement over the previous month.

° The BSI / ISO9001 pre-assessment carried out‘within CS was deemed to be very
successful. There were no non-conformances within C$ and just a couple of
observations.

. There was a big increase during the month in complaints regarding the Cl_4
upgrade and the Cl_4 team has been alerted to these.

° To 25" November, 114 site visits have been completed, with a further 12
plannéd for the next fortnight. There are concerns about the electrical supply to
some. offices ahd the possibility of éxternal radio interférence causing system
crashes and screen freezes.

2. PROGRESS

2.1 OPERATIONS

e There have been 3 operational problems this month with regard to Data
Delivery SLA achievement. Thére*were problems running:under the back-up
data centre at Wigan. On reverting to Bootle, a small. number of TIP files
were not.transferred-by the 03:00 deadline. This will.cost us approx. £20k in
penalties. The root cause of thé problem.was a time zone variable being set
incorrectly in Wigan by ISD.

e The second problem is the increase in the number of post- offices remaining
on the non-polled list. This is mainly due to problems in SMC staffing-due to
sickness and time spent on counter migration activity. A number of
mitigation, measures have been ‘put in place:

e The third problem was the APS processing failing due to a duplicate
transaction. This was fixed and the files sent by 23:30 the following night.
As the SLAA is 23:59 there should bé.no SLA impact.

e Severe congestion of the Energis network has been identified around 18:00.
A fix has.now been distributed and results are being analysed. kh

e Activity on,Day D SLA non-conformance remains a high. priority. The main
development: CP, CP2840 is now with PCCB. A CP is being raised for an AP 8
transaction recovery facility. On this basis the future of BT satelan solution 6
for marooned transactions remains unclear.

e AP Client take-on service provided by RDT will stop uniess we have a clear
view of the CSR+ requirement from POCL. This has been escalated within
POCL.

© Quality of Reference Data from POCL and time taken to résolve the
problem remains a concern. This has been escalated within POCL.

e The live FTMS gateway has been installed and accepted by Mid-Kent. The
Girobank DIT has now been successfully completed.

2.2 SUPPORT SERVICES

2.2.1 GENERAL

¢ There have been a number of issues on a small proportion of Counters as
they migrate from CI_3 to Cl_4, which has resulted in a high urgent
workload for SSC staff.

COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE . Page 19 of 41
ICL Pathway Customer Service Report Ref: -PA/RED/O56
Version: 1.0

Date: 13/12/2000

e Severe congéstion of the Energis network is being experienced, particularly
around 18:00. This is a significant operational threat. The problem is caused
by excess events béing generated at End of Day. A code fix to alleviate che
situation is béing committed to the estate.

e A fix to speed up APS harvesting has been applied to the Data Centre.
However, APS harvesting has failed twice, having hit a duplicate record. The
problem was overcome but the underlying fault will need to be established
and resolved.

e A number of Cl_4 Outlets are reporting a variety of aspects of perceived
slow running. This overall issue is being managed by Deirdre Conniss but
SSC technical resource is also being applied, primarily by Kath Greenwood,
but also by other team members. Pat Carroll was involved in a site visit to
Guiseley.

e An updated version of CS/POL/004, which covers the interface between
PON and Pathway CS on Fast Track Maintenance, has been issued.

¢ The OTI link from PinICL to PowerHelp (and from Dispatch 1 to
PowerHelp) was not working for a number of days. The problem was put to
Alert status and the situation has:improved.

2.2.2 MAJOR RELEASE IMPLEMENTATION

e As at 8th December, 13,095 Ouitlets have- been successfully migrated to
cL4.

e The KMA sérver gave problems that caused POLO login at Outlets to fail
and meant that the customer had to redo the POLO login. The cause has
now been identified andthe fix willbe applied: in the M1 -release.

e Some Outlets occurred twice in the migration schedule. This caused affected
(already migrated) Outlets to receive a letter giving them a new date for
migration and created much confusion.

2.3 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES

2:3.1 MANAGEMENT SUPPORT UNIT

« APS Reconciliation is still giving problems. We are. confident wé are sending
the correct transactions'to HAPS and APS clients, however TIP- are unable to
reconcile the APS content of the files they receive. Both PON and Pathway
have completed a significant amount of work to attempt to identify where
the process is falling down.

e Business incidents are being received in accordance with expected volumes.
We are currently on target to achieve the BIMS SLA of 100% this month for
the first time. Some new bugs have been found with CI_4: Counters (APS)
and they are being investigated.

¢ Non-polling is still a drain on resource. The sheer size of the reporting
obligation is preventing the incident managers from chasing the support

areas.
* Service Review Book for October SLA conformance was completed and seit e
out to PON in accordance with agreed timescales. Most SLAs have. shownran "

improvement over. thé previotis month, especially the System Service where
all 'priority A’ calls have been cleared according to SLA timescales. “ r

e Remedial. invoices for Q2 2000 have now been issued. to PON for Ee
agreement.

2.3.2 BUSINESS EFFECTIVENESS

« The pre-assessment carried out within C$ was deemed to be very successful,
There were no non-conformances within CS and just a couple of
observations. The success was a just reward for the work Alex put in to
prepare CS for the assessment and the, professional approach he adopted on
the day ofthe assessment. ‘The CS staff interviewed by the BSI assessor also
made major contributions. Work has started to build on the pre-assessment
and prepare for February.

2.3.4 FIELD SERVICE MANAGEMENT

© To 25" November, 114 site visits have been completed, with a further 12°
planned for the next fortnight. This slow down reflects PON’s wish to avoid
disrupting offices during their busiest period.

e Environmental Issues - A site in Liverpool has required constant attendance to
manage. The system crashes repeatedly and finally appeared to fail completely
on Friday 24" November. There are concerns about the electrical supply to the
office, and the possibility of external radio intérference. Guiseley continues to
experience intermittent ‘screen cursor freezes, approximately once every three
days. Again, environmental EMC factors may be to blame. A ‘proposal has been
received from Celestica for a service to identify and resolve EMC issues.

¢ CI_4 Slow Running - A number of sites are reporting slow running of CI_4.
This is taking many different forms. Two sites, Bulwell and: Hollybush Lane,
were visited and timings and other information gathered. A third visit, to
Guiseley, took place on 27" November

Quality & Risk Report
1 MONTHLY SUMMARY
° Security. 10,000 live keys. have been produced to schedule. The resolution of

specific key issues has been supported. Compliance software has been evaluated.
The implementation will be managed with anti-virus and vulnerability software.

° Quality. IS09001. The informal assessment was conducted by BSi. Overall
feédback was positive on areas covered. Two non-conformances were raised,
which could prove to be major (record retention and document management).
Both are now receiving close attention and corrective actions in place. The
Pathway version of CSLC: for the ‘Sales Cycle’ has been drafted and is under
review.

° Audit. A new Audit manager started, 4" December. The programme for Q1-Q2
2001 is being developed.

2 PROGRESS

2.1 SYSTEM SECURITY

2.1.1 GENERAL

e CP2292 et.al (Anti-Virus software on the Live-Estate). The agréed solution
for the delivery of anti-virus software to remote FTMS gateway PCs will
now be taken forward under formalised project management. Terms of
Reference have been produced and a Project. manager identified. The draft
strategy paper will be-used by the PM to prepare a CP.

e Work is nearing completion on the evaluation of various compliafice toolkits
to facilitate remote checking of security policy compliance across the live
estate. Implementation will be progressed via CP ~ possibly in conjunction
with work on anti-virus because of similarities in the implementation
process.

e Work has been completed on providing configuration for the delivery of
anti-virus software to the remote AP Client gateways outlined in CPs
2798/2799.

e DPA. The existing Subject Access Request procedure is being amended to
reflect Pathway's data ownership responsibilities under the new Act. Urgent
discussions are still required with PONU to get their agreement on the
ownership of other data processed by the Horizon system before the issue
can be progressed.

e Security documentation continues to bé reviewed as part of the ISO 9001
plan. A project plan has been prepared to track completion. Work is also
underway on incorporating measures for process improvement.

e Terms of reference for the proposed process compliance review of
Datacentre operations has been prepared and circulated. The review will be
undertaken as soon as resources can be brought together and the required
auditing tools have been tested.

e Firewall connectivity of various CS systems to the Datacentres have been
rationalised.

2.1.2 CSR+

e° The Key Manager ‘successfully processed key requests for around 10,000
outlets and kept pace with the agreed Cl4 POCL schedule. The demand for
keys in the first weeks of the month was particularly heavy. Keys have now
been generated for all of this year’s known migrations/rollouts.

e Last month's KMA database corruption resulted in about a hundred outlets
being left in a partially migrated state. Each of these was resolved by the Key
Manager with close co-operation.and support from KMS Development. [n
addition, several days were spent helping to recover from disruption caused
by the CAW archive corruption.

¢ Twenty PinICLs were processéd this month, including six priority ‘A’s and
ten ‘B’s. There are still several ourlets sharing similar faults arid these are
being tackled as groups. When successfully resolved, other individual outlet
failures will be analysed in more detail.

« The. KMS Key Manager continues to consolidate knowledge of the KMS
system and is performing a daily analysis of migration/rollout activities to
inform the programme. The KMS User Guide is being baselined prior-to M1.

2.2 QUALITY-

e 1809001 Programme.

« The BSI pre-assessment took place 14 / 15 November with two assessors,
one of whom is TickIT qualified. Areas covered included CS /
Development / Program Office / Implementation / Quality.

* Overall feedback was positive on areas covered, but areas of ongoing
work were not subject to pre-assessment.

¢ 6 Minor Non-conformanées and 18 Observations were identified. Two
of the Non-conformances, Record Retention and Document Control,
have the potential to become Major Non-conformances if similar findings
are widespread throughout Pathway.

e Record retention definition is being followed up in the Process
Review Forums. :

¢ Document Control has been escalated as an urgent issue (not only for
1S09001 purposes, but also for maintainability of the system). Less
than 50% of the documents registered in CSR+ and N_A worksets
have been formally approved. This is now ‘being driven by the
Programme Office with each Directorate.

Business Development Report

1. SUMMARY

e A changed picture, I am pleased to say. The issue is now resourcing all the
activity that Post Office suddenly require. We have been forewarning them that
this would: lead to a clash of resources but.....

° Additional commitment to revenues of over £1,5m are in place. This comprises
£900K of ERA work and the remainder on Network Banking and EFTPOS.

. The Requirements team have now transferred to Business Development. Trhis
will provide-more focus on the front end of our process. I am also insistent that
we take a-more proactive customer facing approach:

Network Banking:

° Work is now progressing on the 11 work packages. There have béen a number
of successful workshops, involving both IBM and Post Office. Areas such as
Reconciliation have been discussed and broad agreement is in place.

. Escher have placed some strong demands on Post Office to come to a decision
on Web Riposte before Christmas. This will involve up front payments and an
on-going commitment to the Web:approach. This has.caused a flurry of activity
on several fronts over the past two weeks. This will culminaté in, a top level
meeting on 19" Dec. My over-riding concern is what these discussions have
done to the overall relationship between the parties where there is an
unfortunate level of politics even within the Post Office. Our approach must be
to stay factual.and ensure’that we are fully informed in-terms of any decisions to
which we are asked to commit. I

° Discussions with the Banks and Government on Universal Banking continue.
There is still no sign of a let from the banks. Descriptions of the Universal
Banking requirements from Post Office are reminiscent of the Benefit Payment
Card system! We have met Graham Halliday, Post Office’s new Director of
Retail Banking to forewarn him of some of the pitfalls of going down this track
again. The major concern is that Post Office will be left ‘holding the baby’ and
have to implement the vagaries of the Benefit system.

ERA:

e We have now 12 resources fully employed and contracted for on the ERA
project. Harvey Potts has recently joined the team allowing John Hunt to focus
on offering strategic help to the Post Office Project Manager.

ve. There remains overall commitment to the ERA project within Post Office. Dave
Miller and his team have confirmed that without ERA, their business is dead.

Business Development Report Ref: PAIREP/OS6
Version: 1.0

Date: 13/12/2000

Government Gateway:

. Post Office have just received commitment from Dti to a funding programme
for GGP and some early pilots. These are likely to be stand-alone in a particular
part of the country. Post Office and CGEY are trying to narrow down the
potential pilots from 16 to 4.

e Alan Ward from Escher is now engaged as a technical consultant on GGP
working directly to the Post Office.

NAO Report:

° It seems likely that the PAC (Public Accounts Committee) will investigate the
cancellation of the Benefit Payment Card following the NAO report. This is
likely to take place in late January. All interested. parties are aware:

2. PROGRESS

Business Development:

EFTPOS: Post Office are about to ask us to undertake a requirements
definition work. package. We’ have been attempting for some time to clarify
requirements through several meetings without any success. This is now
focussed on getting requirements clarified with them asap such that we can
then quote for development and propose an overall timescale.

Mails: Has had to take a back step while the work on Network Banking is
on-going. This will be-re-invigorated in January:

Service Improvements: Still awaiting input from Post Office. There is no
business thrust behind these potential improvements and therefore no
funding either,

Horizon Communications

Positive case studies appeared in Computer Weekly (9/11/00) and Banking
Technology (Noy edition).

Listeners to the Archers will be getting to know more about Horizon over
the next few months as it is being installed in their Post Office ourlet. At
present the postmistress is attending her training. ICL Pathway,
KnowledgePool and the Post Office have all been helping the scriptwriters
with facts and history that they require. Their latest request is that they
would like a set of equipment - although they are obviously radio, they
would like the system so that they know what sound it.makes!

e The DTI issued a full progress report on the Post Office (14/11/00). It
expresses concern over the feasibility of Universal Bank, and is relieved that
Horizon is proceeding well though seeks reassurance that it will be
technically resilient enough for PO's plans. It criticises the speed of

Implementation Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

A total of 15,282. Pdst Office outlets have had the Horizon system installed, as at closé
of busiriess 8" Decembér 2000. This represents 85% of the current agreed number of
open outlets (18,043), It is anticipated that this will fall to less than 18,000 outlets by
the end of rollout. The 8" December 2000 was the last scheduled day for installations
this year such that outlets aré not disrupted during the busy Christmas period.
However, there will be approximatély 10 installations in the week commencing 11"
December to complete. installs aborted in the previous week.

Rollour is on schedule to achieve the next payment milestone (17,157 outlets by 9"
March 2001) with headroom of 300 outlets available beyond that. We are also on
target to achieve the current outlet revenue forecast of 17,650 outlets by 30" March
2001: Recent commercial negotiations with PONU have successfully reset the payment
milestone target to the lower figure above to’ take account of attrition over which
Pathway has no control. The target for the rollout payment milestone is reassessed
each month, in accordance with approved CCN 655a, to take allowance of PON
suspended or outlets closed during the previous month.

During the reporting period, weekly rollout performance was again consistently below
the planned levels. There has however been an improvement in the performance of
Energis with a reduction in the number of ISDN issues. Current shortfalls are
attributed to a generally higher attrition rate since we entered the tail énd of the
programme and insufficient scheduled outlets. Significant rescheduling has:takeri place
for all rollout weeks next year to allow for higher rates of transition. Rollout volumes
have also been increased for next year to allow for the lower level of achievement of
late. It is therefore anticipated that rollout we return to a trend of achieving target
levels when we recommence on the 8" January 2001.

Impleniéntation closedown plans continue to be implemented with a small number of
staff leaving the team ar the end of December. Implementation headcount, including
staff working on other projects, at the end of December will be 86 compared to a peak
of 110 in August this year. Back to back plans with Pathway Customer Services are in
place and CS will take over responsibility for infrastructure activity from the beginning
of January 2001. Implementation Will conclude existing infrastructure activity during
December and early January and will hand-over installations to CS from mid-May
2001.

2 PROGRESS

Infrastructure Preparation

Implementation-led ‘activity in the infrastructure programme is in the final stages and
consequently is focussed on completing those outlets where the infrastructure work has.
been. moré challenging: It is anticipated that, for outlets released by the Post Office
prior to thé 10" November 2000 deadline, the majority of infrastructure activity will
be complete before Christmas. here will be approximately 120 infrastructure
activities to be complete after Christmas.

For outlets still in suspension, considered to be less than 100 in total, thesé will be
reviewed on 8" January 2001 and will be either released into the programme or
confirmed as closed by the Post Office. It is possible that a small number will remain
suspended beyond the review date since PONU have the contractual right to release
outlets up until the end of June 2001. As part of the Implementation closedown
strategy, any outlets‘released from the 8" January to the end of June 2001 will have
their infrastructure activity managed and completed by Pathway Customer Services,
rather than Implementation. Through joint workshops between CS and
Implementation, process reviews and preparations are at an. advanced stage ready for
the hand-over of responsibility.

As of the 11 December 2000, the status of the remaining infrastructure to be
completed by Implementation includes 122 activities to be complete after Christmas
and 112 before Christmas (already scheduled). The majority of this activity-is. at sites
where standard solutions were not possible and required Post Office intervention, or
aresites designated for the mobile solution or are snagging items. Within these “totals
there are only 10 surveys and 30 preparations remaining to be completed.

In addition to-the above planned activity, Pathway have received a request from the
Post Office to prepare and install head office counter ‘positions ar 46 new geographic
locations. This is currently being processed but will be undertaken by Implementation
and will require the Implementation infrastructure team and our supplier, Pearce
Security, to remain in place for another two months. The request is a contractual
obligation and is being done by Implementation because other parts of Pathway do not
have sufficient levels of resource. Future requests will not be undertaken by
Implementation.

The Implementation infrastructure team will be disbanded following the completion of
all of the above activity and the transfer of responsibility, as part of the Implementation
Closedown Strategy.

Installation Activity

Rollout, now 85% coniplete and well. into Phase Y thé second sweep of the country,
remains approxi:nately 300 sites ahead of the contract plan. We have continued to see
weekly targets not being achieved in the last 4 wéeks, a continuation of the trend
reported last month. The rate of attrition from the installation schedule and the rate of
on the day aborts has risen above that observed in the majority of rollout weeks. The
rise in attrition levels is attributed to having entered the tail end of the programme. In
the tail, outlets tend to be minority solutions such as satellite communication sites and
sites where infrastructure preparation or installation preparation activity has been
problematic. This gives rise to higher levels of attrition.

Having achieved the last rollout milestone earlier this year, the remaining goals are:

© To achieve the final rollout payment milestone in March (99% of Rollout Part A).
This has a value of £90M.
© To achieve and exceed the target of 17,650 outlets installed by 30 March 2001
thereby mecting budget expectations for revenue and profit for 2000/2001.
¢ To complete Rollout Part B, less 40 CS outlets, by mid-May 2001 and close down
the Implementation team. a
e ,
Despite the higher level of attrition observed in the rollout tail, we are confident that
these goals will be achieved. Derailed planning and rescheduling has been completed to
support these objectives with a higher margin of attrition having been created to
account for the higher levels of attrition in the tail. Additionally, the granularity of
tracking and control for rollout has been increased to ensure trends can be identifiéd
early and resolved quickly. Resolution of rollout process issues that may be.responsible
for some of the attrition is also underway and the Christmas break will be used to
complete this work. We have also put in place new procedures to enable out-of-
geography installations where outiets are installed away from the main rollout
geographical centre. This will provide additional volumes in order to support the
rollout targets with only minimal additional cost.

Installations at sites requiring satellite communications as the alternative to ISDN are
now well established with 28 complete and a further 12 communication systems
installed awaiting Horizon installation. Satellite surveys are also largely complete and
it is expected the rotal number of satellice sites will be approximately 250.

The mobiles production programme is also making satisfactory progress and is on track
to achieve the first mobile installations from 29" January 2001.

Installations at ECCO sites, previously planned to be complete by Christmas, will now
be completed by the end of January 2001.

Implementation Closedown Strategy

A strategy to complete rollout and disband the Pathway Implementation team is now in
place with detailed plans having been agreed between Implementation, Customer
Services (who will take-over any remaining small scale activity) and the Customer
implementation unit.

Key milestone dates, supporting assumptions and high level plans have been defined by
agreement dnd detailed working plans to achieve that strategy are now being
developed. These typically include. the review and refinement of existing plans and
processes for use during the final stages of rollout. Customer Services and
Implementation representatives meet once a fortnight to progress these plans and meet
oncé a month with the customer to seek their agreement. The infrastructure
programme will closedown in Implementation and pass to Customer services from 8"
January 2001 and the installation programme from 12" May 2001.

The table below summarises the programme status, as recorded by the rollout database.
Information on infrastructure activity tends to take 5-10 days to reach the RODB and
hence appears inconsistent with that reported earlier-

training scheduling issues.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

No new critical issues have arisen. Positive progress has been made on two issues,
previously reported as critical. These are the dispute with ntl: over an £800K invoice
for weekly shortfall charges and the projected shortfall in training courses.

: Version: 1.0

Dare: __ 13/12/2000

Pathway and ntl: were in dispute over the ntl: claim for £800k of shortfall charges.
Having received clarification of ntl:’s commercial position, it has been recogniséd that
although the original basis for the claim was flawed, Pathway have exceeded the
allowance for reductions in outlets released to ntl:. The total exposure to Pathway
arising from this would equate to a sum of £350k. ‘Following further-negotiation with
ntl:, an acceptable proposal to settle the claim for a ner’cost to ICL of £350k has been
tabled. It is likely that the offer will be accepted in writing during December and
represents a considerable improvement from the original offer of £530k.

Pathway are continuing to predict that an additional 1,000+ training courses will be
required beyond that specified in the Codified Agreement as a result of low course
occupancy. Although Pathway believe PONU are responsible for greater than 50% of
this, it has been difficult to substantiate due to the dynamic nature of the rollout-
training schedule. It-is likely that-a settlement on this issue will be included as part of
an overall negotiation with SLAs for Customer Services. An offer has been made on
this basis whereby Pathway pay the first £1M of additional training courses and any
additional costs are shared equally, thereby motivating all parties to manage the
remaining risk. The total exposure had previously been estimated to be £1.3M but
improvements in occupancy in the last 2-3 months have seen a gradual improvement. ~
The exposure is currently estimated as £1.1M. Further measures have been introduced
recently to improve occupancy further. It is therefore possible that the shortfal} will
reduce further although since we are entering the rollout tail where attrition is higher
there are elements of the programme which are complex to predict. On balance it is
envisaged that the training shortfall will be no worse than £1.1m and whatever
settlement is agreed with the Post Office any recuctions will be to Pathway’s benefit.
The full exposure is already within the financial forecast. and budget. :

4 ISSUES

We continue to have concerns over Eniergis ability to deliver a sustained acceptable
level of performance in the ordering and installation of ISDN lines for the Horizon
installation programme. This has created. considerable extra work for Pathway and has
resulted in additional costs due to aborted installations. Escalation to management
level on a number of occasions has proved unsuccessful and therefore the concerns
were raised with the UK MD of Energis. The performance deficiencies have been
recognised by Energis and positive steps to increase the size of the team, improve
processes and introduce a more effective management team have been taken. Bob
Taylor, the Energis MD, ‘has supported this. Performance. has started to improve and
measurement of sustained petformance is underway. Energis have now offered £50K
as a gesture towards their under-performance although our estimates are that their
responsibility is much greater. The contract with Energis does not provide scope for
installation under-performance, only SLAs post installation. Despite this, we will
continue to pursue Energis for an improved offer of compensation in addition to an
improvement in performance.

Obtaining satellite installation planning permission continues to be a troublesome
process with more than 50% of planned Horizon installs having been suspended dtie to
planning permission not being available. Process improvements are being, introduced

FUJ00058196
FUJ00058196

for installations in the New Year to moderate this and a greater understanding of

factors causing delays has been achieved. It is expected however that there will be
some continuéd impact due to the variable time required for planning permission. As
early suspended sites'are completed there are being reintroduced to the programme and
therefore helping to moderate the ongoing impact.

5 Costs

The Implementation forecast+remains, within budget and is on schedule to achievé ‘the
task and révenue targets for the year.

Improvements to the’forecast have. been achieved following successful conclusion: of the
negotiations with ntl: over the weekly shortfall claim and improvements in training
course oécupancy. ,

The-costs of satellite and mobile installations have now been agreed with suppliers and
have resulted in some. further cost reductions in the forecast. This has been used to
achieve the remaining*task reduction in the budget for this year.

Managemient of business case risk is progressing. well with all identified risks reducing
in terms of probability and potential impact. Contingency: funding in this area is
therefore being gradually reduced.

. There were only a smal! number of planned leavers from the Implementation
team in November but there was one unplanned resignation which.-necessitated
some replanning of resources. In addition the destinations of the planned leavers
for the end of December were agreed. Unfortunately none. of the candidates put
forward to e-Apps to be considered for assignment working was found suitable
and therefore they will be transferred to LINKwise.

° 7 appointments against vacancies were made in November. The number of live
vacant requirements has decreased from 10 at the end of October to 3 at the
end of November.

. The freelancer replacement programme continued to be given high priority.
Approximately 40 CVs were forwarded to our Development managers for
consideration and of these one third were invited to interview. 4 people were
appointed in November against freelancer replacement plan/opportunity and 1
furcher offer was. made for a January 2001 starter. One more freelancer (in
addition to that reported last month) has: volunteered and been accepted for
conversion to permanent status. All freelancer replacement activity this month
relates to the area of Development.

. 2 Technical Support’ Product Specialist vacancies were- filled this month by
existing ICL staff,.a considerable achievement given the difficulties experienced
to date in finding the right people for these types of roles.

. A meeting with Consultants from Computer People took place at month end to
ensure external recruitment plans would succeed in respect of the Freelancer
Replacement Programme.

° Personnel and Resourcing continued to liase with members from the Quality
Department to ensure good progress in respect of ISO 9001 accreditation.

and the Finance Conrrollers should reflect that in their January Forecasts. The
early stages of Zero Based Budgeting have opcned up opportunities to free up
ICL resource currently on the project which will allow us to improve oni the 89
target and give us a head start into Fiscal Year 2001/2002, in terms of replacing
Freelancers.

° The accommodation plan was reviewed and further progress has been made. In
Feltham area Fl was cleared early in the month and has been returned to site
facilities. In Bracknell it was agreed io surrender all space in area G31. The staff
currently occupying this area will be consolidated into areas G74 and G56 and
‘the: resulting free space will be released to site facilities in December. Further
opportunities for consolidation as headcount reduces have been identified and
will be implemented in 2001.

ISSUES

e Récruitment, feedback from Computer People (one of the recruitment agencies
used by ICL) is that there is a severe shortage of some skill types in the market
and this, coupled with salary competition is inhibiting their ability to supply
suitable external candidates. The main problem,areas are developers with C++
skills, testers and high level designers.

° e:Apps have not been.able to accept some members of the Implementation team
following thé énd of their jobs on the Rollout programme because they are not
considered suitable for assignment working. This will potentially have an effect
on team morale during the remainder of the programme and has to be
understood and carefully managed.

The Post Office - Client:Director’s Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

The Consultancy Framework ITT is expected in January.

2 PROGRESS

SPICE (Business) KnowledgePool..

KnowledgePool has picked up the SPICE internal training contract (Mark Horne)
which is confirmed as Phase 1 Business SPICE, Phase 2 Consumer SPICE will follow
next year with Mark being told he'll get this business as well.

Phase 1 - Work Packages 1 & 2 contracted value £200k delivery this co year.
Work Packages 3 & 4 to follow value £500k delivery mid 2001
Work Package 5 to follow value £270k

Siebel kicked up a fuss as ICL is no longer a Siebel Alliance Partner and complained to
Deloittes and the PO. KnowledgePool rebuffed these comments and are trying to work
closer with Deloittes, and will start talking to SAP too about training.

SMPP

ISD are still struggling to complete the trial/interim Peregrine-based asset management
service. Peregrine as an overall supplier to ICL is on red alert.

Despite the very slow progress, PO are preparing to licence further use of Peregrine
from ICL with support services — they have little choice. Value expected to be about
£200k including licences.

e-Infrastructure - The good news is that P&PS Technology (was IT Consultancy) is now
being used on a limited basis to help Paul Jopp in PO Business Systems get to grips with
Platform 2000, including an ICL Health Check on the W2K build - the bad news is that
our involvement is severely limited by PO - ideally we would take them back to basics and -
re-design, plan the migration properly and follow up with a workable rollout plan. There
appears to be very little understanding of “programme management". Consultancy value
£20k but another step forward into potentially high value infrastructure services business.
Good work led by John Bell.

e-Business

Feedback from the ITT process is thar no decisions have been announced and the
(internal) conclusions may be under question. We learn thar seven large current PO
suppliers (IBM, CapGemini, Microsoft, Andersens, PwC, SAP, ICL) all failed to achieve
shortlist in any of the 6 categories being evaluated. We are now exploring the hint thar
“existing contracts can of course be used for eBusiness where appropriate”.

MC have been notified their existing contract will not be renewed in April (this is in fact a
one year extension to the original contract) ~ too early to forecast any end-of-year spend
that MC may pick up

GGP_The debrief from D Waltho emphasised that although we “passed” and they could
happily have done business with us, CGEY made a better offer related to thé longer term.
As yet PO have not got their business case agreed by DTI and therefore. no funds have
been committed to PO. CGEY are on an “interim contract”.

Consultancy Framework Initial OJEC response submitted 13 October for a wide
range of IT consultancy services in 13 categories. ITT expected January.

SmartCard Mike Jenkins driving ICL Smartcard Group have achieved an agreement
with Post Office Research Group for a PO-wide Smartcard seminar for February,
supported by ICL and Microsoft. The agreed clear intention is to promote the business
benefits of smartcards within and without PO, using ICL skills and services. PO will
pay ICL £20k for seminar services.including a tailored SmartCity. demo.
