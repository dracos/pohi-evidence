I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL. Pathway Ltd
since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information
regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented
processes allow me to provide a general overview.

At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all transactions input by the
counter clerk working at that counter position. Clerks log on to the system by using their own
unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash and
stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged on,
all transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the computer and are
accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input

into it. It enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Fost
Office Limited e.g. National Savings Bank and Alliance & Leicester. The Horizon system also
enables the clerk to produce a periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the

other transactions performed in that accounting period, known as a trading period.

Where local reports are required these are accessed from an icon on the desktop menu. The
user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customise: to
requirements. The report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local
database and is printed out on the printer. The system also allows for information to be
transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield in order for the office accour ts

to be balanced.

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter
applications: the Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertained the validity of DWP
order books before payment was made, this application ceased in June 2005; the Electronic
Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to conduct general retail trade at the
counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the Automated Payments Service (APS)
which provides support for utility companies and others who provide incremental in-paymerit
mechanisms based on the use of cards and other tokens and the Logistics Feeder Service
(LFS) which supports the management of cash and value stock movements to and from the
outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in outlets. The counter desktop service end
the office platform service on which it runs provides various common functions for transaction

recording and settlement as well as user access control and session management.

Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated
automatically to databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The informaitic is
then forwarded over ISDN (Integrated System Digital Network) or other communication service,
to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu Services data centres.
This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction Management
Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that control the

flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are normally sant

at least daily via the system. Details are then forwarded daily via a file transfer service to the
Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield and also, where appropriate, to other I?o:it
Office Clients

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages {>
archive media. This creates a record of all original outlet transaction details including its orijin
- outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The TM:
journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They therefore provide
the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded in two places to
verify that systems were operating correctly. All exceptions are investigated and reconciled

Records of all transactions are written to audit archive media

The system clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual! display units
is configured to indicate local time. This has been the situation at South Warnborough, Brar ch
Code 092904 since 27 March 2001 when the Horizon system was introduced at that particu’ ar
Post Office.

The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time Displacements,
thus during British Summer Time (BST) (generally the last Sunday in March to the last Sunclay

in October), system record timings are shown in GMT — one hour earlier than local time (BST)

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the
audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AW’s). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the ‘yp: of
information requested. The integrity of audit data is guaranteed at all times from its origination,
storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been
established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal Audit (POIA) that this integrity is

maintained.

All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQ’s), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
be scrutinised on the AW

Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.

Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The
details are checked and the printed request filed

Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written’ to audit
archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved

To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checks 1m
seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the origir al
value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive media. The
result is maintained in a Check Seal Table

The specific ARQ details are used to obtain the specific data.

. The files are copied to the AW where they are checked and converted into the file: type

required by Post Office Ltd

The requested information is copied onto removal CD media, sealed to prevent
modification and virus checked using the latest software. It is then despatched to the

There was a Mention Hearing today, whereby the defendant pleaded guilty to the 14
False Accounting charges. The case has now been adjourned for sentencing on 25 January
2008. The theft charge will be dropped on the provisal that all the money owed is
repaid by defendant by sentencing date.

If the money is not repaid then we will pursue the theft charge, in which case a new
trial date will be arranged.

As such, there will not now be a trial in December (10 - 23/12/07) and provided the
money is repaid, the trial will be not be re-scheduled.

Thanks once again to you.all for the assistance you have given in this case. I will
advise you in due course as to whether the trial is re-scheduled or whether sentencing
goes ahead on 25/01/08.
