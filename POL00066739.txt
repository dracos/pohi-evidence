Okay, I first wanted to remind you of your legal rights. Um, you're still under caution, which
means you do not need to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when
questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in
evidence. Also, you are not under arrest, free to leave if you wish, and you, you do remain the right
to legal representation and advice, including the right to speak with a solicitor, even in person or on
the telephone, and, again, the Police and Criminal Evidence Acct is all there for you to read if you so
wish. Can you just sign and date the form, please. It's fourteen-, 14:13. Can you just sign the top
line there, just to confirm you've been reminded of your legal rights? (inaudible 01.16) applies.
Okay, and, again, whether you wish to speak with a solicitor or you don't wish to speak with a

we've been on the tape with all the toing and froing from one place to another. Can you just
confirm that between Diane leaving to, to try and get authority to use the, the police station for the
interview and the interview starting at the police station, that this matter of the audit shortage at
(inaudible 02.11) post office was not discussed?

(TC: 00:02:13)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:02:14)
Stephen Bradshaw: Thank you.

(TC: 00:02:15)
Diane Matthews: And, again, it's not been discussed on the changeover of tapes either.

(TC: 00:02:19)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:02:20)

(TC: 00:02:28)
Janet Skinner: No, I'm fine. Um, you said there was-,' Was there still shortages?’ and there was still
shortages. There was still shortages in Katherine Air’ s (ph 02.34), stock in there.

(TC: 00:02:36)
Diane Matthews: When? When was that?

(TC: 00:02:37)

(TC: 00:02:41)
Diane Matthews: Right. How much was it for? Was that the £1,400?

(TC: 00:02:45)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:02:46)
Diane Matthews: Right. Was that showing in your account?

(TC: 00:02:48)
Janet Skinner: Sorry?

(TC: 00:02:48)
Diane Matthews: Was that showing in your account?

(TC: 00:02:50)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:02:51)
Diane Matthews: Right. Because on this one, from November to December, the only shortage that
we've got, again, of £178.

(TC: 00:02:59)
Janet Skinner: That was an error notice. That was sent back.

(TC: 00:03:02)
Diane Matthews: £178?

(TC: 00:03:03)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:03:04)

Janet Skinner: Yes, I know because I didn't declare it.

(TC: 00:03:08)
Diane Matthews: So-,

(TC: 00:03:09)

Janet Skinner: Because she was paying it back. She kept paying it back at £10 a week, then she would-,
you see, in the safe at work, there was a bag, a white bag, and it was a Lisa Halley (ph 03.19) bag and it's
what we used to send the dockets off in.

(TC: 00:03:21)
Diane Matthews: Yeah.

(TC: 00:03:21)

Janet Skinner: And in that bag, it contained Katherine's pieces of paper with all the shortages on. Do you
know-, what she had added up. When she paid it off, she put-, (inaudible 03.31) had the money in it.
Now, that bag's gone. Now, I searched the office for that the other day and I cannot find that bag, and that
had all the bits of paper in when she's been ticking off money, or where she' d been putting the money
back into that bag, or when she'd been taking it back out the bag. Do you know what I mean? So, like, if
her son walked up to the counter and said, um, err, um, 'Mum, can you lend me £20?' She was, like,
giving him the twenty quid but what I didn't know was, she was knocking it off this piece of paper,
because I found this bag the other day-, the other-, well, not the other day, a few weeks ago. I tried to find
it the other day and I couldn't find it.

(TC: 00:04:08)
Diane Matthews: Right. So, the £1,400 lost that was in her stock-,

(TC: 00:04:15)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:14)
Diane Matthews: She accepted that she'd made, let's just say mistakes.

(TC: 00:04:19)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

Diane Matthews: She'd accepted that the shortage, for one reason or another, was in her stock and
she agreed to pay it back at £10whatever a week.

(TC: 00:04:29)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:30)
Diane Matthews: Right. That money was going into a Lisa Halley (ph 04,31) bag in the safe, along
with some form of a record of what was paid back.

(TC: 00:04:38)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:39)
Diane Matthews: Right. That £1,400, when-, when did that actually-, when did she have that loss?

(TC: 00:04:44)
Janet Skinner: Um, not November this year, November of last year. Year before.

(TC: 00:04:50)
Diane Matthews: 2004?

(TC: 00:04:52)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:53)
Diane Matthews: Right. So, from November 2004, when you're on weekly cash accounts, have you
shown that £1,400?

(TC: 00:05:01)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:05:02)
Diane Matthews: Right. So, how-, what have you been doing with that £1,400 loss?

Janet Skinner: She was just adding it as if she had it there.

(TC: 00:05:10)
Diane Matthews: She was adding it?

(TC: 00:05:11)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:05:12)
Diane Matthews: Was that under your instructions to do that?

(TC: 00:05:14)

Janet Skinner: Well, I said to her she had to clear it and she said, ' Well, I ain't got it.' So, um, she said-,
she said, ' Well, can I-, can I just add it on to my (mw 05.25)? I said, ' Yes, but it needs to be cleared.’ I
said, ' Because if I get an audit, it-, it's going to be my-, it's going to be me that gets into trouble, not you.'
And then I was, um-, then she was balanced £495 short, um, but I showed that shortage because it seemed
a lot, do you know, not to share. So, I shared-, I shared that.

(TC: 00:05:50)
Diane Matthews: Why-, why did £490-odd seem a lot not to share, but 1,400 wasn't?

(TC: 00:05:57)
Janet Skinner: Because she'd only been in for one day.

(TC: 00:06:00)
Diane Matthews: Who had?

(TC: 00:06:01)
Janet Skinner: Theresa.

(TC: 00:06:04)
Diane Matthews: But, you know, you only have to serve for ten minutes and you can make a
mistake.

Janet Skinner: Well, it's just that they asked me to show it, you know, to show that shortage to see if an
error notice came back for it.

(TC: 00:06:14)
Diane Matthews: Who asked you to show it?

(TC: 00:06:15)
Janet Skinner: Theresa did.

(TC: 00:06:17)
Diane Matthews: Right. What was different between that one and the £1,400?

(TC: 00:06:21)
Janet Skinner: Because that was a mistake that she'd made, um, like, over a couple of weeks.

(TC: 00:06:28)
Diane Matthews: Do you believe that was a mistake or do you believe it was a loan of money?

(TC: 00:06:33)
Janet Skinner: I-, I don't believe it was a mistake.

(TC: 00:06:36)
Diane Matthews: So, you think she'd loaned some money?

(TC: 00:06:39)
Janet Skinner: Yes, because she too easy (ph 06.40) to take the £10 here and put the £10 back.

(TC: 00:06:42)
Diane Matthews: Right. Did you ask her whether she'd taken the money?

(TC: 00:06:45)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:06:46)
Diane Matthews: And what did she say?

(TC: 00:06:47)
Janet Skinner: 'I' m not that kind of person,’ and just cried.

(TC: 00:06:50)
Diane Matthews: Right. So, did you give her any authority to borrow £1,400?

(TC: 00:06:54)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:06:54)
Diane Matthews: Right. But if this is going back to November 2004, er, as you've indicated with the
seven and a half from January, you said on that you spread that, um, over your tens and twenties.

(TC: 00:07:09)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:07:10)
Diane Matthews: Right and, um, to cover the loss, not to show it in your accounts. Um, and here
we've got a £1,400 one that is being covered up in the same way. Is that correct?

(TC: 00:07:21)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:07:21)

Diane Matthews: Right. Now, if-, if that's been covered up by Katherine Airs (ph 07.25), was she
working under your instructions to do that until she pays-, until there's £1,400 in that Lisa Halley
bag to put it back in?

(TC: 00:07:33)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:07:35)

(TC: 00:07:37)
Janet Skinner: Yes, I did.

(TC: 00:07:39)
Janet Skinner: You knew obviously falsifying an accounting document, like Steve said earlier, is a
criminal offence.

(TC: 00:07:45)
Janet Skinner: Well, no, I didn't know that.

(TC: 00:07:47)
Diane Matthews: And, I mean, we've already discussed obviously the reason for the balance and
how you have to deal with your losses and gains.

(TC: 00:07:54)
Janet Skinner: Yes, I know.

(TC: 00:07:56)
Diane Matthews: And-,

(TC: 00:07:55)
Janet Skinner: But she was expecting me to just pay that back.

(TC: 00:07:58)
Diane Matthews: But if you couldn't pay it back then they do have procedures in place for you to
obviously contact somebody. Did you contact somebody over the 1,400?

(TC: 00:08:09)

Janet Skinner: No. It's the same (inaudible 08.11) had, I had the same problems there. I mean, um, one
week it was £800, um, another week it was £900, and the girl that-, whose stock unit was actually short,
actually left. I went in, balanced her stock unit. Her stock unit was £275 short, and I said ' It needs to be
put right,’ and she was like, 'I ain't got any money. I can't do that,’ and she left on that-, on that Saturday.
So, I had to rectify that. I had to cover it with a cheque and put it back, and then when-, after I'd closed
that office and left, that girl went back into that office-, not into the post office, but into the shop, cashed a
scratch card for £150 and left.

Janet Skinner: Um, well, at that time she was doing 31 hours. Now, she's only doing um, 25, 26, I think.

(TC: 00:09:46)

(TC: 00:10:33)
Stephen Bradshaw: To cover that loss.

(TC: 00:10:35)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:10:36)
Stephen Bradshaw: Katherine's paying back £10 or £20 a week here and there. So, we've got this
bag of money in the safe with so much money in.

(TC: 00:10:45)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:10:46)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. Did she pay back every week?

(TC: 00:10:48)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:10:51)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right.

(TC: 00:10:52)
Janet Skinner: But then-, but then sometimes she took it back, because it's where she kept her stock. It
was her-, her cash at that time that was inflated.

(TC: 00:10:59)

Stephen Bradshaw: Yes, but either way, she's paying it back, isn't she? You've got this Lisa Halley
bag with the money in, she's paying it back. I understand it's all within her-, why is it within her
cash? Because you weren't on individual stock units in November '04.

(TC: 00:12:09)

(TC: 00:12:15)
Janet Skinner: We was already on individual stock units.

(TC: 00:12:18)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. What did you go on individual stock units for?

(TC: 00:12:20)

Janet Skinner: Because I'd gone-, I was-, I was off and it would probably have been about the-, August,
September time, and, um, Colleen was balancing and we were £700 and something short. So, she rang me
up, she'd been there ages, um, I went in to see what it was, and it actually worked out that she'd, um, not
rimmed (ph 12.42) in the change. To-, you scan the sheet, she'd not rimmed it. All she'd not done is
rimmed it in. Do you know, so it-, well, no, that (inaudible 12.52) anyway. But it was something to do
with the change anyway, what she hadn't rimmed in. When I got there, she said, 'I can't find this £700 and
odd,' so we checked it-, her and I both checked it and it was there. It was just a miscount.

(TC: 00:13:07)
Stephen Bradshaw: Do you mean an error?

(TC: 00:13:08)

Janet Skinner: Yes, it was just a genuine error. So, the next day, Colleen said to me-, she said, 'Look-,'
she said-, and like, I think we was down-, we were probably still down about £100 and something. So, she
said to me, 'It's got to-, well, why don't we just put them on individual stock units and then that way, we
know where the mistakes have been made.’

(TC: 00:13:27)
Stephen Bradshaw: Okay, so it started some time the middle of '04 then?

(TC: 00:13:31)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:13:32)
Stephen Bradshaw: Okay. So, we go in there. So, then we come to November '04-,

(TC: 00:13:36) eeeeeeneeneneie

Stephen Bradshaw: Yeah. No, (inaudible 13.43) June, but never mind, we've sorted that out now.
You started then, and then in November '04, she had a loss of £1,400?

(TC: 00:13:52)
Janet Skinner: Yeah. Between-, it was between November and December.

(TC: 00:13:56)
Stephen Bradshaw: Okay, yeah, within that period. So, the loss of £1,400s. She said she couldn't
pay it back all in one go, she was paying back so much each week, ten and £20s-,

(TC: 00:14:07)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:14:07)
Stephen Bradshaw: She was inflating the cash on your instructions to cover the shortage.

(TC: 00:14:15)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:14:16)

Stephen Bradshaw: This £10 and £20 was going in the bag. She went sick in June. We've got one
right. Seven months later, which is 28 weeks. So, we're going to allow for (inaudible 14.26), say you
stole £200. What happened to that £200 that she'd been-, that she paid back?

(TC: 00:14:33)
Janet Skinner: Well, there was nothing in the bag.

(TC: 00:14:37)
Stephen Bradshaw: So-, see, what I just can't work out is, you've got somebody paying-,

Janet Skinner: She was taking-,

(TC: 00:14:43)

you're responsible. At the end of the day, it's your cash out of your pocket that should have made

(TC: 00:14:58)
Janet Skinner: But she was paying it back to herself.

(TC: 00:14:59)

Stephen Bradshaw: But, you know, what sort of office are you running? 'Go and rob money off
me, and then pay it back yourself,' and then she just walks out with your money. So, we've got-, so
you never-, she never paid you a penny back, did she?

(TC: 00:15:12)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:15:13)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. So, you've got £1,400 and that's in November '05.

Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:15:18)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. You've got-, sorry, November '04, we've got £1,400 that hasn't been

(TC: 00:16:55)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:16:56)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. So, there's £1,400, November '04. From November '04 to June '05, it's
okay. June '05 to December '05, what were the balances like?

(TC: 00:17:12)
Janet Skinner: Not too bad.

(TC: 00:17:15)

Stephen Bradshaw: Not too bad? Because the person you distrusted was off, so it was all okay then.
Then between December '05 and May '06, we have a discrepancy of, give or take a little bit,
£59,000.

(TC: 00:17:32)
Janet Skinner: Yeah.

(TC: 00:17:34)
Stephen Bradshaw: Right. £1,400. Each and every account since November '04, until you found
your first loss of January '05, is covered, isn't it? That's been inflated.

(TC: 00:17:47)

(TC: 00:26:56)
Stephen Bradshaw: So, why are you changing all your procedures?

(TC: 00:26:59)
Janet Skinner: Because I was short staffed-, when Katherine went iright, and Theresa was on
holiday, I basically worked that office on my own. Literally on my own. So, I thought, I had to take on
somebody else but couldn't train them to put them on an individual stock unit.

(TC: 00:27:23)

Stephen Bradshaw: Right. I appreciate that you're short staffed and that. What I fail to
understand is, whether you're short staffed or not, and you're saying about training individuals to
put on a shared stock unit-, on an individual stock unit, at the end of the day, whether they're on
individual stock units or a shared stock unit, the person, trained or untrained, is sitting serving
customers from exactly the same makeup and (inaudible 27.51) terminal with all the kit, and the
drawer full of money and a book with stuff in, whether it be shared or individually. What you're
doing-, if you've got ten sheets of first class stamps, you divide it between the two clerks and they
have five each. Why does being short staffed make it that you-, the controls go out the window?
Before (mw 28.11), you're transferring cash in and out, there's an audit trail for it-,

(TC: 00:28:14)

(TC: 00:28:19)

Janet Skinner: How often do you sit behind a counter? All you do is you get verbal abuse permanently all
the time. It's not the easiest of things. It' s-, basically, you' re there to try and provide the best service for
that customer, but when you' ve got them hurling abuse at you all the time, it doesn' t-, it doesn't make it
easy. So, you just don't have the time. So, yeah, you can't tell me that you'd walk into every single post
office and they're run by the book as they're supposed to, because I know they don't. I've worked in that
many.

(TC: 00:28:48)

(TC: 00:28:54)
Janet Skinner: No, I know they don't. Ever.

(TC: 00:28:56)

Stephen Bradshaw: But again-, again, the control. So, you've got customers, you know, (mw 29.03)
abuse or they scream at you. Before-, before you set up, as anybody does in business, you have to
make sure that you re there on time to open up, get your stuff out, and then people have enough
cash to serve the people. When you run out of cash, somebody leaves and you say to the customer, 'I
won't be long. I'm just going for some more cash,' and you walk away. The customer's not going to
hurl abuse. You're only walking to the back to get money transferred out, either signed out ina
book or transferred via the system. You changed the system completely and then suddenly lost
£60,000, so how do we know you haven't stolen the money?

(TC: 00:29:44)
Janet Skinner: You don't.

Janet Skinner: Because I said-, no, it' s-, it's because of the fact that it's always been mistakes that she's
made.

(TC: 00:30:27)

themselves to go out and take the money from the safe?

(TC: 00:30:35)
Stephen Bradshaw: Was the safe always open?

(TC: 00:30:36)
Janet Skinner: No, not always.

(TC: 00:30:43)
Stephen Bradshaw: And where were you then?

(TC: 00:30:45)
Janet Skinner: Well, it depends on whether I was there or not. I only worked half day Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday and then I was off Friday and Saturday.

(TC: 00:30:53)
Stephen Bradshaw: So, you really didn't work very much at the post office, did you? You basically
were a part-time postmistress, weren't you?

(TC: 00:31:02)
Janet Skinner: Well, no, I can't-, you can't really say that.

(TC: 00:31:04)
Stephen Bradshaw: Well, half day Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, off Friday and Saturday?

(TC: 00:31:08)
Janet Skinner: Yeah. Pay somebody else to work it for you.

(TC: 00:31:11)
Stephen Bradshaw: But you-, you pay somebody else to work it for you, all you're doing is paying a
clerk. Have you paid an officer in charge?

(TC: 00:31:17)
Janet Skinner: No.

(TC: 00:31:19)

Stephen Bradshaw: You haven't. You employ clerks to sit there and serve the customers, and
basically do what they want behind. So, you've got no control whatsoever within that post office.
You don't know what goes on. So, for all this about, 'It's Katherine because I don't-,' you're hardly
there.

which is the shop door, our door, and she barged in, pushed the door open and said, 'I need this door
leaving open for stock.’

until the present time, that you were the postmistress at Northbrantown (ph 39.13). Each and every
week, or every month, when you were under branch trading, your cash has been inflated by an
amount of money in order to not show losses within your office?

£40,000 overinflated, of which another nineteen, which leaves you with nine. Now, if memory serves
correctly, I think we found about £10,000 in cash, give or take a bit, was it?

Diane Matthews: Is that because it was requested?

amounts of money, and you've been sending it back?

for money back, because you're already starting 60 grand, or-, well, let's just say from the start of
the year, you're seven grand short, building up. If they're asking for money, you've not got it to
send back. Because if you send it back, you're not going to be able to open for service to the
