Management Summary Update

programmes. _
+ Robust but challenging plan now agreed with !trretevant:with split delivery

dates of December ‘09 and March 10. Customér félationship showing
slow but steady improvement

+ Completion date of 215 April 2010 also agreed on HNGX. Plan has been
re-worked during June with considerable emphasis on resource planning
and costing. Next 60 days critical during Integration testing phase.
Customer supportive of this roll out plan

+ Both plans contain risk which has been assessed and understood but
focus must now be on delivering to plan. Slippage of plan deadlines has
added £4.5m of cost to financials with some contingency available for
project risk.

+ 09/10 Targets — working to closure. Detailed work has been undertaken at
sub BU level and will be finalised once PSD targets agreed.

+ Morale improving as direction of BU becomes clearer and key issues
addressed

efficiently.
