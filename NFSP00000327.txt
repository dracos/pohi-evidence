Dear Colin

Since writing to you earlier today we have held our meeting with ICL
Pathway to review readiness to begin the pilot on the new software release,
CSR+.

We have taken the decision to proceed with the data centre migration next
weekend subject to confirmation from ICL Pathway that they have robust
plans in place to fix an intermittent problem around preservation of data
when swapping faulty kit out on some multi-position counter terminals, and
no new issues emerging in remaining tests next week,

We expect the first pilot offices, 285 existing sites, to start on the new release
in week commencing 4 September. They will be followed by 20 newly
migrating offices who will receive the new CSR+ user training in advance of
this becoming more widely available in early October. During the final week
of the pilot, namely 25 September, we will transfer over another 600 existing
offices before pausing for a week to review experiences. When we resume on
9 October a further 1500 offices will be upgraded. At this stage have built in
another review to confirm we can handle high volumes before proceeding to
complete the remaining migrations at the rate of up to 600 offices a night. We
are endeavouring to convert all existing CSR offices by 13 November and.
certainly before the end of November. Outlets will be notified in advance on
an individual basis of their planned migration date.

Yours sincerely

ee Don Grey
National Horizon Roll out Project Manager
