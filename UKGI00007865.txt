2018 03 12 Submission to Perm Sec on Tom Cooper Appointment to Board
2018 03 12 Submission to Perm Sec on Tom Cooper Appointment to Board.docx

I am trying to finalise the submission to Alex and need your help:
* Please could you add some wording along the lines that Nelli suggested for the indemnity (on the criminal

side of things)

© On the terms of appointment, I think we still probably have to clear these with Alex (despite my view to the
contrary that I expressed to Elizabeth this morning). Please can you check my new wording in the sub on that.

I note that in the marked up letter sent back to Jane there is nothing in there about Tom not having to disclose
information that he learns here in the course of his duties, which he might otherwise be obliged to disclose to
POL. E.g. if he learns something about Royal Mail, unless that’s carved out he’d be obliged to tell them given
they have such a important partnership.

Many thanks — starting to lose the will to live on this one.
