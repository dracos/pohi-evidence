Agenda 1 - Intro’s, actions, AOB
items

Agreed

The minutes and actions taken at the
March meeting were agreed. Hard
copies for January, February and March
were signed-off.

Agreed

AOB items were agreed for discussion at
the end of the meeting:

e OFCOM response

e APOP - transaction time-outs

Noted

A review of action points from the
previous meeting commenced. There
were no new actions as a result of the
review.

Agenda 2 - Service Review

Noted

CM talked through the Service Review
Summary report.

The major highlight was that all formal
SLT’s were met, with the exception of
one ‘day j’ data recovery, for the month
of March. The reason for the failure was
down to a BT line fault at the affected
branch.

Of note though is the increased calls
logged by branches relating to hardware
— split across PIN pad and counter
printers, with approximately 450 extra
incidents each. The PIN pad issue was
related to the S90 counter release. CM
advised that the counter printer issue
could be related to mails label. Nick
Crow will visit a selection of branches
experiencing problems to investigate the
issue. Further discussions to take place
when investigations have been
concluded.

RB asked if there had been any supply
or quality changes to the blank mail

labels.

DH said that he would investigate if any
changes to mail labels and their supply
had been made.

CM advised of one major incident during
March, which affected gateway
exchanges for 90 minutes at the start of
Wednesday 15"* March. There was
minimal impact due to prioritisation of
incidents.

Other incidents-:

e CAPO cards declined on PIN pads
at 87 Bureau pilot branches for
S90. A re-boot restored service
and a reference data reversal done
overnight to restore normal
service. (02/03/06).

e A power failure at the BANK site
resulted in 792 branches losing on-
line services at 16:50hrs and was
resolved at 19.20hrs. (07/03/06).

e Total VSAT network loss due to
internal malfunction of the Hughes
router at Docklands. On-line
services affected to all VSAT
branches from 09:32hrs and
restored between 09:48 and 10:45
hrs. (10/03/06).

CM then advised that branch availability
for March was 99.71%.

DH congratulated Fujitsu Services on
the branch availability figure for March
and also added that this figure had been
99.9% for two days in March. DH also
raised a concern, for awareness,
surrounding incident detail from IMT
when logging incidents with the POL
SCT. All agreed that the detail of

incidents should flow through this
channel on an operational level and
contact between CM and DH should
then be done in an escalation capacity.

DH also congratulated Fujitsu Services
on the March Scorecard results, with
4.25 being one of the best scores
recorded. However the individual score
for Security was raised and an
understanding that actions were in place
by both parties in working together to
improve this score.

Agenda 3 — Service Improvements

Noted

AP240402

CM provided a brief update with progress
of current service improvement initiatives;

CM advised that the IMT and POL SCT
continue in working well together.

FS had also been tracking hardware
component calls made by branches with
the view of refining this work to see if
there were specific reasons for these
calls, such as hardware failure trends or
possible branch training or awareness
issues.

Priority engineer still in pilot stages with
an increase of ‘A’ priority calls. DH was
pleased with the success of this at this
stage.

Counter printer — Ink issue. CM advised
that a commercial decision would be
needed on whether this would be a full or
partial replacement.

DH advised that he would speak to Karen
Molloy to understand latest status and
proposed way forward.

New service improvement initiatives

GW suggested that an area for
improvement would be looking at the
financial discrepancies in POL FS as a
result of closing and re-opening branches
(OBC process). GW said that the current
process needs to be reviewed.

DH asked for a proposal in light of GW’s
POL FS suggestion.

RB advised that the service descriptions
for HNG, X-service and MIS ad-hoc
requests could be presented earlier than
expected, as there were no financial
implications. Initial timescales for
changes would have been October 2008.

RB to present service descriptions for
HNG X-service and MIS ad-hoc requests.

CM suggestion two areas of possible
improvement. The first being Saturday
engineer visits and ‘B’ priority tracking
with the view of removing this and leaving
a‘A’ and ‘C’ priority level.

CM to provide POL with a proposal for
both Saturday engineer visits and ‘B’
priority tracking by the end of May.

DH advised that a text message service is
being devised within POL allowing POL
Sales and Service Managers (SAMs) to
be aware if one of their branches were off-
line (current view is that this should be a
24hr awareness approach).
Communications, highlighting current
service levels with FS, to SAMs has yet to
be finalised.
