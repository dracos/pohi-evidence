2.1 Notes for table

In this table:

e data regarding the HSS and OC is sourced from Post Office Ltd, which

retains full responsibility for the data they provide.

e the HCRS redress payments data reflects the current position at a point
in time — it should be noted that these totals can change slightly as time

goes on as payments are retrospectively confirmed as received by

claimants.

3. Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)

Post Office Ltd received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.
RLIT0000620

RLIT0000620

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
Ltd continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to
March 2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would
be provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress,
and the scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office Ltd has received 7,020 eligible late claims to date.

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants
receive an offer of redress.

The £507 million paid out on the HSS includes £34.6 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £10.8 million in interim payments to late
applications.

On 13 March 2024, the government announced that all
eligible HSS claimants would be entitled to a fixed sum award of £75,000 to
settle their claim.

Post Office Ltd has also started to make payments of the full £75,000 fixed
sum award to HSS applicants who have not previously received redress but
have now accepted this offer. The number and amount of offers and
payments made for the full fixed sum are now included in the HSS figures
below and in the HSS eligible late claims figures on the ‘Claim data by
scheme’ table. As of 30 April 2025, approximately £240 million has been
paid in fixed sum awards to over 3,200 claimants (25% of which are
claimants who had previously applied for full assessment but then switched
to the fixed sum, with the remainder being those who applied directly for the
fixed sum).

Post Office Ltd continues to make top-up payments to claimants who had
previously accepted a full and final offer below the value of £75,000, to bring
their total redress to £75,000. As of 30 April 2025, approximately £107
million has been paid in top-ups to previously settled claimants.

3.1 Eligible claimant stages

As of 30 April 2025, 9,437 claims for financial redress have been received
via the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. This includes applications received before
the original deadline, and applications received since the scheme reopened
in October 2022.

Of the total 9,437 claims received, 5,725 have been paid and a further 87
have accepted offers and are awaiting payment. Another 832 claimants are
RLIT0000620
RLIT0000620

currently in receipt of offers that they have not yet accepted and the
remaining 2,793 claimants are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.

4. Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting
their conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon
evidence.

As of 31 October 2024, all 111 eligible claimants have either reached full
and final settlement or received a minimum of £200,000 through interim
payments.

A full and final claim is defined as:

e both non-pecuniary and pecuniary claims have been received and
sufficiently particularised to substantiate redress payments of £450,000 or
more

e or the claimant has requested the £600,000 fixed sum offer
RLITO000620
RLIT0000620

Post Office Ltd has been progressing non-pecuniary settlements first to get
money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which means a number of
partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full and final
settlements published here. Post Office Ltd continues to work on finalising
these outstanding claims.

Any individual with a conviction overturned by the Post Office (Horizon
System) Offences Act 2024 or the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences
(Scotland) Act 2024 will be eligible to seek financial redress via the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

4.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 111 claimants eligible for financial redress through
the OC scheme. As of 30 April 2025, Post Office Ltd has received 86 full
and final claims.

5. Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63
postmasters had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress
once their conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been
overturned by the courts, they are eligible under the Overturned Convictions
(OC) Scheme. If their conviction has been overturned by the legislation,
they are eligible for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

As of 30 April 2025, of the 492 members of the GLO group, 488 people
been paid some redress. Of these, 294 people have been paid full and final
redress. Another 91 have challenged the offer made to them but have
received 80% of it as an interim payment, and a further 8 have agreed to a
full and final settlement and are in receipt of an 80% interim payment. This
means that in total, 393 members of the group (80%) have therefore
RLIT0000620
RLIT0000620

received substantial redress (defined as either full and final or 80% interim
redress payments).

The remaining claims are at the various stages listed below:

e 2 have agreed full and final redress but are awaiting payment

e 19 have challenged offers but are awaiting their 80% interim payment
e 32 have been made an offer of redress but have not yet responded

e 5 have submitted a full claim and are awaiting an offer of redress

e 16 claims had been submitted but were incomplete

¢ 8 submitted claims had not yet been fully reviewed to confirm
completeness

e 17 claims had not yet been submitted

5.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 492 claimants eligible for financial redress through

the GLO scheme. As of 30 April 2025, 450 full and final claims have been
received. For full and final claims received, the number reported refers to all
claims assessed as complete. Further claims may have been received
recently but not yet assessed to determine whether they are complete. A
claim initially assessed as complete may subsequently be found to require
further information and therefore be removed from counts of complete
claims received while awaiting this information.

5.2 Scheme delivery targets

The Department for Business and Trade is committed to a target of making
a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim within 40
working days. A full claim is defined as a claim which the department
considers, with advice from its legal advisers, does not need any further
evidence in order to assess every element of the claim. Should the
department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a full
assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

Over the lifetime of the scheme to 30 April 2025, 89.9% of claimants
received their first offer within 40 working days of submitting a full claim.

The Department for Business and Trade’s target is providing a substantive
response within 40 working days to 90% of claimants who submit a
complete challenge from 1 December 2024. A challenge will be considered
‘complete’ if the department does not require any more information from the
claimant or their advisers in order to provide a substantive response. A
RLIT0000620
RLIT0000620

substantive response is defined as the claimant receiving a revised offer or
a decision to uphold the original offer.

As of 30 April 2025, 91% of claimants (70 out of 77) who submitted
complete challenges after 1 December received their substantive response
within 40 working days of doing so. Claims are being assessed in the date
order in which they were submitted, so no challenge submitted before 1
December will be left behind.

5.3 £75,000 fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total
fixed sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against

the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-
litigation-order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is
made.

As of 30 April 2025, 304 offers have been accepted, of which 156 are offers
of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the £75,000
fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously accepted
offers.

6. Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme
(HCRS)

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in
the acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by the

RLITO000620
RLIT0000620

Department for Business and Trade, to provide financial redress to
postmasters across the UK who had their convictions quashed by the acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is
working with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’
eligibility for the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress: they can either
accept a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
application to a detailed assessment process.

All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.

The department is now publishing data on settlements, broken down by
initial interim payments and full and final settlements.

6.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 30 April 2025, 360 full and final claims for financial redress have been
received via the HCRS. Of these 360 claims, 353 have received payments
and the remaining 7 have accepted offers for redress and are awaiting
payment from the department.
