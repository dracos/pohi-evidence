Thanks Tim. I’ve asked the same question as there’s a pattern here.

Tom,
I’ve now read it. Judge is critical of both parties, but already sense he is not well disposed to us -
the word “aggressive” is used a couple of times in connection with us, in relation to the
inadmissible evidence claim, and the treatment of an SPM. The tone of his comments on the
comments at the end, on the Common Issues trial, and the puported objection on our part for PR
reasons, is definitely not helpful. I’ve asked for an update on whether this ruling and its tone,
suggests any change of tack.

Best

Tim

Have you seen the judgement from the other day? It’s worth a read.
