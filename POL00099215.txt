Dear All

Apologies that you have not yet received two of the Board papers for next week’s meeting.

The Horizon paper will be circulated by email tonight and Sue will circulate the Funding paper on Sunday afternoon as
it is still being written following input at the VC &JS meeting.

Both papers will be put on the ipad on Monday morning and I will also set up a file in the Reading room for all the
Horizon documents eg JS statement, the Second Sight report etc. .for ease of reference.

Thanks
Alwen
