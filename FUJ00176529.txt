All

Below are my working notes. They are NOT a final outcome. Yellow text is where I am unsure on accuracy. Actions at
the bottom. Do not share this email please.

ARQs - could we have shared a response to POL that had missing data as it was absent in the audit archive

Summary
«Yes. However, if we did, it would have been shown within the ARQ response shared with POL [to be
confirmed]

Detail
* Each ARQ is run by POA SecOps from a secure room using a bespoke AE client retrieval application
e =AnARQis fulfilled by a query executing within the Query Manager
The Query Manager checks for the correct sequencing of JSNs
e JSNs are assigned by the counter and constantly advance as each transaction is processed
FUJ00176529
FUJ00176529

JSNs are not reset, but after extended periods - perhaps c15 years - JSNs can loop back to start their
counter again

The ARQ query options are FAST or SLOW.

The ARQ query will run against one of the 2 Audit Archives (they are assumed to be identical)
SLOW has always been available

FAST was newly introduced in HNG-X R2 2011 by CP to automate addit

POA SecOps use the FAST query by default
A FAST ARQ query will abort if the sequence of JSNs has gaps

A SLOW ARQ query will handle both gaps and duplicates in JSNs
The SLOW query has looked for gaps and duplicates

The POA SecOps is alerted on the AE client screen when it has collated the result set to confirm if there
are/are not any gaps or

«If POA SecOps is alerted to gaps, and this is pre-HNG-X, they should rerun the SLOW query against the
other archive as it is unlikely that BOTH archives will have gaps [this relies on POA SecOps deciding to
do this and could be subject to human error]

e If POA SecOps is alerted to gaps, and this is HNG-X OR the second run against a pre-HNG-X archive, they
should raise an Incident as this is not expected [this relies on POA SecOps deciding to do this and could
be subject to human error]

The gaps/duplicates alert will appear on the Summary tab of the Excel extract the AE Client creates.

. The ell tab will be shared with POL so they will know if there are any gaps or duplicatesIfwe v er

ayy

. The POA SecOps team record the details of the ARQ requested by POL and also the type of query run
(FAST/SLOW) and the archive against which the result set was derived. Notes can also be added. We
have records going back to 2004 in an old MS Access database, from 2014 we have good excel records.
Our ability to access to MS Access databases has been an issue in the past as the version of MS Access
the database was created in isn’t compatible with modern versions of Windows

* POAno longer retain copies of ARQ responses sent to POL - they are permanently deleted once
confirmed as received

« ARQresponses used to be saved on a secure drive which is held in the secure room. The NAS drive died
around 2017, and around the same time a PCI audit finding advised us that we should no longer be
keeping the ARQ spreadsheets as they contain PAN numbers, so we stopped storing them and deleted
the spreadsheets once POL confirmed they had received a copy. We also around the same time deleted
any copies of old ARQ spreadsheets we could find except for any that we were told to keep as a result of
the litigation.

So we need to:

1. Gerald - Check whether checking for gaps has always been in the SLOW query used by POA SecOps -
and if not, state the applicable dates it was [this will tell us if we have always known about this and have
always been notifying POL - and will give us an idea if we were doing this prior to 2007 for which we no
longer have records]

I have only been working on audit since it was changed as a part of HNGx (2010 or thereabouts — I was
actually the very last member of the Horizon counter team working on the migration of data from
FUJ00176529
FUJ00176529

Horizon to HNGx before this — my work there finished when the last counter migrated). I started as a
very junior member of the team but once I got into it a bit (within a year or so) I was fully aware that it
checked the integrity of each transaction, whether there were GAPs and whether there were duplicates.
For one reason or other I often tested that these things worked — for example I once gave a
demonstration to auditors of all 3 and when doing the two migrations of audit I performed I always
checked these still worked. Going back though versions of DEV/GEN/MAN/0015 “Audit Extraction Client
User Manual” I see gaps were mentioned in the very first version 0.1 published on 24/01/09. However
something did trouble me. Duplicates were not mentioned until you got to version 2.1 on 12/01/2011.
Now duplicates are far more common than gaps. I have investigated a lot of gaps and duplicate reports
from CSPOA. When asked to investigate I always ask them to raise a PEAK so that there is an audit trail.
Going back though PEAK records so far I have only found 1 gap one but maybe 20 duplicate ones. In all
cases of duplicates I investigated I found that the same transaction had been put in different TMS files
and , as far as audit is concerned, correctly gathered. I developed special tooling to check these out. In
all cases I checked out all duplicates were exactly that — complete and utter duplicates (not just the
message number the same). Now (and presumably since 2011) duplicates are clearly reported on the
spreadsheet. If the operator understands there are duplicates in the spreadsheet he is looking at all is
well. However if he does not understand there are duplicates there is double accounting of transactions
going on as far as he is concerned with no explanation. I am sorry to report that this might have serious
implications. Note it is quite possible that the previous pre-HNGx audit system silently merged
duplicates (I do not know for sure) but our present system definitely does not. However I suppose it
might have at the time when it did not report duplicates.

Gerald - Confirm that the gap checking applies to both pre-HNG-X extracts and HNG-X extracts

I have been unable to find any documents on this but I did find PEAK PC0133634 from 20-Mar-2006
which clearly indicated to me that GAPS were reported. It attached spread sheets as evidence that are
archived and I have asked them to be got back.

Gerald - confirm when the FAST query was introduced
CP4867 (HNG-X CP0336) 02/03/2009. Not sure when it went live exactly.

Gerald - summarise what the FAST event checks are [so we can be clear why this query came into
existence]

Slow ARQs can do it too by the way. As an option (they do not use it now) all the events are got back for
the time of the query. Then all critical/major events for the FAD in question and the BAL servers are
checked against stored rules written in perl. If they are deemed benign they go into a csv file for
optional examination else they go into a spreadsheet that will be definitely checked by the SSC. The SSC
examine the spreadsheet and if they find that the new ones are benign too they inform the audit team
and we amend the perl filters to exclude them in the future too.

Geoff/Jason - Collate the POA SecOps ARQ records from the earliest date to the present so it can be
looked at (will include converting an old version of MS Access)
Geoff/Jason - Check the POA SecOps ARQ records to see if any have notes stating gaps were present
{this will overtly show examples where we have alerted POL]
Geoff - check if there are any notes in the secure rooms that refer to gaps that we may want to check
Geoff - Identify the secure drive holding previous ARQ responses - may be controlled by Matt Lenton.
We will need to provide very careful controls on the sharing of this data if it is deemed ‘sensitive’
a. SSC - identify the earliest and latest ARQ response dates on the secure drive [we will
know the period for which we can provide more confident views - and this should go back
prior to 2007]
b. SSC- run a query against the data to find any files with "Gaps Found" on any Summary

FUJ00176529

tabs [this will tell us ranges of dates when POL were alerted to gaps]
9. Geoff/Jason - Confirm that POA SecOps will re-run a query for gaps pre-HNG-X and will raise a ticket for
gaps in a second run for pre-HNG-X or any gaps at all for HNG-X. Write this into the Work Instruction
