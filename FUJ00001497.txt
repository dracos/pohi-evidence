1 Purpose

This PPD describes the processes and procedures at post office counters in
respect of the Automated Payment Service (APS), in accordance with ICL
Pathway Core System Release Plus (CSR+).

This PPD provides a description of all the processes involved in order to
enable the contractual agreement of procedures and to be a source from
which authors can develop the further user documentation needed.

2 Scope

This PPD describes the following processes and procedures:
e Automated payment using a magnetic card.

e Automated payment using a bar-coded document.

« Automated payment using a smart card.

e General processes and procedures, for example, manual input of bar-code
number from a bar-coded document or Primary Account Number (PAN)
from a magnetic card and re-printing an AP transaction receipt.

e Fallback procedures.

« Recovery procedures for session, disaster and fallback recovery
scenarios.

This PPD is one of a set of PPDs provided for CSR+. The way in which the
set fits together is described in the CSR+ Introduction PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/093].

The use of the bar-code reader, magnetic card reader, smart card reader and
counter printer is described in the CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/097].

Generic procedures such as rejecting or accepting entered data, altering an
entered value, responding to a value error message and pre-viewing a receipt
are described in the CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

Information on settling transactions and accounting is provided in the CSR+
EPOSS PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/095].

The screen messages described in this PPD are summarised and suffixed
with a cross-reference in the form: ‘[Message Collection:ObjectName] where
Collection is the Collection name and ObjectName is the ObjectName within
this collection. These relate to an entry in the Horizon OPS Desktop
Messages and Help Text: CSR+ [Ref. SD/DOC/009] that defines the text of
the message.

The format of the APS reports and receipts is described in Horizon OPS
Reports and Receipts [Ref. SD/DES/005].

The helpdesk calls described in this PPD are cross-referenced to the calls
described in the CSR+ Horizon System Helpdesk PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/092] as
follows: ‘Telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk [Call Type:Problem]’ where
Type is the call type and Problem is the problem within this type, for example
Hardware:counter printer fault. (Note that these cross-references are
provided solely to assist PPD reviewers; the call references are not relevant
to the helpdesk callers.)

3 Overview

The Automated Payment Service (APS) is a service that enables POCL to
provide a range of payment services to the customers of many POCL Clients
including utility companies and local authorities. These payment services are
typified by their use of magnetic cards, bar-coded documents and smart cards
that are presented by customers at the counter either in support of payments
or as pre-payments to their account.

APS counter transactions use APS Product and APS Token reference data
that specifies details such as the minimum payment amount, card
interpretation rules and specific receipt wording.

APS is provided at every post office counter position, unless directed
otherwise by POCL, and is configured at installation to the particular products
appropriate to a particular post office.

3.1. Transaction initiation

AP transactions are typically initiated at the counter by a peripheral event
such as reading a magnetic card, a utility bill bar-code or a smart card. Two
copies of the receipt (a customer copy and an office copy) are produced for
every successful AP transaction. The office copy of the receipt is used to
facilitate transaction recovery in the case of a failure scenario.

Some transactions (such as AP manual transactions and recovery procedure
transactions) can be initiated by selecting the relevant menu item and
entering the magnetic card or bar-coded bill details.

The recovery procedure may be automatically entered following logon if APS
detects that it is necessary.

3.2 AP receipt retention period

AP receipts should be retained in the office for two years.

4 AP transactions

AP transactions are invoked using a magnetic card, a bar-coded document or
a smart card.

System rules:

e Before the user can perform an AP transaction, the Serve Customer
screen must be displayed.

« The system checks to see whether the POCL client service/product to
whom the customer is making payment is supported by the outlet. If this is
not the case, the system rejects their payment.

« The system will not accept payment amounts that are outside the pre-set
payment parameters for that particular transaction.

e Where a customer reference number is specified, it is validated by the
system.

e Smart card transactions cannot be suspended or transferred.
Business rules:

e Ifthe POCL client service/product to whom the customer is making
payment is not supported by the outlet, the customer must be advised of
this fact.

e Ifthe payment amount tendered by the customer is not accepted by the
system because it does not lie within the permitted parameters or required
method of payment for this scheme, the customer must be advised of this
and asked to amend their payment amount or method of payment, if they
wish to continue with the transaction. In the case of magnetic card and bar-
coded payments for which the customer wishes to make a payment above
the maximum limit, the clerk need not advise the customer but can accept
the payment as two or more transactions.

4.1 Automated payment using a magnetic card

The customer is supplied with a magnetic stripe card by the utility or company
to whom the account is payable. The card’s magnetic stripe contains details
of the customer’s account or reference number with the company to whom the
account is payable. The clerk swipes the card through the magnetic card
reader and the system reads and processes the account/customer
information held in the card.

the account is payable. The card’s memory contains details of the customer’s
account or reference number with the company to whom the account is
payable. The clerk inserts the card into the smart card reader and the system
reads and updates the account/customer information held on the card. The
card must be left in the card reader until the system displays a message to
remove it; premature removal could cause corruption of the card. If the
system detects a mismatch with the reference data, the clerk is advised to
contact the Horizon System Helpdesk. If the transaction is abandoned after
the Amount screen has been displayed, a receipt is produced.

The procedure to accept an automated payment from a customer using a
smart card is as follows:

Step 1. Obtain and check the customer’s smart card and payment -

Entering a bar-coded document’s bar-code number manually (contd)

SCENARIO A. 1.2: If the document does not appear to be
valid:

e Advise the customer that the document cannot be accepted.
e This ends the transaction.

Step 5. Continue in accordance with the procedures described in
Section 4.2 Automated payment using a bar-coded document
starting from step 3.

6.3 Re-printing an AP transaction receipt

6.3.1

A customer copy and an office copy receipt are produced automatically by the
system for every committed transaction. However, should there be any
problems with the system-produced receipts (for example, torn receipts or
illegible receipts), you can re-print a receipt as many times as necessary prior
to settling the customer session.

System rules:

e A reprint (copy) receipt for the customer session can be printed provided
that the session has not been settled.

e Since reversal transactions are settled automatically, reversal receipts
cannot be reprinted. (Selection of the reprint facility under these
circumstances would produce a reprint of the session receipt.)

Re-printing an AP receipt: procedure
The procedure to reprint an AP receipt is as follows:

Step 1. From the Desktop, select the Transaction option, the Serve
Customer option, the Functions option, then the Reprint Receipt
option (or press the RECPT key after the second copy of the
receipt has been printed and before the session has been
settled).

(The system displays a pick list showing the AP transactions in the
current customer session.)

Step 2. From the displayed pick list, select the AP transaction for which
you wish to reprint a receipt.
Note: a pick list is displayed because the EPOSS facilities are used
to re-print the APS receipt before the session is settled. EPOSS does
not know automatically what to print (it could be the session receipt or
any APS transactions within the session) and for this reason the
system displays a pick list.

Step 3. Select the Select option.
(The counter printer prints the receipt.)

7.5 Keyboard failure and touch screen failure

For the fallback procedures for keyboard or touch screen failure, see the
CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref.CS/PRO/097].

7.6 PC failure

7.6.1

7.6.2

(‘PC’ refers to the PC itself plus the internal cards and monitor.)

This section deals with the fallback procedures which must be undertaken
when PC failure occurs in a single-counter or a multi-counter office.

If a PC fails in mid-customer session, the system invokes session recovery
procedures on coming back on-line (see Section 8.1 Session recovery
procedure).

System failure occurring after the first receipt has been printed

If the system fails after the first copy of the receipt (customer copy) has been
printed and before the second receipt (post office copy) is printed, a manual
receipt should be produced for the transaction (see Section 7.4.1 Producing
manual receipts in the event of printer failure). The system-printed first copy
of the receipt should be associated with the under copy of the manual receipt
and retained within the office. No further action will be required by the counter
clerk other than the normal recovery procedures described in Section 8.1
Session recovery procedure.

In the event that no manual receipt can be produced (i.e. the customer has
left the office before a manual receipt is produced), no further action will be
required by the counter clerk other than the normal recovery procedures
described in Section 8.1 Session recovery procedure where a magnetic card
or bar-coded document transaction should be recorded as a lost receipt.

PC failure (single-counter office)
PC failure in a single-counter office will affect all AP transactions.

In the event of PC failure in a single-counter office, AP transactions using
magnetic cards may be undertaken manually. Bar-coded document
transactions should be undertaken using Transcash. Following failure
rectification, it will be necessary to recover on the system details of the
magnetic card AP transactions undertaken during the period of failure. To
ensure this is possible, and to satisfy the mandatory requirement of providing
a receipt to the customer, a manual receipt must be produced for the
transaction by following the procedure described in Section 7.4.1.1 Manual
receipt for automated payment using a magnetic card, but in step 3 ignoring
the instruction to use the receipt screen preview and omitting the recording of
‘checksum’ and ‘AP transaction reference number’.

AP transactions using smart cards cannot take place.

7.6.3

Note: Once the failure has been rectified, recovery procedures must be
undertaken as described in Section 8.3 Fallback recovery procedure.

PC failure (multi-counter office)

In the event of a single PC failure in a multi-counter office, business should
be directed to the other counter(s). If, because of pressure of business, this is
not possible, AP transactions using magnetic cards or bar-coded documents
should be carried out manually in accordance with the procedure for PC
failure in a single-counter office described in Section 7.6.2 PC failure (single-
counter office). However, AP transactions using smart cards cannot be
carried out manually and so will have to be performed at another counter.

In the event of all the PCs failing (due to complete loss of power, for
example), AP transactions using magnetic cards or bar-coded documents
transactions will have to be carried out manually. AP transactions using smart
cards cannot take place.

Note: Once the failure has been rectified, recovery procedures must be
undertaken as described in Section 8.3 Fallback recovery procedure.

7.7 Network failure - within the office

If there is a LAN failure and a terminal becomes isolated from the office
network, APS procedures (with the exception of reversals) can be carried out
as normal.

7.8 Network failure - ISDN connection failure

In normal circumstances, committed transactions are transferred via the
network from the counters to the data centre on a regular basis. The
transactions received at the data centre during the day are batched and sent
to the relevant clients. Initially this will take place via the POCL HAPS system
until client migration has completed.

Network-ISDN failure affects AP transactions in that while the link is down,
committed transactions are stored but not transferred to the data centre.
Once the link comes up again, all committed transactions are transferred.

7.9 Site-related power failure

In the event of a site-related power failure, all AP transactions using magnetic
cards and bar-coded documents will have to be carried out manually as
described in Section 7.6.2 PC failure (single-counter office). AP transactions
using smart cards cannot be performed.

8 Recovery
AP recovery procedures fall into three categories:

Session recovery procedure

(For transactions that were performed on the system but had not
completed at the time of a system crash. These are confirmed to the
system from system or manual receipts.)

Disaster recovery procedure

(For transactions that were performed on the system but are not currently
recorded on the system. These are entered onto the system from system
or manual receipts.)

Fallback recovery procedure
(For transactions that were performed manually during a period of failure.
These are entered onto the system from manual receipts.)

Recovery can be entered by two separate routes:

Whenever the system is reloaded then recovery is invoked during the first
logon only. The system is generally reloaded, as a matter of course, at
least once a day to take account of the possible delivery of reference data
overnight. This means that recovery may be invoked every day if this
reload has taken place. If further reloads take place then recovery will be
invoked during the first logon after each of these reloads. If the system
detects that the previous system was not closed down correctly, a
message is output saying that the system has detected that the last
session ended in error.

From the Desktop, the clerk can select the Transactions option then the
AP Recovery option. If the clerk has performed fallback transactions, or
wishes to perform postponed session recovery or is instructed by the
system to perform disaster recovery then the clerk must perform recovery
by this means.

When recovery is entered:

If the system detects incomplete transactions, including postponed
recovery of incomplete transactions, it invokes session recovery (see
Section 8.1 Session recovery procedure).

When all incomplete transactions have been dealt with or if the clerk
chooses to postpone recovery or if none were found, the system decides if
disaster recovery (see Section 8.2 Disaster recovery procedure) should be
invoked. Disaster recovery is only invoked if this is the first logon since
the Desktop was loaded or if it was not possible to perform disaster
recovery due to any of the reasons described in the system rules below.
The clerk is asked whether the Horizon system has been replaced and
they have any receipts for unrecovered transactions performed on this
node after a particular date and time. If this is the case, the clerk is then
given the opportunity to enter these transactions.

e Finally, the system invokes fallback recovery (see Section 8.3 Fallback
recovery procedure) to allow the clerk to input any transactions
undertaken manually during the period of failure.

System rules:
e Transactions are recovered into the current logged-in stock unit.
e Recovery sessions cannot be suspended or transferred.

e Session and fallback recovery can be postponed. Disaster recovery
cannot be postponed.

e  If.an active session is transferred, then recovery is inhibited at logon to
the transferred counter. The next time an APS transaction is attempted,
the system displays a message telling the clerk to perform disaster
recovery by selecting the AP Recovery option [Message APS
MessageDefs:MSG449]. Acknowledgement of this message abandons the
transaction without receipts.

e lf auser is attached to the default stock unit, then session recovery is
inhibited at logon. If the user subsequently attaches to a valid stock unit
and attempts to perform an APS transaction, the system displays the
message described in the previous system rule.

« Clerks can invoke recovery themselves using the AP Recovery option
from the Transactions menu. In this case, recovery is performed exactly as
described earlier (that is, session, disaster, then fallback). The only
difference is that, if disaster recovery has already been performed
(including the clerk saying that there is no disaster recovery to be done),
then disaster recovery is not invoked again in the current load of the
Desktop. As disaster recovery cannot be postponed, this is the usual state
when the clerk invokes recovery. However, where the recovery
conversation has not been invoked during login (that is, in the
circumstances described in the two previous system rules), when the clerk
invokes recovery then the disaster recovery option is offered in the
standard sequence.

e Disaster recovery requires the receipt details to be correct and complete,
checking them against a checksum. Therefore, if a transaction that should
be recovered during disaster recovery has an incorrectly-completed
manual receipt, then the transaction cannot be entered. (If the clerk has
begun entry of the transaction (see Section 8.2 Disaster recovery
procedure), then the entry can be abandoned and the procedure
continued from step 10, by selecting the Previous option.)

e Disaster recovery does not allow the entry of a Water Card transaction
that has lower case characters in the receipt's Ref2 field. The receipt
should therefore be sent to Chesterfield for the payment to be processed -
refer to the Counter Operations Manual.

Business rules:

e Clerks need to ensure that all AP transaction receipts are readily available
should they be required for AP recovery. This will entail keeping them in a
central location and ensuring that they are not locked in an individual till
overnight.

e All lost transactions must be recovered.

e  Ifatransaction that should have been recovered during disaster recovery
could not be entered because it had an incorrectly-completed manual
receipt, then:

e Fora magnetic card or bar-coded document transaction:
The transaction should be entered as a fallback transaction (see
Section 8.3 Fallback recovery procedure).

¢ Fora smart card transaction:
The transaction cannot be entered on the system. The receipt should
therefore be sent to Chesterfield for the payment to be processed —
refer to the Counter Operations Manual.

e  If.atransaction that should have been recovered during disaster recovery
could not be entered because the receipt was temporarily lost, but has
been subsequently found, then:

e The receipt should be checked against the AP Transaction report.

e Ifthe transaction is not present, the receipt should be sent to
Chesterfield for the payment to be processed — refer to the Counter
Operations Manual.

8.1 Session recovery procedure

Session recovery procedures are mandatory procedures that must be
undertaken to capture details of transactions partially recorded on the system
and allocated AP transaction numbers when the system failure occurred. The
procedures must be performed once the node at which the original
transactions were undertaken is available again.

Although session recovery is mandatory, it may be postponed to a more
convenient time. However, it is strongly recommended that session recovery
is performed as soon as possible.

Step 1. Have ready all AP receipts for which recovery has not been
performed on this node.

Step 2. Select the Tick option on the APS Recovery screen [Message
APS MessageDefs:MSG133].

Step 3. The system asks you whether you want to start or postpone
recovery [Message APS MessageDefs:MSG423].

SCENARIO B: To postpone recovery:

e Select the Cross option. The system moves on to disaster recovery (see
Section 8.2 Disaster recovery procedure) unless this has already been
completed in this session in which case the system moves on to fallback
recovery (see Section 8.3 Fallback recovery procedure).

Step 4.

Note: when you wish to recover the transactions, from the Desktop,
select Transactions then the AP Recovery option and proceed to step
4.

The system displays the details of a transaction that did not
complete properly [Message APS MessageDefs:MSG426 (for a
smart card transaction) or APS MessageDefs:MSG427 (for a
magnetic card or bar-coded document transaction)]. In the case
of a magnetic card or bar-coded document transaction, the
system asks you whether or not you have a receipt for this
transaction.

(Note that, if the system crashed early in the session, some details
may not be present.)

Proceed as follows:
SCENARIO A: For a smart card transaction:

e Select the Tick option.

« The system prints a receipt that should be associated with the original
receipt and retained in the drawer.

e Proceed to step 5.

EXCEPTION A.1: If the amounts on the original receipt and the

8.2 Disaster recovery procedure

This procedure is normally performed on the first logon after the Desktop has
been loaded in order to determine if the system needs to recover from a
catastrophic failure that resulted in the loss of important data. If it is
necessary to perform disaster recovery then it must be performed and cannot
be postponed. It is not necessary to have completed any outstanding session
recovery before performing disaster recovery, although it is advisable.

Step 1. The system asks you if the Horizon system has been replaced
and you have any receipts for unrecovered transactions
performed on this node after a particular time [Message APS
MessageDefs:MSG424):

(Note that, if there are no APS transactions in the counter system,
then the date and time given in the message will default to
01/05/1999 00:00.)

Proceed as follows:

SCENARIO A: If you know the Horizon system has been replaced, or
you are not sure:

« Check to see if you have any receipts in the specified range.
SCENARIO A.1: If you have any receipts in the specified range:

8.4 Recovery and stock unit balancing

Session/disaster recovery is always performed on the failed PC. When the
failed PC is returned to service (or replaced), the user is warned that they
must recover potentially outstanding AP transactions as described in Section
8.1 Session recovery procedure and 8.2 Disaster recovery procedure. These
AP transactions will be those performed against the stock unit attached at the
time of the crash. If an attempt is made to balance this stock unit from another
PC, cash discrepancies (overs) are likely to arise against the unrecorded AP
transactions.

Note: as a good housekeeping rule, do not attempt to balance a stock unit
that was attached to a crashed PC before the PC has been crash-recovered.
If balancing is attempted at another PC, the AP receipts should be checked
against the AP Transaction report and if any are found to be missing, the
attempt to balance should be abandoned.

All transactions for all stock units must be entered before the stock units are
balanced and rolled over. If this is not done there will be cash discrepancies
(overs) in the current BP/CAP. If this is allowed to happen, the AP
transactions should be entered in the next BP/CAP causing equivalent cash
discrepancies (shortages) in the next BP/CAP.
