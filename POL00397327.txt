2. Introduction

These are the requirements governing the introduction of the Drop & Go
small business mails solution into the Crown network, and the completion of
the feasibility for a tiered mails account customer proposition.

2.1 Background

The Small Business segment makes in excess of 2 million branch visits per
week to Post Office branches; Small Businesses spend over £500m
annually, generating approx. £100m income.

A challenge which has consistently eluded Post Office is the identification of
these key business customers and their spending habits. This project will
offer these customers a valuable service and faster branch journey, and in
return it will provide us the capability to identify key small business
customers, to track and assess their spending patterns, directly market to
them and more effectively meet their mailing requirements

The customers in question typically they spend up to £5000 per year on mails
which makes them significantly larger than the average domestic customer.
They are very responsive to service level fluctuations and are most likely to
move to competitors if we fail to meet their needs.

Mails Distribution Agreement

A key part of the new distribution agreement with RMG will be around
servicing small business customers. POL has agreed to deliver 2000 small
business hubs whereby mails customers will receive a preferential service
and have access to small business club benefits; the Drop & Go service will
provide the platform to allow us to deliver the wider programme in the coming
years aligned with network transformation.

Drop & Pay is concerned with developing and implementing a service in
Crown Branches where registered small business customers can:

e Download a mails manifest from our website, indicating the number of
items to be posted and the service required

e¢ Come into branch and drop off their mail directly at the Fast Drop
counter (avoiding queuing) and receive a receipt for that number of
items from the counter colleague.

e The colleague can access the customer’s account using a mag-stripe
card, log that a certain number of mails items have been dropped off by
that customer and issue them a receipt.

POL-BSFF-0223997_0003
IT Directorate PSO Process

POL00397327
POL00397327

Requirements Catalogue Document Template

e Ata later time (before the branch cut off) the colleague can again
access the customers’ account, transact the mails items, debit the
customer's pre-loaded account and print out a transaction receipt.

e When the customer next comes in to drop off mails they will be given

the receipt for their pervious transaction.

2.2 Structure

This document will provide the following information;

e Section 3 describes requirements relating to the development

and implementation

e Section 4 covers Acceptance and Authorisation.

e Appendix A provides a glossary of terms and abbreviations.

e Appendix B provides details of assumptions made by the Drop

& Go project

2.3 Purpose and Scope of Document

This document describes requirements that the Drop & Go team have
identified as being necessary for delivery & includes all requirements

known to date.

3.7 Other requirements

It is recommended this additional, optional section is included to
cover more general requirements that do not fit into an

areas requirements should cover but as a prompt, consider if
those listed below have any specific requirements.

Complaint Handling — as BAU

Enquiries—see P&BA requirements

Out of Hours — there will be no out of hours service provision
Network — this service will only be available in crown branches

Methods of Payment — Drop & Go services may be purchased with
cash, credit & debit cards. Cheques accompanied by a cheque
authority card will also be accepted

Error Management — Exceptions processes have been developed for
the following incidents

IT Directorate PSO Process Requirements Catalogue Document Template

o Death of customer

Existing software and systems — APOP, Horizon and Credence are
the required systems to support this service

Strategy — this project is aligned with the Mails strategy

branches to trial with a view to roll out to the rest of the crown network
in Feb 2012

Archiving — the APOP data will be archived after 2 years

Helpdesks — see P&BA requirements. NBSC will support branch

4.2

e Requirements must be fully demonstrated and proven in “live”
implementation
& itis only at this time, requirements will be formally accepted
as being met.

The above list is considered to be a minimum set of acceptance
requirements.

Depending on the project there may be others, either general such
as those above

or specific in which case they should be recorded against a
requirement.

Levels of detail required are down to each change initiative to
manage.

The more details obtained, the more likely it should be that
delivered changes

meet requirements.

Release Authorisation Criteria

Release authorisation criteria should be maintained in separate
documentation and

referred to from this section . A generic approach for release
authorisation will be added

to the standards shortly.
