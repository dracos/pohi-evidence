On the 30" March 2011, accompanied by my colleagu Sarah Juliff I conducted an

Mrs Hutchings contacted the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) at
approximately 8.40 am and advised that an audit would be performed at the branch,
and that it would remain closed until its conclusion. The nominated branches offered
were: Horndean Waterlooville and Leigh Park a notice was placed on display at the
branch detailing this information. I also asked the NBSC to notify the Outlet
Intervention Office that an audit was being performed and that the branch would
remain closed until it’s conclusion.

After entering the office Lynette Hutching said she had not declared the cash and so a
cash declaration was completed by herself.

I printed a balance snapshot to start the audit procedures and the cash figure
varied by £15,635.02. I then produce the evidence to Mrs Hutchings and was
given no explanation and so we proceeded with a full audit of the cash and stock
which produced a shortage in the office of £9743.76 and no admission or
explanation was forthcoming. I then informed Mrs Hutchings that I would be
contacting the contracts advisor Nigel Allen who proceeded to formally suspend
Mrs Hutchings pending further investigation.

Mrs Hutchings was then advised that she should satisfy themselves that the figures of
the audit team were correct. Therefore, we asked Mrs Hutchings if She would do her
own independent count of all the cash on hand again, which She did.

Mrs Hutchings then confirmed that the figures of the audit team were correct.

The decision was made to precautionary suspend Mrs Hutchings at 2B0nm the

assets were secured in the safe and the keys taken by Sarah Julliff (Field Advisor).
The amount of 9743.76 was posted to Late Account,
I advised the NBSC that the branch would be re-opening on @}Aprii2014
