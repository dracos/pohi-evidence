Subject: Horizon Challenge Cases - Process to be adopted

Importance: High

Dear All

As you will already be aware from previous emails, the following SharePoint link should be used where you have a branch
that is reporting either the Horizon system or the ATM as the route cause of discrepancies within branches.

httos://portal.royalmailgroup.com/sites/PostOffice/acat/Lists/Horizon%20%20ATM%20Issues%20Loq/Allitems.aspx

Given the number of Horizon challenge cases we currently have with possibly more to come, and their high profile nature,
it is important that we have a comprehensive record of each case as it is possible that these may be required at some
stage by Second Sight, the forensic accountants appointed by the business to investigate cases requested by MP's.

As a result, the ‘Horizon Challenge Process’ (attached) has been developed which will formalise our approach and ensure
that all cases are dealt with in a consistent way. After a case has come in through one of the various possible routes, the
CA will then follow the process as appropriate from the point where it says ‘Contract Advisor is now the lead.’

Action Required

e For all cases currently on SharePoint, a Case Summary form (attached) needs to be completed
retrospectively and retained by each CA and placed on the EFC. PLEASE NOTE: A summary form is
NOT required for the ATM cases on SharePoint, only the Horizon ones.

As the case progresses, both the Case Summary and SharePoint (Status Update column) must be updated.
The Horizon Issues Log will be circulated weekly, possibly Mondays, by Pat Bursi with any new cases
that have come in during the preceeding week where Horizon is being reported as the route cause of the
discrepancy. These new cases will appear on either of the first two tabs of the spreadsheet (the third tab
is a download from SharePoint) the CA will need to copy and paste any new cases from the first two tabs
onto SharePoint and complete a Case Summary form.

© Once the new case appears on SharePoint, Pat will then remove it from tabs 1 / 2.

POL00087258

With cases that are over 7 years old eg Kings Road, the amount of information recorded on the Case Summary form may
be limited as the records will not now be available. The key point to make here though is that each case, however it
comes into the business eg NBSC, ECT, MP etc. is presented in a consistent way.

I trust the above is self explanatory, but if anyone requires any clarification, please give me a call.
Regards
