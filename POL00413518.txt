Governance and the Code

1. The purpose of corporate governance is to facilitate effective, entrepreneurial and prudent
management that can deliver the long-term success of the company.

2. The first version of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) was produced in 1992 by the
Cadbury Committee. Its paragraph 2.5 is still the classic definition of the context of the Code:

Corporate governance is the system by which companies are directed and controlled Boards of
directors are responsible for the governance of their companies. The shareholders’ role in
governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate
governance structure is in place. The responsibilities of the board include setting the company's
Strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the management of the
business and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship. The board’s actions are subject to laws,
regulations and the shareholders in general meeting.

3. Corporate governance is therefore about what the board of a company does and how it sets the
values of the company, and is to be distinguished from the day to day operational management of
the company by full-time executives.

4. The Code is a guide to a number of key components of effective board practice. It is based on the
underlying principles of all good governance: accountability, transparency, probity and focus on the
sustainable success of an entity over the longer term.

5. The Code has been enduring, but it is not immutable. Its fitness for purpose in a permanently
changing economic and social business environment requires its evaluation at appropriate intervals.

6. The new Code applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2012 and applies to all
companies with a Premium listing of equity shares regardless of whether they are incorporated in the
UK or elsewhere.

Preface

1. The FRC’s review of the implementation of the Code in 2011 reinforced the two principal conclusions
reported in the preface to the 2010 edition. First, that much more attention needed to be paid to
following the spirit of the Code as well as its letter. Secondly, that the impact of shareholders in
monitoring the Code could and should be enhanced by better interaction between the boards of
listed companies and their shareholders. The UK Stewardship Code, which provides guidance on
good practice for investors, should be seen as a companion piece to this Code.

2. Nearly two decades of constructive usage have enhanced the prestige of the Code Indeed, it seems
that there is almost a belief that complying with the Code in itself constitutes good governance. The
Code, however, is of necessity limited to being a guide only in general terms to principles, structure
and processes. It cannot guarantee effective board behaviour because the range of situations in
which it is applicable is much too great for it to attempt to mandate behaviour more specifically than
it does. Boards therefore have a lot of room within the framework of the Code to decide for
themselves how they should act.

3. To follow the spirit of the Code to good effect, boards must think deeply, thoroughly and on a
continuing basis about their overall tasks and the implications of these for the roles of their individual
members. Absolutely key in this endeavour are the leadership of the chairman of a board, the
support given to and by the CEO, and the frankness and openness of mind with which issues are
discussed and tackled by all directors.

4. The challenge should not be underrated. To run a corporate board successfully is extremely
demanding. Constraints on time and knowledge combine with the need to maintain mutual respect
and openness between a cast of strong, able and busy directors dealing with each other across the
different demands of executive and non-executive roles. To achieve good governance requires
continuing and high quality effort.

5. The Code's function should be to help boards discharge their duties in the best interests of their
companies. In recent reviews of the Code, the FRC has focussed on changing the “tone” of the Code
by making limited but significant changes to signal the importance of the general principles which
should guide board behaviours. It is to be hoped that these changes will promote greater clarity and
understanding with regard to the tasks of a board and that communication with shareholders will be
more effective as a result.

6. Chairmen are encouraged to report personally in their annual statements how the principles relating
to the role and effectiveness of the board (in Sections A and B of the Code) have been applied. Not
only will this give investors a clearer picture of the steps taken by boards to operate effectively but
also, by providing fuller context, it may make investors more willing to accept explanations when a
company chooses to explain rather than to comply with one or more provisions. Above all, the
personal reporting on governance by chairmen as the leaders of boards might be a turning point in

POL00413518

attacking the fungus of “boiler-plate” which is so often the preferred and easy option in sensitive
areas but which is dead communication.

7. While in law the company is primarily accountable to its shareholders, and the relationship between
the company and its shareholders is also the main focus of the Code, companies are encouraged to
recognise the contribution made by other providers of capital and to confirm the board's interest in
listening to the views of such providers insofar as these are relevant to the company's overall
approach to governance.

Comply or Explain

1. The “comply or explain” approach is the trademark of corporate governance in the UK. It has been in
operation since the Code’s beginnings and is the foundation of the Code'’s flexibility. It is strongly
supported by both companies and shareholders and has been widely admired and imitated
intemationally.

2. The Code is not a rigid set of rules. It consists of principles (main and supporting) and provisions.
The Listing Rules require companies to apply the Main Principles and report to shareholders on how
they have done so. The principles are the core of the Code and the way in which they are applied
should be the central question for a board as it determines how it is to operate according to the
Code.

3. Itis recognised that an alternative to following a provision may be justified in particular
circumstances if good governance can be achieved by other means. A condition of doing so is that
the reasons for it should be explained clearly and carefully to shareholders’, who may wish to
discuss the position with the company and whose voting intentions may be influenced as a result In
providing an explanation, the company should aim to illustrate how its actual practices are consistent
with the principle to which the particular provision relates, contribute to good governance and
promote delivery of business objectives. It should set out the background, provide a clear rationale
for the action it is taking, and describe any mitigating actions taken to address any additional risk and
maintain conformity with the relevant principle. Where deviation from a particular provision is
intended to be limited in time, the explanation should indicate when the company expects to conform
with the provision.

4. In their responses to explanations, shareholders should pay due regard to companies’ individual
circumstances and bear in mind in particular the size and complexity of the company and the nature
of the risks and challenges it faces. Whilst shareholders have every right to challenge companies’
explanations if they are unconvincing, they should not be evaluated in a mechanistic way and
departures from the Code should not be automatically treated as breaches. Shareholders should be
careful to respond to the statements from companies in a manner that supports the “comply or
explain” process and bearing in mind the purpose of good corporate governance. They should put
their views to the company and both parties should be prepared to discuss the position.

5. Smaller listed companies, in particular those new to listing, may judge that some of the provisions
are disproportionate or less relevant in their case. Some of the provisions do not apply to companies
below the FTSE 350. Such companies may nonetheless consider that it would be appropriate to
adopt the approach in the Code and they are encouraged to do sa Externally managed investment
companies typically have a different board structure which may affect the relevance of particular
provisions; the Association of Investment Companies’ Corporate Governance Code and Guide can
assist them in meeting their obligations under the Code.

POL00413518

Satisfactory engagement between company boards and investors is crucial to the health of the UK's
corporate governance regime. Companies and shareholders both have responsibility for ensuring
that “comply or explain” remains an effective alternative to a rules-based system. There are practical
and administrative obstacles to improved interaction between boards and shareholders. But certainly
there is also scope for an increase in trust which could generate a virtuous upward spiral in attitudes
to the Code and in its constructive use.

POL00413518

The Main Principles of the Code
Section A: Leadership

Every company should be headed by an effective board which is collectively responsible for the long-term
success of the company.

There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the company between the running of the
board and the executive responsibility for the running of the company’s business. No one individual should

role.

As part of their role as members of a unitary board, non-executive directors should constructively challenge
and help develop proposals on strategy.

Section B: Effectiveness

The board and its committees should have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and
knowledge of the company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities
effectively.

There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the
board.

All directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to the company to discharge their responsibilities
effectively.

All directors should receive induction on joining the board and should regularly update and refresh their skills
and knowledge.

The board should be supplied in a timely manner with information in a form and of a quality appropriate b
enable it to discharge its duties.

prospects.

6 The UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012)
POL00413518
POL00413518

The board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in
achieving its strategic objectives. The board should maintain sound risk management and internal control
systems.

The board should establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how they should apply the
corporate reporting, risk management and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate
relationship with the company's auditors.

Section D: Remuneration

Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to
run the company successfully, but a company should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
A significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to
corporate and individual performance.

There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for
fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors. No director should be involved in deciding his or her
own remuneration.

Section E: Relations With Shareholders

There should be a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. The board
as a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place.

The board should use the AGM to communicate with investors and to encourage their participation.

The roles of chairman and chief executive should not be exercised by the same individual. The
division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly established,
set out in writing and agreed by the board.

The Chairman

Main Principle

The chairman is responsible for leadership of the board and ensuring its effectiveness on all
aspects of its role.

Supporting Principle

The chairman is responsible for setting the board's agenda and ensuring that adequate time is
available for discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues. The chairman should also
promote a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of non-executive
directors in particular and ensuring constructive relations between executive and non-executive

POL00413518

A.4: Non-executive Directors
Main Principle

As part of their role as members of a unitary board, non-executive directors should
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy.

Supporting Principles

Non-executive directors should scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals
and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. They should satisfy themselves on the
integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are
robust and defensible. They are responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration of
executive directors and have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary, removing executive
directors, and in succession planning.

Code Provisions

A4.1._ The board should appoint one of the independent non-executive directors to be the senior
independent director to provide a sounding board for the chairman and to serve as an intermediary
for the other directors when necessary. The senior independent director should be available to
shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of chairman, chief
executive or other executive directors has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.

A4.2. The chairman should hold meetings with the non-executive directors without the executives present.
Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors should meet without the
chairman present at least annually to appraise the chairman's performance and on such other
occasions as are deemed appropriate.

A4.3. Where directors have concerns which cannot be resolved about the running of the company or a

Section B: Effectiveness

B.1: The Composition of the Board

Main Principle

The board and its committees should have the appropriate balance of skills, experience,
independence and knowledge of the company to enable them to discharge their respective
duties and responsibilities effectively.

Supporting Principles

The board should be of sufficient size that the requirements of the business can be met and that
changes to the board’s composition and that of its committees can be managed without undue
disruption, and should not be so large as to be unwieldy.

The board should include an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive directors (and,
in particular, independent non-executive directors) such that no individual or small group of
individuals can dominate the board's decision taking.

The value of ensuring that committee membership is refreshed and that undue reliance is not placed

on particular individuals should be taken into account in deciding chairmanship and membership of
committees.

No one other than the committee chairman and members is entitled to be present at a meeting of the
nomination, audit or remuneration committee, but others may attend at the invitation of the
committee.

Code Provisions

B.1.1. The board should identify in the annual report each non-executive director it considers to be
independent’. The board should determine whether the director is independent in character and
judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could
appear to affect, the director's judgement. The board should state its reasons if it determines that a
director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may
appear relevant to its determination, including if the director:

e — has been an employee of the company or group within the last five years;

e _ has, or has had within the last three years, a material business relationship with the
company either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, director or senior employee of a
body that has such a relationship with the company;

5 4.3.1 states that the chairman should, on appointment, meet the independence criteria set out in this provision, but thereafter the

test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the chairman.

Financial Reporting Council 11
POL00413518
POL00413518

e has received or receives additional remuneration from the company apart from a
director's fee, participates in the company's share option or a performance-related pay
scheme, or is a member of the company's pension scheme;

* has close family ties with any of the company's advisers, directors or senior employees;

e holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other directors through involvement
in other companies or bodies;

« represents a significant shareholder; or

e has served on the board for more than nine years from the date of their first election.

B.1.2. Except for smaller companies®, at least half the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise non-
executive directors determined by the board to be independent. A smaller company should have at
least two independent non-executive directors.

B.2: Appointments to the Board
Main Principle

There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new
directors to the board.

Supporting Principles

The search for board candidates should be conducted, and appointments made, on merit, against
objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender.

The board should satisfy itself that plans are in place for orderly succession for appointments to the
board and to senior management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience
within the company and on the board and to ensure progressive refreshing of the board.

Code Provisions

B.2.1. There should be a nomination committee which should lead the process for board appointments and
make recommendations to the board. A majority of members of the nomination committee should be
independent non-executive directors. The chairman or an independent non-executive director should
chair the committee, but the chairman should not chair the nomination committee when it is dealing
with the appointment of a successor to the chairmanship. The nomination committee should make
available its terms of reference, explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the board.

A smaller company is one that is below the FTSE 350 throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting year.

The requirement to make the information available would be met by including the information on a website that is maintained by or
on behalf of the company.

12 The UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012)
POL00413518
POL00413518

B.2.2. The nomination committee should evaluate the balance of skills, experience, independence and
knowledge on the board and, in the light of this evaluation, prepare a description of the role and
capabilities required for a particular appointment.

B.2.3. Non-executive directors should be appointed for specified terms subject to re-election and to
statutory provisions relating to the removal of a director. Any term beyond six years for a non-
executive director should be subject to particularly rigorous review, and should take into account the
need for progressive refreshing of the board.

B.2.4. A separate section of the annual report should describe the work of the nomination committee’,
including the process it has used in relation to board appointments. This section should include a
description of the board's policy on diversity, including gender, any measurable objectives that it has
set for implementing the policy, and progress on achieving the objectives. An explanation should be
given if neither an external search consultancy nor open advertising has been used in the
appointment of a chairman or a non-executive director. Where an external search consultancy has
been used, it should be identified in the annual report and a statement made as to whether it has any
other connection with the company.

B.3: Commitment
Main Principle

All directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to the company to discharge their
responsi

lies effectively.
Code Provisions

B.3.1. For the appointment of a chairman, the nomination committee should prepare a job specification,
including an assessment of the time commitment expected, recognising the need for availability in
the event of crises. A chairman's other significant commitments should be disclosed to the board
before appointment and included in the annual report. Changes to such commitments should be
reported to the board as they arise, and their impact explained in the next annual report.

B.3.2. The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors should be made available for
inspection’. The letter of appointment should set out the expected time commitment. Non-executive
directors should undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. Their
other significant commitments should be disclosed to the board before appointment, with a broad
indication of the time involved and the board should be informed of subsequent changes.

® This provision overlaps with FSA Rule DTR 7.2.7 R (see Schedule B).

® The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors should be made available for inspection by any person at the
company’s registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and dur ing the

responsible to the board for ensuring that board procedures are complied with. Both the appointment
and removal of the company secretary should be a matter for the board as a whole.

Evaluation

Main Principle

The board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance
and that of its committees and individual directors.

Supporting Principles

Evaluation of the board should consider the balance of skills, experience, independence and
knowledge of the company on the board, its diversity, including gender, how the board works
together as a unit, and other factors relevant to its effectiveness.

The chairman should act on the results of the performance evaluation by recognising the strengths
and addressing the weaknesses of the board and, where appropriate, proposing new members be
appointed to the board or seeking the resignation of directors.

Section D: Remuneration

D.1:

The Level and Components of Remuneration

Main Principle

Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the
quality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid paying more
than is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of executive directors’
remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual
performance.

Supporting Principle

The performance-related elements of executive directors’ remuneration should be stretching and
designed to promote the long-term success of the company.

The remuneration committee should judge where to position their company relative to other
companies. But they should use such comparisons with caution, in view of the risk of an upward
ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.

They should also be sensitive to pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group, especially
when determining annual salary increases.

Code Provisions

D.1.1.

2

In designing schemes of performance-related remuneration for executive directors, the remuneration
committee should follow the provisions in Schedule A to this Code.

Where a company releases an executive director to serve as a non-executive director elsewhere, the
remuneration report”’ should include a statement as to whether or not the director will retain such
earnings and, if so, what the remuneration is.

Levels of remuneration for non-executive directors should reflect the time commitment and
responsibilities of the role. Remuneration for non-executive directors should not include share
options or other performance-related elements. If, exceptionally, options are granted, shareholder
approval should be sought in advance and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be
held until at least one year after the non-executive director leaves the board. Holding of share
options could be relevant to the determination of a non-executive director's independence (as set out
in provision B.1.1).

As required for UK incorporated companies under the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)

Regulations 2008.

Financial Reporting Council 21
POL00413518
POL00413518

D.1.4. The remuneration committee should carefully consider what compensation commitments (including
pension contributions and all other elements) their directors’ terms of appointment would entail in the
event of early termination. The aim should be to avoid rewarding poor performance. They should
take a robust line on reducing compensation to reflect departing directors’ obligations to mitigate
loss.

D.1.5. Notice or contract periods should be set at one year or less. If it is necessary to offer longer notice or
contract periods to new directors recruited from outside, such periods should reduce to one year or
less after the initial period.

D.2: Procedure
Main Principle

There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive
remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors. No director
should be involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

Supporting Principles

The remuneration committee should consult the chairman and/or chief executive about their
proposals relating to the remuneration of other executive directors. The remuneration committee
should also be responsible for appointing any consultants in respect of executive director
remuneration. Where executive directors or senior management are involved in advising or
supporting the remuneration committee, care should be taken to recognise and avoid conflicts of
interest.

The chairman of the board should ensure that the company maintains contact as required with its
principal shareholders about remuneration.

Code Provisions

D.2.1. The board should establish a remuneration committee of at least three, or in the case of smaller
companies” two, independent non-executive directors. In addition the company chairman may also
be a member of, but not chair, the committee if he or she was considered independent on
appointment as chairman. The remuneration committee should make available its terms of
reference, explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the board’. Where remuneration
consultants are appointed, they should be identified in the annual report and a statement made as to
whether they have any other connection with the company.

See footnote 6.

® This provision overlaps with FSA Rule DTR 7.2.7 R (see Schedule B).

22 The UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012)
POL00413518
POL00413518

D.2.2. The remuneration committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all
executive directors and the chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments. The
committee should also recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior
management. The definition of ‘senior management for this purpose should be determined by the
board but should normally include the first layer of management below board level

D.2.3. The board itself or, where required by the Articles of Association, the shareholders should determine
the remuneration of the non-executive directors within the limits set in the Articles of Association.
Where permitted by the Articles, the board may however delegate this responsibility to a committee,
which might include the chief executive.

D.2.4. Shareholders should be invited specifically to approve all new long-term incentive schemes (as
defined in the Listing Rules”) and significant changes to existing schemes, save in the
circumstances permitted by the Listing Rules.

Section E: Relations with shareholders

E.1:

Dialogue with Shareholders

Main Principle

There should be a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual understanding of
objectives. The board as a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue
with shareholders takes place”.

Supporting Principles

Whilst recognising that most shareholder contact is with the chief executive and finance director, the
chairman should ensure that all directors are made aware of their major shareholders’ issues and
concerns.

The board should keep in touch with shareholder opinion in whatever ways are most practical and
efficient.

Code Provisions

E.1.1.

The chairman should ensure that the views of shareholders are communicated to the board as a
whole. The chairman should discuss governance and strategy with major shareholders. Non-
executive directors should be offered the opportunity to attend scheduled meetings with major
shareholders and should expect to attend meetings if requested by major shareholders. The senior
independent director should attend sufficient meetings with a range of major shareholders to listen to
their views in order to help develop a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of maja
shareholders.

The board should state in the annual report the steps they have taken to ensure that the members of
the board, and in particular the non-executive directors, develop an understanding of the views of
major shareholders about the company, for example through direct face+o-face contact, analysts’ or
brokers’ briefings and surveys of shareholder opinion.

?5 Nothing in these principles or provisions should be taken to override the general requirements of law to treat shareholders equally in
access to information

24 The UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012)
E.2:

POL00413518

Constructive Use of the AGM

Main Principle

The board should use the AGM to communicate with investors and to encourage their
Participation.

Code Provisions

E.2.1.

E.2.2.

E.2.3.

E.2.4.

At any general meeting, the company should propose a separate resolution on each substantially
separate issue, and should in particular propose a resolution at the AGM relating to the report and
accounts. For each resolution, proxy appointment forms should provide shareholders with the option
to direct their proxy to vote either for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote. The proxy
form and any announcement of the results of a vote should make it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not
a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes for and against
the resolution.

The company should ensure that all valid proxy appointments received for general meetings are
properly recorded and counted. For each resolution, where a vote has been taken on a show of
hands, the company should ensure that the following information is given at the meeting and made
available as soon as reasonably practicable on a website which is maintained by or on behalf of the
company:

«the number of shares in respect of which proxy appointments have been validly made;
« the number of votes for the resolution;
e the number of votes against the resolution; and

e the number of shares in respect of which the vote was directed to be withheld.

The chairman should arrange for the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination
committees to be available to answer questions at the AGM and for all directors to attend.

The company should arrange for the Notice of the AGM and related papers to be sent to
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.

Financial Reporting Council 25
POL00413518
POL00413518

Schedule A: The design of performance-related remuneration for executive
directors

The remuneration committee should consider whether the directors should be eligible for annual bonuses. If
so, performance conditions should be relevant, stretching and designed to promote the long-term success of
the company. Upper limits should be set and disclosed. There may be a case for part payment in shares to
be held for a significant period.

The remuneration committee should consider whether the directors should be eligible for benefits under
long-term incentive schemes. Traditional share option schemes should be weighed against other kinds of
long-term incentive scheme. Executive share options should not be offered at a discount save as permitted
by the relevant provisions of the Listing Rules.

In normal circumstances, shares granted or other forms of deferred remuneration should not vest, and
options should not be exercisable, in less than three years. Directors should be encouraged to hold their
shares for a further period after vesting or exercise, subject to the need to finance any costs of acquisition
and associated tax liabilities.

Any new long-term incentive schemes which are proposed should be approved by shareholders and should
preferably replace any existing schemes or, at least, form part of a well considered overall plan incorporating
existing schemes. The total rewards potentially available should not be excessive.

Payouts or grants under all incentive schemes, including new grants under existing share option schemes,
should be subject to challenging performance criteria reflecting the company's objectives, including non-
financial performance metrics where appropriate. Remuneration incentives should be compatible with risk
policies and systems.

Grants under executive share option and other long-term incentive schemes should normally be phased
rather than awarded in one large block.

Consideration should be given to the use of provisions that permit the company to reclaim variable
components in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.

In general, only basic salary should be pensionable. The remuneration committee should consider the
pension consequences and associated costs to the company of basic salary increases and any other
changes in pensionable remuneration, especially for directors close to retirement.

POL00413518
POL00413518

Schedule B: Disclosure of corporate governance arrangements
Corporate governance disclosure requirements are set out in three places:

«FSA Disclosure and Transparency Rules sub-chapters 7.1 and 7.2 (which set out certain
mandatory disclosures);

e FSA Listing Rules 9.8.6 R, 9.8.7 R, and 9.8.7A R (which includes the ‘comply or explain’
requirement); and

« — The UK Corporate Governance Code (in addition to providing an explanation where they
choose not to comply with a provision, companies must disclose specified information in
order to comply with certain provisions).

These requirements are summarised below. The full text of Disclosure and Transparency Rules 7.1 and 7.2
and Listing Rules 9.8.6 R, 9.8.7 R, 9.8.7A R are contained in the relevant chapters of the FSA Handbook.

The Disclosure and Transparency Rules sub-chapters 7.1 and 7.2 apply to issuers whose securities are
admitted to trading on a regulated market (this includes all issuers with a Premium or Standard listing). The
Listing Rules 9.8.6 R, 9.8.7 R and 9.8.7A R and UK Corporate Governance Code apply to issuers of
Premium listed equity shares only.

There is some overlap between the mandatory disclosures required under the Disclosure and Transparency
Rules and those expected under the UK Corporate Governance Code. Areas of overlap are summarised in
the Appendix to this Schedule. In respect of disclosures relating to the audit committee and the composition
and operation of the board and its committees, compliance with the relevant provisions of the Code will result
in compliance with the relevant Rules.

Disclosure and Transparency Rules

Sub-chapter 7.1 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules concerns audit committees or bodies carrying out
equivalent functions.

DTR 7.1.1 R and 7.1.3 R set out requirements relating to the composition and functions of the committee or
equivalent body:

e  DTR7.1.1 R states than an issuer must have a body which is responsible for performing
the functions set out in DTR 7.1.3 R, and that at least one member of that body must be
independent and at least one member must have competence in accounting and/or
auditing.

« DTR7.1.2 G states that the requirements for independence and competence in
accounting and/or auditing may be satisfied by the same member or by different
members of the relevant body.

° DTR 7.1.3 R states that an issuer must ensure that, as a minimum, the relevant body
must:

Financial Reporting Council 27
POL00413518
POL00413518

1. monitor the financial reporting process;

2. monitor the effectiveness of the issuer's internal control, internal audit where applicable,
and risk management systems;

3. monitor the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts;

4. review and monitor the independence of the statutory auditor, and in particular the
provision of additional services to the issuer.

DTR 7.1.5 R sets out what disclosure is required. Specifically:

e DTR7.1.5 R states that the issuer must make a statement available to the public
disclosing which body carries out the functions required by DTR 7.1.3 R and how itis
composed.

e DTR7.1.6 G states that this can be included in the corporate governance statement
required under sub-chapter DTR 7.2 (see below).

e DTR7.1.7 G states that compliance with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code (as set out in the Appendix to this Schedule) will result in compliance
with DTR 7.1.1 R to 7.1.5 R.

Sub-chapter 7.2 concems corporate governance statements. Issuers are required to produce a corporate
governance statement that must be either included in the directors’ report (DTR 7.2.1 R); or in a separate
report published together with the annual report; or on the issuer's website, in which case there must be a
cross-reference in the directors’ report (DTR 7.2.9 R).

DTR 7.2.2 R requires that the corporate governance statements must contain a reference to the corporate
governance code to which the company is subject (for companies with a Premium listing this is the UK
Corporate Governance Code). DTR 7.2.3 R requires that, to the extent that it departs from that code, the
company must explain which parts of the code it departs from and the reasons for doing so. DTR 7.2.4 G
states that compliance with LR 9.8.6 R (6) (the “comply or explain” rule in relation to the UK Corporate
Governance Code) will also satisfy these requirements.

DTR 7.2.5 R, DTR 7.2.7 R and DTR 7.2.10 R set out certain information that must be disclosed in the
corporate governance statement:

e  DTR7.2.5 R states that the corporate governance statement must contain a description
of the main features of the company’s internal control and risk management systems in
relation to the financial reporting process. DTR 7.2.10 R states that an issuer which is
required to prepare a group directors’ report within the meaning of Section 415(2) of the
Companies Act 2006 must include in that report a description of the main features of the
group's internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process for
preparing consolidated accounts.

e DTR7.2.6R states that the corporate governance statement must contain the
information required by paragraph 13(2)(c), (d), (f), (h) and (i) of Schedule 7 to the Large

28 The UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012)
POL00413518
POL00413518

and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008
(SI 2008/410) where the issuer is subject to the requirements of that paragraph.

e DTR7.2.7 R states that the corporate governance statement must contain a description
of the composition and operation of the issuer's administrative, management and
supervisory bodies and their committees. DTR 7.2.8 G states that compliance with the
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (as set out in the Appendix to
this Schedule) will satisfy these requirements.

Listing Rules

Listing Rules 9.8.6 R (for UK incorporated companies) and 9.8.7 R (for overseas incorporated companies)
state that in the case of a company that has a Premium listing of equity shares, the following items must be
included in its annual report and accounts:
