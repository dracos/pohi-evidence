NOTING PAPERS
The Fujitsu Services Review of Horizon Online (POLB(12)76) was noted.
ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Paula Vennells and the Chairman updated the Board on the meeting with
James Arbuthnot MP and Oliver Letwin MP, taking them through their
constituency cases which, they believed, had challenged the integrity of
the Horizon system. The meeting had been a success and James
Arbuthnot had now agreed to facilitate another meeting with the other
MPs who also had cases in their constituencies. The business had also
agreed to use a forensic accountant to investigate the system and give
further comfort to those concerned about these cases.
