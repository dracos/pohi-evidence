Hi Alice, I hope you are really well - I am on great form, thanks.

Could you manage 9.15am? (Just gives me a bit of time to prep for the weekly exco afterwards.)
If not, fine.

Hi Alice, we thought it would be good to catch up b4 the Board call: do you want to let me know when
would suit? Other than 10-1lam, I can be flexible.

>

> There is nothing you need to know about that can't wait until you get back. So my starter for ten for
our call is brief:

> * Funding/Sue B: latest position and next steps. Sue will circulate an update to the Board tonight,
which should form the basis for the Board discussion.

> * Horizon/SS: no written update to the Board but I suggest I give an oral one. I will update you. There
are a couple of new risks I highlighted to Susan; but in summary I'm pleased with how it is looking.
Susan is also sounding more confident and her update was good.

> * CWU: very brief oral update to Board, to confirm new ‘action short of a strike’ (work to rule) and 2
additional strikes called for Friday and Tuesday either side of Bank Holiday Monday. Chris is setting up
a Industrial Action deep dive for the Board on 10 or 11 Sept., for the Board to discuss in more detail.
Tom is now leading on this - good feedback on his approach. I will explain to you what we propose to
cover.

> + RM Prospectus: the language in the risks section which refers to PO is very negative. We are on the
case - it is being handled through external lawyers and I have asked for a revised draft by Monday. I am
not suggesting we flag this to the Board yet but you need to be in the picture. Susan has picked this up
and insisted inaccuracies are removed and the tone improved. However, as this is the risks section, my
guess is we may still be uncomfortable even with their final draft and so I have already asked Susan to
flag to will that we may want to escalate it to HMG. We will need to brief the Board properly at some
stage but probably best when we have something to send out.

>
> Chris and I have looked at the September Board agenda and will have a good outline of what/how we
propose to cover the agenda, which we can pick up on your return. Lots more .. But no intention of
spoiling your holiday!

> Enjoy the weekend. Paula
