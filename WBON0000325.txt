Amy Prim

ie

Matthew,

Post Office is seeking to quote from its Electronic Documents Questionnaire submitted back in 2017. It is seeking to
rely on the following quote in relation to KELs:

"[t]he KEL only contains the current database entries and is constantly updated and so the current version will not
necessarily reflect the version that was in place at the relevant time. The previous entries / versions of the current
entries are no longer available".

Can you confirm that this is definitely the correct position (i.e. that previous entries are no longer available)? We need
to respond to Freeths by 10am tomorrow, so confirmation ASAP would be appreciated.

Kind regards,

Lucy
