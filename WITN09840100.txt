                                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY



                  FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ALISDAIR JOHN CHARLES CAMERON



            I, ALISDAIR JOHN CHARLES CAMERON, will say as follows...


            INTRODUCTION


             1.   I am an employee of Post Office Limited ("POL"). I have been employed by POL

                   since January 2015 as Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and from 2017-19 as Chief

                   Financial and Operating Officer ("CFOO"). I held the position of Interim Chief

                   Executive ("Interim CEO") from April 2019 to September 2019. During my

                   employment with POL, I have also undertaken other roles and responsibilities at

                   different times, which I set out in my statement. I have been on medical leave

                   since 7 May 2023.


            2.     This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

                   "Inquiry") with the matters set out in its Rule 9 Request to me (the "Request"),

                   dated 14 March 2024

             3.    Except where I indicate to the contrary, the facts and matters contained in this

                   witness statement are within my own knowledge. Where any information is not

                   within my personal knowledge, I have identified the source of my information or

                   the basis for my belief. The facts in this witness statement are true to the best of

                   my knowledge and belief.



            4.     Given the passage of time, I have limited recollection of some topics covered by

                   the Request. Where this is the case, this statement focuses on the content of

                   various documents provided to me by the Inquiry. To the extent that those

                   documents have assisted my recollection, I set out the URN of the relevant

                   document.



            5.     I was assisted in preparing this statement by Bates Wells and Braithwaite LLP,

                   my recognised legal representative in the Inquiry.



            APOLOGY



            6. When I joined POL, the business was confidently communicating that it had

                  found no evidence of faults with the Horizon IT system ("Horizon"), or that

                  convictions of Postmasters had been unsafe. Nor had any convictions been

                  appealed at that time. I am sorry that I accepted that Horizon was working

                  effectively too easily at the time, and for the time that it took us to shift focus from

                  the commercial performance of the business to the experience of Postmasters. It

                  became clear to me in 2019 that Postmasters needed far greater support, and

                  this demanded a culture shift in POL. In 2020 I understood that there had been

                  miscarriages of justice which should never have been allowed to happen, and



                                                         Page 2 of 137

                                                                                                    WI TN09840100

                  which should have been rectified far earlier. I hope that this statement assists the

                  Inquiry in its investigations into these vital matters.



            BACKGROUND



             7_    I have been asked to summarise my career and professional background.



            8.     I started work as a trainee accountant for Binder Hamlyn in September 1987.

                   After qualifying as a Chartered Accountant, I remained in practice until 2002.



            9.     My employer was subject to a change of control on two occasions. As a result, I

                   joined Arthur Andersen, becoming a partner in 1999. 1 became a partner of

                   Deloitte and Touche following another transaction in 2002.


            10. My duties during this period were to take part in, manage and then lead external

                   audits, internal audits, risk management work and transaction support for

                   customers. I also undertook some internal management roles for Arthur

                   Andersen.


            11. Later, in 2002, I left practice, becoming the Head of Internal Audit and Risk

                   Management for Centrica plc. At the time, the Centrica group included the AA,

                   OneTel, Goldfish Bank and energy companies in North America, Europe and the

                   UK, including British Gas.



            12. In 2004, I was appointed Group Financial Controller of Centrica plc, managing

                   the production of the financial results and the external audit.

                                                                                                    WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




            13. In 2006, I was appointed the Finance Director of British Gas Residential Energy.

                   In 2010, I was appointed the Finance Director of the combined British Gas. In

                   2012, I was appointed the Managing Director of British Gas Energy, which

                   provided energy to small and medium sized business customers in the UK. In

                   2013, I was appointed Director of Standards of Conduct for British Gas.


            14. I have held Non-Executive ("NED") positions at the e-learning Foundation

                   (2008-2012), Oxford University Hospitals (2009-2016) and Dover Harbour

                   (2017-2022).



            15. In January 2015, I was appointed CFO of POL, a position I still hold. I had a

                   variety of executive accountabilities in this role (see below).



            Positions held at POL and roles and responsibilities



            16. From 2015 to 2023, my primary accountability as CFO was financial reporting

                   and treasury management. In addition, I was accountable for Procurement and

                   Safety. I also had periods of accountability for Strategy, Cash Logistics ("Supply

                   Chain"), Change, Property, Operations, Management Information and IT. Other

                   than Operations and IT I do not think that these roles had a direct bearing on

                   matters of relevance to the Inquiry but I am, of course, happy to answer

                   questions on this point.


            17. My title changed in January 2017: 1 became CFOO until March 2019. Broadly, I

                   was accountable for the functions that supported interactions with

                   Subpostmasters ("Postmasters"), employees and in some cases third-party

                   product owners ("Clients"). I was not accountable for the commercial and

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




                   contractual relationships with these groups, individual Postmasters or with the

                   National Federation for Subpostmasters ("NFSP")


            18. My executive accountability for IT started in January 2015. It was a role

                   designed to support the Chief Information Officer ("CIO") and enable better

                   liaison with the Board. The Board were aware that I brought no previous

                   experience or expert understanding of IT. The CIO at the time that I joined was

                   Lesley Sewell and her role was to lead the IT function.


            19. Lesley Sewell resigned in 2015 and I brought in an interim CIO, Chris Broe and

                   then a permanent replacement, Rob Houghton, who joined the business in April

                   2016. He was, as planned, promoted to the Group Executive (the "GE") at the

                   end of 2016, which marked the end of my accountability for IT.


            20. In my personal objectives, which I agreed with Paula Vennells (CEO of POL

                   2012 — 2019) for the start of 2015 - 2016, I had no IT objectives. In the second

                   half of 2015 - 2016 and 2016 — 2017, I did have IT objectives. These were

                   focused on the challenges described later in this witness statement: lead team

                   structure; separation from RMG ("Royal Mail Group Ltd"); decisions on the

                   Fujitsu relationship; website stability; and a Back Office project. The working of

                   Horizon was not referred to in my objectives.


            21. From April 2019 I was Interim Chief Executive of POL then reverted to CFO in

                   September 2019 when Nick Read joined as CEO.


            22. Between 2019 and 2023 I had reducing accountabilities, handing over

                   accountability for Operations in 2019 and again in 2020, Management

                   Information in 2021 and Supply Chain in 2022. I took on Internal Audit and Risk

                   Management in 2019. Nick's preferred operating model was to have a separate

                   Operations Director / Retail Director.


            EXECUTIVE AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES



            23. When I joined POL in 2015, the governance structures looked appropriate to me

                   and appeared to be functioning sensibly.



            The relationship with the Shareholder


            24. The Government ("HMG") via the Department for Business and Trade

                   (previously the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, BEIS)

                   ("the Department" or "the Shareholder") has a 100% shareholding in POL. UK

                   Government Investments ("UKGI") oversees this shareholding on behalf of the

                  Department via a designated "Shareholder Representative", who holds a seat

                   on the POL Board and its key Committees.



            25. The most difficult area in POL's governance structure was often the relationship

                   with the Shareholder. There can be an advantage in the alignment and

                   closeness of the working relationship between a Shareholder, Board and

                   Executive team. This seemed to be the case up to 2020 when improving the

                   commercial performance, especially Trading Profit, was a clear priority.



            26. Most major financial decisions are made as part of a broader negotiation

                   between the Department and the Treasury ("HMT"). POL rarely gets to talk

                   directly to HMT officials. Depending on the subject, internal HMG discussions


                                                         Page 6 of 137
                                                                                                     WI TNO9840100
                                                                                                 WI TN09840100

                   are with a variable combination of HMT, the Secretary of State and the relevant

                   Minister, the Minister's policy team, the Permanent Secretary, the Department's

                   Finance team and UKGI. Attempts to open better lines of communication, such

                   as through a formal Quarterly Shareholder Meeting, have had limited success.


            27. In my view, with a seat on the Board and its key Committees, UKGI should have

                   a deep understanding of POL as a business, backed up by commercial

                   experience. It should be vital in explaining the commercial business to the

                  Department and HMT and communicating the Department's needs to POL. In

                   my experience this has not worked effectively.



            The Board and its Committees



             The Board



            28. I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Post Office Limited (the

                   "Board") and of the GE from January 2015 until the present day, although I

                   have been on medical leave since 7 May 2023.



            29. The Board was collectively responsible for setting POL's primary business

                   objectives, establishing a proper governance framework and ensuring resources

                   and leadership to achieve its stated objectives, as set out in the POL governing

                   Board Terms of Reference and Schedule of Matters Reserved, 26 June 2015

                   (POL00362178) and as summarised in The POL Governance Induction Pack 14

                   April 2018 (POL00362224). POL must comply with the Companies Act and its

                   Articles of Association.

                                                                                                  WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




             30. The Terms of Reference and the Articles of Association changed from time to

                   time but not significantly.


             31. The Board was led by the Chairman (Tim Parker between 2015 and 2022) and

                   included all of the NEDs, including the Shareholder Representative from UKGI,

                   together with the CEO and the CFO. There was therefore a significant NED

                   majority.



             32. The Board typically had 7-8 standard meetings a year plus a 2-day Strategy

                   away day. Extraordinary or Additional meetings were convened where

                   appropriate, mostly in 2020-2022, as the Board managed POL's response to the

                  Postmaster Group Litigation ("GLO") and previous criminal convictions.

                  Decisions could also be made by correspondence.



             33. Overall Board members were focused on the commercial issues faced by the

                   business, which was typically their background.


             34. The introduction of the Postmaster Representative Directors was welcome and

                   important, although it is a difficult role for the individuals: their unique

                   perspectives are offered privately, and they generally need to accept collective

                   decisions.



             35. The Board and its Committees have, especially since 2019, committed very

                   substantial amounts of time to issues associated with the matters relevant for

                   the Inquiry. However, the bulk of this time has focused on managing the legal

                   and compensation processes. Much less time has been spent on ensuring that

                   Horizon and the processes around it are operating effectively.

             36. Through much of my tenure, the Board was chaired by Tim Parker. Tim was an

                   excellent commercial Chairman. He is extremely astute, as his business record

                   demonstrates, he is instinctively supportive without ever being unable to

                   challenge and he gave the Executive team more confidence to focus on

                   commercial issues. In my view, his perspective on the Litigation felt less

                   confident and tended to follow the legal advice.



             37. During 2016 — 2017, I understood that Tim commissioned a Chairman's Review,

                   at the request of Baroness Neville-Rolfe, to investigate matters related to

                  Postmaster complaints and the mediation scheme. I do not know how this work

                   was reported, or how it was transitioned from the Chairman's review into

                   preparation for the GLO. The work was legally privileged, and my recollection is

                   that it was not shared, even with the Board. However, I was later included in the

                   work on the Suspense Accounts (see from paragraph 259). On reflection, the

                   Board should have insisted on seeing and understanding this work as part of

                   our preparation for the GLO.



             Sparrow Sub-Committee



             38. The responsibility for management of the initial complaint review and mediation

                   scheme regarding complaints concerning Horizon reliability (codenamed

                   "Sparrow"), the GLO, and the criminal convictions of Postmasters fell to

                   different committees during different periods of time.



             39. The Sparrow Sub-Committee was attended by the Chairman, CEO, NEDs and

                   members of the Legal and Communications teams. I understood the purpose of

                   the Sparrow Sub-Committee was to review the progress of the Mediation

                   Scheme. I attended the last meeting of the Sparrow Sub-Committee in February

                   2015 and have seen the papers for the previous meeting in January 2015. I

                   discuss these meetings later in my statement (see from paragraph 150).


            40. Shortly after I joined, the Sparrow Sub-Committee was disbanded and not

                   directly replaced. I do not recall the reasons, although the Mediation Scheme

                   was losing support from third parties and internally in POL around that time.


             GLO Sub-Committee and subsequent committees


            41. The Postmaster Litigation Advisory Board Sub-Committee, sometimes also

                   referred to as the Board GLO Sub-Committee, also dealt with matters within the

                   Inquiry's scope. I will refer to it as the "GLO Sub-Committee" in my statement.


            42. The GLO Sub-Committee was formed in 2018, met four times between March

                   and September 2018 and continued until its final meeting on 3 March 2020. It

                   was chaired by the Chairman of POL. Its purpose was to receive legal advice on

                  POL's defence of the GLO, with key decisions referred for final approval by the

                   Board.


            43. Its membership comprised the CEO (Paula Vennells, then Nick Read), the

                   Shareholder Representative, the Senior Independent Director and myself, with

                   the General Counsel (Jane MacLeod) in attendance in her role as Company

                   Secretary until April 2019.


            44. With hindsight, the GLO Sub-Committee struggled in the early period of meeting

                   from lack of clear papers and issues such as minutes arriving late and


                                                        Page 10 of 137
                                                                                                   WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




                   sporadically. One particular issue faced by the GLO Sub-Committee was in

                   June 2019, when it was discovered that the Board had not been informed of the

                   Claimant's schedules of information to support claim values (Draft Meeting

                   Minutes of the Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee of POL 20 June 2019,

                  POL00006752).



            45. The GLO Sub-Committee was superseded by the Criminal Cases Review

                   Commission ("CCRC") meetings which were convened many times between

                   April 2020 and August 2021. My recollection is that this was not a committee but

                   a series of meetings of the Board, chaired by the Chairman, with a specific

                   focus. The meetings evolved to deal with various matters such as the appeals

                   against the criminal convictions of Postmasters, compensation schemes and

                   decisions of the Board regarding POL's duties as former prosecutor of

                  Postmasters in earlier criminal cases.



            46. This work was continued from August 2021 by the Historical Remediation

                   Committee ("HRC") which was chaired by the then Senior Independent Director

                   (Ben Tidswell) and whose membership comprised two other NEDs including the

                   Shareholder Representative.



            47. I could see the papers and had the right to attend HRC meetings. I only did so

                   when I had a specific concern regarding the high-level legal or financial

                   approaches, picked up from GE briefings or reading the papers.

            Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee


            48. Throughout my time at POL, I attended but was not a member of the Board's

                   Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee ("ARC"). The ARC was chaired by and

                   made up of NEDs, with a preference that the Chair and one other member

                   would have financial experience. The number of meetings varied according to

                   need, for example, how many discussions were required to finalise the Annual

                   Report & Accounts ("ARA").


            49. The focus of the ARC was the financial and risk management of POL. It would

                   appoint and receive plans and reports from the external auditors (EY and later

                  PWC), meeting them without management on a regular basis. It would review

                   the ARA and discuss adjustments and disclosures with the business and the

                   external auditors and make recommendations to the Board. It would agree the

                   Internal Audit plan which was updated regularly (see for example Post Office,

                   Minutes of a meeting of the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee on 25

                   March 2015 POL00026719), meet the head of internal audit without

                   management on a regular basis, review internal audit reports and assess the

                   completeness of actions.


            50. The ARC reviewed compliance with laws and regulations and POL's approach

                 more generally, for example considering the 3 lines of defence identified by the

                 Risk and Compliance Executive committee ('RCC") at a meeting on 1 May 2015

                 (Risk and Compliance committee meeting 1 May 2015, POL00227870).


            51. The ARC would also approve policies, assess the financial reporting controls

                   with a focus on maintaining and testing that those controls were operational and

                                                        Page 12 of 137

                   valid (see, for example, the Audit Risk and Compliance Committee on 10

                   November 2015, POL00110251), and consider specific issues of concern.



            52. The ARC had a relationship with the Department's Audit Committee.



            53. The ARC saw minutes and would receive regular reports from the RCC (full

                   detail on this committee below from paragraph 66) and updated the Board after

                   each meeting.


            54. Due to the size of POL as a business and the various areas of potential risk, the

                   ARC also considered issues such as IT, Cyber-Security, Disaster Recovery,

                   Business Continuity Planning and the Whistle-blowing processes. These are set

                   out in detail in the Agendas and Minutes, but I do not directly reference them

                   here as they are general background to the issues to be considered by the

                   Inquiry.



            55. Overall, I found that much of the work completed by the ARC and RCC was

                   sensible and challenged key issues. Carla Stent, who was the Chair for much of

                   this period, was diligent, hardworking, patient and considered.



            56. However, with hindsight I feel that the ARC did not tackle the evidence

                   underpinning the performance of Horizon nor meaningfully consider the

                   potential outcomes for Postmasters if there were issues with shortfalls and

                   balancing. Postmasters are rarely mentioned in the documents and are treated

                   as a third-party rather than an integral part of the business.




                                                        Page 13 of 137
                                                                                                      WI TN09840100
                                                                                                    WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




            57. Where issues were reviewed it was therefore through the lens of POL's own

                   financial outcomes. For example, in the minutes from a meeting on 20 May

                   2015, the ARC focused on Postmaster debts and whether there was sufficient

                   narrative on the costs of Sparrow, rather than whether these matters were being

                   resolved satisfactorily (Post Office Limited Audit, Risk and Compliance

                   Committee minutes of 20 May 2015, POL00021433).



            58. During 2016 this pattern continues in the documented minutes from meetings,

                   with limited or no focus on Horizon or Postmasters (POL Audit, Risk and

                   Compliance Agenda 17 March 2016 POL00240662) and (Post Office Audit Risk

                   and Compliance Agenda 19 May 2016, POL00103188).



            59. It may have been the view of the ARC that issues of Horizon and Postmasters

                   were being managed through the Chairman's Review and the preparation for

                   the GLO. However, even if that was the case, the issues relevant to the Inquiry's

                   terms of reference should have been embedded in the internal audit, risk

                   management and ARC agendas.



            Pensions Committee



            60. In 2015, I attended Pensions Committee meetings which met to discuss the

                   future of the Pension Schemes and meetings of the Financial Services

                   Committee ("FSC"), both chaired by a NED. The purpose of the FSC was to

                   provide oversight into the performance of our financial services businesses. I

                   think that both were dissolved in September 2015, with most of their duties

                   transferred to the ARC or to Post Office Management Services Limited

                   ("POMS").

            Post Office Management Services Limited


            61. I was appointed to the Board of POMS on 31 March 2015 after being approved

                   by the Financial Conduct Authority. POMs was the entity set up to manage the

                   Insurance business, including its proposed acquisition of the Bank of Ireland's

                   share in the joint venture that was managing Insurance up to that point.

                   Subsequently, independent NEDs were appointed and I resigned from the

                  POMS Board on 30 October 2015.


            The Group Executive and its Committees


            62. The Group Executive ("GE") is the most senior leadership team accountable to

                   the Board for the day-to-day operations of POL, and for delivering performance

                   measures against corporate objectives agreed with the Shareholder, as set out

                   in the GE Terms of Reference 19 February 2015 (Terms of Reference for POL

                   Group Executive, POL00362165). The GE was chaired by the CEO and

                   comprised her/his senior team. The GE could also be referred to as the

                   Executive Committee or ExCo. Most of the executives recruited into the GE had

                   a consistently commercial background.



            63. My recollection is that around 2015 or 2016, delegated authorities were

                   changed. The GE team could only approve matters up to a value of £5 million, a

                   relatively small amount given that contracts might be multi-year, whereas

                   previously it had been £20 million. Delegated authorities were invested in

                   individuals not committees, so the CEO held £5 million, the CFO £4 million,

                   other GE members £2m and so on. As a result, any Commercial or Retail

                   decision of more than £2 million had to be made by the CEO. This meant that

                                                        Page 15 of 137

                   the GE was not formally delegated to and tended to discuss what the CEO

                   determined that it should.


            64. The structure of GE meetings varied over time. Typically, there would be a

                   monthly decision-making meeting. Specific meetings were sometimes

                   scheduled to review performance or strategy. From 2019, the GE also had

                   tactical meetings that took place most Mondays to support the CEO's

                   understanding of what was happening in the business.



            65. The GE agendas focused on commercial matters and delivering the IT agenda,

                   with verbal updates on Sparrow in 2015 and later the GLO.


                  Risk and Compliance Committee of the GE



            66. The Risk & Compliance Committee ("RCC") of the GE met 5-6 times a year. It

                   was chaired by the General Counsel until March 2019 and then by myself in my

                   role as CFO. I was a member throughout. It was typically attended by senior

                   colleagues from across the business, the Financial Controller, the Head of

                   Internal Audit, the Head of Risk Management and the Head of Compliance.



            67. The RCC's purpose was the Executive assessment of audit, control and

                   compliance issues and performance. Unlike the ARC, it did not focus on the

                   external audit or the approval of the Annual Report & Accounts. Typically, it

                   operated ahead of ARC meetings to ensure that issues flagged to ARC had

                   already received Executive attention.

            68. POL's governance over operational performance varied over time. In 2019-

                   2020, Operations was a formal Committee of the GE. At other times

                   performance was managed by individual Executives, including myself, Dan

                   Zinner and Martin Roberts.



            69. Operations responsibilities included Support Services to provide effective back-

                   office support to the POL branch network ("the Network") and central functions

                   to enable Postmasters to run Post Offices as successfully as possible. There

                   was a consolidated site at Chesterfield for Support Services which included

                   customer helpline staff and Branch & Customer support teams as set out in the

                   GE Agenda Monthly Update on 16 May 2016 (Group Executive Agenda Post

                   Office re: Monthly Update (Report P12 Flash Results to GE) by lead Chris Broe

                   /Angela Van Den Bogerd, Radha Davies, Kevin 16 May 2016, POL00154004).



            70. The formal Operations Committee met 6 times in 2019-2020, focusing on the

                   management — quality, service and cost — of treasury, cash, costs, IT, Network

                   and Postmaster support, loss prevention and security.


            Improvement Delivery Group


            71. In February 2021, a GE Sub-Committee called the Improvement Delivery Group

                   was formed, chaired by Dan Zinner, to ensure POL was delivering improvement

                   actions resulting from the GLO.

            Reflections on Governance


            72. I have commented on the various governance and leadership structures of POL

                   at different times during my employment. By March 2023, the General Counsel

                   wanted to appoint an independent third party to review POL's Governance as

                   part of our work for the Inquiry.



            73. My reservation in starting this work immediately was that, in my opinion, our

                   governance was flawed, and it might be better to first try and fix key issues.


            74. Nick Read asked myself, the General Counsel and the Strategy Director to

                   share our views on the key issues by email, which we did between 23-26 March

                   2023 (Email RE: The robustness of our governance 26 March 2023

                  POL00423699).



            75. My response set out my concerns relating to the Board, the lack of clear

                   oversight of the Retail directorate, the absence of governance over the Horizon

                   replacement, the lack of work being undertaken on how the end-to-end

                   processes to manage the financial relationship with Postmasters would work

                   after Horizon, and the lack of executive engagement and ownership of the

                   agenda of the HRC.



            76. A key lesson from Horizon and the Postmaster remediation activity was that

                   `Horizon' was not simply the operation of the software but the end-to-end

                   processes that managed the relationship with Postmasters, needing better data,

                   more transparency and clear, agreed processes and outcomes. No one was yet

                   working on how to design this.

                                                                                                  WI TN09840100

            77. Colleagues did not dispute my views, rather suggesting their own priorities and

                   additional topics. Nick indicated that his focus was the quality of his team and

                   that decision-making should be better distributed across the business.



            78. When I became ill in May 2023, the governance was therefore, in my view, less

                   effective.


            Chief Financial Officer Role in 2015



            79. From 2015-2018, Paula Vennells replaced a significant part of the Executive

                   team that she had formed when the business became independent. Jane

                   MacLeod (General Counsel) and I joined in early 2015, following lengthy

                   recruitment processes which in my case had to be signed off by the Department

                   and the Treasury.



            80. I note Paula's explanation in the CEO's Report January 2015 (CEO's Report

                   January 2015 - POL00219395) that the GE would now be operating more

                   strategically. At the time she distinguished between the GE which met monthly

                   to consider strategic issues and an Executive team meeting, focused on

                   performance, which also included the Chief of Staff, the CIO, the Chief

                   Marketing Officer and the Communications Director.



            81. My understanding at the time of my appointment was that Paula wanted a CFO

                   who would provide her with support in improving the business.


            82. I was enormously excited to join POL. I wanted to work for a company that

                   mattered, and Post Offices mattered enormously then as they do now. I wanted


                                                        Page 19 of 137

                                                                                                 WI TN09840100

                   to learn, to add value and to work with a team that had a real sense of urgency

                   to improve the long-term sustainability of Post Offices.



            83. It became clear to me after joining that POL faced a number of potential

                   existential threats from the age and weakness of its IT, from its financial

                   arrangements (including commercial challenges) and in protecting cash (see

                   further from paragraph 92).



            84. The core role of any CFO is to make sure the numbers are right. I understood

                   that my most important value-add beyond that was to help improve the

                   commercial performance of the business.



            85. My first Finance Director roles had been in British Gas from 2006-2012 where I

                   had been a part of a team that had improved the profitability of the businesses

                   while also improving customer service and reducing customer losses. This

                   required some material cost reductions as one part of a wider set of changes.

                   Cost was an important element but only one element of that transformation.



            86. As far as I can recall, when I was recruited to POL my understanding was that

                  POL had some similar needs to British Gas. The commercial performance had

                   to improve and reducing costs was an important element of that, but not the

                   only element. I recall that there was already an existing cross-POL cost

                   reduction programme underway when I joined, although it did not then report to

                   the CFO.


            87. In terms of my broader role, in 2015, I was also asked to take on executive

                   accountability for IT and for Supply Chain. I explained that I had no IT

                   experience or expertise but was assured that the CIO would provide that. My

                   role was to help manage the Board relationship and the non-technical side of

                   the CIO's role. This included support with implementing an IT strategy to

                   transition the business away from disparate legacy IT systems (CEO Report

                   January 2015 POL00219395).


            FINANCIAL SITUATION AT POL


            88. The financial situation at POL, its operational drivers and the evolving rules it

                   has to follow have had and continue to have a profound impact on the matters

                   being investigated by the Inquiry.


            Overview

            89. I described the financial situation of POL as a newly independent business in

                   the NFSP Conference — key note speech Monday 15 April 2019 1lam-11.45

                   (POL00270665) as follows: "The business we inherited was failing and

                   completely dependent on getting huge amounts of Government support every

                  year - £400 million in our first year of independence alone. We were losing £115

                  million a year from our trading, the IT estate was large, expensive to run, old,

                  insecure, vulnerable — and still inside Royal Mail. Our owned shops were deeply

                  loss making and many of our agency outlets couldn't support the people who

                  ran them and worked in them. Many had opening hours that were 9 - 5 Monday

                   to Friday which was wrong for customers. Our culture within POL was too often

                   that of a victim: everything was worse than it used to be, it was all someone

                   else's fault and nothing could be done".

            90. During the keynote speech, I also explained that "until recently our accounts

                   showed that if we bought an asset — a computer or property.... We had to write

                  it off the day we bought it. Because our financial future was considered so

                  insecure, no one could reasonably assume we would still exist in a few years'

                   time" (POL00270665).


            91. Although losses were reducing by 2015, the fundamental situation was the

                   same. Our task was to use HMG money to improve the business. An

                   independent Post Office should maintain a national network of Post Offices. By

                   improving its performance, it should create enough profit from trading that it

                   could pay for its maintenance and change programmes. This would be

                   "commercial sustainability", enabling reducing financial support from HMG.



            92. From 2015, POL continued to face a number of existential threats, the outcome

                   of which would determine the future of Post Offices. These drove management

                   attention and focus in three key areas:



                       •   IT. While the systems were considered to be operating effectively, they

                           were also old, vulnerable, expensive to run and hard to change. IT

                           management had to be separated from RMG through new third-party

                           arrangements.



                       •   Financial arrangements. Significant HMG funding would continue to be

                           needed to keep Post Offices operating and delivering the social purpose.

                           Retaining support was dependent on funding being reduced over time:

                           POL had to improve its commercial performance.

                       •   Protecting cash. A significant amount of POL's business is conducted in

                           cash, which has increasingly become a product in its own right. Ensuring

                           that cash was used or recoverable was essential to POL's business

                           model.



            IT



            93. The IT landscape was a critical element of and threat to POL's financial position

                   and survival following independence.


            94. By the time I joined in 2015, the POL Board had concluded that its IT was old,

                   under-invested and vulnerable. POL's IT had always been provided by RMG but

                   following independence, new, separate third party support structures had to be

                   put in place by March 2016.



            95. There were a number of concerns regarding Horizon, the "Front Office" IT

                   system. It was dependent on physical data centres which were old and needed

                   continuous investment. It was time-consuming and expensive to change. The

                   contract with the system's provider, Fujitsu, was very expensive. It was slow and

                   expensive to extract data from it. At the same time, it was still understood to be

                   operating effectively as set out in paragraph 146 below.



            96.    Recognising the vulnerabilities and the high costs of service, the Board had

                   launched a series of material, competitive IT tenders, splitting the estate into

                   Equipment, Networks, Back Office, an Integrator role and Front Office. These

                   tenders were largely complete when I joined. Failing to deliver these IT system

                   changes threatened POL's ability to trade and were my areas of IT focus, as the

                   Executive accountable for IT, in 2015 and 2016. Most of the contracts landed

                   successfully, although the integrator role was later insourced. The separation

                   from RMG was managed, just in time.



            97. In 2015, the Equipment contract was won by Computacentre, the Network by

                   Verizon, the Back Office systems by Accenture and the integrator role by ATOS.



            98. POL appeared to have assumed that Fujitsu would win the Front Office contract

                   as only Fujitsu knew how Horizon worked, it owned the intellectual property and

                   Fujitsu owned and ran the data centres that supported it. However, Fujitsu

                   withdrew from the tender, apparently on the grounds that they did not expect to

            99. IBM won the Front Office award in 2015 and was contracted to create a more

                   modern version of Horizon, independent of Fujitsu. However, we had concerns

                   about the risks of Fujitsu's exit which were discussed in the Board Meeting on

                   28 January 2015 (Meeting minutes: minutes of Board meeting held on 28th

                   January 2015, POL00021531). During this meeting the Board sought

                   independent assurance of the new Front Office system's integrity and security.



            100. The CIO and I identified early into agreeing the new Front Office contract with

                   IBM that we could not confidently expect to complete the re-build of a Horizon

                   equivalent with a new supplier by the time the Fujitsu contract ended in March

                   2017.



            101. Michael Keegan from Fujitsu had also been issuing warnings over our ability to

                   get the work done in time for Fujitsu's planned exit, and it was vital that POL

                   protected the continuity of operational service in the event that the new Front

                   Office services were not ready in time. I therefore led the arrangements to

                   secure an extension to the Fujitsu contract and between March and May 2015, I

                   corresponded with Michael to agree a 1 year extension on the IT contract and 3

                   years on Telco. I acknowledged in this correspondence that we were in

                   agreement with Fujitsu that we had no other practical alternatives. (Email from

                   Alisdair Cameron to Michael Keegan and cc'd Steve Clayton and Ruth Phillips

                   re: RE: Fujitsu and POL 15 May 2015, FUJ00175204).


            102. On 20 May 2015, Michael Keegan was provided with a briefing paper before

                   meeting me (Briefing for Meeting —Alisdair Cameron (Chief Financial Officer at

                  Post Office) 20/05/15 V1.0 — By: Mark Phillips, FUJO0175206). I had requested

                   that POL and Fujitsu work on the IT and Telco extension agreements together.

                   My recollection is that I did this because our view was that Fujitsu were more

                   willing to extend the Telco agreement, which is supported by the relative amount

                   of detail in this paper.



            103. On 21 May 2015 during a Board meeting, when the new contract with IBM for

                   Front Office was agreed, we recommended that the Fujitsu contract be

                   extended by 1 year to ensure operational continuity (Memorandum for POL

                   Board from Lesley Sewell, Kevin Gilliland and Alisdair Cameron — Front Office

                  POL00027278). However, the Board did not agree to the extension due to cost

                   concerns and asked the Front Office steering group to explore options to reduce

                   the capital investment.

            104. It was also noted in a Memorandum for the Board on 29 June 2015, which

                   recommended an extension to the Fujitsu contract to ensure continuity of

                   service, that when the new IBM software was rolled out, any suggestion that

                   branch accounting was not right would delay the implementation of the new

                   system (Memorandum for the Board of Post Office Limited from Alisdair

                   Cameron — Fujitsu Extension Option by Al Cameron 29 June 2015,

                  POL00027309).



            105. During a Board meeting on 7 July 2015, the Board was still reluctant to support

                   the proposed extension to the Fujitsu contract, not least because the cost of the

                   works to be done in the data centres (which housed Fujitsu's software) to

                   ensure they could be maintained until March 2018 would be significant (POL

                   meeting minutes RE Fujitsu contract extension with handwritten annotations 2

                   July 2015, POL00027239).



            106. However, continuity of service in branches was POL's greatest concern and a

                   plan that assumed (a) that a major IT programme would complete on time and

                   (b) that service could be maintained without up-front investment was considered

                   to be an unacceptable level of risk. The Board therefore resolved to extend

                   Fujitsu's contract as a contingency against delays in implementing the new IBM

                   contract.



            Scrutiny of Horizon


            107. Rather than any particular scrutiny of Horizon, in my first few weeks at POL the

                   Board received updates on Sparrow, branch improvements and there was

                   discussion of the response to queries by forensic accountants Second Sight

                   Support Services Limited ("Second Sight") (see further from paragraph 156).

                   The engagement of the CCRC in respect of the past prosecutions and

                   convictions of Postmasters was also a topic of discussion. These areas are set

                   out in more detail in the minutes from those meetings on 28 January 2015

                   (Meeting minutes Board meeting 28 January 2015, POL00021531) and in the

                   agenda for the meeting on 12 February 2015 (Post Office Ltd Group Executive

                   Agenda, meeting to be held on 12th February 2015, POL00220849).



            108. As set out in the POL GE Agenda for the meeting on 12 February 2015

                   (POL00220849), the branch improvements paper and Second Sight responses

                   paper were reassuring, and shortfalls were concluded to be the result of

                  Postmaster error. Horizon was considered to be robust, and there was no

                   reason to question the convictions of Postmasters. However, with hindsight, it is

                   deeply uncomfortable to see the ease with which Postmasters were found to be

                   at fault when issues arose.



            109. In the Post Office Limited — Post Office Board Agenda dated 25 March 2019

                   (POL00103479), there is a reference to "Privileged Reading Room materials.

                  Draft Deloitte report on Horizon (January 2018)" and "Summary of previous

                  reviews." I do not recall seeing these documents or these references to them,

                   which may have been prepared for the Chairman. I describe my involvement

                   with Deloitte's work from paragraph 259.



            110. I continued to accept the premise that Horizon was fundamentally robust both

                   because experienced Postmasters had expressed that view to me and because

                  I did not see how, given the number of transactions flowing through the system,


                                                        Page 27 of 137

                                                                                                    WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




                   systemic problems would not be operationally and financially overwhelming to

                   the business. At the time I only interpreted Horizon to mean the software, and

                  POL did not have a broader consideration of the processing and data issues

                   which could leave a Postmaster with unexplained shortfalls.



            111. With hindsight I would now conclude that insufficient scrutiny of Horizon was

                   undertaken before finding Postmasters to be at fault for unresolved shortfalls. I

                   also acknowledge that even as we sought to answer questions on the safe

                   working of Horizon as it operated at that point, this does not mean it operated

                   effectively in earlier periods. I also question the conclusion that Postmaster

                   training was fundamentally sound. In 2017, when I was more involved in

                   Operations, I attended a 2 day training course for new Postmasters and did not

                   consider it to be a strong basis to support Postmasters. I later chased for

                   improvements as a result of this.


            Financial Arrangements



            112. POL is supported financially by HMG which provides: a borrowing facility to fund

                   the cash held by Post Offices; Cash backed support through the Bank of

                   England's Note Circulation Scheme; Investment Funding for material projects

                   like Network Transformation and a broader change programme of multiple

                   investments. HMG also provides Network Subsidy Payments to enable POL to

                   retain unprofitable branches that were necessary to the social purpose.



            113. The social purpose is captured in two critical metrics. The first is that while

                   individual Post Offices will open and close over time, there should always be at



                                                        Page 28 of 137
                                                                                                      WI TNO9840100
                                                                                                  WI TN09840100

                   least 11,500 UK locations open. The definition of a Post Office location has

                   changed over time.


            114. Secondly, locations must be distributed across the UK and cannot be focused

                   solely on high population areas. This is calculated according to a formula set by

                   HMG, encompassing a number of measures.


            115. POL cannot borrow from anyone other than HMG without specific permission,

                   except for standard commercial undertakings such as leases.



            116. The rules and definitions governing these agreements could and did change

                   over time, often at the point at which new Funding agreements were put in

                   place. The focus in 2015 and 2016 was to ensure that I and the Board properly

                   understood the facilities and their rules and that there were processes in place

                   to oversee them. The committed facilities were and remain critically important to

                  POL's annual assessment of whether it is a Going Concern.


            117. Government support was expected to reduce over time as POL's commercial

                   performance improved. This was my core focus after ensuring that the financial

                   reporting was becoming more robust. The Board decided to focus on our

                   Trading Profit or EBITDAS. This focused the Executive on its own performance

                   and could be derived from the audited ARA, making it less subjective.



            118. Commercial improvement was driven in three areas: gross margin; Postmaster

                   remuneration and POL's own costs.




                                                        Page 29 of 137

                                                                                                  WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




            119. Improvements in gross margin such as re-negotiating contracts with Clients

                   were off-set by digital competition and the decline in Government services.


            120. Postmaster remuneration is accounted for as a cost, POL's largest cost. The

                   strategy was to reduce fixed pay elements, focusing on variable remuneration

                   that also supported POL's income.


            121. When I joined, POL was significantly missing the revenue targets in its original 3

                   Year Plan. The resulting shortfall in gross margin was substantially mitigated for

                  POL by the fact that variable Postmaster Remuneration was also reduced. That

                   helped POL meet its targets. The business model, treating Postmaster

                   remuneration as a cost, creates a direct trade-off between POL's financial

                   targets and Postmaster Remuneration, which was generally resolved in POL's

                   short-term interests.


            122. Reducing POL's own costs was a significant focus for management, often

                   overseen by me, for several years.


            123. Cutting the staff and non-staff costs of POL, as opposed to Postmaster

                   renumeration, was an act that was supportive of Postmasters. Any Postmaster

                   have discussed this with over the years has considered POL to be too

                   expensive and bureaucratic and wanted to see those costs cut, increasing their

                   potential share of available profits.


            124. Nonetheless, money could have been spent radically improving the

                   management of Horizon and the management of shortfalls. Our focus on POL's

                   commercial performance meant that this was not a priority.

            Protecting cash



            125. Much of POL's business is conducted in cash and increasingly under

                 agreement with the banks, the 'Banking Framework', enabling customers to pay

                 in and withdraw cash.



            126. Given the security risks, POL provides the cash, borrowing money from HMG,

                 taking it in and out of Bank of England vaults and delivering it to and picking it up

                 from Post Offices.


            127. Postmasters are therefore trusted with very significant amounts of cash and

                 POL's business model and ability to manage taxpayers' money is dependent on

                 being able to determine how that money was used and to recover it if

                 appropriate.



            128. POL has a view of what cash, stamps and lottery tickets a Post Office should

                 hold and asks Postmasters to regularly confirm the cash holdings they have by

                 counting (cash declarations) and reconciling the information (balancing).



            129. However, POL found it difficult to extract and interpret detailed information over

                 a period of time from Horizon, had a limited competence in understanding how

                 branches worked and felt that it could not know what had happened in a branch.


            130. Accordingly, POL took the view that the Postmaster was accountable for what

                 happened in the branch. If there was less cash than POL thought there should be

                 ("a shortfall"), POL's position was that the Postmaster was accountable for that

                 shortfall.

            131. Postmasters were therefore asked to pay for the shortfalls in accordance with

                  POL's view of their contracts. If unpaid, the balances were classified as debt.

                   This was provided against — written off to the Profit and Loss account - after 60

                   days, but maintained as an amount owed by that Postmaster. A rising trend of

                   unpaid shortfalls therefore hit the Profit and Loss account and EBITDAS very

                   quickly.



            132. My Operations priority from 2017 was to look for ways to stop that cost

                   escalating. This would protect Trading Profit and the business model: POL trusts

                  Postmasters with hundreds of millions of pounds every day and if it does not get

                   the cash back from the Network, the business model fails.


            133. To that end we sought to better identify branches with symptoms that suggested

                   a shortfall might exist. We could then count the cash, believing that a shortfall

                   was more likely to be resolved if it was found when smaller. However, we did not

                   spend sufficient time scrutinising what might be the cause of the shortfall.


            134. In 2019 and 2020 better work was done seeking to proactively identify branches

                 that were not balancing for a period, or which had visible issues on their

                 accounting for stamps.



            135. My feelings remain that these more innovative ways of helping Postmasters not

                 get into difficulty, rather than focusing on recovery after the event, could have

                 been instituted many years earlier and created better ways of working and

                 greater learnings. Unfortunately, the drive for profit meant that we focused on

                 what was material to us, not what was material to a Postmaster.

            136. With people changes and the pandemic, together with the uncontrolled

                   introduction of a dispute button into Horizon after the GLO, improvements to the

                   shortfall process went into reverse in 2021 and 2022, with the profit and loss

                   account charges increasing.


            137. In 2022 the Retail directorate considered that they were undertaking

                   investigations into shortfalls which were not then leading to repayments by

                  Postmasters and that some sort of legal clarity would be needed, perhaps

                   triggered by deducting repayments from remuneration (Doc:

                  POL GE Postmaster Losses 16 November 2022 POL00423917and Doc:

                  POL_GE_Postmaster Losses 25 January 2023 POL00423921)


            138. On 24 January 2023, I summarised my views briefly to Nick Read and Ben Foat

                   (Email Re: Losses 24 January 2023, POL00423698) listing the significant steps

                   we would have to go through before we could feasibly reclaim shortfalls from

                  Postmasters. In addition, even if those steps were completed satisfactorily, I did

                   not believe that we could practically recover shortfalls from Postmasters through

                   a legal process while we were still using Horizon, given its reputation.


            139. We engaged EY to help us assess the position with investigations of shortfalls

                   in branches. On 11 April 2023, I summarised my understanding of their work to

                   that point; "it does seem that the financial cost [of shortfalls] is driven by our

                  inability to successfully complete investigations and not on our ability to collect

                   established losses. Is that fair?" (Email RE: Branch discrepancies — Findings

            140. There therefore remained a fundamental lack of clarity on the reasons for

                   branch shortfalls, making any fair resolution impossible. It is my view that POL's

                   business model cannot continue sustainably unless this is resolved whether

                   using Horizon or its replacement.



            POL's current financial position


            141. While the decision that POL must fund the costs of the Inquiry and

                   compensation schemes was politically and emotionally logical, there is really no

                  POL money that is separate from taxpayers' money.


            142. POL is financially incentivised to pay compensation quickly and generously

                   (HMG pays the compensation) but the processes to which it has to adhere to

                   receive that payment are bureaucratic and complex, which slows compensation

                   and increases its overall cost.



            143. In accounting terms, where POL states that compensation will be payable, it

                   converts a contingent liability into an actual liability. If it does so without having

                   HMG funding in place, it cannot afford to pay for that liability and could be

                   wrongfully trading, an offence which would change the basis on which the

                   business can be run.


            144. In a set of email exchanges between 12 and 16 May 2023 the relationship

                   between funding and timing is set out (Email RE: "Question" 16 May 2023,

                  POL00423920). I was arguing that the resulting delays are unacceptable.

            145. I also drew attention to my concern about monthly deductions from Postmaster

                   Remuneration to cover shortfalls, which had been agreed with Postmasters in

                   earlier years during periods when proper investigations into the shortfalls had

                   not been done: "it took us so long to stop taking the payments. I cannot find an

                   argument that I would be prepared to make in public or private that says we can

                  hold on to the monies paid since 2019, unless we have done the same checks

                   as we did for the small population still paying. And of course HSS [Horizon

                   Shortfall Scheme] does not apply for this period".


            MEDIATION (2015)


           146. In 2015, POL was confidently communicating the position that there was no

                 evidence of any faults with Horizon, or unsafe convictions, nor had any

                 convictions been appealed: "To date, we have found no evidence, nor has any

                 been advanced by either an Applicant or Second Sight of either faults with the

                 Horizon system or unsafe convictions and no convictions have been appealed."

                 (CEO's Report Jan 2015, POL00219395).


           147. While POL acknowledged that there were instances where it "could have done

                 more" to assist applicants to the scheme, such as intervening earlier when it

                 became clear branches were experiencing losses, POL was steadfast that it was

                 the actions of the applicants themselves which had caused or contributed to the

                 losses suffered (CEO's Report Jan 2015, POL00219395).


           148. My understanding at the time was that the Board had initiated the mediation

                 scheme with good intentions and a significant amount of work had been done

                 even though POL was unequivocal in its position as set out above. I therefore

                 accepted that the criminal trials had been fair: it did not occur to me that

                 important material had been withheld from the defence during prosecutions.



           149. The CCRC had requested papers on a number of prosecutions without, to my

                 knowledge, feeling any need to intervene. It was not until Brian Altman QC (as he

                 then was) stated that there might have been miscarriages of justice in 2020 that I

                 changed my position.



           150. I had little engagement with the Mediation Scheme when I joined POL, as it came

                 to an end shortly after I joined as CFO. There was a Sparrow Sub-Committee

                 meeting on 12 January 2015 which I did not attend, although I may have read the

                 papers at the time, and I did attend its final meeting on 18 February 2015.


            151. The 18 February 2015 meeting of the Sparrow Sub-committee discussed that

                   the mediation scheme was failing and there was likely to be an unbridgeable

                   gap between the parties.


            152. The proposal of the Sparrow Sub-Committee was to continue to mediate and

                   engage with Second Sight on individual cases, but end both the existing

                   mediation scheme and the broader Second Sight engagement.



            153. In email correspondence in March 2015 between myself, Alwen Lyons and

                   others I agreed to support the proposed approach (Email from Alisdair Cameron

                   to Alwen Lyons, Neil McCausland, Virginia Holmes and others cc Alice Perkins,

                   Alasdair Marnoch, Richard Callard and others RE: Sparrow paper for the Board

                  -Action required 3/3/15, POL00138860). I considered that it was possible that

                   this decision to end the mediation scheme could "trigger" a reaction from

                  Parliament, the media or in the courts, however this was likely to be inevitable in

                   any event and therefore should be faced.



            154. One of the options put forward by the Communications Director (Mark Davies)

                   in email correspondence in relation to the mediation scheme in January 2015

                   was that POL provide £5,000 funding to each applicant to the scheme which

                   could be used for legal advice. I indicated that I was content to consider that

                   option (Email from Paula Vennells to Mark R Davies, Alisdair Cameron, CC

                   Gavin Lambert and others re: Sparrow -An idea at pace! 15 January 2015,

                  POL00218860).



            155. I do not recall that anything further happened in relation to this proposal, but the

                   feeling that the gap between the parties was so great that it needed to be

                   resolved in the courts was what I understood to be the guiding principle of

                  POL's subsequent legal strategy.


            SECOND SIGHT (2015) — SUSPENSE ACCOUNTS



            156. Suspense Accounts are a common accounting practice, creating an account on

                   the balance sheet where unresolved transactions can be held while work is

                   going on to resolve them. In my experience, credit balances (amounts due to

                   someone) typically arose because a former customer could not be identified or

                   located, making it impossible to pay them an amount due. After a period, that

                   credit would be released as profit.



            157. Such credit differences typically arose in POL where Horizon records created by

                   branches showed an amount payable to a Client greater than the Client

                                                                                                      WI TNO9840100
                                                                                                 WI TN09840100

                   believed it should be, or an amount due from a Client less than the Client

                   believed it should be.


            158. Of relevance to this and subsequent sections of my statement, Second Sight is

                   a firm of independent forensic accountants and investigators appointed jointly

                   by a small group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance ("JFSA")

                   in 2012 to conduct an independent investigation into Horizon. They were

                   contracted by POL who supported the appointment. Second Sight issued

                   several reports in respect of their investigations. The key one for the purposes

                   of my statement was the Briefing Report — Part 2 which was finalised on 9 April

                   2015 (see later from paragraph 178).


            159. On 15 January 2015, very soon after I joined POL, I was asked by Chris Aujard,

                   Interim General Counsel and others for urgent help to answer questions from

                   Second Sight on the operation of POL's Suspense Accounts ("SAs").


            160. I was provided more detail in email correspondence following a Working Group

                   meeting of the Complaint and Mediation Scheme (Email from Rod Ismay to

                  Peter Goodman Re: suspense accounts 15 January 2015, POL00351276). In

                   summary, Second Sight were asking how much was absorbed into POL's Profit

                   & Loss account from suspense accounts each year, and how much of that

                   related to money which was or could be properly due to Postmasters.


            161. The following day, Chis Aujard sent me a separate request. He was seeking

                   someone who was "technically switched on re suspense accounts" and who

                   could "handle themselves in front of an adversarial audience". Chris set out that

                   he was "concerned we give Second Sight no more information than is

            162. I responded on the same day by email to confirm that Rod Ismay who led the

                   FSC, was the right person to handle the queries from Second Sight.


            163. I indicated that I was inclined to be open with Second Sight in response to their

                   queries and that Rod should be adequately prepared to answer potentially

                   hostile questions (reflecting the language of "adversarial' that Chris Aujard had

                   used) (Email sent from Mark Underwood to Belinda Crowe and others re:

                   Suspense Accounts, 19 January 2015, POL00040805).


            164. Chris Aujard proposed a slightly slower timetable for POL to respond

                   substantively to Second Sight's queries, while I was starting to get up to speed

                   with the issues raised (Email from Chris Aujard to Ian Henderson cc Belinda

            165. Shortly after these discussions, I saw a draft response to Second Sight, which I

                   was not dealing with directly. On 27 January 2015 I wrote to Chris Aujard and

                   Jane MacLeod that the response needed to be more comprehensive and data

                   driven (Email from Chris Aujard to Alisdair Cameron, CC Andrew Parsons and

                   I received, that Second Sight were only interested in credit balances in SAs and

                   not branch accounts, to ensure that we were answering the right questions. This

                   was an important clarification for me because shortfalls in most cases were

                   recorded in branch accounts between POL and an individual branch, not in the

                   SA.



            166. In response to my comments, Andy Parsons from our external legal advisors,

                   Bond Dickinson, replied to Chris Aujard that in his view providing too much

                   information to Second Sight would "encourage further fishing". I continued to

                   provide my comments on the draft paper to improve our response to Second

                   Sight's queries (Emails between Paul Lorraine, Alisdair Cameron, Andrew

                  Parsons and others 29 January 2015, POL00021829).


             167. On 28 January 2015, following a discussion, Jane MacLeod wrote to me setting

                   out a suggested strategic approach to the mediation scheme and Second Sight

                   more broadly, including how to move forward. This correspondence

                   demonstrates that the two of us were open at that time to providing funding for

                   investigations, possibly to be carried out by Second Sight, to manage the

                   reputational risk of proposals to end the mediation scheme (Email from Jane

                   MacLeod re Sparrow 28 January 2015, POL00311251).


             168. Chris Aujard sent the response to Second Sight on 30 January 2015, and it was

                   copied to me on 2 February 2015.



             169. I also provided comments on a note from Second Sight which listed their areas

                   of focus. I said that we had to listen to their concerns but that we should seek a

                   clear distinction between areas where Second Sight had evidence of an issue

                   and those where they speculated could be an issue (Email chain including Tom

            170. I agreed to brief Paula Vennells following a meeting with Second Sight

                   regarding SAs on 2 February 2015 before she went before the Select

                   Committee for an evidence session on the mediation scheme on 3 February

                   2015.


            171. On 9 February 2015 I was asked to provide comments on a draft paper for the

                   Sparrow Sub-Committee by the Communications Director. My comments were

                   that the tone of the paper was negative and could disconcert the Committee. I

                   suggested allowing Second Sight to finish their work and to continue to work

                   with them positively on the issue of SAs (Email from Mark R Davies to Alisdair

            172. I continued to engage with the requests of Second Sight throughout February

                   2015, liaising with POL's FSC team and considering options such as following

                   individual branch cases through to provide satisfactory answers to their queries

                   Cameron to Ian 12 February 2015, POL00312085). The final letter was sent on

                   13 February, suggesting a further meeting with Second Sight.


            174. On 27 February 2015 Belinda Crowe, another departing member of the Legal

                   team, reported back following a conversation with Second Sight (Email from

                   Belinda Crowe to Alisdair Cameron and others re "catch up call with Second

                   Sight" 27 February 2015, POL00102236).


            175. Her note explains that Second Sight were grateful for my positive engagement,

                   but that they still suggested that there were large sums of unattributable I

                   unreconcilable money in an unstructured account at the end of each month.

                   This does not reflect my recollection of the evidence we presented to Second

                   Sight at the time; generally the evidence from our work was, I thought,

                   reassuring in respect of the operation of SAs.


            176. Throughout March and April 2015, there was continued correspondence

                   between POL and Second Sight to try and resolve their outstanding queries. I

                   was also asked to consider and approve wording around SAs for the Initial

                   Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme End of term Report V.7

                   (POL00040932) dated 6 March 2015.


            177. My overall recollection is that I had a final amicable meeting with Second Sight,

                   which according to my diary took place on 4 March 2014, and the information

                   provided in respect of SAs was reassuring to me and, I believed, to them.


            178. However, on 13 March 2015, Mark Underwood from the Legal department

                   emailed me and Rod Ismay stating that Second Sight had reported experiencing

                   difficulties obtaining access to evidence from POL, including detailed

                   transactions relating to SAs. He highlighted particular paragraphs in the Second

                   Sight draft report and asked for my comments on the same.



             179. In response to this email chain (Email chain from Mark Underwood to Alisdair

                   Cameron cc Rod Ismay, Belinda Crowe, Andrew Parsons RE: Second Sight's

                  Part Two Report and assertions made in relation to Suspense accounts, 20

                   March 2015, POL00225156), I set out my understanding, suggesting what I

                   believed to be more accurate wording in respect of the highlighted sections of

                   the draft report and the position that had been reached. I agreed that some

                   numerical data on aspects of the client accounts themselves were outstanding

                   and confirmed that we could close this issue. I also pushed back at the idea that

                   released credits to the SAs were "substantial' compared to the value of the

                   transactions being processed.


            180. I wrote to Second Sight on 23 March 2015 setting out POL's position in respect

                   of SAs, in particular our conclusions that they were effectively controlled. I felt

                   that based on the knowledge I had accumulated in the last few weeks, Second

                   Sight should be satisfied from the information we had provided that there was

                   no evidence that Postmaster credits were being released to POL's profit and

                   loss account inappropriately at that time.


            181. Second Sight responded on 27 March 2015 that the information provided by

                  POL 9 months previously that all unmatched transactions were posted to a

                   single SA "was not correct". My understanding was that this referred to

                   individual client creditor accounts, where transactions were recorded to be

                   matched and processed. Unmatched items would initially be held there before

                   being transferred to the main Suspense Account. Second Sight therefore felt

                   more investigations were required of unmatched items in individual third-party

                   client accounts and they might need to look further at the main Suspense

                   Account (Email from Ian Henderson to Alisdair Cameron, Rod Ismay, Jane

                   Macleod and others RE: Client Suspense Accounts — Confidential 27 March

                   2015, POL00313968).


            182. I reiterated on 30 March 2015 that I found the evidence we had obtained to be

                   reassuring.


            183. On 10 April 2015, I received excerpts from Second Sight's Part 2 report from

                   Mark Davies who characterised it as "flawed and inaccurate." (Email from Mark

                   R Davies to Alisdair Cameron, Re: Sparrow 10 April 2015, POL00102389). In

                   respect of SAs, he summarised that the report claimed that POL was potentially

                   profiting through money in SAs which could be due to Postmasters.


            184. In response, I suggested a clarification: the large figures in SAs represented

                   amounts due to Clients, and not amounts that were overdue, or unreconciled

                   amounts which therefore could be due to Postmasters. The description in the

                  Part 2 report was therefore misleading. We had already explained to Second

                   Sight that the statistic which gave comfort was that neither account had any

                   unreconciled balances which were over 6 months old, meaning that transactions

                   had been resolved between POL and its Clients and customers.


            185. In summary, I did not see grounds to be concerned about the operation of the

                   Suspense Account or the Client Creditors. If there were unresolved credit

                   transactions due to Postmasters stuck in suspense, there would be a large

                   balance of older items, however the two material accounts we investigated had

                   no balances over 6 months old. There also was no evidence from the

                   investigations undertaken by POL that significant credits were being released

                   from SAs to Profit & Loss. I do not know whether that could have happened in

                   earlier years, as I am not familiar with the way the SAs were operated before I

                  joined POL.



            186. I was surprised and upset by what I felt to be a gap between the conversations I

                   had had with Second Sight, the data we had shared and their conclusions in

                  Part 2 of the report. My position had been to be open with Second Sight and

                   answer their questions properly, even though others at POL had concerns about

                   their professionalism and the scope of their work. Following this experience

                   however, I wondered if there had been a "wilful misunderstanding" (Email from

                   Mark R Davies to Alisdair Cameron, Re: Sparrow 10 April 2015, POL00102389).



            187. I had very little engagement with Second Sight thereafter in respect of SAs

                   although I was involved in the later Deloitte reports (see from paragraph 259),

                   which formed part of our preparation for the GLO.



            188. I had no animus to Second Sight. On 9 February 2022, Tim McCormack (a

                   former postmaster) wrote to the Inquiry and copied Nick Read, raising a concern

                   about the reconciliation of cash received in our cash centres. I offered Tim

                   McCormack the opportunity to visit a cash centre and go through our approach

                   with the Head of Cash Logistics to reassure him. I agreed that he could bring

                   Ron Warmington of Second Sight with him.

            189. Following this visit, Tim McCormack copied the Inquiry into an email on 28

                   March 2022 which finished by thanking me for giving him and Second Sight the

                   opportunity to visit the cash centre to "see and hear for ourselves the progress

                   that is being made." I therefore remained open to working with Second Sight.



            190. I have always been conscious that they continue to argue that Postmaster

                   credits had been siphoned into POL's profit and loss account but I have never

                   been clear of the evidence that they were relying on.



            EXECUTIVE AND LEADERSHIP (Second Sight)

            191. My emerging view across my first year at POL was that the competence of the

                   Finance teams and the control environment were weaker than they should have

                   been. There were people with operational capabilities undertaking financial

                   roles. This was very substantially improved over time.


            192. In the context of Second Sight, there was significant internal back-and-forth in

                   correspondence as the POL teams worked through Second Sight's requests. As

                  I was new to the business, I was surprised that it had taken so long to provide

                   the information Second Sight requested, and that the default position was to

                   give as little evidence as possible.


            193. The correspondence demonstrates that I generally pushed back at this, and

                   used my role as CFO to engage with Second Sight in completing their

                   investigations.


            194. The sense I got was that there was a core group of people at POL who led the

                   management of the mediation and Second Sight issues for Paula Vennells,

                   including Andrew Parsons, Belinda Crowe, Chris Aujard, Mark Davies, Angela

                   van den Bogerd and over time, Jane MacLeod. They seemed convinced that

                   Second Sight was acting beyond the scope of the work it had been hired to do.

                   The position at POL was that Second Sight would seek evidence to support its

                   hypotheses rather than drawing proofs from individual cases and then seeking

                   to prove or disprove them.



            195. Paula seemed open to the idea that we were taking too legalistic an approach in

                   dealing with Second Sight (Email from Paula Vennells to Alisdair Cameron re:

                   Mediation Scheme 30 January 2015, POL00109933). However, I don't recall us

                   discussing it specifically and I assume that, ultimately, she agreed with her

                   team's consensus above.


            OUTREACH BRANCH REMITTANCE ISSUE (2015)



            196. The Outreach Branch remittance issue was escalated following an article in

                   Computer Weekly. In summary, the article had described a warning issued by

                   the Communication Workers Union ("CWU") to members regarding issues in

                   Horizon which had been sent by the POL IT Help Desk.


            197. It described circumstances where it was possible for an operator error to

                   duplicate a transaction between an Outreach branch and Central hub. Chris

                   Broe, the Interim CIO, informed me that the issue was known about, was

                   relatively rare and a change had been agreed to Horizon in order to mitigate

                   operator errors likely to cause the problem.

            198. We agreed the lack of escalation until that point was a concern. Chris was also

                   determined that the Communications team discuss IT issues with him before

                   they responded to journalists (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Neil Hayward,

                   Jane MacLeod, Paula Vennells re Outreach Branch Remittances 12 November

                  2015, POL00153623).



            199. I do not recall whether this correspondence was followed up or if any further

                   actions were taken. I do not recall whether we made any investigations into the

                   potential implications on Postmasters of this issue.



            HORIZON ISSUE IN (2016)


            200. On 9 May 2016 there was a failure of Horizon which meant that a significant

                   number of branches were unable to enter transactions. As part of business

                   continuity testing, Horizon had been operating for a short period on its

                   secondary server and had on the previous day been brought back to its primary

                   server. This test was intended to give confidence (or learn lessons) in case this

                   was ever required after a server failure.


            201. However, on the morning of 9 May 2016, the primary server failed, and a reboot

                   of the primary server was required. This was resolved 90 minutes later, by

                   approximately 10.30am, and there was no further disruption to service.



            202. I provided a note to the GE on the same day summarising the issue, the next

                   steps and the importance of ensuring there was no adverse impact for

                  Postmasters such as if the outage led to incomplete or unbalanced transactions

                   Issue — urgent 9 May 2016 POL00241349)



            203. A NED (Tim Franklin) raised a concern to Paula Vennells that the note to the

                   Board, which was sent late the same day, was unacceptably delayed and led to

                   his being updated based on media reporting (and after being questioned about

                   the issue by an external partner). I acknowledged this and set out the position in

                   respect of incomplete transactions and how they would be managed, including

                   that a full review of branch level transactions would be undertaken by the back-

                   office team. Paula supported this approach and identified that there were

                   lessons to be learned quickly as a result of the system failure (Email from Tim

                   Franklin to Paula Vennells RE: Media coverage on Horizon system failure 9 May

                   2016, POL00241374).


            204. The correspondence following this incident demonstrates the actions taken by

                  POL. Chris Broe set out a Lessons Learned and Proposed Actions on 10 May

                   2016, including improved IT incident alerting, incident handling, future

                   avoidance and business communications (Email from Chris Broe to Mark

            205. I raised our concerns with Fujitsu on 11 May 2016, given there had been a

                   similar issue a couple of months previously and received a response from

                   Regina Moran (Fujitsu relationship lead) reiterating Fujitsu's commitment to a

                   successful strategic partnership with POL and confirming that the root cause

                   would be shared as soon as it had been identified (Email from Regina Moran to

            206. This was followed by a formal letter to Fujitsu written by the new CIO Rob

                   Houghton on 12 May 2016 setting out POL's grave concerns regarding the

                   events leading up to and the handling of the service incident. I was copied into

                   this correspondence (Letter from Robert Houghton to Gavin Bell (Fujitsu) re:

                   RE: Horizon service outage incident on 9th May 2016 ("Service Incident") 12

                   May 2016, FUJ00175319).


            207. Following further internal correspondence, Paula was updated on 25 May 2016

                   as to progress in responding to the incident including POL's response to the risk

                   of branch shortfalls as a result of the service disruption.


            208. The correspondence demonstrates that POL took the incident seriously and

                   learned lessons. We were proactive in making sure Postmasters were not out of

                   pocket as a result of any unbalanced transactions caused by the incident.


            209. As far as I can recall, there has been no similar service incident since, although

                   business continuity testing of Horizon has been limited given its age and

                   fragility.


            INTERIM CEO 2019


            210. In late 2018, Paula Vennells told us that she was leaving POL. Her departure

                   date would be April 2019. It was clear that the process to replace her would take

                   longer than that and an Interim CEO would be required.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




            211. Appointing me as Interim CEO, as agreed between the Chairman and the

                   Minister, was the simplest solution because I was already a member of the

                   Board. I agreed to serve as Interim CEO and indicated that I would apply for the

                   permanent role as did one other member of the management team. The role

                   would be also advertised externally.


            212. In practice, I increasingly started taking over the Interim CEO role from the

                   beginning of March 2019                          IRRELEVANT




            213. The process to find a replacement, which would be determined by HMG,

                   concluded in July 2019 and I was not successful. Nick Read, the new CEO, was

                   quickly available and started in September 2019.


            214. We had not found a CFO replacement, so I reverted to being CFO, a role I had

                   never fully relinquished.



            215. My reflections are that the outcome of the Common Issues Trial ("CIT") and the

                   pressure on POL to address the issues arising from that judgment meant that

                   having an entirely new CEO with no previous involvement in the business was

                   the right decision.



            216. My time as Interim CEO was intense and busy. In a letter to Tim Parker on 20

                   March 2019 the Minister set out her expectations: respond to the GLO, make

                   things more attractive for Postmasters and improve financial sustainability

                   (Letter from Kelly Tolhurst MP to Tim Parker - Re: Appointment of Al Cameron

                   Accountable person: Instruction from BEIS permanent secretary to the CEO of

                  Post Office Ltd on accountabilities and responsibilities 9 June 2019,

                   UKG100010163).


            217. I provide fuller detail later in my statement of the actions I took in my role as

                   Interim CEO in relation to matters investigated by the Inquiry (for example the

                   GLO). From a governance perspective, my primary concern as CEO following

                   the judgment in the CIT was to change our legal advisors. We appointed new

                   General Counsel (Ben Foat), supported by a fresh external legal team from

                   Herbert Smith Freehills ("HSF"). We also changed Leading Counsel for the final

                   stages of the appeal against the CIT judgment. This led to a change in legal

                   strategy and a move to settlement.



            218. A key focus of my early tenure as Interim CEO, even before the CIT judgment,

                   was improving support for Postmasters. This was the main focus of speeches I

                   discussed with the senior leadership group and delivered on 15 April 2019 at the

                   NFSP conference (POL00270665) in which I emphasised: "We have to make it

                   easier for Postmasters to make more money for less effort and in a better spirit

                   of partnership." This focus was given extra momentum by the NFSP survey

                   highlighting the risk of losing Postmasters which led my appearance at the

                   Business Select Committee in May 2019.


            219. We announced higher Postmaster Remuneration and a process to review it

                   further, enabling a second increase later that year. This was enabled by the very

                   significant increases in prices agreed for the Banking Framework.

            220. During my tenure as Interim CEO, I also got involved in two more specific

                   branch issues that are relevant to the Inquiry.



            221. At the first individual branch, they had experienced a material shortfall. I asked

                   the Operations team to investigate and it took a number of weeks. The reason,

                   was told, was that through a period when the Postmaster was ill, a series of

                   temporary Postmasters had not been recording stamps in-and-out accurately.



            222. Due to my concerns that the stamp recording issue could be a significant one,

                   and not knowing at that stage how long I would be in role, or with POL,

                   reported the issue to Ben Foat, so the issue would not be lost. I informed Nick

                   Read when he joined.


            223. This was escalated and following an independent review led to the Stamps

                   remediation scheme and improvements in the stamps processes. However, I

                   remain concerned that the `solution', scanning stamps in and out of branches

                   and reconciling those movements to Supply Chain's records, was still not, in

                   2023, either delivered or planned within the Horizon replacement programme.


            224. The second issue was that I was contacted in June 2019 by Tim McCormack, a

                   former Postmaster, asking to speak to me. I cover this in more detail from

                   paragraph 409 below.

            225. On 18 February 2015, as the Mediation Scheme started to lose support, there

                   was a suggestion, in the Sparrow Sub-Committee, that a legal case was being

                   prepared against POL. During late 2015, 2016, I recall there being less attention

                   focused on these issues by the GE and the Board: the Chairman's review was

                   understood to be going on, although it was kept secret as legally privileged,

                   even from the Board; work on SAs was not making progress; and I do not recall

                   being much involved with the residual elements of Sparrow/Mediation.



            226. In April 2016, a High Court claim was issued against POL by a group of

                  Postmasters and a Group Litigation Order was subsequently issued by the

                   Court to manage the claims in March 2017. Around 555 claimants joined the

                   GLO and the Court ordered that the case would be heard through a number of

                   trials to cover various issues. Of the trials that went ahead, the first, the CIT,

                   sought to answer a number of questions about the contracts of Postmasters

                   with POL. The second, the Horizon Issues Trial (HIT), covered questions

                   relating to the robustness of Horizon, both at the time of the litigation and

                   historical versions. Further trials were scheduled but never took place due to

                  POL and the Claimants coming to a settlement agreement in December 2019.



            Litigation 2017 — 2018



            227. I do not recall having much personal involvement in POL's strategy or

                   management of the GLO until late September 2017, when Jane MacLeod was

                   discussing the approach to the Case Management Conference ("CMC"), which

                   was scheduled for October that year.

            228. On 22 September 2017, in email correspondence Jane summarised some notes

                   for a meeting arranged with Paula Vennells and the Shareholder Representative

                   in advance of the upcoming CMC, which would set the legal direction for the

                   case for the next 1 — 2 years (Email from Jane MacLeod to Avene Regan, cc

                  Paula Vennells and Alisdair Cameron re Litigation- meeting with Tony Robinson,

                   22 September 2019, POL00250703).



            229. Key questions to be decided in the litigation included whether Horizon was

                   robust and whether Postmasters' contracts were "fair" and supported POL's

                   operating practices.



            230. Having reviewed these documents recently, I do not recall the question of the

                   fairness of the contracts being debated internally. My recollection is that the

                   GLO sub-committee later discussed the apparent gap between the legal

                   approaches of each party: the Claimants sought a decision on fairness and POL

                   remained focused on whether the contract was consistent with the law.

                   However, I am not a lawyer and may have misunderstood this point.



            231. Following the CMC, POL's general case management strategy was set out in a

                   Steering Committee Briefing paper and agreed in October 2017 (Steering Group

                   Briefing Paper: Update on case management strategy meeting 4 October 2017,

                  POL00006462). POL's legal strategy remained largely unchanged after the

                   CMC as no key additional information was brought to light.


            232. In December 2017, Jane updated me and Paula that the Steering Group would

                   be asked to consider at their upcoming meeting initiating settlement discussions

                   for two particular groups of claimants. The advice was that there was financial

                   and tactical value in seeking to settle particular issues and demonstrating POL

                   was willing to engage to narrow the issues (Email chain from Jane MacLeod to

                   Andrew Parsons and Rodric Williams, Re: Postmaster Litigation 5 December

                   2017, POL00024292). However, I do not recall settlement discussions being

                   progressed any further at that time.


            233. Until the GLO Sub-Committee was formed in 2018, I do not recall having a

                   formal role in POL's management of the proceedings. However, I was usually

                   copied in to notes and invited to meetings by Paula and Jane as well as

                   participating in Board meetings.


            234. On 28 January 2018, Jane provided a fuller update in respect of the GLO which

                   confirmed that there would be a first trial (CIT) for four weeks from November

                   2018 to determine the correct interpretation of the Postmaster contract and

                   whether additional terms should be implied (Email chain between Jane

                   MacLeod, Alisdair Cameron, Paula Vennells and others Re: Postmaster

                   Litigation - Briefing notes for the Board, 28 January 2018, POL00024182). Four

                   weeks had been set aside for a second trial in March 2019.


            235. Jane also set out POL's proposed strategy including contingency and mitigation

                   planning, the timetable for obtaining legal advice on the merits of POL's case

                   (which was to be reviewed at key stages), and a proposed security for costs

                   application. I was informed that two Silks had been briefed, David Cavender QC

                   and Anthony de Garr Robinson QC (as each then was).


            236. David Cavender QC was asked to consider how he would approach the claim if

                   he was advising the claimants rather than POL and highlighted particular issues

                                                        Page 56 of 137

                   to POL during this exercise including the reliability of Horizon, training of

                  Postmasters, and SAs. We also considered the gross value of the claims,

                   although at that stage the allegations were unsubstantiated and there were

                   several variables to consider such as whether any of the individual claims were

                   time-barred.


            237. In my reply to the GLO update, I noted that settling the claim for a moderate

                   amount would enable POL to move forward, and we should give this serious

                   consideration.



            238. In March 2018, the GLO Sub-Committee was set up and I was a member. The

                   updates were provided to us orally. The first GLO Sub-Committee meeting in

                   March was largely a procedural update as to the status of the GLO. During the

                   May meeting we considered an opinion from our instructed Silk on the common

                   issues, although I have not recently seen any minutes from this meeting setting

                   this out.


            239. In correspondence on 6 June 2018, Jane MacLeod updated us that a further

                   CMC was scheduled for 5 June 2018 and that the claim had been valued by the

                   Claimants at between £80-90 million (E mail from Jane MacLeod to Tim Parker;

                   Ken McCall; Carla Stent; Tim Franklin, re: Postmaster Litigation - Confidential

                   and subject to Legal Privilege - Do not Forward 1 June 2018, POL00103336).



            240. During the summer of 2018, Jane and Angela Van Den Bogerd, who was

                   supporting Jane, undertook a piece of work to assess the Claimants' challenges

                   to the way in which the Postmaster contract was implemented ahead of the

                   upcoming CIT.

            241. My view was that we should use the time before the CIT to improve the contract

                   for Postmasters where we felt it was weak. However, legal advice cautioned

                   against clarifying the contract in any way in advance of the trial. Instead,

                   substantial contingency work was undertaken to risk rate the different

                   challenges to the contract, by impact and likelihood, assessed with reference to

                   legal advice.



            242. This was discussed at the GE on 18 July 2018, and again during a Board

                   meeting on 31 July 2018 (Meeting minutes: minutes of Board meeting held on

                   31st July 2018, POL00021556) with higher impact ratings attributed to the

                   challenges on causation of shortfalls and liability for losses, given these would

                   lead to immediate financial impacts for POL in the event of an adverse

                  judgment. Suspension pay was categorised as an operational issue. This work

                   provided a clear view of where POL should focus its efforts when the CIT

                   Judgment was subsequently published.



            243. Also during the summer of 2018, there was correspondence between Jane

                   MacLeod, Stephen Clarke (of UKGI) and me regarding a briefing with

                  Permanent Secretary (Alex Chisholm) of the Department scheduled for 10

                   September 2018 (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Stephen Clarke RE: Post

            244. We discussed particular areas of focus for the briefing including the issues at

                   stake in the upcoming CIT, the implications of losing for POL, contingency

                   arrangements, and the issue of settlement. We also arranged a pre-meet with

                   UKGI to go over the agenda prior to the briefing.


            245. In September 2018 I received correspondence from Jane, copying various

                   others from our legal advisors at Bond Dickinson, which started as a request for

                   guidance about security for costs (Email chain from Jane MacLeod, Andrew

                  Parsons, Rodric Williams and others Re: Postmaster Litigation - Security for

                   Costs 16 September 2018 POL00024204). Our legal team had recommended

                  POL make this application, which was due to be heard later that month.


            246. However, the Claimant's legal advisors had served a request for a cross

                   undertaking for damages, so if POL lost the CIT we would be required to

                   indemnify the Claimants for the cost of providing the security. Paula Vennells

                   and I had particular concerns about being asked to take this decision by our

                   legal team, which risked public money, with "little date and no notice". The final

                   decision was influenced by a desire not to back down at the first sign of a fight.

                  Despite this being in line with the advice provided to us, Paula and I had

                   concerns whether we had been advised well enough, and I felt that the

                   Claimants had better advisors.


            247. On 16 October 2018, Paula and I exchanged correspondence to prepare for the

                   next day's meeting with the Permanent Secretary of the Department, copying

                   the General Counsel and the Communications Director. Paula acknowledged

                   the importance of using neutral and balanced language when communicating

                   the risks associated with the litigation. Key areas included the focus on

                   resolution, but it was noted that POL was not afraid to appeal if the judgment

                   was flawed and had strong legal support to do so. Contingency arrangements

                   were in place for various potential outcomes of the CIT, and we had a plan to

                   engage with the media and challenge examples of biased reporting.



            248. In this correspondence, Paula acknowledged that Postmasters had undoubtedly

                   "suffered badly'. However, this was not because of Horizon but because they

                   had got out of their depth, and suggested there was the opportunity to engage

                   in mediation after the two trials were completed (Email from Alisdair Cameron to

                  Paula Vennells, Jane MacLeod, Mark R Davies Re: Tomorrow's GLO Meeting

                   16 October 2018, POL00154340).



            249. In my response to Paula's correspondence, I focused on the losses in the

                   Network which had arisen as a result of POL's decision not to prosecute

                  Postmasters until we could prove that Horizon was reliable. I noted that this had

                   caused an increase in losses to POL, and a reduction in the recovery of

                   shortfalls, in the past couple of years. However, POL was improving at

                   identifying shortfalls earlier and sharing them with auditors and agents.



            250. On 17 October 2017 the meeting took place for the Permanent Secretary to

                   scrutinise POL's preparations for the upcoming trials and contingency plans,

                   including potential implications for the business of adverse findings and a

                   planned approach to settlement and communications.


            251. I have now seen the Department briefing for the Permanent Secretary at that

                   time, which notes that "There is a consensus that it is not appropriate or feasible

                   to settle in the short term but there will be a mediation window in March 2019."

                   2018 UKG100008519). During this meeting, I believe the Permanent Secretary

                   challenged POL on plans for mediation and the argument that we could not at

                   this point settle the case. This is based entirely on my recollections as the

                   minutes from this meeting are not clear (Draft read out note of POL meeting in

                   HoC on 17th October 4-4:45pm 17 October 2018, UKG100008554).


            252. My recollection is that we felt that POL would never be able to recommend a

                   settlement that would satisfy the Claimants, as there were individual claimants

                   in the GLO who had already signed full and final settlements but had still

                   chosen to become involved in the litigation. The shared view was that we

                   needed to win or lose to resolve the complex issues raised, and our legal advice

                   was that we had a strong legal claim and were likely to win.


            253. The counter-argument was that if we didn't fight, we couldn't lose — and while

                   another case might emerge in 2-3 years time, that could be settled too. We

                   didn't follow that line of thought believing that only a win or a loss in court would

                   enable a satisfactory solution for either party.


            254. Later, I was accused of a cynical 'kick the can down the road' strategy when I

                   said that POL could manage the costs of the litigation because we had deeper

                   pockets. POL pursued a win or lose strategy because we thought we would win,

                   and we also thought that we could only reach a resolution with a decisive verdict

                   one way or the other. If we had wanted to 'kick the can down the road', we

                   would have settled the case in 2018 and waited for any further cases to emerge

                   later.

            255. The outcomes of the meeting were increased information-sharing with the

                  Department and a planned Cabinet paper on the strategic issues POL faced.


            256. Generally, the correspondence from the beginning of the GLO, and POL's

                   external communications strategy, demonstrates our intention to robustly defend

                   the claim. The view was that of the huge number of transactions that were

                   processed daily by Horizon, only a very small percentage of Postmasters who

                   had used it had experienced issues of the kind alleged by the Claimants. This

                   was reflected in our legal strategy (Email from Melanie Corfield to Mark R

                  Davies, Rodric Williams, Ben Float and Bob Hammond RE: For action- F&O call

                   on Thursday 2.15pm 21 November 2018, POL00259560).


            257. By December 2018, POL was expecting to receive the CIT judgment mid-late

                   January 2019. At this stage, POL's contingency planning included consideration

                   of the potential for a decision to appeal the judgment. Proposals were set out in

                   detail and the Chairman was responsible for the decision with Paula Vennells

                   and myself, based on advice from POL's legal team.


            258. General Counsel from UKGI had also asked to be briefed on how POL intended

                   to reach any decision on whether to appeal the CIT judgment. We discussed

                   producing an appeal matrix using our contingency planning as a guide to POL's

                   response on each possible finding in the awaited judgment (Email from Jane

            259. I have set out my earlier involvement in respect of POL's SAs and answering

                   queries from Second Sight (see above from paragraph 156). The following

                   section sets out the further work POL commissioned in respect of SAs from

                   June 2016.


            260. This work was never fully visible to me as it was conducted under legal

                   privilege. I assumed its purpose was to provide a definitive answer to the

                   concerns raised by Second Sight that the Suspense Account and any related

                   Client Creditor accounts could have housed Postmasters' money before a

                   release to the POL profit and loss account.


            261. On 1 June 2016, Mark Underwood forwarded to Deloitte a note that I had sent

                   him setting out the position in respect of SAs (Email from Mark Underwood to

                   Mark Westbrook cc'd Patrick Bourke re: Private & Confidential: Subject to Legal

                  Privilege 3 June 2016, POL00242323). In this correspondence I set out the

                   importance that all concerns raised in respect of SAs should be investigated

                   and issues rectified.


            262. I suggested engaging Deloitte to investigate the balances at year-end 2015 and

                   2016 to check my conclusions and to identify explanations for any credits

                   released to the POL Profit & Loss accounts to confirm that they did not belong

                   to Postmasters. I also suggested that POL should review every client account to

                   demonstrate that there were no material balances of unmatched items more

                   than 6 months old (as previously discussed with Second Sight), and that

                   unmatched credits cleared from the client accounts over the period went to an

                   identified SA for resolution.

            263. Most importantly, I recommended that Deloitte should confirm using transaction

                   analysis that there was no systemic branch impact and that the SAs did in fact

                   operate as I understood them to.


            264. My email on 3 June 2016 (POL00242323) contains some important points. In

                   particular, my note had not yet been checked for accuracy, and while it could

                   draw conclusions on what was happening in 2016 it could not confirm how SAs

                   had operated in 2005. I clarified that POL had not sought to state that it was

                   impossible for a branch to ever be "out of pocket" but that POL had no reason to

                   believe that as a result of the operation of the SAs Postmasters were

                   systemically and unknowingly losing money, to POL's gain.


            265. In early 2017, I was forwarded correspondence between our legal advisors and

                   Angela Van Den Bogerd seeking my approval to sharing a Deloitte paper with

                   them on the issue of SAs. On receipt of this, I immediately contacted General

                   Counsel and indicated that I had not been aware that further work was being

                   conducted in relation to SAs and asking to be copied into all ongoing

                   correspondence as I, as CFO, held ultimate accountability for preparing POL's

                   accounts (Email chain from Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod re: Private &

                  POL00110592).


            266. It appears to me now that the additional work was commissioned substantially

                   later than my suggesting it in June 2016. I emphasised that I should be included

                   in any meetings and copied into information exchanges to ensure that

                   information provided was reliable.

            267. Following this, on 22 March 2017, a note was sent on my behalf (by my PA) to

                   members of the POL Finance team setting out a planned Deloitte investigation

                   into SAs (Email chain from Ruth Phillips to Kay Wilson, Paul Smith and others

                   re suspense account 22 March 2017, POL00247840).



            268. Through 2017, I was kept apprised of the scoping of Deloitte's work and we

                   discussed how many accounts they wanted to investigate.


            269. In November 2017, a noting paper prepared by Bond Dickinson refers to two

                  Deloitte reports prepared to investigate allegations made by the Claimants

                   pertaining to the reliability of Horizon (Post Office Group Litigation Steering

                   Group Meeting - Noting Paper: Deloitte Reports 3 November 2017,

                  POL00024323). I don't recall this paper and I do not know if I saw it at the time.

                   My recollection is that the formal GLO Sub-Committee was not in place until

                   2018 and I did not have such a meeting on 3 November 2017, according to my

                   diary.


            270. The Bond Dickinson paper notes that the first 'Main IT Report' dealt with

                   allegations that discrepancies in branches were caused by bugs in Horizon. The

                   second report covered allegations that POL operated SAs which held

                   unattributable surpluses, which could be generated from branch accounts,

                   which after a period were swept into POL's profits.


            271. The paper notes that the second report had been reviewed by Mark Underwood

                   and by our legal advisors. It summarises the report's conclusions that controls

                   should be stronger and Deloitte "should be able to establish" if POL benefited in

                   the way alleged by the Claimants by reviewing branch transaction data. There

                   was no confirmation that this next stage of work would be undertaken.


            272. The paper notes that, once finalised, the second Deloitte report would be

                   shared with me for comment. I do not recall ever seeing the Deloitte SA report

                   or having any further discussion about it.



            273. As far as I can recall, the Deloitte work on SAs was never completed. While it

                   was overtaken by the litigation, we were not aware of any materially adverse

                   findings.


            274. Following concerns raised by Lord Arbuthnot in February 2020, KPMG were

                   commissioned to investigate SAs again and the ARC considered a paper that

                   summarised KPMG's findings: "In summary_.. these suspense accounts should

                  not result in Post Office pursuing Postmasters for sums it had or could

                   eventually take to profit. This is because sums housed in suspense accounts

                   are either not taken to a profit and loss account; or relate to unmatched

                   transactions due to customers (not Postmasters); or relate to surpluses rather

                   than shortfalls." It did, for completeness, describe a way in which it was

                   theoretically possible for it to happen (Doc_ARC_Current Operation of

                   Suspense Accounts, 27 July 2020, POL00423922).



            275. It was agreed that KPMG would provide a second report on the same issue but

                   relating to the past which was reviewed in November by the ARC (Doc: ARC

                   Committee Report, 24 November 2020, POL00030907). This reached similar

                   conclusions to the July 2020 report, noting two possible exceptions.

            Accounting treatment of the litigation



            276. As CFO of POL, I was engaged with the accounting treatment of the litigation.



            277. In May 2016, I was involved in discussions with the ARC members and our

                   external auditors whether POL should disclose the GLO claim in our accounts

                   now that it had been formally lodged in the High Court (Email from Carla Stent

                   to Alisdair Cameron and Tim Franklin CC'ing Peter McIver RE: Conversation

                   with EY team relating to Post Office ARC meeting 26 May 2015 POL00241640).

                   It was noted that the GLO was an unqualified claim which POL's management

                   considered to be unjustified and intended to robustly defend.


            278. Discussion of the accounting treatment of the litigation and what was

                   appropriate disclosure in each year's accounts was debated several times. In

                   particular, we discussed how we might value the claim (given that it had not yet

                   been quantified by the Claimants) and whether there was a liability that needed

                   to be provided for.



            279. At a meeting of the ARC on 28 June 2016 (Post Office Limited Audit, Risk and

                   Compliance Committee Minutes 28 June 2016, POL00021446), it was noted

                   that following an estimate from the Claimants in their skeleton argument that

                   their claims were worth up to £90 million, EY had recommended that POL

                   disclose this figure in their accounts. Following a discussion, it was concluded

                   that while the existing draft disclosure in the contingent liability note needed to

                   be expanded, disclosure of the estimated claim value might not be a reliable

                   reflection of the actual value of that claim, and POL's strong preference was not

                   to disclose the estimated figure. This was subsequently accepted by EY in July

                   2017 and the estimate was not referred to in their audit report.


            280. In early July 2018, I sponsored a report which considered the accounting

                   treatment of the GLO against IAS 37 (Post Office Group Litigation Report 1 July

                   2018, POL00120814). The report noted that, taking into account all available

                   evidence including the advice of independent experts, our legal advisors and

                   Leading Counsel, it was "possible although not probable" that a present

                   obligation existed, making the GLO a contingent liability requiring disclosure.

                   This report concluded that POL should disclose the claim in the 2017/18 annual

                   report as a contingent liability under the definition in IAS 37.


            281. Following this report, an internal panel at EY tested the arguments put forward

                   in respect of the disclosure of the liability (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Jane

                   Macleod RE: POL Contingent Liability Issue and Outstanding Items 16 July

                   2018, POL00255796).


            282. In later email exchanges with EY, they confirmed that the claim was a

                   contingent liability and did not need to be disclosed in their audit opinion. There

                   was subsequent internal discussion with General Counsel regarding the

                   appropriate wording for the disclosure of the claim as a contingent liability (E

                  POL00021447). Following this discussion, management agreed to support PWC

                   (our new external auditors), to seek advice from Counsel why it was difficult to

                   set down a reliable estimate of the claim's value.



            284. In June 2019 as POL turned more to the possibility of settlement of the GLO, we

                   considered that given the Claimants had still not fully quantified their claim, it

                   remained impossible for POL to come up with an effective estimate for

                   disclosure or provision in the annual report, although we could speculate on the

                   potential range of settlement costs (Email Chain from Alisdair Cameron to Tim

                  Parker, Ben Foat and Alan Watts re: FW: Letter from Kelly Tolhurst MP Re POL

            285. It was also noted by the Shareholder Representative that it was important to be

                   aware that disclosure in POL's accounts of speculative figures could have

                   significant implications for the ultimate cost of settlement and cause concerns in

                   the Department which POL would need to be able to address (Email from

            286. In January and February 2019 my involvement in the GLO was limited. There

                   was a meeting of the GLO Sub-Committee on 11 February 2019, and I was

                   copied in on a note from Paula Vennells to various members of the GE

                  POL00176667) I do not recall seeing any further correspondence in this chain.



            287. During March 2019 I was increasingly acting as the Interim CEO in Paula's

                   absence and this was formally confirmed in April.


            288. I therefore took a lead with the Executive team when we received the news on 8

                   March 2019 that POL had lost the CIT on all counts, that Mr Justice Fraser had

                   found that the Postmaster contract was relational (which POL had disputed),

                   and that he had therefore found various implied terms in that contract that POL

                   had not been enforcing. The judgment was extremely critical of POL.


            289. 1 was in correspondence with Jane MacLeod between 8 and 11 March 2019 and

                   we agreed that a Board call should be set for 12 March 2019, which I had

                   discussed with the Chairman (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod in

                   response to proposed email to Post Office Board following the judgement in the

                   also proposed the content of a note to be circulated to the Board ahead of the

                   scheduled call. Initial areas of focus included the legal approach, operational

                   reactions, IT, Agents, communications and stakeholder management as well as

                   governance, funding and budget considerations (Email from Alisdair Cameron to

            290. My immediate concern when we received the CIT judgment was that we did not

                   allow immediate reactions to develop into a crisis of confidence, especially

                   among Postmasters. I was keen to ensure my colleagues remained focused on

                   delivering the agreed contingency plan, and wrote to reassure that "this is

                  manageable if we manage it... so lets crack on, reassuring any wobblers as we

                   go." (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod, Mark R Davis, Melanie

                   Corfield and others re GLO Decision and resulting actions required 8 March

                   2019, POL00136433).


            291. This was also set out in my proposed wording to the Board, which I sent to Jane

                   MacLeod on 11 March 2019 "The Executive Team views such an extreme

                   verdict as a potential crisis and the outcome will depend on how we manage the

                   situation..."(Email from Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod RE: Board Call on

                   the GLO - Legally privileged and confidential 11 March 2019, POL00154694).


            292. On 15 March 2019, a standard email was sent on my behalf to Fujitsu which

                   had been written to important third parties informing them of the nature of the

                  judgment. I emphasised that POL was taking the strong criticisms from the

                  judgment very seriously and would be taking action as necessary, including

                   accelerating investigation of problems raised and stepping up training and

                   support. I acknowledged in a further email that this was not appropriate for

                   Fujitsu as we had already directly discussed the judgment with them (Email

            293. A key area of managing the adverse outcome of the CIT was POL's external

                   communications. On 12 and 13 March 2019, there were a series of emails

                   between Mark Davies, myself and others, regarding the preparation of a

                   statement for the media on the CIT judgment



            294. Initially the expectation was that the media statement would come from me as

                   interim CEO and I favoured wording that was open and demonstrated our

                   intention to reflect seriously on the issues raised. In my draft wording, I used

                   language such as "we will not simply put up a defence, we will face up to the

                   criticisms and take action" (DRAFT OVERALL MEDIA STATEMENT — in

                   strictest confidence, legally privileged — subject to legal advice, 15 March 2019,

                  POL00267739). and (Email chain from Alisdair Cameron to Mark R Davies,

                   Jane MacLeod cc'ing Melanie Corfield and others re: Draft media statement, 13

                   March 2019, POL00163485).



            295. There was debate about the content of the statement internally, and it was

                   decided that the statement would come from the Chairman as I was not yet

                   announced as Interim CEO. He agreed the final version of the wording with

                   Mark Davies and the tone was much more standard, for example "the Judge's

                   comments remind us that we must always continue to do better... We have

                   taken his criticism on board."



            296. I felt then and still believe that managing down the criticism, and the need to

                   change, in the media statement following the CIT judgment was an opportunity

                   lost to re-set views within POL and externally.

            297. On 15 April 2019 I gave a speech to the NFSP in my role as Interim CEO. In

                   internal discussions, I was advised to use language which aligned with the

                   messaging already agreed in relation to the judgment and ultimately followed

                   this counsel (Email from Jane MacLeod to Alisdair Cameron and others re

                   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE: Key note

                   speech 11 April 2019, POL00270605).


            Financial and operational issues raised by the CIT judgment


            298. On 22 March 2019 I sponsored a report on POL's Operational Responses to the

                   GLO ("Operational Responses report") (POL Operational Responses to the

                   GLO 22 March 2019, POL00269350). The Operational Responses report set up

                   workstreams to deal with the impact of the CIT judgment and set out key

                   questions to be addressed for each. Each workstream had executive owners.


            299. The workstreams were as follows:


            •      Legal: enabling POL to make changes in line with the judgment that would

                   stand the test of time, in areas such as contract variations, suspensions and the

                   Branch Trading Statement.


            •      Operations: to deliver new processes. This would include a new process for

                   managing differences in branch accounts with built-in transparency and

                   independence. There would also be a programme to reduce errors. This was

                   put into place quickly and in the CEO Report I noted that we were already

                   changing the structure in Chesterfield where the Postmaster support centre

                                                                                                  WI TN09840100

                   operated with a new team focused on disputes in branches (CEO Report - The

                   GLO Author: Al Cameron, 30 April 2019, POL00273832).



            •      Agents (Postmasters): To identify the balance of remuneration, simplification,

                   support and lower costs that would make the proposition of working as a

                  Postmaster more attractive.



            •      Other workstreams included Communications; Stakeholders; IT/Horizon; Brand;

                   and Financials.


             300. I was responsible for managing stakeholders and observed that "if Postmasters

                 remained in BAU [business as usual] mode, largely reassured and pleased with

                 changes, stakeholders will also relax." (POL Operational Responses to the GLO

                 22 March 2019 POL00269350). It was my belief that the key was to make

                 progress with the Postmasters.


             301. This paper also set out for the Board the need for cultural change, which would

                   require a material shift in attitude and behaviour, including Branch Hub

                   investment and improved training. To do so POL would need to be open to

                   criticism and demonstrate willingness to change.



             302. Financially, we signalled to the Board that supporting Postmasters would

                   change the budget for 2019 - 2020, which was not approved until the 30 April

                   2019 Board and was still subject to UKGI confirmation. In total, approximately

                   £22 million of additional spend was budgeted, with £12 million of additional

                   operating costs, including £5 million of specific changes to Postmaster

                   remuneration (Meeting minutes: minutes of Board meeting held on 30th April

                   2019, POL00021565).


             303. In June 2019, also reflecting the likely outturn of the Banking Framework

                   negotiations, a Postmaster Remuneration increase worth £17 million per annum

                   was announced (Letter from Al Cameron to Kelly Tolhurst MP re: follow up from

                   meeting on 15 May 4 June 2019, UKG100010232) with a further review to report

                   in the Autumn.


             304. A further financial implication of the CIT judgment was that while POL had to be

                   able to recover taxpayer money that was used as cash in branches, it would

                   now be harder to do so in practice (Email Chain from Alisdair Cameron to Tim

                  Parker, Ben Foat and Alan Watts re: FW: Letter from Kelly Tolhurst MP Re POL

                   (May 2019) — Legally Privileged 2 June 2019, POL00103569).


             305. Reviewing the documents from that time, I am struck by how immediately

                   sought to see a change of position, attitude and operational behaviour at POL

                   following the outcome of the CIT judgment, backed up financially. With

                   hindsight, my sense is that the CIT judgment played into my existing frustrations

                   such as the advice not to improve the contract while the litigation was going on,

                   and I wanted to remedy the issues highlighted in the judgment effectively.


             306. For example, Debbie Smith (Retail Director) had convinced me through 2018

                   that POL was not treating Postmasters as well as a retailer would treat staff in

                   its shops, and we had started considering how to improve this position. In my

                   role as interim CEO I began to prioritise making Postmasters jobs easier,

                   supported by POL's improving finances. It is my view that, although it was an

                   adverse outcome, the CIT judgment allowed POL to utilise Trading Profit in

                   2019 — 2020 in a way that might not have attracted Board support previously.


            Legal Strategy following CIT judgment

             307. As I have indicated, the CIT judgment was extremely critical of POL, including

                   its approach to the litigation thus far. Part of my immediate reaction to the CIT

                  judgment was that we had been badly served by our legal advice, given the

                   adverse outcome. I wanted the advice POL received in future to be easier to

                   challenge. However, despite the scale of the loss in the CIT, there was no

                   immediate change to POL's proposed legal strategy.



             308. Instead, very shortly after we received the CIT judgment, I received

                   correspondence from Jane MacLeod setting out proposals including appealing

                   the judgment and an application for Mr Justice Fraser (the Judge presiding over

                   the GLO) to recuse himself (see further from paragraph 311) (Email chain from

                   Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod RE: Board sequencing 16 March 2019,

                  POL00268475). Jane had brought in Lord Neuberger (former president of the

                   Supreme Court) and Lord Grabiner QC (as he then was) to advise POL on

                   these issues. I was uncomfortable that they came from the same chambers as

                  David Cavender QC.



             309. I was keen for some independent advice and we involved the firm Norton Rose

                   Fulbright in discussions from that point to act as a check and balance to the

                   decisions we were making (Email chain from Alisdair Cameron to Jane

                   Report - The GLO Author: Al Cameron 30 April 2019 POL00273832).



             310. We also had a change in General Counsel. Jane MacLeod left the business and

                   Ben Foat ("Ben") was appointed General Counsel in May 2019.



             Decision to make application for recusal of Mr Justice Fraser


             311. As early as 14 March 2019, our legal team sought advice from Lord Neuberger

                   on a potential application by POL for Mr Justice Fraser to recuse himself from

                   the remainder of the GLO (Email from Jane MacLeod to Jane MacLeod RE:

                   Litigation Options 15 March 2019, POL00268060). POL received Lord

                   Neuberger's advice shortly thereafter, which was broadly that POL had good

                   prospects in a recusal application (Advice by Lord Neuberger on the recusal

                   application 14 March 2019 POL00025910). This advice was caveated: he had

                   looked "only very cursorily' at the materials but expressed concerns that the CIT

                  judgment was "wrong in principle and unfair in practice".


             312. The advice was shared with me by Jane who proposed that POL instruct Lord

                   Grabiner QC to present the recusal application. Most of the following

                   discussions were happening concurrently with discussions regarding an appeal

                   of the CIT judgment (see from paragraph 329).



             313. My recollections are that recusal was a new concept to me and an

                   uncomfortable one, because it seemed radical, aggressive and played to the

                   sense that POL was arrogant. The application also conflicted with my desire for

                  POL to be visibly open to change. I recall the Shareholder Representative felt

                   similarly uncomfortable.


             314. However, the legal advice was that the decision on recusal was urgent as

                   arguments about unfairness had to be made in the recusal rather than forming

                   part of any appeal of the CIT judgment. If we did not challenge quickly, POL

                   would look like we had consented to the criticisms in the CIT judgment and Mr

                   Justice Fraser's approach. We only had a number of days from receiving the

                   CIT judgment and legal advice in which to make the decision (POL Board

                   Meeting - Minutes of a call of the Board of Directors of POLTD 18 March 2019,

                  POL00027594).


             315. On 18 March and 20 March 2019 Jane MacLeod held conferences with Lord

                   Grabiner QC to discuss the decision on a recusal application (Note of

                   conferences on 18/3/2019 and 20/3/2019 with Lord Grabiner QC,

                  POL00006397). Lord Grabiner is quoted as saying that the CIT judgment was

                   "unbelievable nonsense and demonstrated apparent bias".


             316. During the second Board dial-in on 20 March 2019, Jane summarised for the

                   Board that "there was no practical alternative."The legal advice was strong that

                  POL should make a recusal application and not to do so would have a

                   detrimental impact on not only the remaining trials but also would destabilise the

                   business. Lord Neuberger had supported Lord Grabiner's view and "thought that

                  not taking the aggressive course (recusal) carried more risk than taking it from a

                  legal basis." (POL Board Meeting - Minutes of a call of the Board of Directors of

                  POLT 18 March 2019 POL00027594).

             317. On 20 March 2019, following internal discussions, the Board met to decide

                 whether to apply for Mr Justice Fraser to recuse himself as the judge presiding

                 over the GLO. A report on this decision was prepared by myself and Jane in

                 preparation for this decision (Post Office Limited The Board of Directors

                 Discussion Paper — The Background to Recusal and other issues 20 March 2019,

                 POL00103473). This paper set out three options for POL; to continue our original

                 legal strategy of working through the trials scheduled with Mr Justice Fraser

                 despite concerns following the CIT judgment; apply for recusal for the opportunity

                 to continue the trials under a different judge; or seek settlement. The Chairman

                 and Shareholder Representative were conflicted from voting in the decision on

                 recusal but were present at the Board meeting.



             318. During the final Board call, the Board discussed the legal advice we had

                 received and that there would be an increased risk of an adverse outcome in

                 future trials if Mr Justice Fraser continued to preside (Board call GLO 20 March

                 2019, POL00021563). The main argument of force against making the

                 application was the near-term reputational impact and risk of further alienating Mr

                 Justice Fraser if it was unsuccessful, although it was noted that his views were

                 already pronounced in the CIT judgment. Norton Rose Fulbright attended to

                 provide independent advice and concluded that while there were risks, the

                 greater upside in making a recusal application outweighed them. My view was

                 that the final decision was balanced. In the end however, the strength of the legal

                 advice meant that the Board supported a resolution for a recusal application with

                 Lord Grabiner QC to be instructed.

             319. My recollection of these meetings is that we were very uncomfortable with

                   having to make this decision. Personally, I recall being influenced by a

                   suggestion at one of these meetings, which was not minuted, that, if upheld, Mr

                   Justice Fraser's finding that the Postmaster contract was a relational contract

                   would, over the next year or two, make it impossible for the Post Office to

                   function because we could not operate individual contracts with implied terms

                   with that number of Postmasters. It was my concern about the effect of the CIT

                  judgment on POL's sustainability as a business that ultimately swayed me into

                   following our legal advice and supporting an application for recusal.



             320. It became evident in the weeks and months following the CIT judgment that the

                   impact of a relational contract was not as feared, that each time POL would

                   seek to enforce an element of the Postmaster contract the Postmaster would

                   challenge the application of the individual contract in those circumstances, and

                   this would be overwhelming for POL. Postmasters largely did not challenge the

                   way POL implemented their contracts following the CIT judgment.


             321. In the end the recusal application had been made less than a month after POL

                   received the CIT judgment. Had we had more time and been able to consider

                   this fully, I do not believe that we would have supported a recusal application.


             322. On 21 March 2019, proposed wording was circulated for a press statement on

                  POL's anticipated recusal application (Email from Mark R Davies to Jane

                   MacLeod, Alisdair Cameron cc Mark Underwood, Patrick Bourke, Melanie

                   Corfield RE: Statement 21 March 2019, POL00269061). I provided my

                   comments on the proposed wording and pushed for the statement to focus on

                  POL's need to change rather than the anticipated strength of our defence. I also

                   recognised that the advice from our legal advisors (both new and previous) was

                   that recusal was both justified and necessary to protect Post Offices (Email from

                   Cameron RE: Statement: legally privileged and strictly confidential 21 March

                   2019, POL00269063).


             323. On 9 April 2019 Jane MacLeod updated us that the recusal application had

                   been refused but, unexpectedly, POL's application for permission to appeal that

                   decision was also refused (see further below from paragraph 329) (Email from

                   Jane MacLeod to Alisdair Cameron, Thomas Cooper, CC Avene Regan and

                   others re: Post Office - Recusal Application - confidential and subject to legal

                   privilege - do not forward 9 April 2019, POL00359925). Subsequently the

                   question became whether to appeal the CIT judgment to the Court of Appeal

                   separately, or in conjunction with an appeal on the recusal decision.



             324. In my response to Jane's update on the outcome of the recusal application, I

                   pointed out that this assumed that POL was happy to appeal the recusal

                   decision without further debate, and in particular the grounds for appeal of the

                   CIT judgment and whether the two appeals would be joined needed discussion.

                   Cavender QC had reacted emotionally to the CIT judgment and was no longer

                   able to give us the best advice in relation to the recusal appeal or POL's legal

                   strategy more broadly.


             326. The tension between the legal advice and the Board's concerns are partly

                   evidenced in my Interim CEO report to the Board on 30 April. It was decided

                   that POL would proceed with the recusal and CIT judgment appeals separately,

                   against legal advice. (CEO Report - The GLO Author: Al Cameron 30 April 2019,

                  POL00273832). My recollection is that this decision was motivated by concerns

                   that the more controversial unfairness arguments in the recusal application

                   could undermine the more conventional grounds for appealing the CIT

                  judgment.


             327. On 11 May 2019 Ben Foat notified us that POL had lost the recusal appeal

                   argument (Email from Ben Foat to Alan Watts, Kirtsen Massey, CC Alisdair

                   and highly confidential 11 May 2019, POL00360195). On 13 May 2019 I wrote

                   to the GLO Sub-Committee and HSF that "recusal is finished' and we should

                   put together a team to settle the case (Email from Alisdair Cameron To Tim

             328. On 4 June 2019, as part of a broader discussion about the impact the litigation

            Decision to appeal CIT judgment



             329. As set out above, many of the discussions regarding whether POL should

                   appeal the CIT judgment were running concurrently to those regarding the

                   recusal application and are contained in the same documents. However, for

                   ease I have separated these issues in my statement.



             330. On 15 March 2019 Jane MacLeod provided a note to me, the Shareholder

                   Representative and the Chairman setting out advice from Lord Neuberger on a

                   potential recusal application (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Thomas Cooper

                   re. URGENT Litigation Options - Confidential and Subject to Legal Privilege 15

                   March 2019, POL00103438). The Shareholder Representative replied that he

                   was more comfortable with appeal than recusal, a view that I think was largely

                   shared.


            331.On 18 March 2019, during a call with the Board and Lord Neuberger to discuss

                   legal advice in respect of the CIT judgment appeal (and recusal), we were

                   informed that any appeal of the CIT judgment had to be submitted within 21

                   days, making it less urgent than the recusal issue although still pressing. (POL

                   Board Meeting - Minutes of a call of the Board of Directors of POLTD 18 March

                   2019 POL00027594). During this meeting, Lord Neuberger presented options to

                   the Board and arguments for not accepting the CIT judgment. In particular, in

                   his view, Mr Justice Fraser had accepted evidence into the CIT which was not

                   relevant. The Board put various questions to Lord Neuberger and it was

                   acknowledged that this was a difficult decision. POL wanted to be clear that

                   even while appealing, the business was still committed to making operational

                   changes and improvements.


             332. On 20 March 2019, during the same Board call that the recusal application was

                   discussed and approved, the Board agreed to seek permission to appeal the

                   CIT judgment (call GLO 20 March 2019, POL00021563).


             333. As set out above, the initial recusal application was refused on 9 April 2019

                   (Emails re recusal application 9 April 2019, POL00359925). On 14 April 2019 1

                   received an update from Jane that the application to the Court of Appeal for

                   permission to appeal the recusal decision had been filed. I was advised that

                  POL should consider filing the appeal of the CIT judgment decision without

                   approaching Mr Justice Fraser so that those appeals could be heard together by

                   the Court of Appeal (Email chain including Jane MacLeod (POL); Ruth Cowley

                   Litigation Update 14 April 2019, POL00270753).


             334. During April 2019, POL's legal team and our advisors debated the grounds for

                   appeal of the CIT judgment (Email from Andrew Parsons to Jane MacLeod c.c.

                   Amy Prime, Ben Foat: Subject 'Catch Up 17 April 2019, POL00006513). I note

                   that I was not copied into this correspondence and do not recall debating the

                   potential grounds for appeal in detail other than as outlined in Board minutes.


             335. However, following fuller discussion by the Board, and as above, POL decided

                   against legal advice to separate the recusal appeal and the CIT judgment

                   appeal on 30 April 2019 (CEO Report 30 April 2019, POL00273832).

             336. Once the appeals had been separated, during May 2019 we focused on the

                   nature of the CIT judgment appeal and whether the unfairness arguments or

                   even a "recusal lite" argument should be included given the recusal application

                   (and the application to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal against the

                   refusal of that application) had been unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal had

                   made clear its criticisms of the recusal application and it was acknowledged that

                   we needed to reassess our approach to the appeal against the CIT judgment to

                   reflect this (Email from Ben Foat to Alan Watts, Kirtsen Massey, CC Alisdair

                   Cameron and others re: Group Litigation - recusal application - legally privileged

                   and highly confidential 11 May 2019, POL00360195).


             337. During these discussions, I echoed the view of the Shareholder Representative

                   that the current legal strategy was lining POL up for further criticism. I proposed

                   urgent consideration of whether the appeal grounds should be narrowed to pure

                   points of legal interpretation of the contract rather than echoing the

                   unsuccessful unfairness arguments in the recusal application (Email from

                   others re: RE: Post Office trial 12 May 2019, UKG100043848).



             338. During POL's consideration of the grounds of appeal of the CIT judgment, David

                   Cavender QC continued to hold onto the original legal strategy including broad

                   appeal grounds (Email from Alisdair Cameron To Tim Parker, Thomas Cooper,

                   to POL's application for permission to appeal the CIT judgment, where he

                   described the relationship between Mr Justice Fraser and David Cavender QC

                   as "strained" and when POL's application was subsequently refused (Email from

                   Ben Foat to Alisdair Cameron re: Group Litigation- Legally Privileged — Highly

                   Confidential on 23 May 2019 POL00275357), we decided to appoint a different

                   silk (Helen Davies QC — as she then was) to lead a narrower and less

                   combative appeal of the CIT judgment which better reflected POL's adapted

                   approach to the litigation. I was supportive of this narrower approach to the

                   appeal (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Alan Watts, Kirsten Massey, Ben Foat

                   and Others re GLO Pre Meet and Sub Committee — Legally Privileged and

                   Confidential 7 June 2019, POL00103576).



             339. The GLO Sub-Committee subsequently met on 12 June 2019 and approved

                   grounds of appeal of the CIT judgment that had been reduced by Helen Davies

                   QC from 55 to 8 pages. The appeal grounds removed the arguments relating to

                   procedural unfairness and did not "defend any clauses within the contract that

                   we did not think defensible" (Post Office Limited Minutes of Postmaster

                   Litigation Subcommittee Held on 12 June 2019, POL00103595). This carefully

                   reasoned approach felt much more comfortable and appropriate than the

                   strategy put forward by the Silks instructed previously by POL.


             340. On 27 June 2019, HSF informed us that following a restrictive order from Mr

                   Justice Coulson which surprised Helen Davies QC in "both content and tone",

                   she was reconsidering whether POL might avoid the CIT judgment appeal

                   application being heard by that Judge. I expressed concerns in response to this

                   that we were not changing our approach but appeared to be "doubling down".

                   refused.


            The Horizon Issues trial (HIT)


             341. As set out above, the second trial in the GLO was the HIT and was scheduled to

                   start in March 2019. On 11 February 2019, Paula Vennells wrote to colleagues

                   and copied me expressing "serious concerns" about Fujitsu's witness

                   statements, asking Jane MacLeod and Rob Houghton to have a "frank" phone

                   call with Fujitsu, and seeking better clarity on our defence (Email from Paula

                  Vennells to Rob Houghton, Jane MacLeod, Rodric Williams and others RE:

                   Fujitsu Call 11 February 2019, POL00176667). This followed supplementary

                   evidence submitted by the Claimants which set out new lines of argument. I do

                   not recall seeing any replies to this correspondence.


             342. On 21 February 2019 the GLO Sub-Committee minutes recorded that in the

                   view of POL's Silk, Anthony de Garr Robinson QC ("Tony Robinson QC" as he

                   then was), Horizon was "critically robust" and that while POL was not seeking to

                   prove that the system did not have any bugs, it accurately recorded data in most

                   cases and that bugs identified to date could be explained (Meeting Minutes of

                   the Group Litigation Subcommittee of POL 21 February 2019, POL00006753).

                   This was part of a brief to the GLO Sub-Committee ahead of the start of the HIT.


             343. As part of a discussion of the risks of the HIT, this meeting also covered remote

                   access. Tony Robinson QC reported that the case on remote access from

                   Fujitsu had changed over time, and while initially Fujitsu had said that remote

                   access was not possible, the Deloitte investigatory audit had found that it was.

                   The Claimant's IT expert was arguing that the scope of remote access was

                   even greater than currently stated, and the Court was likely to test this

                   allegation fully. It was also confirmed that only Fujitsu could change data and

                   there was no suggestion that PO had ever operated a policy to get Fujitsu to

                   manipulate the branch data.


             344. Reading this now, I am struck by the reference to a Deloitte audit, which I do not

                   recall ever seeing. As noted in paragraph 37 my involvement in Deloitte's work

                   was limited to Suspense Accounts. I do not remember noticing this reference at

                   the time.


             345. Generally, the discussion on remote access did not strike me as significant as

                   my understanding was that the Claimants were fully aware that it was possible

                   in preparations for the litigation: Jane MacLeod had flagged this on 28

                   November 2016 in emails that made it clear that the issue was being discussed

                   with a QC and that the Claimants would be notified (Email Re: Postmaster

             346. On 7 March 2019, shortly before the HIT was due to begin, Jane wrote to

                 confirm that both parties' experts had agreed that Horizon was "relatively robust"

                 and therefore Mr Justice Fraser could not find otherwise (Email from Jane

             347. However, despite the experts' conclusions we remained deeply anxious about

                   the possible findings from the HIT, particularly given the conclusions that Mr

                   Justice Fraser had reached about POL in the CIT judgment. During discussions

                   of the CIT judgment, there was therefore a focus on the need to ensure POL

                   had a clear view on the reliability of Horizon (Board call GLO 20 March 2019,

                  POL00021563).


             348. On 20 March 2019, Rod Williams from POL's legal team noted in a HIT update

                   that during cross-examination the Claimants had been largely successful in

                   demonstrating that POL's reliance on Horizon was "overstated and blinkered",

                   that POL was withholding data which could assist in resolving branch

                   accounting issues from Postmasters and that improvements to the system were

                   "overstated" (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Rodric Williams, Jane MacLeod

                   RE: Update on Horizon Issues Trial - Post Office Group Litigation 20 March

                   2019, POL00268869).



             349. In my reply to this update, I stated that I did not disagree with some aspects of

                   the findings and asked whether POL could demonstrate that even where

                   criticisms are well-founded that did not mean Horizon generated the losses

                   complained of. I considered whether we might accept some of the points made

                   and emphasised that POL's strategy was to rectify some of the cultural

                   underpinnings that still existed in relation to the issues. I was advised in

                   response that the focus of the case was overall Horizon robustness and that

                   evidence from witnesses should not be relevant given the trial was to be

                   decided on expert evidence about technical issues (Email from Rodric Williams

             350. I took this on board and remained anxious about preserving the experts'

                   "relatively robust" finding, suggesting on 3 June 2019 that the GLO Sub-

                   Committee should consider the HIT strategy so Mr Justice Fraser did not go

                   beyond the expert witness remit of this trial (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Ben

             351. On 7 June 2019 Rod Williams reported that the Claimants' IT expert in cross-

                   examination admitted that he was not aware of any instance where transaction

                   data had been remotely deleted or edited, and that Fujitsu "insertions into

                   transaction data... were very rare, only done when necessary and carried out

                   with great care" (Email from Rodric Williams to Alisdair Cameron, Rob

                   Houghton, Mark R Davies & others cc Catherine Hamilton, Mark Underwood,

                   Office Group Litigation 7 June 2019, POL00026043). This was helpful evidence

                   to POL's case, although with hindsight I feel that we perhaps focused too

                   greatly on good news rather than the overall direction of the HIT. The HIT was

                   concluded on 2 July 2019 and we awaited the final judgment.


             352. On 2 October 2019, before the HIT judgment was handed down (but after the

                   trial had concluded) Ben Foat reported to Nick Read, myself, Alan Watts and

                   Mark Davies that there had been a disclosure incident regarding Fujitsu's

                   Known Error Logs ("KELs"). POL had relied upon Fujitsu's evidence that old

                   versions of the KELs were overwritten and no longer existed. However, Fujitsu

                   had now reported that the relevant logs had been found (Email from Ben Foat to

                   Nick Read, Alistair and Mark Davies cc: Shikha Hornsey, Rodric Williams,

                   Sherrill Taggart, RE GLO — Disclosure Incident 2 October 2019, POL00026216).

                   As a result, POL had given inaccurate information to the Court which could

                   influence the verdict in HIT and change our perception of the case. It also

                   brought into real question POL's credibility, particularly given we had already

                   been criticised In respect of the approach to managing disclosure In the

                   litigation.



             353. I replied on 3 October 2019 in respect of the KELs disclosure incident

                   emphasising my distress and that POL needed to tell the Court immediately. I

                   also noted that this was the third time we had been misled by Fujitsu (Email

                   chain from Alisdair Cameron to Ben Foat cc Nick Read and Mark R Davies Re:

                   GLO Disclosure Incident re. KEL logs 3 October 2019, POL00112591). During a

                   subsequent Board meeting to discuss the disclosure incident we considered

                   whether this was likely to impact the experts' assessments of Horizon, and that

                   it would need to be factored into POL's contingency planning.



             354. On 22 October 2019, the GLO Sub-Committee met to consider a detailed

                   update on changes since the contingency planning was first implemented for

                   the HIT. This paper assumed a worst-case outcome, where Postmasters might

                   refuse to open branches, and outlined possible responses from enhanced

                   monitoring to preparing for "pop-up" Post Offices (PO GLO Board Sub-

                   implemented, it reflects the sense of potential crisis as we awaited the outcome

                   of the HIT judgment.



             355. On 4 December 2019, Ben Foat sponsored a paper to provide a HIT Judgment

                   Contingency Planning Update (Horizon Issues Trial Judgment Contingency

                  Planning Update 4 December 2019, POL00129086). This paper was intended

                   to provide reassurance that POL was prepared to respond to potential

                   operational impacts following the HIT judgment and that these measures could

                   be refined and adapted quickly to suit the outcome and reassure Postmasters.

                   The paper also acknowledged the likely sources of historical claims including

                   suspension pay, notice periods and repaying shortfalls. This contingency

                   planning operated in conjunction with tactical meetings on settlement (see from

                   paragraph 358).



             356. On 9 December 2019, we received the embargoed HIT judgment, which found

                   that the latest version of Horizon was relatively robust. However, the remainder

                   of the judgment, including the conclusions on the robustness of historic versions

                   of Horizon (Legacy), were adverse to POL and the Claimant's expert evidence

                   had been preferred. Mr Justice Fraser concluded that there was a material risk

                   that bugs in older versions of Horizon had caused shortfalls in branches.



             357. As a result of the HIT judgment, Ben Foat noted that Horizon contingency

                   planning should now be implemented as POL could expect to receive claims

                   based on historical shortfalls, and analysis would need to begin in respect of

                  Postmasters who had convictions on the basis of evidence of Horizon (Email

                  POL00043341).



            Mediation and settlement of the litigation


             358. Mediation had been considered as part of the litigation strategy at least from

                   January 2019 where, during a meeting of the GLO Sub-Committee, it was

                   reported that both sides in the claim had agreed that it was better to receive the

                   CIT and Horizon judgments before entering into mediation. We considered

                   during this meeting whether the Claimant group could be categorised for

                   mediation purposes, for example to exclude those with a criminal conviction, or

                   whose claim was out of time (Meeting Minutes of the Postmaster Litigation

                   Subcommittee of POL 28 January 2019, POL00006756).



             359. During the discussions on recusal, settlement was set out as one option

                   however it was highlighted that Claimants who had already been through

                   mediation were now part of the GLO, and settlement would not prevent further

                   claims in the future. As set out in earlier sections, our legal advice at that time

                   was to continue to robustly defend the claims (POL00103473).



             360. However, following the refused recusal application appeal on 13 May 2019 1

                   asked the GLO Sub-Committee to put together a settlement team

                   (POL00103539). It had been my gut reaction to the CIT judgment that POL

                   should change its legal strategy due to the scale of the loss and criticism we

                   received. However, it took 2 months to make the necessary change to POL's

                   legal team (see above paragraph 217).

             361. On 24 May 2019, during internal correspondence I set out that if POL's only

                   priority was to minimise negative brand impact, we should consider settling the

                   GLO at that stage and create an independent process to manage historical

                   issues. However, I acknowledged that step had potential consequences (Email

                   from Patrick Bourke to Mark Davies re: Brand, press coverage and solutions 24

                   May 2019, POL00118056).


             362. On 3 June 2019, I asked Ben Foat to add to the agenda for the upcoming GLO

                 Sub-Committee meeting to "Propose an approach to settlement (timing,

                 approach, team, remit and governance)."(Email from Alisdair Cameron to Ben

                 privileged 3 June 2019 POL00275871). The following day I emphasised in a

                 further note copying in the Shareholder Representative that settlement was now

                 "Plan A" (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Alan Watts, Ben Foat cc'd Thomas

             363. On 7 June 2019 I provided an update to the GLO Sub-Committee, noting that

                   Alan Watts' plan for settlement was to go to mediation first, helping us to better

                   gauge settlement and reassure Mr Justice Fraser that POL was keen to make

                   progress (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Alan Watts, Kirsten Massey, Ben Foat

                   reporting to me and subsequently reporting to Nick Read. As Nick was CEO

                   from September 2019, he worked with HSF on the final stages of the

                   settlement, and I took a step back.

             364. The nature of an emerging settlement was discussed by the GLO Sub-

                   Committee on 17 September 2019 (Post Office Limited Postmaster Litigation

                   Subcommittee Agenda & Minutes 17 September 2019, POL00026939). By this

                   stage, POL's legal strategy was to focus fully on exploring settlement options,

                   based on a review of advice on settlement from HSF. Our discussions were

                   based on an informal understanding of how any settlement was likely to be

                   attributed between the Claimants, their legal team and their funders. It was also

                   acknowledged that HMG approval would be required before any settlement

                   could be reached.



             365. A formal settlement approach (and upper limit figure) was approved by the GLO

                   Sub-Committee on 13 November (Meeting Minutes of the Postmaster Litigation

                   Subcommittee of POL 13 November 2019, POL00006759) and the negotiated

                   settlement (including Claimants legal costs) was approved on 10 December

                   2019. The settlement was not just financial but included agreement that POL

                   would not appeal the HIT judgment and that Brian Altman QC (as he then was)

                   would assess the CCRC cases (Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee Agenda 22

                   January 2020, POL00292587).



             366. Following the agreed settlement on 10 December 2019, there was a debate with

                   the Communications team regarding how we should answer the question about

                   how POL funded the settlement (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Patrick Bourke,

                   Nick Read and Ben Foal RE: Mediation 10 December 2019, POL00290109).

                   This discussion centred around the issue of whether we could confirm that the

                   settlement was not funded from HMG investment or the Network Subsidy. I

            The involvement and role of the Department and UKGI in the litigation


             367. From 11 March 2019 when we received the outcome of the CIT judgment, we

                   noted the need to be communicating with the Department, as Shareholder

                   (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Jane MacLeod RE: Board Call on the GLO -

             368. On 16 March 2019, we had a call with the Department and UKGI to manage the

                   outcome of the CIT judgment. During the meeting the Minister raised a number

                   of concerns regarding the litigation thus far: including concerns that POL's legal

                   advice to date was poor; that POL needed to share more information with the

                  Department; and that she was worried about Postmaster remuneration levels.

                  During the meeting the Chairman confirmed that POL would not seek more

                   financial support as a result of the litigation, and that we were looking for a

                   different person to lead the appeal of the CIT judgment to alleviate concerns

                   regarding our legal advice.

             370. On 19 April 2019, Richard Watson, a UKGI lawyer, reached out to HSF copying

                   the Chairman and myself seeking a discussion on the litigation so that the

                  Department remained updated (Email from Richard Watson to Alisdair Cameron

                   and others re Joining up 17 April 2019, POL00270909).


             371. On 15 May 2019, I attended a meeting with the Minister (Email from Eleanor to

                   Carl Creswell, Craig Watson, Cecilia Vandini re Note of Kelly/Al/Tim meeting on

                  POL — 16 May 2019, UKG100009777). The Minister had the opportunity to raise

                   concerns including why legal counsel "kept getting it wrong", costs of the

                   litigation and reputational damage. We provided reassurance regarding POL's

                   new approach to the litigation. We set out that we would cost out different

                   scenarios in POL's 5-year plan for the July 2019 Board and would share with

                   the Department. We emphasised POL's commitment to improving relationships

                   with Postmasters, although this would take time, and agreed that POL would

                   work more closely with the Department in future to improve public

                   communication with a better tone to admit mistakes and fallibility.



             372. I followed up our commitment to better communicate with the Minster with the

                   Shareholder Representative and a member of the Minister's policy team the

                   same day (Email chain from Carl Creswell to Thomas Cooper, Alisdair Cameron

             373. As we received major updates in the litigation, such as permission to appeal the

                   CIT judgment being refused by Mr Justice Fraser on 23 May 2019, we sought to

                   keep the Department informed, although we had to follow the rules where the

                   updates were embargoed (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Thomas Cooper, Tim

                  POL00103557).


             374. On 2 June 2019, I sent a draft letter for the Chairman to send to the Minister,

                   answering key questions in respect of the current status of the litigation,

                   changes to litigation strategy following the appointment of the new legal team,

                   possible settlement scenarios, an assessment of potential costs of the litigation,

                   operational consequences and confirmation of POL's ability to fund any

                   settlement (Email Chain from Alisdair Cameron to Tim Parker, Ben Foat and

             375. On 4 June 2019, I also sent a formal letter to the Minister focused on

                   commercial matters (Letter from Al Cameron to Kelly Tolhurst MP re: follow up

                   from meeting on 15 May 4 June 2019, UKG100010232). This covered an

                   increase in Postmaster remuneration; the franchising consultation process;

                   asking her views on improving communication; and a number of commercial

                   priorities.


             376. In an email on 7 June 2019, I acknowledged the Minister's anxieties in respect

                   of the litigation (Email from Alisdair Cameron to Alan Watts, Kirsten Massey,

             377. On 28 June 2019 I sent a further letter to the Minister, again with a largely

                   commercial focus but confirming that we were now much more open to

                   information sharing and thanking her for her support to date (Letter to Kelly

                   UKG100010371).



             378. The Minister replied to my letter on 5 July 2019. She recognised our openness

                   to discussing new litigation strategies. She also confirmed that a Department

                   representative would attend the subsequent GLO Sub-Committee meetings

                   (Letter from Kelly Tolhurst MP to Al Cameron - Re: PoL Litigation and

                   engagement with DWP 1 July 2019, UKG100010369). Richard Watson from the

                  Department attended the meetings from 17 September 2019.



             379. After I moved back into the CFO role, responsibility for the relationship with the

                   Minister moved to Nick Read.



            Reflections on the litigation



             380. Over 2018 I had become increasingly convinced that POL needed to change

                   the way we approached the business on several fronts. Most important was

                   building a better, more open, more supportive and more rewarding relationship

                   with Postmasters.



             381. I felt that the litigation had made it harder for us to admit where we needed to do

                   better and to change. The defence was often prioritised over the business.


             382. I therefore reacted to the CIT judgment with a belief that we must change our

                   culture and approach, openly acknowledging criticisms and being publicly

                   determined to change. I was able to obtain Board agreement to investing in

                   some of these objectives in 2019 — 2020.

             383. The change of legal advisors was important and enabled the change of strategy

                   to seeking settlement.


             384. Following the judgments in 2019, I felt that decisions on how POL managed

                   ongoing projects such as the previous criminal convictions, and improved

                   operations, should not lie with those individuals who had presided over the

                   trials. We were unlikely to reassure anyone that POL had changed if the

                   membership of committees such as the GLO Sub-Committee remained

                   unchanged. Similarly, while I agreed to continue to sponsor Operations until

                   Nick Read found a successor, I recommended that different people should

                   assess POL's operations and processes against the requirements of the

                  judgments to ensure an adequate response to the GLO.



             385. In November 2020 I prepared a paper "What Went Wrong? A Draft for

                  Discussion" (19 November 2019, POL00175235). This was drafted for Nick

                   because I was concerned that if we didn't articulate a view on what went wrong,

                   promises that it could not happen again could seem hollow. I intended it as a

                   purely personal view, addressing both what I had seen and what I thought had

                   happened before I joined the business.


             386. In the paper I set out my belief that at the heart of the issues experienced by

                  POL was a culture which stopped us from dealing with Postmasters in a

                   straightforward and acceptable way. This skewed POL's judgements about

                   prosecutions and subsequent management of the litigation. On reflection, I still

                   agree with the conclusions that I reached in this document today.

             387. The paper was discussed with Nick Read, Richard Taylor (then

                   Communications director) and Ben Foat and I believed helped to prompt some

                   cultural challenge for the leadership team in early 2021. I had intended the

                   paper to be a first draft to be built on by others to create a shared narrative for

                  POL to test against in the future. I am not aware that ever happened.



             388. With Nick's agreement, in 2020 I helped bring in Deloitte to provide an

                   independent assessment of which operational objectives following the GLO we

                   believed had been delivered and whether that could be proven to be the case.

                   This proved to be a substantial piece of work with complex areas including the

                   ongoing issues of proving Horizon worked and managing shortfalls in the

                   Network.



            PROSECUTION OF POSTMASTERS



             389. In my previous role within British Gas, at times prosecutions were sought

                   against people who, we believed, stole electricity or gas. Getting the attention

                   and support of the Police was sometimes difficult, depending on their other

                   priorities.


             390. Having an expert, in-house function at POL for prosecutions therefore seemed

                   to me a sensible and pragmatic approach. I understood that POL had no

                   specific powers and that any organisation could work in this way if it had the

                   right skills.



             391. A number of the criminal convictions based on Horizon were not prosecuted by

                  POL, but by state prosecution authorities such as the CPS. This suggests that


                                                       Page 101 of 137
                                                                                                           WI TN09840100
                                                                                                      WI TN09840100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 35848878-14EA-4648-AF01-6881BFF848DD




                  POL acting as prosecutor was not a decisive factor in the miscarriages of

                  justice. However, I do now believe that the separation of investigators and

                   prosecutors is important, and POL should never again act as prosecutor.


             392. Around November 2015, I asked POL's legal team for an updated Prosecutions

                  Policy for the GE. I did this because there were apparently concerns expressed

                   in the Network that a reduction in prosecutions was having an adverse impact

                   (Email from Jane Macleod to Rodric William, John M Scott, Angela Van-Den-

                   Bogerd and others RE: Prosecution policy 13 November 2015, POL00176615).



             393. I do not recall the specific concerns expressed in the Network referred to by

                   Jane MacLeod in her email but as CFO my sense was that the previous years

                   of prosecutions had kept these losses relatively small, that they were growing

                   and that if people did not have to pay for shortfalls, the financial stability of the

                   business would be at risk.


             394. The policy was subsequently presented to the Board and endorsed on 21 March

                   2016 (POL Minutes: Board Meeting held 21 March 2016, POL00027598). I do

                   not recall being asked to provide specific input in relation to the policy.



             395. While prosecutions had ceased as a result of Sparrow, the expectation was that

                   they would be re-started when the legal processes were completed and POL

                   identified expert witnesses that could testify robustly on our behalf in respect of

                   the causes of shortfalls.



             396. Later, in June 2017 I provided a standard update to the GE on issues getting

                 focus within Operations, including the need for further safety equipment to

                 Group 27 June 2016, POL00249527).


             397. I also sent on my note to Jane calling out the FSC's concern "over the ability of

                  legal to respond on the debt collection process." We had been trying to work out

                   how to approach the legal work around debt collection where we considered

                   there were amounts which Postmasters owed to us. These were being provided

                   for as losses.



             398. Following a meeting, I clarified my understanding on 27 June 2017 that: "We

                   should not attempt to prosecute any cases where the losses had arisen from or

                   were identified via trading and Horizon rather than straight theft, until two things

                  happen. First, we complete the Deloitte work on systems reliance. Secondly, the

                   CCRC opine." (Email chain from Ben Foat to Rodric Williams Re: Ops Board

                   and Losses & Crime Group, 27 June 2017, POL00249527).


             399. I felt that our approach should be confirmed in a formal decision and asked the

                   legal team to prepare a brief to discuss with Paula Vennells.



            400. I also suggested we identify a suitable test case for a prosecution which relied

                   on Horizon, and raised a perennial cost concern that if we were not going to use

                   a specialist team that can undertake prosecutions, then it was not sensible

                   financially to continue funding them.

                   use the Horizon system as a defence would be reconsidered once Deloitte had

                   completed their work on Horizon and could be used in court as an expert

                   witness" (Status Report for Post Office Limited 2 August 2017, POL00103308).

                   This demonstrates the settled position at that time was not to prosecute

                  Postmasters until the conclusion of any litigation given the allegations were that

                   Horizon was leading to shortfalls.



            402. Between August and 27 October 2017, I initiated a dialogue with Mark Raymond

                   who led the team that would undertake prosecutions on behalf of POL. I

                   explained to him that any prosecutions were at least a year away and he set out

                   some factors in response which he considered would be needed for a test case.

                   He had raised possible cases for prosecution but acknowledged that due to the

                   current Deloitte review of Horizon underway POL was not in a position to

                   proceed with any prosecutions at that stage (Email from Mark Raymond to

                   Alisdair Raymond and Mark Ellis RE: Cases suitable for prosecution 27 October

                   2017, POL00251125).



            403. In paragraph 136 above, I explained that these issues are unresolved and by

                   April 2023, losses were rising and not being properly investigated. I was very

                   clear that we could not enforce recoveries without the right work being

                   completed. My informal view was and is that POL should not pursue

                  Postmasters for shortfalls through legal action while Horizon is in its current

                   form.

            404. In my executive roles I rarely got involved with issues faced by individual

                  Postmasters, as the primary stakeholder relationship with POL was through the

                   Network or Retail teams. The teams I was responsible for provided operational

                   support and I tended to see that through the lens of collective statistics, control

                   measures, efficiency and cost effectiveness. This was consistent with how I had

                   overseen the running of a call centre in a previous job. However, there were a

                   few individual scenarios that I was made aware of during my tenure which I set

                   out below.



            405. In July 2016, Paula Vennells asked myself and Rob Houghton for a report into

                   the Dalmellington Error bug which was an issue raised in a blog by Tim

                   McCormack. Jane MacLeod responded to Paula's request to reassure Paula

                   that the matters Tim McCormack had raised were subject to review and that

                   they were "on top of this" (Email from Rob Houghton to Gavin Bell and others

                   Re: Dalmellington error in Horizon / problemswithpol 1 July 2016,

                  POL00029993).



            406. I was not copied on the rest of the correspondence following this, which I can

                   now see was concluded with a clear explanation from Fujitsu that the problem

                   was understood and had been resolved, and that monitoring checks had been

                   made to identify any further issues for Postmasters. I am not aware that I was

                   included in any further correspondence with Fujitsu discussing this potential

                   bug.


            407. On 30 October 2017, I was copied into correspondence relating to a sudden

                   closure of a post office in Rutherglen, where concerns were raised that the

                   closure had been without consultation or proper warning. In the correspondence

                   it was identified that the branch had to be closed following the suspension of the

                  Postmaster when an audit identified a loss of £123,000 (Email from Mark R

                  Davies to Linda Bonar, Ruth X Barker, Alice Cookson and others re: Save

                   Rutherglen Post Office 30 October 2017, POL00163217). We discussed that

                   better messaging was needed to explain closures to the public than "operational

                  reasons". I could understand public frustration and wondered if we could be

                   more open to explain that we were investigating issues. However, I can now see

                   that in later emails, into which I was not copied, the communications team

                   advised that it was an extremely complex situation compounded by other events

                   at nearby branches and therefore it was difficult to communicate fuller reasons

                   to the public and media without legal implications. I do not recall having this

                   information at the time.



            408. In February 2018 I was copied by Paula Vennells into correspondence

                   regarding a Postmaster complaint (Email from Paula Vennells to Alisdair

                   Cameron and Debbie Smith re Seaton Post Office and Post Office Ltd 20

                   February 2018, POL00253502). In summary, the complaint was in relation to a

                   nearby branch opening shortly after the Postmaster had newly opened his own

                   branch, and he had concerns about the impact on trading. There was a further

                   perceived lack of consultation in this scenario. In my response I focused less on

                   the specifics of the issue, which were being handled, than POL's issue with

                   "getting the human engagement bit wrong". I acknowledged the difficulties of

                   asking junior employees to take on the burden of dealing with the human side of

                   their work and suggested that POL as a business needed to give more in terms

                   of engagement, training and support through our field ops teams, with a clearer

                   escalation to senior employees to assist.



            409. Much later in June 2019, while I was interim CEO, I was contacted directly by

                 Tim McCormack who flagged an issue being experienced in branches by

                 Postmasters. I was grateful for this and against the strong advice of POL's

                 Communications Director, I spoke with Tim McCormack about the issue. I did this

                 because I felt it was important to engage with potential critics and as part of

                 POL's determination to change in culture, and to view criticism as an opportunity

                 to do better (Email from Mark R Davies to Melanie Corfield, Mark Underwood,

                 Angela Van-Den-Bogerd RE: Fwd: Another Computer Error. Chain includes

                 correspondence with Tim McCormack. 23 June 2019 POL00136417).


            410. The issue that Tim McCormack raised was with Horizon and was being

                   identified and managed locally in branches but had not been escalated or

                   properly resolved. We were able to assist in communicating the issue and its

                   solution to the Network transparently for resolution and Tim McCormack later

                   thanked us for this approach (Email RE: "The error, Catch 22.. ... , 29 June 2019,

                  POL00423915).




            411. At the GE on 12 March 2015 and the Board meeting on 18 June 2015 (Post

                 Office Limited Board meeting minutes -18th June 2015 re Agreement with NFSP,

                 UKG100017284), POL approved a new agreement with the NFSP whereby POL

                 would provide most of the NFSP's funding. The agreement also included a clause

                 that the NFSP could not criticise POL in public. It is clear to me that these facts

                 undermined NFSP's independence from POL in its representation of

                 Postmasters.


            412. This agreement was reached because of a concern that if the NFSP failed, as a

                 trade representative, they would be replaced by a Union, possibly the CWU.


            413. In the Operational Responses Report dated 22 March 2019 (POL00269350), I

                   emphasised: "We need an effective representative body for agents

                   (Postmasters) that they can support. Can the NFSP evolve to fulfil that role, or

                   will agents prefer to replace it? How can we help without undermining its

                   confidence?"


            414. In early April 2019, I was working on a speech to give in my role as Interim CEO

                   at the NFSP conference. As set out earlier in my statement (from paragraph

                   218), I was keen to use the opportunity to show Postmasters that we were

                   listening to them, valued them and to explain what POL thought was important.

                   In the final version of the speech I delivered, I asked the NFSP to "become

                  more truly representative" and "be open and challenging." (NFSP conference —

                   key note speech: Monday 15 April 2019, 11am - 11.45 POL00270665).



            415. In the Board papers for 30 April 2019 (PO Board Agenda — 1.19 Wakefield 30

                 April 2019, POL00163556), I reported attending the NFSP conference. We had

                 recently released the NFSP from the clause in our agreement preventing them

                 criticising us in public. We had promised a deeper review of Postmaster

                 remuneration at the Board meeting that October. We recognised that the

                 conference had highlighted the extent to which Postmasters had felt neglected. I

                 acknowledged that POL should not complain about the NFSP putting the

                 business and HMG under pressure to do more for them. This discussion and the

                 Postmaster survey led to a Select Committee in 2019 and improved remuneration

                 for Postmasters.


            Media


            416. I have set out at various points during my statement where I was involved in

                   discussions regarding POL's engagement with the media, particularly during the

                   litigation and when I was interim CEO.


            417. More generally, while I did not tend to seek out media contact, I occasionally

                   answered questions on a particular Annual Report.


            418. I recall undertaking at least one media training session as part of my role. I have

                   been provided with a media training script from January 2019 (Post Office

                   Media Training Scenario: Horizon 21 January 2019, POL00262341), although I

                   do not have specific recollections about this session.


            419. I occasionally received requests to speak to journalists but was advised not to

                   by Nick Read and Richard Taylor.


            Fujitsu

            420. As set out earlier in my statement (see from paragraph 98), when I joined POL,

                   Fujitsu had withdrawn from the Front Office IT tender and would therefore be

                   exiting the business, except for its ongoing support contract for our Telco

                   business.

            421. Part of the reasoning for appointing IBM to complete the Front Office project

                   was their proposed "collaborative and partnership approach to working with

                   other suppliers.. .A stable and robust stock control and accounting platform that

                   will mitigate against Sparrow scenarios in the future." (Memorandum for POL

                   Board from Lesley Sewell, Kevin Gilliland and Alisdair Cameron - Front Office

                   Contract Award to IBM UK Ltd and Fujitsu Horizon, 21 May 2015,

                  POL00027278).


            422. In entering the new contract with IBM, we had acknowledged internally that

                   Fujitsu had been difficult colleagues; concerns had been raised previously about

                   their levels of service. Further, we could have managed shortfalls better with

                   more accessible data on branch transactions and sought to achieve with this a

                   new Front Office system. Finally, and as set out earlier in my statement, it was

                   accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was

                   vulnerable (see paragraph 94).



            423. Unfortunately, despite the clear motivations to implement a new Front Office

                   system, over the next few months, the Interim CIO and I developed our

                   assessment that the IBM replacement programme for Horizon was not credible,

                   despite the enormous work that had gone into the procurement.


            424. I therefore asked the Interim CIO to engage Fujitsu and see whether there was

                   a way in which we could evolve the relationship: I could not see any practical

                   alternative to keeping the Front Office systems running.


            425. By November 2015, we had reached a consensus between Fujitsu (led by

                   Regina Moran) and POL (led by me) to work together to reach an agreement for

            426. During a meeting on 20 November 2015, the minutes report that I raised the

                   issue of Fujitsu remaining an independent witness in the litigation if they were to

                   continue to be the provider of POL's Front Office services. I was reassured by a

                   member of Fujitsu that an independent expert approach was in place. I do not

                   have specific recollections of raising this and can refer only to the minutes

                   recorded.


            427. Subsequently, on 9 February 2016, the Board approved the termination of the

                   IBM contract and the extension of the Horizon contract with Fujitsu.



            428. I have explained that part of the motivation for POL moving to another Front

                   Office service provider was difficulties we had in our relationship with Fujitsu. On

                   9 May 2016, before we had agreed to continue working with Fujitsu longer term,

                  I complained to Regina Moran about the quality of their service, noting in

                   particular issues with their response to a Postmaster remuneration issue and

                   Horizon failure where we felt that Fujitsu had not demonstrated an

                   understanding of the urgency or seriousness of the situation (Email from Regina

                   Morgan to Alisdair Cameron, cc to Rob Houghton, Chris Boe and others Re:

                   Service Horizon etc 9 May 2016, FUJ00175302). Regina Moran responded to

                   my concerns briefly that a full review of the issue had been organised and she

                   would revert further.

            429. On 19 June 2016 I contacted Regina Moran again following a meeting with her

                   to set out that there was a need for a "radical recasting" of POL's relationship

                   with Fujitsu across a range of issues including leadership, culture and cost

                   (Email chain from Regina Moran to Gavin Bell re: Fwd: Follow Up 19 June

                   2016, FUJ00175336). I stated that POL was committed to the relationship with

                   Fujitsu but emphasised that it needed to be sustainable, setting out a list of key

                   priorities.



            430. After this period, the ownership of the relationship with Fujitsu moved

                   progressively to Rob Houghton and he led the next contractual evolution.



            431. My general recollection from 2017 onwards is that the relationship with Fujitsu,

                   especially once Regina Moran had moved on, did not develop as POL had

                   hoped. We had envisaged a more modern partnership with Fujitsu enabling a

                   digital transformation of Horizon, including a move to the cloud. It became

                   apparent that they did not have the capability to deliver this objective.



            432. During the litigation I was no longer the executive responsible for IT and did not

                   oversee the Fujitsu relationship, which had moved to Rob Houghton. On 25

                   March 2019, the Board minutes refer to an IT error that had affected Horizon

                   which was fixed overnight (Post Office Limited Board Meeting Minutes 25 March

                   2019, UKG100017291). I do not have any further recollection of this incident or

                   whether we were later informed of the root cause. I do not know whether POL

                   liaised with Fujitsu at the time about this issue.


            433. I do recall during my time as Interim CEO meeting with Duncan Tait (of Fujitsu)

                   and that I asked him why Fujitsu witnesses seemed so unable to manage the

                   questions being posed to them in the litigation. This reflected Paula Vennell's

                   concerns about Fujitsu's witnesses earlier that year (POL00176667). I do not

                   recall Duncan Tait providing any response.



            434. I do not recall any further discussions of bugs, errors and defects, prosecutions

                   or expert evidence being part of my correspondence with Fujitsu. In the period

                   when I was responsible for the relationship with Fujitsu (2015 and into 2016) 1

                   do not recall being aware of there being serious errors in Horizon. It is possible

                   that they were discussed during the second contractual evolution (led by Rob

                   Houghton) as, although I would have had sight of the Board papers, my role in

                   this was more peripheral.


            435. On 5 November 2019 I prepared a note to Nick Read before a meeting with

                   Fujitsu to share my experiences (Email from Rodric Williams to Ben Foat,

                   Sherrill Taggart, Jacqueline Scott and others Re: FW: Fujitsu decisions thoughts

                  - legally privileged 5 November 2019, POL00288080). In it I summarised

                   concerns, in particular that Fujitsu might think that POL did not have the

                   capacity or will to exit the Horizon and Telco contracts. I acknowledged that POL

                   would not now choose Fujitsu to provide Front Office systems as their

                   technology and digital skills were "lagging". It had been pointed out that the

                   individuals who had designed and understood Horizon were similarly aging and

                   many were now retiring. I raised particular concerns over Fujitsu's

                   "performance" during the litigation, referring to the evidence that had been

                   provided and POL relied upon which later turned out to be inaccurate (see

                   above from paragraph 352). I also suggested that a team from POL should go

                   to Japan for a serious discussion with Fujitsu about the future of the relationship

                   with POL, and the timetable for an exit strategy. I do not believe this happened.



            436. It is very clear that the level of scrutiny applied to Fujitsu's operation of Horizon

                   was not sufficient. The existence of remote access, for example, demonstrates

                   that POL simply didn't understand fully how Horizon worked.



            CONCLUSIONS


            Ownership and the Future of POL



            437. It always seemed unlikely to me that the Post Office network could be owned by

                   a financial investor. It has never looked profitable enough to fund dividends and

                   it was hard to see political appetite for the required structural and governance

                   changes.


            438. However, a mutual ownership of Post Offices would enable Postmasters to own

                   the Network. Postmasters are, as well as being the channel through which Post

                   Office sells most of its product, its greatest cost in any given year. Lower

                  Postmaster remuneration increases POL's profit and enables POL to hit its profit

                   targets. "Putting Postmasters First" normally falls at this first hurdle.


            439. My strong belief is that Postmasters need to own the Network. The cost will be

                   considerable, the governance complex and the timing should align with the

                   replacement of Horizon, with Postmasters offered new contracts.

            440. The roll-out of a Horizon replacement will be extremely complex, crystallising

                   any shortfalls in the Network. It will require a high degree of trust between POL

                   and Postmasters, which is hard to envisage.
