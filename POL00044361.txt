POST OFFICE LTD -v- OYETEJU ADEDAYO
CASE POLTD/0506/0336

ford a realistic
out

In my opinion the evidence is sufficient to af
prospect of conviction of the above named on the charges

on the attached Schedule. It is considered that there Soa
medium prospect of success in this matter. Any defence put
forward by the Defendant is likely to be based on her lack of

dishonesty.

The remaining admitted offences namely the falsification of the
weekly cash accounts other than those charged in June, July and
August can be dealt with as offences to be taken into
consideration after conviction. Please ensure the TIC's are
ready for the first hearing.

In view of the serious breach of trust involved in this case and
the amount of money “borrowed” by the Defendant, this Offender
should be prosecuted.

This case is, in my opinion, more suitable for trial in the
Magistrates Court. When the decision has been taken please
return the papers to obtain summonses.

In order to comply with the Guidelines issued by the Home
Office which restrict the time between completion of
investigation and laying of information, I would ask that you
ensure that the decision made within 5 working days of
receipt of the papers by you.

No further statements need be obtained at this stage.

Memo

Cont...

If the Defendant should enter no plea or plead not guilty,
Natasha Bernard should obtain and associate all necessary
statements and exhibits. I list below the statements which
appear to be necessary in this case, but Natasha should also
consider whether there are any other areas which can usefully be
covered and include any such evidence.

1 Statement from the Retail Line Manager dealing with the
length of time that the Defendant was the Sub Postmaster of
Rainham Road SPOB. The relevant portion of her contract
should be produced (the fact that post office funds could
not be used for private purposes).

2 Statement from Mr Deepak Valani dealing with the audit. He
should produce both his audit notes and the handwritten
note given to him by the Defendant.

3 Statements from Natasha Bernard and Adrian Morris dealing
with their role in the investigation.

In this event, please prepare one set of typed copies of those
statements and exhibits. Please also prepare typed draft lists

of statements and exhibits (statements to appear in
chronological order and exhibits in the same order in which they
are produced by the witnesses). A separate typed list of

witnesses, showing their addresses, should also be supplied.

As this investigation commenced after 4 April 2005, the changes
to the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the
revised Code of Practice will apply to this case. Section 32 of
the Criminal Justice Act amalgamates into one the two stage

disclosure test. This means the primary and secondary
disclosure stages are replaced by a single objective test to be
applied throughout the life of a case. The Prosecution must

disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not
previously been disclosed to the accused and which might
reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the
prosecution against the accused or of assisting the case for the
accused. If Natasha Bernard is aware of any such material, I
would be grateful if I could be provided with the details at
this stage.

Kindly also advise in the event that the audit shortage is made
good.

Counsel will be instructed to pr i tter. Please
liaise with our General Office on efore fixing a

date of hearing.
