All

To ensure we have appropriate governance for the Horizon Investigation I am setting up a monthly project
governance board.

The broad terms of the board and how it relates to the overall project governance are attached.
You are receiving this message because you will receive an invitation to this board.

The meetings will happen the last Friday of each month at 11am. For Susan, Alwen and Angela, this will replace the
weekly Second Sight currently scheduled for this time.

Regards, Simon

Simon Baker Head of Business Change and Assurance
