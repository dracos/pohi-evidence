Belinda, David

Please find attached the updated submission on the "mediation test" question. I've also attached a comparison
showing the changes.

Having reviewed again JFSA's comments these are nearly all irrelevant to the proper test for moving cases to
mediation. You'll see I've added a footnote on page 1 to address this.

Kind regards
Andy
