Re: Letter from Bond Pearce Solicitors Dated 18 Nov 05 PO Vs Mr Castleton

In response to your email request dated 28 Nov 05 concerning the questions raised at para (3)
of the above document;

QI. We need to explain to a Judge who will know nothing about Horizon exactly how it
works, what precisely happens when a customer goes into a Post Office to buy an item? How
is this recorded? Is it manually recorded into the Horizon system at the same time or later in
the day? Is the cash register linked to Honzon?

This should be directed to the POL IT probably Bob Booth

Q2. Precisely what steps Fujitsu took to examine the Horizon system at the Marine Drive
Post Office in 2004 and what their conclusions were.
Ann Chambers response: attached.

Q3. Whether there have been any similar or serious problems with the Horizon system at the
Marine Drive Post Office since Mr Castleton's suspension and dismissal.
No comment however Steve Holbert should be able to assist here

Q4. Whether you believe that the suggestion put forward by Mr Castleton's experts is likely
to be correct and your reasons, either way (if you are able to comment on this).
No comment.

QS. If there have been human errors in recording the transactions, could an explanation be
that:
(a) There was nothing wrong with Horizon, because it simply reflected the
information entered 6n to it; but
(b) If staff entered the wrong numbers into Horizon there may have been no
real loss (even though Horizon would show a loss), because there could be a
human error in accurately recording transactions.
If so, would that be a likely explanation?

Q6. Any other Information, that you believe may be relevant.

Details of investigation by Ann Chambers

I looked at the reconciliation reports for any entries for this outlet for two weeks preceding
the date of the query (25/2/2005). There were none. This indicates that:

e the transactions completed on the Horizon system were correctly formed and written

e the value and quantity of transactions completed on the Horizon system at the outlet
matched the value and quantity of transactions copied to the Horizon central systems

e the Cash Account produced at the outlet at the end of each week included all transactions
completed on the Horizon system at the outlet

e the payments and receipts balanced on the Cash Account

I examined the messagestore - this holds, amongst other things, all transactions completed on
the Horizon system, also the stock, stamp and cash declarations entered by the clerk.

Firstly I checked the cheques recorded on the system during the week, to make sure that they
had been removed correctly from the system via the Remit Out process. There had been one
error in process on 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report, but this didn't cause a
discrepancy.

Then IJ added up all cash components of transactions for an accounting week plus the cash
brought forward, and found that the difference between this system total, and the end of week
Cash Declaration, matched the discrepancy generated when the stock unit was balanced.

I then.repeated the process on a daily basis, comparing the system totals with the overnight
cash holding declarations, to see if I could identify a particular day when the discrepancy had
occurred. I found that there were varying and large differences between the system totals and
the declared amounts each day, and it was not possible to pin down the discrepancy to a
particular day.

Comments from Gareth Jenkins:

If there have been human errors in recording the transactions, could an explanation be
that:

(a) There was nothing wrong with Horizon, because it simply reflected the

This is certainly True (ie Horizon simply reflects the information entered into it).

(b) If staff entered the wrong numbers into Horizon there may have
been no real loss (even though Horizon would show a loss), because
there could be a human error in accurately recording transactions.

Again, this could be True. However if there is some sort of miss-entering of data into
Horizon, then there would be another corresponding error which should be picked up eg as a
Stock Error or some AP Client being credited with an incorrect amount. Also, any such error
should show up as part of the Balancing Process.

If so, would that be a likely explanation?

Ref A: Letter from Bond Pearce Solicitors Dated 18 Nov 05 PO Vs Mr Castleton
Ref B: Email ref two cases; Marine Drive and Torquay Road. ARQ Ref No 405 & 421 - 423

I have received a copy of a letter regarding Marine Drive, from Bond Pearce
Solicitors Ref A refers, which concerns the loss of some £27,115.83 from Marine
Drive sub PO between 18 July 03 and 25 Mar 04 of which Mr Castleton was the Sub
Postmaster. Mr Castleton was suspended 23 Mar 04 and dismissed 17 May 04. The
PO have now issued a claim against him to recover these losses and he in turn has
issued a counter claim stating that any shortfall is entirely the fault of problems with
the Horizon computer and accounting system at the Marine Drive Post Office.

The process for the security team in dealing with all routine PO Investigations is
always initiated by an ARQ issued by Graham Ward from the PO Fraud
Investigations team. Both these cases were initiated within the last two months by an
ARQ from Graham and the details were forwarded to him on CD. After an initial
discussion with Graham on this matter he acknowledged the request and has asked us
(FJ) to formally respond through him to the solicitors concerned Ref B refers.

The letter (ref A) is directed at FUJITSU requesting answers to 6 questions which are
fundamentally outside of the scope of the POA Security Team and also outside the.
scope of the ARQ process. It is clear that some investigatory work has already been
undertaken by FUJITSU dated 5 May 04 by Julie Welsh (SDM) of which all parties
seem aware and for this reason I would recommend caution before any comment is
made without reference to any previous report and would also recommend that this
letter is re-directed through our Legal and Commercial team at the earliest opportunity
for guidance and-way forward. I am still awaiting requirements re Torquay Road
from Graham Ward.

As discussed by phone this morning, could I please ask that the request
below be expedited.

Both the ARQ requests detailed in the Subject title are Civil matters
where there is a suggestion that the losses incurred at the offices are
as a result of faults with the Horizon software.

Marine Drive - In this case Bond Pearce Solicitors acting on our behalf
have asked for an investigation into the workings of the system (their
letter dated 18/11/05 refers, copy posted back to you today details
exactly what analysis is required ). Could I ask that you deal with the
questions raised and prepare a formal response to be returned via me as
soon as possible.

Torquay Road - The same scenario as above applies. I am awaiting
details from our Solicitors dealing with the matter, outlining exactly
what is required and as soon as I receive this information, I will be
asking for a formal response from you, much the same as with Marine
Drive.

I am assuming that in both cases, you have copies of the ARQ

ear Sirs,

Post Office Limited -v- Mr L Castleton
14 South Marine Drive, Bridlington, WY15 3DB ("the Marine Drive Post Office")

‘ (1) Background

We act on behalf of the Post Office Limited (“PO”). From approximately 18 July 2003 to 23 March 2004, Mr
Castleton was a Sub Postmaster at the Marine Drive Post Office. He was strictly responsible for the safe
custody of cash and stock and was obliged to make good all losses caused through his own negligence,

1 carelessness or error and losses of any kind caused by his assistants.

Between 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004, net losses of £27,115.83 occurred at the Sub Post Office. Mr
H Castleton was suspended on 23 March 2004 and dismissed on 17 May 2004. The Post Office has now
' issued a claim against him to try and recover these net losses. Mr Castleton has issued a Counterclaim
i claiming wrongful termination of his contract.

(2) Mr Castieton’s Defence

Mr Castleton’s case is that any shortfall {s entirely the fault of problems with the Horizon computer and
accounting system at the Marine Drive Post Office and that the PO wrongfully terminated his Sub
: Pastmaster contract in respect of which has suffered loss not exceeding £250,000.

We attach copies of the following:

A. Without prejudice letter dated 30 September from Mr Castleton‘s solicitors to Bond Pearce LLP.
B. Bentley Jennison’s Report dated 23 September and attachments;

C. White & Hoggard’s Report dated 18 August.

Bentley Jennison state that deficiencies have probably been brought forward despite the fact that they

have been entered onto the suspense account entry. They suspect this is because the Horizon system,
despite the suspense account entry, has failed to recognise the entry on the daily snapshots. They have
drawn this conclusion through looking at the discrepancy of £3,509.18 on Thursday 26 February 2004, -
They then suggest that this double accounting could have continued over a number of weeks and that as
such, Mr Castletan’s Defence, “appears to hold potential merit based on the limited documentation” they
have so far reviewed. White & Hoggard reach a similar conclusion in thelr Report.

Mr Castleton belleves that if he can obtain further documents, such as the daily snapshots, he will be able
to undertake a manual reconciliation of the cash account In order to substantiate his belief that the losses
are not real but attributable to computer error. We attach an email from Fujitsu to Richard Benton at the
Post Office dated 5 May 2004 In which Fujitsu state “It is possible that they are not accurately recording all
transactions on the system” and that there was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem.

Without Prejudice
Dear Sirs

Our cent: Mr L Casticton — Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington
Your ellant: Post Office Limited

We refer to our recent without prejudice telephone discussions (Mark Tumer/Denise Gammack).

As we mentioned when we spoke, we have instructed an expert accounting witneas, Chris Hine of Bentley
Jennison, to review the documentation that your client has made avnilable to date. His brief was to consider
certain of those documents in light of our client’s pleaded defence to the effect that the alleged shortfall is (at
least in part — nd we cannot be any more specific than that given the incomplete disclosure which has been
given) attributable to problema with the Horizon system.

In order to assist you and your client in understanding our client’s position, we are prepared to disclose to you
on a without prejudice basis the report which Mr Hine has prepared. Since the report refers to a report
prepared by Andrew Richardson of White & Hoggard, a copy of his report together with supporting
documentation is also enclosed.

By way of explanation, Mr Richardson acts as auditor to the business owned by our client’s father in law. His
Teport was obtained directly by our client as a “second opinion” on the methodology that our client had used
in reviewing the available documentation, To avoid any question of partiality, we commissioned Bentley
Jennison to consider the same documentation ax had been available to Mr Richardson, as well as his report,
and to comment on whether they agreed with its findings.

For the complete avoidance of doubt, both documents are made available to you and your client on an entirely
without prejudice basis. Whilst the substance of the Bentley Jennison report is likely to form the core of any
formal report prepared for uze in court, we reserve the right to rely on a report which may differ in form to
that which we have presently disclosed.

As you will see, both Mr Richardson and Mr Hine concur with our client’s position that there, at the very
least, discrepancies in the way in which the Horizon system appears to treat weekly balances. This simply
serves to reinforce what both we and our client have seid from the outset, namely that the daily balance
snepshots which have not yet been disclosed will be of fundamental importance is enalysing whether there is a
problem caused by the way in which the Horizon system operated during our client’s tenure as sub-postmnaster
as Marine Drive Post Office.

Daily snapshots for week 49

At Document 1 is a copy of the daily snapshot printed at the end of Thursday 26 February
2004, being Day One of the week. ‘This shows a discrepancy of £3,509.18.

I note that this an identical amount to that recorded by the Horizon system as having been
deficient in week 48, as identified in the audit undertaken by Helen Hollingworth, the
schedule for which is set out at Document 2.

This schedule also shows that cumulative deficiencies of £8,243,10 were put into a suspense
account relating to weeks 43-46, although I note that no figure appears to be disclosed
specifically for the following week, week 47.

The identical amounts of £3,509,18 point to two possible scenarios, either that (a) there has
been a deficiency suffered on day one of week 49 that exactly matches the sum of the
deficiency for the whole of week 48, or (b) the figure is the brought forward deficiency from
week 48. I consider it reasonable to assume that option (b) is the most likely scenario.

On Day Two of Weck 49, being Friday 27 February 2004, an entry for £3,509,6B is shown as
“Loss 2 2a in”, per Document 3.

J am unable to explain the difference of 50 pence between the suspense account figure and the
daily snapshot deficiency, although I note that in White & Hoggard’s report they explain that
Mr Castleton informed them this was a manual entry following instructions from Horizon
technical support.

‘The £3,509.68 appears to represent the entry on the suspense account (Document 4) for the
Same amount, processed on 27 February 2004, which I would expect given the daily snapshot
entry.

Suspense account

A suspense account is generally used by accountants to ‘park’ transactions that have either
been erroneously posted and are pending correction, or which, as is the case here, are
transactions that are either unreconciled or unexplainable.

From my experience, the impact of a suspense posting would allow a line to be drawn under
the cumulative deficiencies on the daily prints, effectively resetting the figure to zero, which
should be reflected as such on the end of day print,

However, it is evident that on the end of day print (Document 5) there is still a deficiency of
£3,509,18, notwithstanding the suspense account entry.

This again Jeads to two possible scenarios, either thar (a) following the suspense account
entry an identical shortage of £3,509.18 was again borne by the branch during the course of
the day, or (b) the Horizon system, despite the sispense account entry, has failed to recognise
the entry on the daily snapshot, leaving the figure of £3,509.18 unchanged,

Again, after considered reflection, it is more probable that scenario (b) has occurred.

For Days 3, 4, 5 and 6 (Saturday 28 February 2004 - Tuesday 2 March 2004), identical entries
occur in relation to the figure of £3,509.68, with a cumulative deficiency of £3,509.18 being
shown at the end of each day.

For the final day of week 49, Wednesday 3 March 2004, the entry of £3,509.68 again is
recorded, however the total deficiency now shows £3,512.26 (Document 6), an increase of
£3.08, and supported by the final Horizon Cash Account print (Document 7).

I note that in weck 49 the cost of a first class stamp was 28 pence. The increase of £3.08
could, therefore, represent (and in line with Andrew Richardson’s opinion) a scenario
whereby a book of 12 first class stamps was sold, but only money for one single stamp was
taken (ie (12 x 0.28) — 0,28).

Having already concluded that the system should have no longer been recognising the
£3,509.18 (posted to suspense) on a daily basis, the only discrepancy for the week should, in
my opinion, have been the £3.08 deficiency apparently borne on Wednesday 3 March 2004.

The system has, therefore, appeared to overstate the deficiency for the week by the amount of
the deficiency in week 48, being £3,509.18.

The report of White & Hoggard essentially appears to reach the same conclusion, in thet this
sum has been erroneously double counted.

Cwnulative deficiencies

I would note that the Horizon aystem, from the documentation I have reviewed, appears to
tecord deficiencies on a cumulative basis, hence the running total of £8,243.10 up to the end
of week 46 being rolled into week 47's suspense account and carried forward to week 49
(Document 4),

Based on this approach, the integrity of the system is heavily dependent upon weekly figures
being both accurate, and carried forward correctly,

In the isolated case of week 49 thia appears not to have taken place, with the implication that
errors could, theoretically, have been double counted: over a number of weeks,

As such, Mr Castleton’s defence, that the root of the problem lies with the inaccurate figures
produced by Horizon, appears to hold potential merit based on the limited documentation I
have so far reviewed.

Clearly, however, I have only had sight of the daily snapshots for week 49, which although
appearing to indicate an error within the Horizon system for that short period, does not
necessarily mean that it has been replicated for other weeks. This can only be checked
through an analysis of the daily snapshots for all relevant periods,

Andrew Richardson’s conclusion that “the balance of probabilities would suggest that it is
quite likely that this has also happened in earlier periods” is, I suspect, a little premature and
can only be proven following a more detailed review.

Equally, other issues aside from the discrete problems evident in Week 49 maybe uncovered,
upon a more detailed inspection of relevant Horizon documentation.

Disclosure

The documentation I would ideally need sight of (further to that listed in your letter dated 11
April 2005, and presuming such papers were used in the normal course of business at the
branch) to gain a clearer picture of bow Horizon worked, and whether it was working as
intended, is as follows:

« Daily snapshots for the period preceding, during, and following the alleged
deficiencies borne under the management of Mr Castleton, which as suggested in copy
correspondence might be from weeks 39-52 inclusive, although for completeness (and
if considered cost effective) it may be appropriate to analyse the period from when
Horizon was first used in the branch to gauge the effectivencss of the system from
Day One

Audit of Post Office ® Marine Drive branch, FAD 213337

An audit took place at Marine Drive Post Office on the 25” March 2004.
Helen Hollingworth led the audit and in attendance was Chris Taylor. The audit -
commenced at 8.00am and on our arrival the sub postmaster was very pleased to
see us. He explained problems he had been having at the office regarding
balancing. His problems with balancing started in week 43 with a mis-balanca of
4230.97. He was adamant that no members of staff could be committing theft
and felt that the mls-balances were due to a computer problem. He had been in
cantact with the Retail Line Manager Cath Oglesby and the Horizon help line
regularly since the problems began. The following table gives further weeks
balance declarations on the cash account .

Dear Lee

You have asked me to produce a report on my findings following my exemination of the
documents presented to me for Marine Drive Post Office in respect of the week ended 3% March

2004 and the apparent discrepsncy claimed by the Post Office which I understand at 4% March
2004 amounted to £15,265.04,

Uhave therefore examined the daily balance printouts that you produced covering the period 26"
February 2004 to 4" March 2004 and also the report marked “Horizon Cash Account (Final)”
dated 4" March 2004 in relation to the week ended 3 March 2004,

My conclusions are as follows:~ ~

a) The Horizon Cash Account (Final) Report for week 49 (week ended 3% March 2004)
produced on 4" March 2004 (time 07:46) indicates the following:

Table 2 (a) authorised cash shortages (A) 11,752.78
Discrepancies Table 3,512.26
Total £15,265.04

b) The Suspense Account summary attached to the report — office copy dated 3 March 2004
(time 17:38) produces the following under the heading “Cash Shortages A”

‘The difference between the above two reports is £3,512.26 (I will refer to this figure later in
my observations).

The Horizon Cash Account (Final) Report for weelc no.49 (week ended 3 March 2004) dated
4" March 2004 (time 07:46) indicates the following:
Balance Due to Post Office 97,014.07
Less Stock (Table A) (9,036.41)
Less Cash (Table 5) (72,712.62)
Shortfall . £15,265,04
The above entry at (d) above appears to me to comprise the following:
1. Discrepancies Table 3,512.26
2. AA 21" February 2004 Loss A to Table 2a 3,509.68
3. Brought forward from earlier periods 8,243.10
Total £15,265,04

It follows, therefore, that we need to ascertain how each of the above apparent discrepancies
at paragraph (ce) have arisen:

In order to attempt to explain the apparent discrepancies I have prepared a detailed analysis of
the daily balance printouts covering the period 26” February 2004 (time 17:30) to 4° March
2004 (time 07:46). 1 have used the Horizon Cash Account (Final) Report for the analysis of
the movements on 4" March 2004. My conclusions are as follows:

1. Discrepancies Table - £3,512.26

This figure is not on the Suspense Account Summary dated 3" March 2004 but appears to
comprise part of the overall shortfall (see a and c above). This figure appears to include the
“discrepancies in this account” summary on the “final balance” sheet dated 26" February
2004 but is recorded as £3,509. 18 increasing by £3.08 (which I believe is a book of stamps) to
£3,512.26 on 3 March 2004. It is understood that the sum of £3,509.18 is a discrepancy
from en earlier period. I have seen no evidence to reveal how this discrepancy from the
earlier period has been arrived at.

2. AA 27" February 2004 Loss A to Table 2 a - £3,509.68
On the “final balance” sheet dated 26" February 2004 (time 17:30) there is an entry for “net

discrepencies” of £3,509.18 which equates to the “discrepancies in this account” entry — sce g
(above.

On the “balance snapshot ~ office copy” sheet dated 27 February 2004 (time 17:31) there is
an entry “OTHER PAYMENTS” loss a — 2a amounting to £3,509.68. This entry is then
repeated daily. .

(understand from my telephone conversation with you that this amount was input manually
under instructions from Horizon technical support which probably explains the difference of
50p from the previously mentioned sum of £3,509, 18.

If the sum of £3,509.68 is indeed the same entry as the sum of £3,509.18 recorded in g 1

above, and it seems highly likely that this is the case, there is a duplication in the apparent
shortfall.

Ic follows that a retional explanation is needed for this apparent double counting in the
Post Office records,

3. Brought forward from Earlier Period - £8,243.10

In addition to having no documentary evidence to support the discrepancy of £3,509.18,
which appears to be duplicated by the further entry of £3,509.68, there is no documentation to
support the discrepancies from earlier periods amounting to £8,243.10. It is therefore
absolutely essential to obtain documentary evidence supporting the discrepancies that
are claimed to have arisen in the earlier periods of £3,S09.18 and £8,243,10.

Conclusion .

From the limited available evidence of one weeks tunsactions referred to above my
conclusion is that it is highly likely that the sum of £3,509.18 has been recorded twice
increasing the apparent discrepancy during the week ended 3% March 2004. On the
assumption that I am correct in this conclusion, and there seems to be no rational explanation
for this amount appearing twice other than my conclusion, then there has to be doubt as to
whether or not the discrepancies brought forward from earlier periods of £3,509.18 and
£8,243.10 can be substantiated. Ik is therefore absolutely imperative that the Post Office
produce documentation to justify their claim for the earlier periods in order to produce
evidence that the system is operating correctly, At the present time it would eppear to me that
during the week ended 4" March 2004 an incomplete instruction to input a manual entry of

£3,509,18 (incorrectly entered as £3,509.68) bas created a double counting of this amount in-

the calculations produced by the Post Office of shortfall. If this has happened for the one
week where we have documentary evidence then the balance of probabilities would suggest
that it is quite likely that this has also heppened in earlier periods and has to cast doubt on the
credibility of the claim made by the Post office which therefore needs to be examined in some
further detail with the benefit of supporting documentation.

Thope that the above report is of sore assistance.

Kind regards

Yours sincerely

NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT
DATE

AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-fab-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and
guidance given I have checked various things on the system, All the

Internal

reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except

for 10th Fab when the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't

cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer Id

11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer Id, this can lead to

amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided,

But again It will not cause a discrepancy, Checking the cash transactions

on

the system against the declarations shows that they are not working

particularly accurately (i.e, at the end of the day the cash they declare

In .

the drawer Is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has
been recorded on the system). It Is possible that they are not accurately
recording all transactions on the system. There Is no evidence whatsoever
of

any system problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julle Welsh (Customer
Services) who will try to get POL to follow It up, but In the meantime
please tell the PM that we have Investigated and the discrepancies are
caused by the difference between the transactions they have recorded on the
system and the cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the
software or hardware.

ANNEX

Part 35 Is Intended to limit the use of oral expert evidence to that which is reasonably required.
In addition, where possible, matters requiring expert evidence should be dealt with by a single
expert. Permission of the court is always required either to call an expert or to put an expert’s
report in evidence. There is annexed to this Practice Direction a protocol for the instruction of
experts to give evidence in civil claims, Experts and those Instructing them are expected to have
regard to the guidance contained in the protocol,

EXPERT EVIDENCE — GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1.1. It is the duty of an expert to help the court on matters within his own
expertise: rule 35.3(1). This duty Is paramount and overrides any obligation
to the person from whom the expert has received instructions or by whom he
is paid: rule 35.3(2),

detract from his opinion.

1.5 An expert should make it clear:
(a) when a question or Issue falls outside his expertise; and

(b) when he Is not able to reach a definite opinion, for example because he
has insufficient information.

matter, such change of view should be communicated to all the parties

2.3 An expert's report must be verified by a statement of truth as well as
containing the statements required in paragraph 2.2(8) and (9) above.

2.4 The form of the statement of truth is as follows;
"I confirm that Insofar as the facts stated in my report are within my own
knowledge I have made clear which they are and I belleve them to be true,
and that the opinions I have expressed represent my true and complete
professional opinion.”

2.5 Attention is drawn to rule 32.14 which sets out the consequences of verifying
a document containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.

(For information about statements of truth see Part 22 and the practice
direction which supplements It.)

INFORMATION

3 Under Rule 35.9 the court may direct a party with access to Information which
Is not reasonably available to another party to serve on that other party a
document which records the information. The dacument served must include
sufficient details of all the facts, tests, experiments and assumptions which
underlie any part of the information to enable the party on whom it is served
to make, or to obtain, a proper interpretation of the information and an
assessment of its significance.

a

INSTRUCTIONS

4 The Instructions referred to In paragraph 2.2(3) will not be protected by
privilege (see rule 35,10(4)), But cross-examination of the expert on the
contents of his instructions will not be allowed unless the court permits it (or
unless the party who gave the instructions consents to it). Before it gives
permission the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to
consider that the statement in the report of the substance of the instructions
is inaccurate or Incomplete, If the court Is so satisfled, It will allow the cross-
examination where It appears to be in the interests of justice to do so.

a

QUESTIONS TO EXPERTS

5.1 Questions asked for the purpose of clarifying the expert’s report (see rule
35,6) should be put, In writing, to the expert not later than 28 days after
receipt of the expert’s report (see paragraphs 1.2 to 1.5 above as to
verification).

5.2 Where a party sends a written question or questions direct to an expert, a
copy of the questions should, at the same time, be sent to the other party or
parties,

5.3 The party or parties instructing the expert must pay any fees charged by that
expert for answering questions put under rule 35.6. This does not affect any
decision of the court as to the party who is ultimately to bear the expert’s
costs.

given by one expert only (rule 35.7) but there are a number of disciplines
relevant to that issue, a leading expert in the dominant discipline should be
identified as the single expert. He should prepare the general part of the
report and be responsible for annexing or incorporating the contents of any
reports from experts In other disciplines.

a
