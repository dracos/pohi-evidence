Dear Rachael / Gareth,

Please find enclosed outlines of the the two cases which involve me.

Of the two, i would say that the Sefton & nield case is the more urgent, and therefore Gareth i would be grateful if you
could concentrate on that one first. it is listed for trial in Jan and they have been waiting longer for this report. the allen
case is only for plea and case management on 10th December. in an ideal world i would like to serve a report before the
10th if possible, but in any event we do not have a defence case statement in that matter yet.

regards

Andrew Bolc
