Acceptance that will be introduced into the HNG-X service. The documents therefore
represents the baseline reference for those involved in the various stages of design,
development, deployment and support for solution components to meet the overall
requirement. It is also intended to support the Post Office Ltd concurrence and approval
processes that are required to be undertaken in order that a solution can be implemented.

Use cases will be documented and input to Doors as appropriate.
Inputs used in the production of this document have been:
= Feasibility Study

Outputs/Outcomes that subsequent activities are required to deliver based on the
requirements detailed in this document are:

= TDA Strategic Concurrence.

= Subsequent Supplier Solution Outline Design.

= Subsequent Supplier Technical and Application Interfaces Specification documents.

3.2 BACKGROUND

In line with the commercial contracts with clients, a number of settlements made by Product
and Branch Accounting are based upon data provided by the client. Such an example is
Camelot, where settlement is based upon data captured by the Camelot terminal in outlets
rather than the data being captured at transactional source by HNG-X.

The client data is uploaded into POL FS and compared with the equivalent HNG-X data which
has to be manually input by the agent/counter clerk. Ideally the data, when compared, should
be the same but a number of conformance issues have been identified where agents/counter
clerks do not perform end of day routines correctly, do not input the Camelot details into HNG-
X as they should, and can key incorrect figures, leaving Product and Branch Accounting with
a reconciliation difference. This difference may require the issuing of a transaction correction.

Changes through automated re-engineering should provide improvements to branch
compliance as well as reducing costs.

Although Client based settlements are not a preferred settlement option it is recognised that
the data being provided by clients such as Camelot is robust, controlled by reference data,
and more accurate than the HNG-X data stream due to the conformance issues mentioned
previously

The solution is to automate a process that converts the Client data file (eg Camelot), into a
data feed to the branch, i.e. a Transaction Acceptance file. The branch will then accept the
data and thus avoid the issues described above.

A number of non-financial benefits should result from the full change:
= Time savings at outlets achieved through the less frequent interrogation of ‘off
counter’ equipment and the manual input of data into HNG-X, resulting in less time
required to deal with associated differences, and transaction corrections.
= A fit for purpose generic solution which can be used for future off counter
development and client based settlements ie further kiosk developments such as.
Paystation Plus / Post & Go

3.3. SCOPE

The document describes the high-level processes for the Transaction Acceptance for the
following activities:-

Transaction File Receipt from the Client

Generation of the Transaction Acceptance file and POLFS Control entry
Branch processes to accept the Transaction Acceptance

Back-end Systems processes in POLFS.

Revised operational instructions which describe the preceding changes for
agents/counter clerks

= Duty instructions for POL FS users

Out of scope :
= There will be no change to the way that transactions are currently conducted ie lottery
on-lines sales.
= As settlements are already based on client data there should be no change to
settlement timescales or the commercial contracts with clients, although there may be
a minor impact on the client enquiry process.

4 PROCESS OVERVIEW

4.1 CURRENT CAMELOT PROCESS

The following diagram describes the current process for data received from Camelot
(Lottery Sales) and the associated reconciliation process via POLFS.

ranch Summary Branch Surrey

POLFS reconciles values I

Horizon Value £1000 ay branch
Camelot Value £1000 aa

Buk erty

Camect I mo
Daly Branch
Data
1. Transactions are undertaken at the Camelot terminal, eg Sale of Lottery Ticket
2. At the end of day the Clerk should request a Branch On line summary — this

shows the monies taken by the camelot terminal

The Clerk needs to take monies from the Camelot till and enter into the Branch
accounts via HNG-X.

The Branch input data is captured and passed to POLFS

Camelot provide a summary of transactions undertaken via the terminal and send
it to POLS (via EDG) which is a contractual required for settlement

A manual reconciliation process in POLFS reconciles the values between the 2
data streams (eg £1000 as show in the example above)

Transaction Corrections (TC’s) are issued where the reconciliation fails

The proposed process involves a data feed from the Client and this being used to
generate a Transaction Acceptance. The HNG-X entry is not required as the branch
will receive a TA which will be accepted (this is explored in more detail in the
following sections).

1. Camelot provide a summary of transactions undertaken via the Lottery terminal
which is passed to POLFS via EDG as contractually required

2. POL TI will create a Transaction Acceptance record for the branch indicating the
value of transactions undertaken

3. The Branch will be presented with the value to “accept” only . Unlike TC’s there
will be no opportunity to write off or ask for evidence due to the inherent
robustness of the Camelot data provided . Also post HNG the only available
‘evidence’ will be within the office systems so all accountability to bring the TA to
account is already within the branch domain

4. The “accepted” value will be passed to POL back end systems such as POLFS
to provide the opposite posting into the matching account and HRSAP to provide
the remuneration calculation

4.3 TRANSACTION ACCEPTANCE PROCESSES

The following section describes the processes necessary to undertake Transaction Acceptance for the
following components:

« Transaction File Receipt from the Client

* Generation of the Transaction Acceptance file

= Branch processes to accept the Transaction Acceptance

= Back-end Systems processes in POLFS

4.3.1 Transaction Receipt from the Client

Data received from the client will be via the EDG as this is the preferred interaction with
external sources. EDG will pass the data to the target system (eg POL TI) unchanged. EDG
will expect a file to be received daily from the Client. Where no file is received an alert will be
raised and the Client contacted.

4.3.2 Generation of the Transaction Acceptance file

Two models exist for the creation of Transaction Acceptance file:-

o Where the Client does not have a current interface it is expected that the Client will
conform to the POL TI “generic” interface (as defined in CP08-0011 — Client Data Generic
Interface)

o Where the Client has a current interface or is not willing to migrate to the generic
Transaction Integrator interface

4.3.2.1 Transaction Integrator to send to branch and POLFS (control)

The standard/generic Transaction Integrator format is the preferred interface format to send
data to POLFS (see diagram below — interface 3 & 4).

Asecond stream of data will be passed to the branch for the Transaction Acceptance data
(see doc ref[7]) (see diagram below — interface 5).

The Client will be asked to conform to the generic AIS (see diagram below — interface 2). This
may require some Clients to undertake rework if there is already an existing interface. Where
this is not possible, the solution at 4.3.2.2 will be followed.

It is expected that Paystation Plus and Post & Go will follow this route.

Solution overview

© Transaction Integrator to process Client transaction data and summarise into a TA file
that is passed to the HNG-X Branch Database.

o Acontrol entry is created for POLFS such that matching of processed TA’s can be
undertaken. This will be via the generic ETL to POL-FS AIS. It will be possible for
P&BA to detect where a branch has not accepted the TA.

o Each non-Horizon system (eg Paystation Plus, Post and Go, Camelot) will create a
separate file containing TA’s pertinent to the branch device (Camelot terminal 1 / 2
etc)

4.3.2.2 Existing Client Interfaces that cannot be changed

Where there is an existing Client stream that contains the transactional data this information
is used to update the POLFS Settlement Accounts (via EDG). In order to keep the solution
consistent, the data will be passed to the Transaction Integrator to transform the data into the
generic POL TI process. This remainder of the steps will then be as option 4.3.2.1.

It is expected that Camelot data will follow this route. The EDG to POLFS data load can then
be removed.

Asecond stream of data is required to generate the Transaction Acceptance to pass to the
branch.

o Acontrol entry is created for POLFS such that matching of processed TA’s can be
undertaken. This will be via the generic ETL to POL-FS AIS. It will be possible for P&BA
to detect where a branch has not accepted the TA

co The existing POLFS process to load data into the Vendor accounts can be
ceased/removed

Note: this makes the end-to-end solution consistent for both models and puts the data
processing obligations into POL TI. The branch processes and POLFS load processes for
Transaction Acceptance clients will be consistent.

4.3.3.1 Log On

After making the existing check for Outstanding TCs, where the user has a Role of MANAGERS or
SUPERVISORS (to be further defined) a further check will be made to determine whether there are
any outstanding TAs.

If there are any, then the User is presented with a list of all Outstanding TA’s to process. There will
not be an option to bypass this, and it will normally be the case that Users will just Accept all TAs
without further consideration.

The solution always needs to allow for the SU not being present and the situation where the current
SU is not appropriate (ie it is SU DEF). If the supplied SU doesn’t exist (or is not available due to
being locked) and the Logging On User is attached to SU DEF, then bypass TAs for that SU during
the Log On. They will not be marked as failed and can be processed at a subsequent Log On or
manually later. The final solution regarding Stock Units is yet to be defined.

4.3.3.2 Processing TAs

When the user is presented with a list of TAs to be processed, the user can either select a specific TA
to look at it in more detail, or select a function to Accept all the TA’s.

However normally, the User would be expected to touch the Enter button which would result in
accepting all the TAs. In turn this will generate transactions (in one or more hidden baskets) which
will be recorded in BRDB as normal and the next night will be passed back to POL FS in the normal
BLE file as well as to Credence in the normal MI interface.

An identifier will be associated with the transactions that are generated to support the matching
process. This will be included in the TA record and is put into the tc_reference field as fora TC. This
will be correctly passed back to POL FS and can be used there for auto matching with the data
passed into POL FS from the client.

Since these transactions need to be matched up in POL FS it is important that the BLE
Summarisation process does not aggregate them. Since it is expected that the products, which are
used for TAs, are specifically for use for TAs, then what is required is that the Reference Data for
those products map them to Articles which are configured not to summarise the data in the Modes
being used for TAs acceptance.

Summarisation is set by POL FS Article, i.e. Product.

4.3.4 Back-end Systems processes in POLFS

4.3.4.1 Transaction Integrator to send to branch and POLFS (control)

A Control entry is made using the ETL to POL FS Generic Interface currently under implementation
for Paystation Plus and Post & Go. Camelot data to be included in the ETL to POL-FS extract.

The Counter Application will convert the TA file upon acceptance to the TA Branch Summary that will
use HNG-X mode 14 REC.

N.B When mode 14 is re-instated on HNG-X it is to be called ‘Transaction Acceptance’.

4.3.4.2 Transaction Integrator to send to branch and update POLFS (control)

As described in Section 4.3.2.2, existing Client data, such as Camelot update the Vendor account via
XI. A Control entry is made using the Programs ZIFX0045 and ZIFX0043 The TA file will have an
article of type 40. The Counter application will convert the TA file to the TA Branch Summary that will
use HNG-X mode 14 REC, where Settlement=C.

The intention is to migrate the solution to the model described in Section 4.3.2.2, and standardise on
the feed via Transaction Integrator. This will require a migration strategy for each Client to ensure the
data feeds are not duplicated. There may be an opportunity to parallel run the data streams before the
existing POLFS route is ceased.

4.4 ARCHITECTURE

The following components are enhanced to support the solution.

4.4.1 Transaction Integrator
The use of Transaction Integrator will enable a generic Transaction Acceptance process to be

followed. By utilising a standard detailed transaction file format it will be possible to output data to the
Branch Database for use by HNG-X (see diagram below).

Business
OP Obecis

Box!

Transaction Data
received from Client

Transaction
Acceptance records for
HNG-X

The file delivery process will operate like TCs, namely that Fujitsu will process all files delivered to
the input directory at the time it runs (proposed to be 06:05 am each day as with TCs). If multiple
files are generated then they will all be processed. The monitoring will only raise an alert if there are
no files delivered.

The files are loaded into the TPS Host system where they are validated and any error files generated
and returned.

A new set of processes will need to be implemented based on the TC processes to load, validate and
process the TA file and deliver it to BRDB.

There is no change to the remuneration model for products. If the product is currently paid using
HNG-X data, this will continue, but, with the more accurate Transaction Acceptance figure. This data
will still be extracted by Fujitsu and passed on the HNG-X to HRSAP AIS, not from Transaction
Integrator.

4.4.2 Branch Database

A new table will be required in TPS Host and BRDB to hold TA’s the contents of which will be
determined during Solution Design.

Transaction Integrator will require a number of “controls” to ensure that the solution is robust and that
the data received from Clients is processed correctly and updates the appropriate systems. The
paystation® project will implement POL TI with the appropriate controls.

LI

Sales & AP > POL FS - Retain for 0 days
» Chants. Retain for 2 years

Non Sales ~ REMSs, Revaluation ate — Retain 90 days
Events ~ Log on etc. ~ Retain 90 days

4.4.3. XI Changes

The two data streams into POL FS (from POL TI and HNG-X) will be using existing interfaces. How
SAP-XI handles these data streams and how they are posted into POL FS is entirely dependent on
the reference data pertaining to the Article. As mentioned previously in Section 4.3.3.2, no new
modes are required, but Mode 14 will be re-used.

4.4.4 Transaction Volumes

Volume figures will be defined in a form that can be fed into PA/PER/033 during the definition of the
Als's.
