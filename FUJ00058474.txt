2. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

2.1 KEY POINTS - JUNE 2000

« In June Pathway Management Support Unit received 742 incidents, as compared to 600 in May, thus showing a further
increase since February, March and April.

« The Non Polled offices occurred most frequently, as 633 were received in June, as compared to 445 incidents (74.1%) in May.
This is shown in report and table 3.1 and 3.2. Therefore, 85.3% of all incidents handled by MSU in this period were due to non-
polling, followed by Receipts and Payments (Migration) being 8.2%, as compared to 13.8% in May. Receipts and payments
due to post-migration accounted for 2.0% of incidents in June, as compared to 4.0% during the last period.

« There were 742 incidents received and managed by MSU in June, where 792 were cleared. Incident analysis indicates that
72.5% of all incidents were successfully cleared achieving the Sday SLA, whereas 88.5% of incidents attained the 24 hour SLA.

« Report 3.3 shows incidents received by MSU over a period of time, whereby the ratio of incidents received to outlets has
increased slightly in June to 0.09, as compared 0.08 in May. This indicates a slight upward trend in the number of incidents
occurring in the live Horizon estate, in comparison to the previous month.
