2. Notes for table

In the above table spend is rounded to nearest £1 million.

2.1 Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme

63 postmasters (out of the 555 who were members of the GLO) had convictions
and are therefore eligible to apply for financial redress once their conviction has
been overturned.

The remaining 492 postmasters are currently eligible for the GLO scheme, of
whom 484 qualify for interim payments.

476 to 483 of the 484 have received their share of the £19.5 million interim
payment announced in June 2022.

For disclosure reasons, the exact number of claims paid is now withheld.

Work continues on the remaining payments in complex categories such as
those recently deceased and people who have not taken up the offer of an
interim payment.

A full claim on the GLO Scheme is defined as a claim which DBT considers,
with advice from its legal advisers, does not need any further evidence in order
to assess every element of the claim. Should the department consider further

BEISO001047

evidence is needed in order to make a full assessment, this claim is no longer
counted in our data as a full claim until such time that the required evidence is
received from the claimant or any other source. This means that the figures
reported for number of claims received may need to be revised.

3. GLO scheme delivery target

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is committed to a target of
making a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim within
40 working days.

A full claim is defined as a claim which DBT considers, with advice from its legal
advisers, does not need any further evidence in order to assess every element
of the claim.

Should the department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a
full assessment, the 40-working day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

As of 23 February, 85% of claimants received their first offer within 40 working
days of submitting a full claim.

4. GLO scheme 75k fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January, all eligible GLO claimants are now offered
the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total fixed sum of
£75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their individual
losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the GLO guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-litigation-

order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is made.

As of 23 February 2024, 80 offers have been accepted over 70 of which are
paid under the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those paid the £75,000 fixed
payment, two thirds are new claims and a third had previously accepted offers.

As of 23 February 2024, approximately £34 million is the total value of all
payments including interim payments that has been paid to claimants in the
GLO scheme.
