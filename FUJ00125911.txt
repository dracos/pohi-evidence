Hi Mark

Unfortunately we did not start work on the tools to capture the BTS and Gareth is now on leave for 2 weeks,
returning week commencing 27 September. I spent a fair amount of time on Friday trying to locate a previous
copy we had provided, unfortunately without luck.

I attach a copy of Gareth’s statement supporting duplicated transactions.

Kind regards
Penny

Penny, I have a real live request for a copy of a BTS, however this is beyond the 6 months for migrated
branches, so I guess we are unable to retrieve a copy direct from the branch,

Did you manage to progress any further with the process you were looking at to produce BTS at your end,
thank you.

Also, I'm looking for a copy of the expert witness statement that Gareth completed for our solicitors in respect
of the duplicated data. I have to ring Juliet today, as one of the investigators (re: Rinkfield) requires to use the
statement, however I understand Juliet wanted a couple of amendments, but I can’t locate the draft.

Regards
Mark

I am the appeals manager dealing with the case for FERNDOWN 282508 2 the BTS for Period 11 is missing
I am trying to establish how and how is responsible for this, the issue is that the subpostmaster is suggesting
that false figures have appeared in the office account and this has caused them losses, as you can see I
have Period 10 of last year and Period 12 but not period 11 if this could be provided it would be very helpful in
my appeal deliberations, however if this is going to cost a fortune to achieve them I am happy to not proceed
with the request, any help or advice on this gratefully received.

Yes I believe Penny is referring to the Branch Trading Statements (BTS for short) stating they can be
reprinted which is news to me as I was always under the impression they could not.

However it does appear that this is only for either 12 or now 6 months when often the requests are historical
for perhaps 2-3 years.

If this can be clarified by Penny it would be very useful for everyone to be aware of this being available.

Gary, hope you can further assist on this one. This is an extract from Penny. Is this the same thing as the
Branch Trading Statement, or is she referring to something else. She appears to be on the same page which
means that it is possible to obtain a reprint, but from Fujitsu.

Cheers
Mark
On Horizon it was possible to reprint the Balance Reports and BTS for up to 12

months. On HNG-X we believe it is possible to do this for 6 months. Also, it is
only BTS reports that were migrated from Horizon to HNG-X.

We believe we could provide some assistance here, but it would not be part of the
standard service.

Before our application migrated to HNG-X we developed and used a specific tool to
print out Balance report and BTSs from audit records.

We should be able to develop something similar around the HNG-X retrieval tools
that we now have for Horizon data.

For HNG-X this data is also in the audit trail and we should be able to extract
it.

Are you looking for Balance reports for a Horizon office?

At this stage we are not sure about costs, but we should be able to develop a

tool with approximately 5 man days of effort - which we could book to the
Litigation Support CT for Gareth Jenkins.

Kind regards

It appears that this person (Philip de Nahlik) is talking about the Branch Trading Statements and I don't
think these are able to be re created by Fujitsu as he states. The information on the Horizon data will show
the actual trading period discrepancy but that's about all.

Perhaps a phone call to him may establish the office he is dealing with and in turn allow us to identify the

Fraud Advisor who is actually dealing with the case. It may be then that better copies could be supplied or
arrangements can be made for the originals to be viewed.

Dear Sirs

HORIZON/POST OFFICE SYSTEMS

1am London partner of Begbies Traynor accountants in charge of forensic accountancy.

I have over the years carried out a number of Post Office investigations.

T have a situation where in a current case the monthly management statement print outs are too faint
to read (even the originals). My memory of an earlier job is that you at Fujitsu can re create these

monthly management statements and reprint them.

Please could you confirm this and at the same time please also supply a name and contact telephone
number so I can follow up.

Many thanks, this is I regret as ever an urgent issue.

Yours sincerely

Statement of GARETH IDRIS JENKINS

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of two pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my
knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to
prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 8 dayof July 2010

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd, since 1996 as a Customer Solutions architect, involved in many aspects of design
and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon. This is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

Fujitsu have a Security Department which is responsible for providing audit data to the Post
Office Limited's Fraud Team.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to
archive media. This creates a record of all completed outlet transaction details including its
origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
TMS journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all completed transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They
therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded
in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. Records of all transactions are
written to audit archive media.

With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which data is audited has always worked on the

Continuation of statement of GARETH IDRIS JENKINS

principle that it is acceptable to audit the same data more than once — in particular if in doubt
as to whether or not it has been previously audited successfully. The Mechanism used on
Horizon to retrieve the audit data took this into account and only presented one instance of
such duplicate data in the ARQ extracts. The Audit Mechanism cannot alter the base
information and therefore a re-running of the audit process will always produce the same
result.

In January 2010 a new HNG-X application was introduced to filter transaction records for
presentation to Post Office Limited. It has recently been noticed that this HNG-X retrieval
mechanism does not remove such duplicates. An enhancement to the extraction toolset will
be developed, tested and deployed and will remove such duplicate data in the future. However
until this enhancement is deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated. The reliable
way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used to generate
the unique sequence numbers. This will be included in all future transaction record returns
until the retrieval mechanism is enhanced. A semi-automated process to copy the returned
data, and then to identify and remove any duplicated records which may be present from this
copy by using the <NUM> attribute, has been agreed with Post Office Limited for use in the
interim period.

It is emphasised that the duplication of audited records has not, in any way, affected actual
physical transactions recorded on any counter at any outlet. The duplication of records has
occurred during the auditing process when records were in the process of being recorded
purely for audit purposes from the correspondence servers to the audit servers.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times the
computer was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly, or
was out of operation was not such as to effect the information held on it. I hold a responsible
position in relation to the working of the computer.
