Alysa
Just to clarify one of the comments Peter and I said yesterday regarding the Horizon scheme.

e As we stated, the rules of the scheme give the chair a casting vote as to whether a case should go to mediation
or not, if the JFSA and POL disagree. However, each party can still decide whether to participate in the
process or not as mediation is by its nature voluntary.

e POL has to date declined to mediate in only 2 cases (so unclear where James Arbuthnot gets his “90% of
cases” from)

e Reasons to decline include where an SPM has say admitted theft, or where the case is so vague, such that
there is nothing to really mediate on. It is worth noting that each mediation process costs up to £30k so POL
does view each case with a critical eye.

Kind regards
Richard

Hi all,
Just a couple small things I noted during our catch up and would be grateful if you could take forward.

e Jo would like to press Paula on the timings of Network Expansion and the rolling out of the Mini Post Offices in
their meeting next week. Can this be in the briefing please.

e Her steer would be to leave the cliff as Sept 2015 unless there are huge benefits of moving it. Can you let POL
know this at official level?

Thanks,
Alysa
