All

Further to the below, the purpose of this call is limited to discussing the technical issues and commercial concerns with
providing access to the KEL and unfiltered transaction and event data. Please during the call bear in mind that the
purpose is not to discuss whether these documents should be provided, but how access could be provided. We have
already provided Freeths with an explanation of your concerns (letter attached) and this call should be limited to a
broader discussion of these topics.

Please also note this is not an off the record or without prejudice call and there is a chance that Freeths and/or Jason
may try to broaden the call to discuss other matters. It would be appreciated if you could (1) stay within the scope of
the meeting; and (2) only answer the questions asked and not offer additional explanations or stray into other areas of
Horizon.
