JH No comment.
GB Is that why the cash figures are so high because you got into financial difficulty

and you've gradually been stealing Post Office money and the cash is being
inflated and it’s got to the stage where the auditors have come in and only found
£1,900 and something on hand. Is it the case that you’ve been stealing money
over a period of time from the Post Office?

JH No comment.

that you have been stealing Post Office money?

Counter News. Do you implement those updates?

she was encouraged to ring the Helpdesk. States that is great because if you
don't know the answer or believe your manuals are out of date then the people

problem did you phone the Helpdesk for assistance?

when this was?
JH No comment.
GB States that it says that following a telephone call to either the Helpline or Colin
