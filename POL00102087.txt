Subject: Ask for the following - re govt

1. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Initiate inquiry independent of Post Office — perhaps a public
inquiry

2. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Post Office to make available prosecution records relating to
all cases being considered under the Mediation Scheme to the investigators

3. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Post Office to make available all data regarding suspense
accounts for those years during which an investigation is relevant

4. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Ask the Ministry of Justice to consider how to deal with cases
where a miscarriage of justice has been found but where defendant has pleaded guilty and
make available its recommendations to this Committee

5. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Ensure that the Post Office preserves and makes available to
the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) any documentation the CCRC thinks relevant to
enquiries it wishes to make on behalf of applicants who claim to be victims of a miscarriage of
justice (Alan, Kay, please use these exact words — James has written to the Chairman of the
CCRC and is meeting with him and Kevan Jones soon to discuss Post office cases)

6. <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Ask the Ministry of Justice to make available a suitable
legislative vehicle as soon as possible, extending the CCRC’s Section 17 powers to cover the
private sector (as above, please use these exact words)

Re the final two points, please see the attached.

Janet
