Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA - GUILDFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL

I refer you to Ms Issy Hogg’s E-Mail of the 22"? July 2010.

These have been previously requested by you and our view is consistent. The prosecution do not have
obligation to grant you access you require or are not prepared to disclose this material. However you are

perfectly entitled to make a Section 8 application to the Court.
