Alan

Further to the correspondence detailed below - | have now met with our
Finance Team to discuss this issue and to establish their position regards
any requirements they have to ensure POL does not incur additional expose
as a result of this defect.

As previously stated the Final Balance Report is a legal document and as
such POL rely on the accuracy and integrity of the report during any legal
action we undertake to recover monies from Subpostmasters. Given the Trial
report can be printed several times - usually following stock adjustments
made during the balancing process, this has no standing from a legal
perspective.

Based on this, and the understanding of the defect, how it arose, and the
proposed rectification (as provided by Gareth); our Finance team require
certain specific deliverables from Fujitsu in order for them to be able to
mange the risk this poses, and to give them confidence to support the
continued Roll-Out of HNG.

The deliverables required are;

A complete and comprehensive list of all products where the volumes on
the Final Balance Report differ to those on the Trial Balance Report.

A definitive statement detailing:

1. How this defect has arisen

2. What the impacts of this defect are - detailing all stock items
affected

3. What Fujitsu are doing to resolve this defect

4. Aclear statement proving the integrity of the data is not
compromised in any way, and that the only impact is incorrectly reported
data.

5. A commitment to support POL in proving the integrity of the system
in any subsequent legal action (specifically where the difference in the
two reports is used as a means to challenge the

integrity of the system).
FUJ00094268
FUJ00094268

POL Legal to "sign-off" the Fujitsu Definitive Statement as fit for
purpose.

There are several internal processes that will be implemented to ensure any
impact is minimised, however | do need Fujitsu's agreement to the above to
gain the support of our Finance teams.

Would you please respond and action this as a matter of urgency.

Thanks and Regards

Phil,

Thanks for the quick response - and yes, it does clarify the
cause of the issue.

What would be really useful is an example of exactly which
figures are different.

The only differences are in the Stock Levels part of the BTS report. The
first part which is concerned with the Cash movements and the summary
Trading position will be correct.

It is not practical to explain exactly which figures are wrong and which

are correct on the Final Report. However it is restricted entirely to the
Stock levels of Volume Stock (ie the second part of the BTS). From the
examples we have seen it is likely to be many of the Stock levels are wrong
(and the figures will be too high, so indicating that the Branch's Stock
levels should be higher than they really ought to be).

Given the legal status of these reports (they <the final > are
often used in court proceedings when we are trying to recover
monies from dismissed Subpostmasters) and the potential
FUJ00094268
FUJ00094268

"integrity" challenges that could be levelled against the HNG
system as a result of any differences; POL need assurance from
Fujitsu that they could/will explain the cause of the problem

and prove the system has integrity should we be challenged.

| understand this, though | would have though most legal proceedings would
be based on the first part of the report (which covers cash levels) rather
than the second part.

| know this is not your area, however in order to help us get
concurrence from our Finance Team we do need that commitment. |
know Mark has asked Chris for that assurance, however dependent
upon the outcome of the meeting scheduled with POL Finance on
Monday we may need to request more specific assurances.

I'll leave others to respond to that.

Would you please advise who within FS would be in a position to
provide the assurances/agree to any such request.

Again, I'll leave others to respond to that.

Regards

Gareth

Phil,
Alan D'Alvarez has asked me to respond to your concerns below.

I'll try and explain the issue and what has caused it.

| assume you've seen the attached write up of the issue which was send to

Barry Evans (and others) on Friday 12/02/10.

<<BTSStockLevels v3.doc>>

To expand on this a bit further:

1. When the BTS is being produced, it is done based on data written to

the Branch Database (BRDB) whenever a Stock Unit Rolls over.

2. BTS Production retrieves this data from BRDB to the counter.

3. The counter then uses it to generate the Trial BTS

4. There is a bug in the way that the report is produced such that

some of the in-memory copy of the data is overwritten when the Trial BTS is

produced

5.  Aconsequence of this is that when the final BTS is produced it is

using incorrect data.

6. The problem has been fixed by ensuring that the final BTS uses the

original data retrieved by the counter at step 2 rather than the data left

over after step 4.

7. The problem was first reported by Warwick and they pointed out that

the trial Balance figures were correct and the Final Balance figures were

incorrect.

8. Comparing the Trial and Final balance figures with the

corresponding Stock Unit Balance Reports shows easily that the Trial

FUJ00094268
FUJ00094268
Balance is correct and the final Balance is incorrect.

9. None of the incorrect data is stored to BRDB so there is no

possibility of ongoing corruption of stock levels.

Does this clarify the situation for you? I’m happy to talk it through with

you and expand on any areas that are still unclear if that would help, but

| thought it simplest to expand on the write up first.

Regards

Gareth

Just rang Geoff but he is on leave - would you be able to help with this

one please.

Would you please send any history regards this issue - specifically what

the differences in the Final report are, and can you advise how Fujitsu

have established that the trial report is correct - and that there is no

corruption of the data.

A speedy response would be appreciated as | need to explain this issue to

our Finance colleagues in more detail.

Thanks and Regards

Thanks but can | ask who you have agreed this workaround with. This is a

legal document and there is a difference between a trial balance and a

Final Balance? | would also expect CS to have a KEL for this - if agreed -

to be able to explain the position to any Subpostmaster who calls in.

Graham to confirm please.

Phil

Can you discuss with P&BA please to determine if this would be acceptable?

Both,

This is to confirm the position on a fix for the BTS issue whereby printing

the Trial Balance Report for BTS results in incorrect data being displayed

in the Final Balance Report. A fix can be delivered and tested for

inclusion within the 01.08 Maintenance Release as a counter fix.

In the meantime, branches need to use the BTS Trial Balance Report, which

is correct, and discard the BTS Final Balance Report, which is incorrect.

Regards,

Geoff
