Angela

During the recent BAQC meeting on the 25" April 2014 .When the attached was mentioned .You indicated that there
would be cases where immediate intervention and suspension would be justified . Obverse starting point example in
case of shortage of 20K -30K.

There will be cases in which it will be clear from the outset that POL will need to conduct criminal investigation with
view to potential prosecution to protect POL brand and reputation and for business purposes. It would be unfortunate
if such cases were compromised by the process of dialogue by the agents deployment team or others involved in the
contractual process. For that reason I would recommend the policy document “ material breach of contract” be send
to Cartwright King in order that they can advise POL from criminal law prospective.

It seems to me that the best approach for the business would be to ensure that the proposed contract breach policy
document remains unchanged from a contractual prospective, but has safe guards built in from criminal prospective
to avoid potential embarrassment to pol.

Could you please confirm whether you are happy for me to send this document to Cartwright King for advice.

Best Wishes.

Jarnail
