3 CUSTOMER SERVICE

HSH continue to support LT2 well, with July call volumes dropping significantly
on June (Total calls logged have dropped by 16.5%) highlighting an overall
improvement with the service. In respect of the HSH operational service more
improvements have been made or are on-going:

Networked reference systems are now installed at both HSH sites in Manchester
and Stevenage. The reference systems comprise 2 by 5 counter post office
configurations and can be upgraded with both reference data information and

It is planned that another 5 counter system will be installed at each site in

HSH staff training has also been improved and TSA refresher courses are ongoing.
HSH have introduced a competency test at the end of the course to identify that
TSAs have either achieved an appropriate level of skill or require additional

training.
5.

Work on the development of Helpdesk call scripts is ongoing. POCL feedback has
been received and the scripts are being updated to reflect comment. The scripts
are now within the second comment cycle. It must be noted that the improvement
of call scripts will be an ongoing activity used to “continuously improve” the
delivery of the business to the Post Office Counter. 1 scripts have been fully
developed, 3 are under development. It is believed the use of call scripts has
improved the performance of the HSH and the average call duration has dropped
by 1% to 4 minutes 32 seconds for July.

3.1.2 Outlet Change

Since the last report POCL have raised the following outlet change requests.

Location Reason for Change
Leonard Stanley, Stroud Outlet Closure
Northville, Bristol Outlet Refurbishment
Montagu Estate, Newcastle Outlet Refurbishment
Filton Avenue, Bristol Outlet Refurbishment
Chesterton Lane, Cirencester Outlet Refurbishment

ICL Pathway is working with the Network Change Authorisers in the Northeast and

Southwest regions to plan and deliver these changes.

3.1.3 _ Management Information

1. Work is nearly completed on the July Service Review book.

2. In depth analysis work is being undertaken into all aspects of HSH performance
and counter system availability and usability, reporting into POCL Business Service
Management. Particular emphasis being placed on the performance of the extra 24

outlets introduced in LT2 against a 'matched' set from the existing 299 outlets.

3.1.4 Business / Reconciliation Incident Management

1. Cash Account related reconciliation incidents continue to fall as the LT2 software
is refined. The main area of concern is still centred on the performance of the

printing process with a high number of calls being received by the HSH.

2. Systems reboot and slow printing during cash account are areas of POCL concern

which are being investigated.

3.2 Operations Services

3.2.1 Systems Operate Service

1 Correspondence Server Clusters 2 & 4 have had “Blue Screen” failures. Normal
failover to Wigan occurred. Investigations are ongoing into Cluster 2, with

problem unknown at present. Cluster 4 awaiting a PSU control PCB.

3.2.2

1

Problems on the Audit Server at Wigan are being investigated, but the current
action is to rebuild the server on Friday (13"" August).

We are experiencing problems with a file feed to the Data Warehouse which
stopped processing at the 5th August. A workaround is currently being put in
place and processing restarted, with catch up over the next 2 days being run during
the day.

Networks
No major issues this week, but we are still seeing several PO’s reporting NOT

harvested for a period of days, normally between 2 and 4. A tight monitor is being
maintained on this and it is running as a problem.

3.2.3 Business Continuity

1.

3.

We are currently undergoing acceptance reviews of Business Continuity Testing
with POCL.

All Business Continuity tests have now completed a first pass and the first draft of
the overall report will be complete by close of business on Friday (13"" August).

Some repeat tests are still to be scheduled with POCL.

3.2.4 _TIP

1.

Outstanding AI342 regarding file and data delivery has been addressed and
responded to through Requirements. Another High priority Al376 regarding
missing data from TIP is also being addressed. The problem is where we have
data, which fails validation by the Pathway service, and does not get harvested, we
cannot send that data to TIP. We have established a workaround whereby we
check for this data each day and send a RED report out through MSS so that TIP
can manually reconcile their Cash Accounts. We have a number of PinICLs which
when released should also significantly reduce the number of transactions that fall
into this state, and we are currently looking at how to rectify the root cause. The
occurrences of this problem are relatively small. _ Basically affecting 1% of all
outlets. Since the fixes have been applied we expect that to drop by around 10% to
0.1% of outlets. At a guess this would be 2-3 transactions per month.

Pressure has been applied in an attempt to move forward the OLA. The Steering
Group has not meet since June and no progress has been made. It would appear
TIP awaits input from POCL BSM. Julia Bowes has sent out notes and tried to
contact the relevant team, but has had no response about moving things forward.
Currently we operate without an agreed OLA. This needs to be moved forward
urgently.

APS

There seems to be some delay in POCL receiving the OLA for sign off. It has been
signed by Pathway and sent through the POCL distribution process. This is now
well behind schedule.

POCL have logged a number of Incidents to say the AP Transaction Summary
Report does not match the Control File figures. We believe the report is
performing as it should, but POCL do not agree. Julia Bowes is to escalate this
through Bob Cragg to agree a way forward.

Service running well. Our new Unpolled Offices report and procedure have
addressed this. An outstanding AI in relation to this has been responded to
through Requirements.

CTO

3.2.6

1.

Pathway has received a request from POCL to redefine the Token Verification
service so that POCL perform the role of token testing instead of Pathway. We
have received a brief outline proposal through an Email. Julia Bowes has
requested through Bob Cragg that we receive this request via the CR process. This
is because we expect to breakdown costs incurred so far in establishing the
processes and testing the tokens to date. We still await the CR. All work on
documentation and OLAs is on hold until we establish the way forward. We will
now simply run the Token Verification in accordance with the agreed schedule
until further notice.

3.2.7__AP Client Migration

1

Good process being made with POCL, although things are moving slowly. We
have established contact with Girobank and have workshops organised with POCL
next week to agree how the presentations will work. The next priority is to
establish communications with as many AP clients as soon as possible. Internal
preparations are moving forward positively. Will set up a review meeting with
POCL shortly.

3.2.8

3.2.9

LFS

Moving forward slowly. Do now have responses to CARs. The process of putting
together an operational timetable is in the very early stages.

Reference Data

During the Sequent Host failover test, data could not be delivered to the
Verification Counters due to a difference in the firewall configurations between
Bracknell/Bootle and Bracknell/Wigan. After significant input from RDT, this was
eventually diagnosed and corrected. There was also an issue with the RDMC
Workstations not being reconfigured to point at Wigan. The firewalls have now
been reconfigured.

16 PinICLs currently outstanding on POCL re: quality of their Reference Data/OBC
processes (9 on OSG, Farnborough and 7 on RDOT, Chesterfield).

A total of 30 reference data changes were released to the Live estate last week.

3.2.10 Release Management

1

Resource in Release Management is focussed on acceptance incidents. RN855,
which provided the agent fix to Al376, has been successfully applied. The latest
tranche of Counter EPOSS had to be rejected last Saturday and a fix produced
urgently for issues that required application before cash account on 11" August. This
fix RN895 was applied successfully to 794 counters out of 821 in one night. It is now
complete. At the time of writing RN896 has 9 counters outstanding and RN897 has
23 counters outstanding from the total population of 821. Testing of the other non-
polled outlets report (CP2078) is in progress and it is expected to be delivered to live
over the coming weekend (14/15 August).

STATUS I A report is being produced and will be complete on
Monday 9°" Aug.
Action complete.

4712 To check the numbers of incidents reported (prior to and MR
after LT2) and to ensure that there is a common view 6 Aug
between everyone of the numbers, particularly of software
reported calls.

STATUS I It is understood that POCL and Pathway are in
agreement with the number of incidents reported for all
categories. Pathway has received no indication from
POCL that the figures reported for each incident
category - (as supplied

weekly by CS to POCL BSM), i.e. ‘Advice and Guidance’,
‘Hardware’, 'Network' and ‘Operations’, are being
disputed.

The figures quoted within the June Service Review were
accepted by POCL, and the July Service Review is due to
be presented to POCL this week.

Action complete.

4713 To report why there has been an increase in the number of MR
incidents reported as software related since the introduction 6 Aug
of LT2.

STATUS I The number of Software calls logged with HSH by Live
Outlets from March 1999 to July 1999 is as follows: -

March = 330
April = 557
May = 833
June = 1164
July =1477

The reason for the increase in the number of calls
received in LT1 & 2 can be referred to known problems:

* Receipts & Payments misbalance - problem now
resolved
* Stock unit roll over into subsequent CAP - problem

STATUS

I reported that it had been reported in the APS Steering
Group meeting that Davyd Nash had said that it was the
intention that this service would be carried out by POCL
rather than Pathway. As there had been many man-
months development against this I requested
clarification on this. I believe Keith Baines took the
action to find out more.

Action ongoing.
