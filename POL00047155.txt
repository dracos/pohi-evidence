POST OFFICE LTD -v- ALISON HENDERSON
CASE POLTD/0910/0167

I understand from the papers that an audit discovered a shortage of just in excess of £11,900
at a sub post office that was only open on a limited basis.

I also understand from the papers that whilst the suspect would maintain that she was
unaware of the loss, the suspicion is that when she completed the branch trading statement
on 6 January 2010 she would have been aware of the loss. Could you explain to me why she
would have been aware of the loss? I note there is reference to a table in Appendix B which
leads to the suspicion that she knew of the loss. I am not able to understand why it shows
that she would have been aware that the accounts were short on that occasion.

Presumably, we would be able to interrogate Horizon and establish a full accounting pattern
for the sub office to show all transactions that were conducted and therefore how much
money was paid out, how much was received in remittances and therefore how much should
have been present in the account.

Accordingly, I would like to understand how it is that we can pinpoint where this loss occurred.
You may think it sensible at this stage bearing in mind it is most unlikely that she will plead
guilty that we start to put together full witness and exhibit bundles.
