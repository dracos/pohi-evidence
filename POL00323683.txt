Exec Summary FUJITSU

The Horizon Application has been designed to ensure that accurate and auditable
records are kept of all sub-postmaster transactions

When a transaction is conducted at a counter, an auditable mechanism has been
built in to ensure these transactions are taken from the counter, stored in the
Horizon main branch database and then copied to an audit database

This mechanism can be considered a ‘closed loop’ where information is securely
exchanged from the counter to the Horizon branch database and then on to the
audit database

Whilst copies of transaction data are provided to numerous external systems from
the main Horizon database, the Core Audit Process is segregated, its records are
security sealed and audit records cannot be accessed or changed through external
interfaces

Given the nature of the design, the Core Audit Process is fundamental to any
examination of the integrity of transaction data

A number of ‘assertions’ can be independently examined to test the robustness of
the audit process

N.B. Where necessary any external systems will need to be examined and
compared to the Core Audit Data on a needs basis dependant on individual cases
