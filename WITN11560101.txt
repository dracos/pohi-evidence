Dear Ms Jones,
Request for information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006

I am writing to you as the Solicitor to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry to make a formal request on behalf of
the Chair under Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006. This is the first request that has been made to your client,
UKGI, under the Inquiry Rules 2006. As you will be aware, the Chair will make a determination on the List of
Issues in due course, after which new requests under Rule 9 may be issued by the Inquiry.

Your client provided documents to the Inquiry before it was converted into a statutory inquiry on 1 June 2021.

Accordingly, I should be grateful for confirmation that the unredacted documents you have already provided
may be treated as if they were provided to the Inquiry pursuant to a request under Rule 9 and, as such,
considered as evidence by the Chair under the Terms of Reference. Please provide this confirmation by 5pm
on 30 September 2021.

Further, I formally request that all documents which you have previously provided in redacted form (by reason,
for example, of data protection) be re-submitted to the Inquiry in their original, unredacted form. Any such
unredacted documents should be resubmitted by 5pm on 30 September 2021.

Any requests for redactions and/or applications for restriction orders should be made in accordance with the
Inquiry’s published Protocol on Redaction, Anonymity and Restriction Orders, which provides that such
requests should not be made until after the Inquiry confirms that it wishes to disclose the document (or within 7
days of the Inquiry confirming that it will not be making the redaction on relevance grounds, if later).

If, in response to any further requests under Rule 9, you choose to refer to, or to resubmit, documents that you
have already provided to the Inquiry prior to 1 June 2021, please ensure that this is clearly reflected in your
response (and in any Index of documents, as appropriate).

The Indices of documents your client provided to the Inquiry prior to 1 June 2021 have been appended to this
letter, for your information. The Inquiry notes that some of these Indices were provided in conjunction with
BEIS. Please note that this does not mean the Inquiry is in receipt of all documents listed and any documents
that appear in the lists, but have not yet been provided to the Inquiry, should be submitted in response to this
letter and without delay.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
