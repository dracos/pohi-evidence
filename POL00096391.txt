The Chairman understood that Berkeley Partnership had
challenged the concept of the towers within the framework.
Lesley Sewell to take a further look at the different approach
suggested by Berkeley Partnership.

Lesley Sewell

Berkeley provided a useful summary of
the option to consider multiple
‘application’ towers, with the primary
benefits being: promotion of more
competition in establishing run cost of
new services, and enabling phased re-
procurement of each individual app tower
as they reach their individual end-of-life
(vs forced re-procurement under a single
run provider).

The report agreed that there is no ‘right
answer’ and support our stated
procurement approach of engaging in
competitive dialogue with suppliers to
discuss the most beneficial tower
construct. Single or multiple app towers
will be identified as part of this
competitive dialogue as best fits the
needs of the Post Office, particularly with
consideration to the existing Horizon
‘app’ tower and on-going evolution of
that platform to meet business
transformation needs in parallel to the re-
procurement activities.

A copy of Berkeley's note on this subject
is tabled as a noting paper for the April
Board.
