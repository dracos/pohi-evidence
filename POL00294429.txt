5. On the date of the audit the auditor found a total shortage of £74,880.75 made

up as follows:

£95.33 (-) identified as a difference in cheques on hand figures

£130.36 (+) identified as a difference in foreign currency figures

£74,880.75 (-) TOTAL

6. Mr Parekh had given the auditors a signed note in which he said that the
accounts would be £50,000 to £60,000 short and that he had been adjusting his

cash to show a balance.

7. Mr Parekh, in his interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 30"

April 2009 said that:

He agreed that he had told the auditors that there would be a shortage
of £50-60,000 and accepted that the figure could be as high as £77,000
He controlled the BM and HH stock units.

He had been waiting for the refurbishment of a property and owing to
shortages he had been paying staff, mortgage and council tax from one
account.

He got £8,000 per month from the Post Office and had to pay £5,000

mortgage and £3000 on staff with other expenses on top.

Defence case

8. In interview the defendant admits taking POL money and entering false figures

into Horizon both to the auditors and in his interviews.

9. Despite these admissions a not guilty plea was entered and a defence statement
was served which disputed the taking of the £74,880.75, denied dishonesty,
sought the exclusion of the interview on the basis of the medication that he was
taking at the time of the interview, challenged the Horizon system and put

some of the discrepancies down to members of his staff.

10. He disputed the totality of the loss.

11. The defendant pleaded guilty with no basis. In his Pre Sentence Report he

admits the offence in its entirety in virtually the same terms as the interviews.

Discussion
12. This case was dealt with by way of a guilty plea at the eleventh hour before the
trial. The defendant has admitted stealing the money to the auditors, in his

interview and in the pre sentence report.

13. Whilst there is an attack on Horizon in the defence statement this does not
reflect the interviews which put the discrepancies down to staff errors rather

than unexplained errors.

14. Whatever the cause of the original discrepancies the vast majority of the loss,
even on his own version came from this defendant’s taking of the money to pay
staff, mortgage, council tax and other expenses. It is difficult to conjure any
circumstances where this defendant could be assisted appealing this conviction
or sentence by any disclosure that we could make of the issues canvassed in the

Second Sight Interim Report.

Conclusion

15. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we might have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the
Second Sight Interim Report during the trial process but in view of the
defendant’s full admissions to theft to the auditors, in interview, to the author
of the Pre Sentence Report and his guilty plea on legal advice I cannot see how

he can be assisted by any further disclosure that we might make
