Ok I will set up a 30 call next week for lessons learnt. Apart from you, should I invite anyone else, eg Craig?

Hi Simon,

OK -— it makes sense now. A review of lessons learnt would be good and I have implemented some along

the way but we should formally record these and any others that transpire.

Hi Angela

Our position hardened when Ron and lan made it clear that our response will be put into public domain, this has lead
our legal team to become concerned that anything we include could be used against us in the future and made us
take a more cautious approach. Since then Ron & lan have back tracked a bit an said they’d only put in an exec
summary of our spot reviews in the report — however the point remains as we don’t know what part they will pick
out.

Ron/lan can come back with more questions if they want. However we are trying to influence them to only focus on
areas which answer the question “is there a systemic defect in Horizon” — most of these spot reviews seem to be
peripheral matters.

I do need to talk to you separately about lessons we have learned from the investigation and what/when we are going
to implement them — this is for Paula to show James that even though no systemic problem was found there were
some benefits to the exercise (hopefully we can think of some!). I’Il give you a call next week to discuss.

Simon,

Intentionally not answering questions raised by 2nd Sight will in my view give rise to suspicion ie that we
have something to hide and is not in the spirit of our interaction/engagement with Ron and lan. By trying to
dodge answers that may not present POL as positively as we would like will in the long term come back to
bite us. I would much rather be upfront from the start. There was always a risk that our policies, procedures
and processes would come under the spotlight and in some cases be deemed to not be as good as some
would expect whether this expectation is reasonable or otherwise — this was a risk I believe we accepted
from the start and whilst the integrity of the Horizon system may be intact we should not ignore any lessons
learnt that come out of these investigations.

You may think that I’m being overly holistic here (and perhaps I’ve missed something by not attending as
many of the recent meetings/conf calls) but I don’t believe I am and would be interested in the views of
Alwen and Susan although I am aware that they did not raise any issues/questions on the spot reviews.

Simon,
As requested my feedback is below:

¢ Spot review 1 — happy with our response

« Spot review 11 —- we have not responded to the request “POL is requested to provide statistical information
about the number of days taken to send TCs to the SPMRs in the Horizon Investigation Sample

We have intentionally not provided the stats on TC submission times for the following reasons:
POL00144588
POL00144588

1. This is irrelevant to the Second Sight's scope of work — the time taken to submit TC is a POL operations issue
not a Horizon issue.

2. There is no simple answer to this question — the time taken to respond to any particular TC depends on the
product, nature of error, investigation process, date the error is discovered, etc.

3. Compiling this information would be disproportionately expensive / time consuming for in light of (1) and (2)
above.

4. Anecdotally, the view is that these stats would show POL in a negative light as there will always be a material
lag between a transaction and a TC. There is no simple way to spin this in POL's favour.

5. The submission date of a TC does not fairly reflect the date on which the SPMR will have knowledge of an
error. In many cases, an enquiry regarding an error will have been raised with the SPMR before the TC is
issued. Providing TC stats would lead to a misleading view that there is a long delay between transaction date
and the SPMR's opportunity to investigate an error.

The above points cannot be explained in concise way that would not detract from an otherwise very positive response
on the accountability of GIRO transactions (which is the core issue in SR11). It was therefore thought best to simply
avoid this question for now. If Second Sight pushes for these stats, POL can then produce a separate and bespoke
response that addresses above points in detail.

« Spot review 12 - we state that “there will be around 100 cases per month where it becomes apparent
that a cheque has actually gone missing”. Could we present this as a % to demonstrate that this is not a
big issue in terms of volumes.

The figure of "100" missing cheques a month is anecdotal only. We would need to ask Andy Winn / Linn Norbury if
there is any hard data to back-up this figure or to convert it to a % of total cheques processed.

It would also be helpful to give some average time taken to raise a TC — discrepancies between
cheques received at processing centre and cheques remmed out would be identified relatively quickly
(within how many days?). A cheque that didn’t clear and that had been accepted incorrectly would be
returned to branch within xx? number of days.

See comments on SR11 above.

¢ Spot review 13 — happy with our response

Thanks,
Angela
