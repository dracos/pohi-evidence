David

Further to our review yesterday afternoon, I have updated the issues list to reflect the agreed outcomes. In particular:

e Ihave emailed John Dutton seeking guidance on the outstanding questions regarding branch reporting

e Gareth has spoken with Alan who is working on the TMS/AIS material for the CD. We understand that Alan will
be providing updated material for the CD during the course of today

e Gareth has left a message for Chris to call to determine progress on the requirements for handling non-
accounting data following the problems identified last Tuesday at our review

e [have tabled working assumptions as agreed the wording of which you will need to check/verify

I will call you after lunch for a follow up progress review as agreed.
Regards
