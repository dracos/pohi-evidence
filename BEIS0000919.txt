Hi Andrew,

Minister Hollinrake’s comments:

Happy with all the recommendations on Nick Read pay

The £30k bonus is a relatively small sum but it is always controversial to try and claim
something back. In the context of a much smaller pay increase than the Chair was looking
for I think we should let him keep it but perhaps Carl could make sure that we have done
this as a gesture of goodwill.

Best wishes,
Cora

D ROVAL: POL CEO pay sub follow up advice

Importance: High
Hi Andrew,

Further to your request below, please see attached for requested follow up advice on POL CEO pay. This
advice has been cleared by the Permanent Secretary.

Following SoS’s meeting with Henry, Senior BEIS and UKGI Officials have discussed the pay issue with him
again. He recognises the political considerations that SoS raised and is no longer expecting approval of the
full proposal; he would, though, still like to see a retention bonus and a small pay increase for the CEO. He
is particularly anxious about not asking Nick to repay the £30k which is a deserved bonus that was properly
approved within POL. We are recommending we do not ask Nick to return this as doing so is likely to drive
active ill-will from the Chair and CEO (as opposed to just disappointment around overall pay levels, which
is an inevitable part of their public sector roles).

Thanks again for all your help with this. Please let me know if any questions.
Best,

Siv

HiJames,

Thanks very much for this, and Carl for joining.
BEIS0000919
BEIS0000919

As discussed, the action from this meeting is for follow-up advice on the CEO retention/pay issue in the round.
Expect SoS will view the bonus more favourably than big pay increase — but (as below) do think we need to make
clear difference between this and pay within an ALB. @Creswell, Carl (Business Sectors - Services Directorate) Could
I please ask for that by the end of next week?

Attendees: SoS, Henry, Jess Webb, Carl Cresswell, Andrew Crawford

Readout:

- Henry started setting out the scale of some of the challenges with POL: Horizon, legal issues, industrial
action. He was strong here.

- SoS asked about the structure and original privatisation of Royal Mail

- Henry then spoke about areas for the business to focus on, had an exchange on cash (growing share of
declining market) and the possibility of breaking with Royal Mail and the need to be competitive

- They spoke about the local importance of Post Offices, Henry said 25+ per constituency and SoS mentioned
one had closed in his but surprisingly no casework. Regardless SoS keen to POL to continue with current
approach to ensuring network maintained and gave clear steer on that.

- Henry talked about need to make life attractive for postmasters, survey showing 33% planning to leave in
next 3-4 years

- They then moved on to talk about recruitment challenges and how he wanted to build his team — Henry
talked about NED recruitment and difficult attracting top quality people.

-  S0S asked about Nick and CEO pay. They went through the 30K bones and the proposed increase in pay,
Henry firm in defending the need for it but SoS kept returning to ask how he could stand in parliament and
defend that kind of salary and increase in the context of the rest of public sector pay [/ think we need to
make clear for him in next advice the difference between POL situation and an ALB — don’t think this has
landed).

- Henry spoke about the importance of Nick to the business, challenge if he left now, and emphasised the
bonus in particular as something that would cause particular ill will if repaid

- SoS still reluctant and asked about skills you needed — Carl came in to say retail background was criterion.
Henry talked about other offers that would be coming Nick’s way.

- Don’t think there was much movement on SoS position on headline pay but maybe slightly softer view on
the bonus. He also asked about DfT and BEIS NEDs (which he thinks good) and whether any could be
candidates for POL. I’ve passed SoS henry’s number as requested.

Best wishes,
Andrew

Hi Andrew

Please find attached briefing for SoS meeting with the POL Chair, Henry Staunton on Monday. Do let me know if
there is any further which would be useful.
BEIS0000919
BEIS0000919

The origin of this meeting was the CEO pay issue. However, Henry will reflect on the extent to which he raises this
with SoS in light of his meeting with Sarah yesterday. The CEO pay issue has therefore been downgraded to ‘if
raised’.

@Creswell, Carl (Professional Business Services, Retail & Post Directorate) would like to join the meeting if possible —
please could you advise and share the invite with him if appropriate?

All the best

Adding policy team and Minister Hollinrake’s office —

It would be good to include general introduction, and get a sense of Henry’s priorities, his plans for the company,

Hi Andrew,
Thanks a lot for confirming.

Noting that this will be the first time that SoS will be meeting the new Chair, was there anything else that the SoS
would like on the agenda other than CEO pay?

If you can confirm — we will ensure those agenda points re also covered in the briefing.
Thanks again for all your help.

We've reached out to Henry, yes.

Hope you are well. We were just wanting to check in on the status of whether the conversation with Perm Sec on

If so, we would be grateful for confirmation of the meeting date. Please let us know if SoS would require a briefing

Hi Andrew,

The sub you have relates to a contained issue relating to pay for 21/22, so I would be grateful if you could
put that in for SoS review now, please.

This letter is about the CEO’s pay going forward and we and UKGI plan to advise on it separately. We
don’t want to hold up dealing with the 21/22 issue now, since a decision is required for POL’s
accounts. The forward-looking ask will require separate consideration.

Thanks,
Carl.
