Elisa ~ can you please deal with this under the Ad Hoc Contract Advisors file, unless it falls within the fixed fee for the
Group Litigation (Miss Davies is a claimant)?
Thanks, Rod

Rod,

Further to your email below, I have prepared a draft charge letter inviting Mrs Davies to respond
by letter and not offering a meeting. I do not think a meeting can have clear objectives and the
outcome would be unlikely to have a major bearing on the final decision.

There is a very large quantity of information on file relating to complaints, audit shortages and
warnings going back to the time of Miss Davies appointment in Octeber 2009, to which I have
alluded in the letter, but without great detail. Please advise if this is sufficient at this stage. A
summary is on file prepared following dispute of an audit shortage in March 2012 and it refers to
“a comprehensive explanation supplied by Post Office Solicitors Bond Dickenson LLP to Miss
Davies’s Solicitors, John Hamilton Leyshon Solicitors on 25 June 2013”. I do not have a copy of
this, but it could be useful should a decision be taken to terminate the contract.

Please would you review the attached letter

Regards

+ Andrew Parsons

Paul — we've just spoken. I am now copying Alan.

Anna Davies is a claimant in the Freeths Group Litigation, so this does require careful handling. [am therefore also
copying Andy Parsons and Elisa Lukas from Bond Dickinson who are running Post Office’s defence of that litigation.

My recommendation is:

1. Alan draft up a letter to the postmaster setting out the action he would like to take with this agent/branch under
normal BAU conditions, e.g. if it is that the contract for services is terminated, the grounds on which termination
would be based; if it’s reinstatement on conditions, then what those conditions are and why they are considered
necessary.

2. Given that Freeths will be involved, that action should NOT be an invitation to meet unless there is a clear,
realistic objective for the meeting, the outcome of which would have a material bearing on the action Alan
wants to take. Without that, we'll just get into the same problem we have with Gorman.

3. Legal then review that letter to advise on the legal risks raised by Alan’s proposed action.

Does that make sense?

Rod

Hi Paul

IT have enquired with Angela Van-Den-Bogerd and with the Support Services Resolution team
and they can find nothing to substantiate the claim made that the full loss at a neighbouring
branch was written off by Angela in similar circumstances. Angela has no recollection of writing
any amounts off in this or other surrounding branches and the SSR team have searched to no
avail. Both will consider again if the allegation is made sufficiently specific.

Please advise whether I should proceed with this case differently in any way because of the
implication of problems with the Horizon system.

With apologies for the delay in responding.

Thanks Alan.
Regarding the point she has made about a similar loss being written-off by Angela, is this correct?

If so, what were the circumstances, when did that happen, what was the value and how did the facts of that loss differ
to this case please?

Regards,
Paul.
