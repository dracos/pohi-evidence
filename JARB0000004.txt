Subject: RE: Post Office threats!!

Dear Mr Arbuthnot,

Today I received another threatening letter from the Post Office this time saying it is the last letter
before action.

I now believe I know where the problem might be.

I have discovered how to send transactions through the Horizon system which will appear on an
Alliance and Leicester bank account but will appear as Zero on the Horizon system.

I,m sure you will also find this interesting I found it on Mr Newmark MP,s website.

Mr Bristow

12 October 2009 : Parliamentary Question

Post Office Horizon System

Mr. Newmark: To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills whether
he has received reports of errors in the Post Office Horizon system which have led to Postmasters or
Postmistresses being falsely accused of fraud; and if he will make a statement. [291675] Mr.
McFadden: The Department has received no such reports. Any issues relating to the Horizon system
are operational matters for Post Office Ltd. I have therefore asked Alan Cook, managing director of
Post Office Ltd., to respond directly to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply will be placed in the
House Libraries.
