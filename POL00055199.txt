ATTENDANCE NOTE

CASE NAME: SEEMA MISRA
CASE NO: CRM/258932/JSX
DATE: 27” August 2010

Spoke to Warwick Tatford of Counsel on two matters. Firstly that on the question of
Defence request of granting access to the system in the Midlands or the operations
at Chesterfield or the system changed I have written to them saying that if they wish
to proceed they need a Section 8 application to the Court and I have not heard
anything further from them and also as to the page count have not heard anything.
He confirmed that he will speak to the Defence Counsel Mr Hadrill and had a brief
chat with him in Court, but very briefly, and he has stated that only the relevant
appropriate pages would be required. He will have another word with Mr Hadrill and
will revert back to me.
