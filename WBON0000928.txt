Just to you and Andy

You're quite right with this — we can’t afford for Fujitsu to be lazy and just point to this doc as providing all
the answers. We need to craft something specific to go back to SS with — Andy, you are I think already
playing with some drafting ?

Thanks Pete,

That sounds promising. Though we will need to map the lines SS have hung their assertions on, to the points
made in the paper i.e. what process FJ are referring to when they state “The data can be corrected by
adjusting the appropriate opening figures and BTS data that relates to the current TP” etc

Pete,

In preparation for this morning’s call, attached is a paper we had previously prepared with James Davidson
in relation to Remote Access. It never got finalised or shared with Second Sight. It may be that this forms the
basis for the answer we provide to Second Sight. But let’s discuss on the call.

This may be useful to have to hand for the call @1 lam. Especially given it seems likely SS query relates to
the BTP process.
