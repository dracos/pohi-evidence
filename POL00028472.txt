Agreed Category B Faults

J. I Of the nine Agreed Category B Faults, there are six with agreed 31* Augto I 6" Sept
resolution plans. It was agreed that ICL Pathway would submit an 5 Sept
Acceptance Incident Analysis Form to cover the agreed resolution plan
for each of the six Acceptance Incidents for POCL’s agreement. (The six
incidents are 342, 361, 371, 211, 399 and 39) Silvas = ory taeRiere etadg fle lasore.
_ Preliminary discussion of AI 378 - Incomplete cash account records
Action Date I Workshop
Date
2. I AI-378 is to be discussed on 26". It was thought that a new occurrence of I 26" Aug 26" Aug
this fault had arisen (12" August). However, Pathway have now stated
that this was a different fault. Therefore, one of the issues to discuss on
26" will be for Pathway to demonstrate that this new occurrence is a
different fault, In the meantime, it was agreed that POCL would raise a
separate new Acceptance Incident for the new fault
AI 369 - Scanner Reliability
Action Date I Workshop
Date
3. I The following were agreed: 2™ Sept
* Pathway would write up the results of the last 100-cover laboratory (Progress
tests and submit a report to POCL. check)

* Pathway and POCL would conduct data analysis to validate the DSS
proposition that there has been a higher level of impound rates on
OBCS compared with ESNS yet, as they were all valid books, there
must therefore be a higher rate of false rejection (impounds) on
OBCS than on ESNS. Pathway will conduct the data analysis and
validation work for OBCS; POCL will conduct the work for ESNS.

* Pathway will set up field validation of actual rejects occurring in
outlets, The validation tests will determine the cause of the rejects as
between scanner, user, paper, ink, damage, condition etc. This
activity is expected to require a mobile laboratory facility. ~

* POCL will seck observation of the field validation tests by DSS

* POCL will request the DSS to provide the covers off books rejected
during field validation &/or historically rejected books to Pathway
for laboratory testing.

« POCL will check training course material for the adequacy of
scanner user training and/or instructions.

© POCL will obtain the DSS’s buy-in to the above approach to the
resolution of this AI.

It was expected that Karen Rogers would co-ordinate this activity for

POCL and that John Dicks would initially do so for Pathway.

“The workshop discussed the observations made following the visit to the

Acceptance Incident Analysis. It was expected that this report would be

72, - Systems Management

Action Date

Workshop
Date

Pathway explained that the root cause has not yet been established but it
is thought that it may lie with the system software. Currently, there are
daily checks being conducted, which would identify any re-occurrence
of the problem and the proposition is that these checks should continue
until either the root cause is identified or else both parties are satisfied
that the problem is not re-occurring.

It was agreed that Pathway would prepare a resolution plan in the form

of proposals containing criteria for deciding if and when to discontinue
