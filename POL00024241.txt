My comments attached.

Before this is sent, I would recommend that it is converted to PDF, password protected and editing permissions locked
down (ie. sometimes you can lock out the print function). There are ways to get around this protections but they should
help avoid some of the risk. I can do this if that would help.

All
I know you’re snowed under with the Defences due today, however in light of the grief that we are getting from UKGI to
give them an update following the Board, I have drafted the attached. I have based it on the speaking notes which

David Cavendar used at the Sub-Committee — heavily abbreviated!

Once you are through with Defences, would you please read this and see if you’re ok with it, and on that basis we can
hopefully get it to UKGI on Monday.

Rod — we should also send across the summary you prepared following the CMC on Tuesday.
Many thanks everyone.

Jane
