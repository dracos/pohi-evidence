1 Introduction

1.1 Scope

This High Level Design sets out the design for the Secure Access Servers described in the Remote
Support and Diagnostics architecture (ARC/SYS/ARC/0004). This will provide remote support access to
IRE11 and IRE19 for the following user communities:

« SSC

« SMG

e ISD (Unix, NT and Network support)

° Test

The design will cover the connection method from the workstations to the SAS (SSN), the applications and
clients installed on the SAS (SSN) and the secure method used to connect to supported platforms.

The support workstations and laptops used to connect to the SAS (SSN) are out of scope for this design
and are described in (Réfi TBC)

Third Party support access is not covered in this HLD. See DES/SYM/HLD/0019 - Third Party Support
Access High Level Design.

1.2 Context within the Architecture

This design is contained within the Remote Support and Diagnostics Architecture. The context of the SAS
(SSN) is described in ARC/SYS/ARC/0004. The diagram below shows where the SAS (SSN) and test
SAS (SSN) fit into the over all support architecture. The SAS (SSN) described in this design will only be
used to support HNG-X platforms. The existing Horizon SAS design will be retained to support Horizon
platforms.

2 Design Principles
Listed below are the guiding design principles for Remote Systems and Diagnostics SAS design.
e The use of COTS applications where possible with minimal bespoke development

e Role based authentication through the Identity Management System incorporating 2 factor
authentication

e The SAS (SSN) will provide the only supported mechanism (except for agreed emergency
situations) for support staff to access the application server and counter infrastructure.

e The design needs to take account of the contractual Audit, Security and Risk procedures.

4 Sub-System Description
4.1 Secure Access Server (SAS) Overview

The SAS (SSN) is based on the Microsoft Windows 2003 platform as described in DES/PPS/HLDO001 -
Windows Server 2003 High Level Design for HNG-X. They will be used in scale out configuration as
shown in diagram below.

In this design the users are grouped and assigned to dedicated server. However, no exchange of
information and no load sharing take place between the SAS (SSN) servers.

4.1.1. Access

Terminal Server and Terminal Server Licensing are enabled and users will connect to the SAS (SSN)
using the RDP client over SSL. This will provide the ability to have more than one session to the SAS.
(SSN). Users will be authenticated using Active Directory and the strong authentication method described
in DES/PPS/HLD/0003 - HNG-X Active Directory High Level Design and DES/SEC/HLD/0001 - HNG-X
Strong Authentication High Level Design, respectively. Appropriate support roles will be configured using
AD groups and policies (ref. DES/SEC/HLD/0001, DESSECHLD0004.DOC).

System Requirement - T-RSD-3 (role based access)

System Requirement - T-RSD-9 (2 factor authentication should be used)

The Secure Shell (ssh) client will be installed on the SAS (SSN) and ssh server will be installed on the
operational platforms. This will provide a secure shell for support access.

OOH Support access will be provided using OOH laptops which will provide access during disaster
recovery periods. The OOH laptop design is described in

System Requirement - T-RSD-10 (OOH access)
System Requirement - T-RSD-13 (DR support)

FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Support workstations will access the SAS (SSN) using RDP and will also have the ability to access BRS
and the SSC server (RDP) directly. The SSC Support workstations will also be accessible from the OOH
laptop using RDP. System Requirement - T-RSD-15, T-RSD-22. This is detailed in the OOH laptop design

4.1.2 Audit

Although no active command logging or keystroke logging is done but we are keeping the record of people
logged on to SAS (SSN) server through double authentication and OS security policies for state servers.
Security policy is implemented to raise alert when any file is copied or deleted to SAS (SSN) server. Also
no user account is allowed to install any software on SAS (SSN). FTP folder will be maintained manually
by SSC team.

All components of the SAS (SSN) should comply with the manageability requirements.

System Requirement - T-RSD-29, T-RSD-30, T-RSD-34 (Applications should provide diagnostic or log
files - see manageability compliance guidelines - document ref TBC!)

4.1.3. Support and diagnostic tools
From the SAS (SSN) support users will be able to run the following support tools:

Tivoli tasks

Cygwin tools

Installed software clients
Web based clients
Windows 2003 support tools
RDP

4.2 Terminal Server

Terminal server is licensed as part of Windows 2003. License Manager is provided as part of the
installation of Terminal Server. Each client accessing through the Terminal Server requires a licence
(Terminal Service Client Access Licence - TS CAL) and the License Manager limits access to only
licensed users or devices. “Per Device” licensing will be used.

4.3. Administration Tools

4.3.1. Cygwin

Cygwin is free software that provides a Unix-like environment and software tool set to users of any
modern version of MS-Windows for x86 CPUs (95/98/NT/2000/ME/XP). Cygwin consists of a Unix system
call emulation library, cygwin1.dll, together with a vast set of GNU and other free software applications
organized into a large number of optional packages. Among these packages are high-quality compilers
and other software development tools, a complete X11 development toolkit, GNU emacs, TeX and LaTex,
OpenSSH (client and server). For HNG-X we will be installing minimum set of packages to use OpenSSH
client and server. Cygwin is used for connecting to servers at both datacenters and to counter machines.

Cygwin has three different authentication methods, for HNG-X it is planned to use public/private key for
authentication

4.3.2 I OpenSSH Client

Open Secure Shell (OpenSSH) is a free implementation of the SSH connectivity tools, developed by the
OpenBSD project.

OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including passwords) to eliminate security vulnerabilities and provides
secure tunnelling capabilities.

To establish an SSH session an SSH client is required on the SAS (SSN) and the SSH server service or
daemon on the target system. The Quest OpenSSH client (Quest-PuTTY-0.60_q1.129) will be used to
connect from the SAS (SSN) to the ssh server.

This is detailed in the HLD for OpenSSH/sudosh connectivity. Boéliment ref TBC.
System Requirement - T-RSD-1

4.3.3. BSEC

For establishing the true identity of the admin/support users authorised to access HNG-X platforms, at any
SAS (SSN) Servers for the HNG-X project, BSEC software is installed on all SAS (SSN) servers. For
details refer to DES/SEC/HLD/0001.

4.3.4 Secure File Transfer

The COTS selected to provide SFTP to SSC is JScape. It will be installed on SSC server. For end to end
file transfers all files will be transferred to SSC server and from there they will be pulled either to SSC
workstation or to SAS (SSN) using WSFTP client.

JSCAPE software is installed on SSC server, from SSC workstation files will be transferred to SSC server.
Then user logged on to campus server via RDP / SSH session from SAS (SSN) will download files to
campus server from SSC server. Similarly files will be pushed to SSC server from campus server and
then using WSFTP client they will be downloaded to SSC workstation.

4.3.4.1. FTP Client

FTP client WSFTP will be installed to provide the FTP facility on SAS (SSN) server. The house keeping of
FTP folder will be responsibility of SSC team.

4.3.5 Web Clients

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 sp2 will provide connection for web based clients. This access will not be
audited on the SAS (SSN) and access should be restricted, secure and auditable on the target server.
Web clients should use https and certificates will be provided by the Certificate Authority described in
DES/SEC/HLD/0003 - HNG-X KEY MANAGEMENT HIGH LEVEL DESIGN. For details please refer to
DES/SEC/HLD/0003

7 Manageability

The SAS (SSN) can be managed remotely using Terminal Server and access through the BladeFrame
console.

Systems Management tool — Tivoli will provide remote control access to this server.

Critical Windows OS services should be monitored and alerted on. General performance alerting should
be carried out. Provisioning of SAS (SSN), patching and software distribution will be provided by Tivoli
Provisioning Manager (TPM).

Refer to DESSYMHLD0004.doc for more details.

8 System Qualities

8.1 Security

The security of the SAS (SSN) and the supported platforms it is used to access will be ensured by the
features described in the following sub sections.

8.1.1 Role based access and Controlled Tasks

Support users roles will be defined in AD and in the Tivoli Management Framework. This will ensure that
only selected users will have permission to carry out potentially hazardous tasks on target platforms.
Tasks identified by SSC as repeatable and low risk will be passed to 2™ line support after development
and testing.

8.1.2 Encrypted Communication
Refer to the OpenSSH, Cygwin, Sudosh high level design — document reference to!

8.1.3. Strong Authentication

See high level design for Strong Authentication - DES/SEC/HLD/0001. This provides Windows 2003
natively supported 2 factor authentication using USB tokens.

8.1.4 Windows Operating System

The Windows 2003 platform poa_bastian.xml security policy is applied. This is part of the platform
foundation build and supplied in the windows distribution. Security patches relevant at the date of first
build will be applied to the platform and these will be documented. All other patching will be subject to the
patching and upgrade policies and processes.

RDP traffic from the remote support workstations and laptops to the SAS (SSN) will be encrypted using
128 bit SSL. See DES/SEC/HLD/0003 - HNG-X KEY MANAGEMENT HIGH LEVEL DESIGN for details
of the Certificate server that would be required for this.

8.2 Availability

The platform will provide resilience and repair described in the Windows 2003 platform design. For the
blade hosted SAS (SSN) in IRE11 and IRE19.

For HNG-x it is planned to have 3 SAS (SSN) in each Data Centre.

8.3 Performance

See the Windows 2003 Platform design for details of how this platform meets performance requirements.
In summary the base build has improved performance by increased page file size on a dedicated disk and
optimised disk partition configuration.

To ensure adequate terminal server performance all third party products should be supported under the
terminal server environment. Where suppliers do not specifically state support under terminal services,
these products should be adequately tested to ensure they do not adversely affect the performance of the
server.

8.4 Usability

The service has been designed on Microsoft Terminal Server. Although this provides a GUI for interactive
use, the system will not be used interactively except for SAS (SSN) platform set up and maintenance.
Users from SSC, SMG and ISD, will log on through the Terminal Server Client on the local Support
Workstation, and be given access through ssh, client software and through the Terminal Server profile to
the target system, applications or files.

8.5 Potential for Change

The focus of ssh session logging may be moved from the client to the ssh server service removing the
need for the command logger on the SAS (SSN). Sudosh may be used to log ssh session content to the
syslog file which would then be picked up by the audit solution.

Additional support tools and clients may be installed on the SAS (SSN) in future. These clients must
ensure that they have adequate, secure auditing or that application auditing takes place at the application
server.

Additional SAS (SSN) can be added if additional support users or support groups require access to the
HNG-X infrastructure.

12 Risks and Assumptions
The following risks and assumptions have been identified with the SAS (SSN) design for HNG-X:
Risks:
« Delays due to licences for TS CALs will limit access.
« ssh command auditing solution not developed in time.
e Security not tight enough enabling changes to be made to the SAS (SSN)
Assumptions:

« Assumed that there will be a level of auditing on supported DC servers accessed using specific
clients.

« Assumed that development will take place with the installed version of cygwin. If a later version is
released prior to development the version of cygwin used for INF-2 will be replaced.

« Support skills are available to support the open source code that is compiled and release as part of
this design.
