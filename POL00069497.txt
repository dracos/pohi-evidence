Telephone conversation with Ruth Simpson re amendments she wants to make to her
witness statement.

Basically she wants to amend para 7C to correct the date of the cash account to 7 April. She
also told me that she could tell from the cash accounts that the morning the screen went
blank was Wednesday 31 March 2004 because she didn’t print out the cash account until
later that day as a consequence. Therefore she asked me to make consequential
amendments to para 9C of the statement.
