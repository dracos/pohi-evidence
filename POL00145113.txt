Hi

Yes agree re being consistent and if we start to drop our lines on confidence this could get picked up. We did
recently amend to reflect that we have confidence that Horizon has not been the cause of any of the court cases
raised by MPs, rather than using a more generic line.

I think we do need to remain consistent with what we have previously said

Suggested changes:

A Post Office spokesperson said: “In order to complete a thorough investigation and ensure our
subpostmasters have confidence in the Horizon computer system we agreed to, and fully support, this
external review to examine the small number of individual cases raised by a number of MPs.

The timings are a matter for the external reviewer. But we hope the investigation can be completed as
soon as possible.

Do we need this!

We have absolute confidence that Horizon has not been the cause of any of the court cases raised by MPs and hope
that the investigation can be completed as soon as possible.”
