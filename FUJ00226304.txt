There are a few outstanding changes, but they won't change the scope or tone. Gareth is marking them up in red text.
He hopes to have the final draft ready by mid-morning.

Jeremy,

One of the main problems I have with it is that it does not appear to be the final version. What is going to be done with
all of the comments and red-lining?

Kind regards,

Amanda

Jeremy,

I'm not happy with this and want it to go through Legal. Please inform POL that there will be a delay.

Kind regards,

Amanda

Hi Amanda,
Here's a preview of the document, which Suzie has now been promised to Post Office for mid-morning tomorrow!

T hope you can take a look ASAP, and that you'll conclude that it's OK to release, with the addition of some suitable
commercial boilerplate text?

(Latoya - Your review is also welcome, but it might be worth comparing notes with Amanda as part of the review.)

Thanks in advance!
