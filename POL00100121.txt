Thanks Alwen - the parcels volume numbers are troubling but the margin opportunity shows the size of the prize if we get
it right. I'd suggest this is a major area of focus for 2014.

Dear All

There were questions on several topics at the Board meeting which the presenters thought would be helpful to provide answers to
sooner rather than later:

1. Business Transformation
The Alsbridge work will be completed by the 30th March

2. Parcels

Parcels volume v sales revenue and POL parcels income

All of the following are down versus last year, Parcels volume 9%, Parcels sales revenue 7% and POL Parcels income 9%. This
includes all consumer and small business parcels but excludes collections and returns both of which have grown versus last year.

The total UK parcels market is 1.2bn; POL currently has circa 230m of this total volume. Very roughly this means that an additional
1% share would be worth 10m items, based upon average income per parcel and assuming volume was spread across collections and
returns and consumer/small business parcels POL would earn an additional £6m.

3. MyAccount
My account - the plan is to have one overarching customer account which includes all product areas. This is key to the strategy as it
will help to enable cross-product holdings and minimise confusion for customers as only one password and a single sign in process

will be required.

4. Cost Reduction programme flow through and full year effect.

The Cost Reduction programme identified £3.0m of in year savings in FY 13/14 but c£2.2 m of these are short term tactical, and £0.8m.
of the in-year savings have an on-going impact. The FY 14/15 impact of these programmes is expected to be £5.3m and they are
included in the budget submissions within the £34m saving highlighted as coming from this programme in the budget paper. The
annualised impact of the activities is therefore £6.1m. This does not represent all savings made across the year, as some of these were
made earlier to meet budget stretches and have not been incorporated into the programme.

5, Rateable position for ATMs
The VOA's position remains unchanged; they consider our ATMs to be separately rateable.

A great deal of discussion has been held between Post Office and BIS including significant supporting evidence from Post Office
which resulted in independent legal opinion from BIS that our ATMs should not be separately rateable which has been communicated
to the VOA and is currently under consideration. The planned communication to branches from the VOA advising them their ATM
will be subject to separate taxation is on hold with no firm date until the legal challenges have been resolved.

The earliest any bills would be issued by VOA in relation to our ATMs would be in February, but no definite date has been given as
this depends on how long VOA takes to review latest information from BIS. If bills are issued then final resolution of the rates issue
will depend on the next steps we take to challenge e.g. if we go through a court case which could take another 6 to 12 months.

Below numbers show the financial impact to POL (from Crown ATMs) and sub postmasters - for historic and future charges.

6, 2nd Sight update
As reported to the Board late last year, we have been endeavouring to formalise SS's engagement by putting in place a formal

appointment letter, one of the terms of which will expressly restrict SS's ability to act against PO. For a variety of reasons (mainly
related to defining the scope of their work), this letter has proved very difficult to finalise, though good progress has been made in the

POL-0099704
POLO0100121
POL00100121

last few days. SS are, however, still (mildly) resisting the inclusion of a clause imposing any form of restriction on their ability to
undertake future related work. That said, we do expect that over the course of the forthcoming week (and ahead of the next face to
face meeting of the working group) all outstanding issues, including this one, will be resolved in our favour. In the meantime, the
provisions of the confidentiality agreement that was put in place at the start of their engagement continue to provide some, albeit
limited, protection in that they expressly prohibit SS divulging, without our consent, any confidential information obtained by
them as part of their work.

7. Engagement benchmarking
Our response rate was 34%. IPSOS Mori have said that typical B2B survey response rates are @ 20%.

Many thanks
