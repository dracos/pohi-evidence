Subject: IADG decision for OE & OE Note Counter PRJO046222
Attachments: image001.png

Hello Mel, Ciara,

Thank you for attending the IADG meeting the other day and sorry for the slow response but we are a bit thin on the
ground at the moment.

This email is formal notification of the decision regarding your submission for Operational Excellence (OE) &
Operational Excellence Note Counters (OENC).

OE was approved by IADG and OENC was approved subject to certain conditions being cleared. Those conditions have
all been cleared so both projects are now approved.

In discussions with Nikki James, subsequent to the meeting, it has been agreed that these projects be merged and all
funding (£3,350k CapEx £1,181k OpEx) now sits in PRJO0046222

Both SNow and Anaplan have been updated. Note if any forecast exists in Anaplan for Notes it will need consolidating
with OE.

Regards,

George Cross
