342.1 Purpose of this Document
This Project Initiation Document (PID) defines how the POL SAP Project will be
managed and identifies the changes that will be delivered into Post Office Limited
(POL). It is important to note that this is the internal Fujitsu Services PID and that
there is a separate joint POL/Fujitsu PID for the overall programme.

The PID aims to describe Fujitsu’s plans, strategies and processes that will define
the what, when, who, where, how, and why for the project.

The PID will be a living document subject to review and re-baseline, through
change control, as appropriate throughout the life of the project.

3.22.2__Existing Systems

POL operates two large SAP systems in separate data centres as separate
instances, plus several legacy systems in Cash Centres. The POL SAP Project will
provide a consolidated SAP environment to support POL’s business critical
processes.

The following summarises each of the systems targeted for consolidation:

1 SAPADS

+ ASAP 4.6c application

+ Implemented in 1997, hosted and supported by CSC

+ Supports Supply Chain functions (mainly the warehousing and movement of
cash through the Post Office network and to external customers)

+ Acustomised application (upgrades are complex, protracted and costly)

POLES

A SAP 4.7 IS Retail System

Implemented in 2004 (as part of the Impact Programme)
Hosted and supported by CSC and Fujitsu Services

Supports the financial settlement of transactions undertaken at the Post Office
counters and via direct sales channels.

(Formatted: Body Text )

(Formatted: Fort: Nae }

4:13.1_Scope

In June 2007 a Feasibility Study was undertaken by Cognizant that comprised of a
solution design and migration roadmap for the consolidation of the 6 applications
listed in section 2 of this document.

In line with the findings of the Cognizant Feasibility Study 2007 the following will be
delivered:

° Consolidation of SAPADS onto POLFS 4.7 IS Retail instance and UNIX / Oracle
infrastructure

+ Consolidation of Transtrack, CMS, BUDMAN and CASHMAN onto POLFS 4.7 IS
retail.

+ Removal or migration of customisation (z transactions) within the SAPADS
application and consolidation using standard SAP.

There are elements of existing systems that are not fully understood and, as such,
a business blueprint will be produced, which will detail and document the precise
scope of the project. This will require the approval of POL and agreement of any
changes in scope, e.g. where assumptions made during the proposal stage have
proved to be incorrect.

The project scope consists of the design, development, testing, and release of the
above and includes the delivery of supporting infrastructure as described in [ REF
_Ref221516981 \r \h J.

4.23.2 _Exclusions from Scope

+ Management of the SAP Portal which remains with CSC.

+ Hosting and supporting Internet Transaction Server (ITS).

+ Maintaining SAP Security, i.e. administration of users, their access rights, and
the access to POLSAP components.

+ Migration of legacy application master data (Transtrack, Bag Tracking, CMS
(Siebel), CASHMAN, BUDMAN) into the new POLSAP system; this is to be
undertaken by POL. See section [ REF _Ref223450560 \r \h ] for scope of
data migration.

Data cleansing of the information on the existing + Formatted: Bullets and Numbering j
systems will be undertaken by POL with support from the Fujitsu project
team; i.e. Fujitsu will test to ensure the cleansed data will migrate
successfully. See section [ REF _Ref223450816 \r \h ] for scope of data
cleansing.
+ Acceptance testing will be undertaken by POL with support from the Fujitsu
project team.
+ SAPADS IXOS and POLFS IXOS will be consolidated into a single archiving
platform. As POL has not yet specified the policy regarding miaration of
archived data transfer into POLSAP; this is not currently included in the

requiring approval by POL. On approval the agreed scope will be developed
and implemented in the new consolidated POLSAP Application.
The Business Blueprint document enabling a fixed price quotation for
completion of the remainder of the SAP Consolidation Project;
The consolidation of POL-FS and SAPADS systems will be merged onto an SAP
4.7 IS Retail on a LINUX/Oracle platform to become the POLSAP system;
+The 139 customisations (z programs) within the SAPADS system will be
replaced with standard SAP functionality where there is clear business benefit
for doing so or migrated to the SAP 4.7 Retail environment, where no standard
exists_or where user performance will be lost; (Formatted: Highlight )

The legacy applications (CMS (Siebel), CASHMAN, BUDMAN) will be replaced by
existing SAP functionality or bespoke z programs produced, where no standard
SAP functionality exists;

The POL-FS and SAPADS data will be migrated of into the new POLSAP system;
The existing interfaces to Transtrack and Bag Tracking will be moved from
SAPADS to POLSAP.

+ Configuration and development of the existing Hand Held Terminal
Functionality necessary to support the redevelopment of Transtrack and Bag
Tracking functionality into standard SAP transactions.

43233. Infrastructure
The infrastructure will all be completed with Phase 1 of the project.

As the SAPADS system is to be consolidated into the POL-FS system re-use of the
existing POL-FS infrastructure was considered as an option. However, this is
inadequate to support the new consolidated POLSAP system as the processing and
storage requirements are greater than the current system can support. As a result
the following new infrastructure will be put in place:

+ New pBlades installed into the existing POL-MI Bladeframe chassis in IRE11
Data Centre. Initially, these will be used for development and testing, but will
become the live system;

. New Bladeframe and pBlades installed into IRE19 Data Centre as the Disaster
Recovery failover system. Additionally, these pBlades can be used for future
development and testing should any modifications to the POLSAP system be
required;

+ An additional pBlade will be included in each Bladeframe to enable increased
resilience of the systems, i.e. should a live pBlade fail this will automatically
take ovel

+ Consolidation of applications onto POLF-S 4.7 IS Retail instance and LINUX /
Oracle infrastructure;

+ Modifications to networks, routing, switches, and firewalls to enable interfaces
to external system;

. Additional storage added to the existing data centre storage.

(Formatted: Body Text

\. (Formatted: Font: Italic

+ Due to the POL change freeze Phase 1 needs to complete by the 134%
September.

+ Not all bespoke "Z” programs can be replaced with standard SAP, in these
circumstances they will be migrated.

. POL requires all Fujitsu staff to successfully complete a CRB check.

+ The hand-held terminals development for Phase 2 must be conducted in a
“Clean room environment” to ensure that the intellectual property rights of
other parties are not infringed.

* Hardware must be delivered within the defined budget.

+ During the As-is To-be the Fujitsu team are to required to be located for the
majority of their time on POL sites.

+ Access to existing POL systems requires Fujitsu staff to have POL laptops
configured and connected to systems managed by POL/incumbent suppliers.

POL business representatives will be required to assist Fujitsu staff in
understanding the current functionality during the As-is To-be phase of the project.
This will require Fujitsu staff to be located for the majority of their time on POL
sites (mainly Chesterfield, but other sites may be visited depending on location of
POL staff).

This highly collaborative approach will minimise the risk of the solution failing to
address user requirements (particularly any that may not be explicitly stated in the

65_RISK AND ISSUE MANAGEMENT

Risks and issues will be managed through effective elicitation and capture, frequent
review, establishing of clear actions, deadlines and owners and early escalation
where appropriate.

It is proposed that RAID Review sessions (covering Risks, Assumptions, Issues and
Dependencies) are carried out periodically among Fujitsu and POL project teams to
ensure logs are “living” documents. The RAID and associated plans will be
reviewed regularly, with actions raised and monitored, to enable appropriate and
containment and to provide the Programme Project Review Board with appropriate
updates.

Issues will be presented to the relevant Review Boards

either in line with the meeting schedule or as
and when they arise, depending on urgency and impact.

Logistics and specific roles and responsibilities will be discussed and agreed by
Fujitsu and POL teams. A process based on the generic Fujitsu approach to
administering Risks is recommended for use on this project and is provided in the
diagram below:

and appropriate distribution of deliverables among staff;
+ Documents subject to configuration control include:
o PID;
0 Dependency and Assumptions CCD;
o Plans;
© Highlight Reports;
o All Solution Specifications (Requirements, Design, Test, Service etc.);
© And any other documentation deemed key to the success of the project.

+ The Fujitsu CL and Post Office equivalent shall agree how best to share
documents (separate shared drives, a joint shared drive hosted by Fujitsu,
hosted shared drive hosted by POL, email between two CLs etc.);

87_CHANGE MANAGEMENT

fAction-+POL-{Raj Sudhir}-te-confi 4
p z a
The Fujitsu standard process for managing change is illustrated at summary level in

the diagram below.

A Change Control board will be required to meet at a frequency that will be
determined by volume of proposed changes and the project stage (likely to require
more frequent reviews during peak development periods). This board will review
any proposed scope changes, significant plan revisions/deviations and off-
specifications.

A well-established Change Control process exists between POL and Fujitsu for the
processing of requests within the Horizon environment. This process or a derivative
thereof is envisaged for the ongoing management of change during the life of the
contract.

S-4L.1__Project Change Control Procedure

The Change Control Procedure is a crucial mechanism that can affect the success or
failure of this project. This process is the primary vehicle for containing scope and
ensuring that management has the opportunity to make timely trade-offs between
the three key project variables of cost, time and scope. It is imperative that
potential changes are identified early, documented carefully, and resolved at the
appropriate levels of responsibility.

Changes are broadly defined as work activities or work products not originally
planned for as defined by this PID. More specifically, changes will include:

+ Any deliverables not defined as “in scope” within this PID;

. Participation in activities not previously included in this PID’s list of work
products & activities (see section [ REF _Ref221522271 \r \h ]);

+ Provision or development of deliverables not included in this PID;

+ Achange in responsibilities, as defined in this PID between Fujitsu Services and

POL, including reallocation of project and customer staffing;

Any rework of completed activities or accepted deliverables;

Investigative work to determine the impact of major changes;

Assumptions not remaining valid;

Risks that actually occurred;

Delays (proposed or actual) to the agreed schedule slippage/advances

+ Variances of actual work effort from estimated effort.

In order to manage change properly, the agreed Change Control Process as per the
existing POL/Fujitsu agreement will be used to identify record, assess, and approve
changes to the project. Fujitsu Services and POL will follow this process to classify,
prioritize, approve, or reject changes. Change requests need to be clearly defined,
including cost, resource and schedule implications, to allow Fujitsu Services and
POL management to make appropriate decisions. Fujitsu Services will always need
prior authorization and approval of expenditures by POL before starting work on
changes.

Testing will be carried out in 2 key areas being Application Testing and
Infrastructure Testing.

948.1 Application Testing
Testing of the new POLSAP installation can be broken down into discreet areas for
the purposes of testing:
+ Integration-(interfaces)End to End Testing - interfaces;
+ Development proving:
o Unit Fransaction-Testing;
o End-to-End integrationSystem testing,

+ Application Processes:
o User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

+ Archive Testing.

POL has-expressed-2-preference-to-will carry out the User Acceptance testing of the
POLSAP application using their staff and test software. This will help to ensure that
POL retains a good understanding of the consolidated POLSAP system on
completion of the project.

The table below shows the areas of responsibility for each of the areas listed.

# Area Responsibility I Approach

1 I Integration-End I Fujitsu Fujitsu will ensure that all integration
to End Testing - points are tested and that all interfaces are
including working and connected to the appropriate
interfaces systems.
interfe

2 I Development I Fujitsu Throughout the SAP system development
proving (configuration) the Fujitsu Project Team

will be testing the business processes and
transactions.

Fujitsu will be developing the business
processes in conjunction with the POL
process experts/key users and will actively
involve these experts along with any POL
Testing/Training personnel in the
development proving. During this phase
Fujitsu will be conducting both Unit testing
and integration testing (including
interfaces). POL are expected to witness
sample areas of this testing to satisfy
themselves that it has been carried out.

# [Area Responsibility I Approach

3 I Application POL POL will be responsible for carrying out the
Processes (UAT) Application User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

Fujitsu will support the testing phase
during the project and assist in the
development of a testing plan in line with
the overall project plan. During this phase
the UAT and integration tests will be
carried out. Fujitsu will re-examine the
POLSAP sizing calculations and confirm
that the infrastructure will support the new
application.

44 I Archive Testing I Fujitsu Fujitsu’s approach to Archive testing will
focus on the key requirements from the
archiving processes. Initially, the retrieval
of previously archived documents will be
tested. This will be performed from the
SARA transaction and using any archive
info structures to access individually
archived documents from the existing
POLFS archived data and migrated SAPADS
archive data.

Once successful retrieval is confirmed,
archiving itself will be tested by performing
test runs in the Dev and QA environments
and confirming archive file storage.
Retrieval will then be tested again. Upon
completion of successful test runs a “live”
archiving run will be performed in QA.
Test runs will then be performed in
Production ensuring storage is successful
before re-enabling standard live archiving
jobs.

9.28.2 _Infrastructure Testing

The Infrastructure installation has been broken down into discreet areas for testing
purposes:

+ Hardware;

+ GonnectivityOperational Acceptance.

The table below shows the areas of responsibility for each of the areas listed.

409TRAINING

The training approach detailed below applies to both Phase 1 and 2.

The Fujitsu approach is based on effective knowledge transition to and training of
the POL personnel involved in the project.

10,19. Train the Trainer

Fujitsu will take a ‘Train the Trainer’ approach in each of the SAP functional areas

and deliver training to POL designated trainers (subject matter experts) on the

application usage. Once trained, these trainers will then conduct all training for

POL end users and future trainers, and POL will take responsibility of planning and

delivering this end user training.

POL will take responsibility for:

+ The Training plan;

+ Carrying out end user training;

+ Office facilities e.g. classrooms and training infrastructure to enable hands-on
training;

+ Developing all End User course material.

Fujitsu will take responsibility for:

+ Making available a suitable SAP system to support the end user training plan for
Phase 1 and Phase 2;
+ Documentation to support ‘Train the Trainer’ activities.

All of the completed deliverables identified in this PID will be formally submitted for
final review and approval. This section outlines the key components to this
acceptance process. Fujitsu Services and POL at the start of the project will
mutually agree to a more detailed acceptance procedure and specific acceptance
criteria. The key components are:

+ There will be only one person identified as the designated acceptor for each
deliverable;

+ The deliverables will include an acceptance form for signature;

+ Each deliverable will have clearly documented, objective acceptance criteria;

+ There will be a specified time-frame for acceptance/rejection of each
deliverable;

+ De ables will be deemed accepted if the review tim ‘ame is exceeded.

In order to avoid delays in the schedule and the associated increased cost due to
slow deliverable review, deliverables not reviewed and approved within the
specified review period will be considered accepted. /Sa/ie comment as eb0VE) (Formatted: Fight }
Feedback supplied after the review period will be evaluated as a change of scope.

The POLSAP application will undergo formal acceptance testing by POL. POL is
responsible for producing the acceptance test scripts and scenarios by 29th June
2003 to allow time for review and update prior to commencement of testing._This
date is provisional and is subject to confirmation at the Blueprint stage.

Details of specific deliverables and their timeline will be shown in the appropriate
Stage Plan.

To deliver the project it will be necessary to migrate data from existing legacy
systems (Cashman, Budman, CMS, Transtrack), SAPADS and POL-FS into the
POLSAP Rationalisation system._It is understood that this is a Fujitsu responsibility.

Prior to this data migration it will be necessary for POL to carry out data cleansing
‘so that only correct data is migrated. Of particular note is the large amount of
open-item historical data in POL-FS (circa 5 million transactions) which should be
cleansed and archived before migration.

In order to ensure success of the data migration it is recommended that POL

undertake the following:

+ Appoint a Data Migration manager to ensure the completion of data cleansing;

+ Close all open-items where possible in the SAPADS and POL-FS systems to
minimise the amount of data to be migrated during cutover;

POL will take responsibility for the accuracy and quality of the data supplied to
Fujitsu for migration. Fujitsu will define the quality criteria required to enable
successful migration. This will clarify the standards to enable POL to successfully
cleanse the data.

Historical transaction data (closed items) will not be migrated except the data held

for Flexible Planning._So that closed items are not lost, prior to migration the
archive routines will be executed to ensure that this data is archived.

Fujitsu will take responsibility for the migration of the following SAP data from
SAPADS and POL-FS:

Target Load
Data Type _I Description Sequence
Master Data _I Customer Master First Load
Vendor Master First Load
Material / Article Master First Load
Purchasing Info Records Second load

Manual entry of any master data that is needed to be migrated from legacy
systems (Cashman, Budman, CMS, Transtrack) will be carried out by POL personnel
with Fujitsu guidance.

At present the IXOS data archiving is excluded from the scope of data migration.
However, it is understood by Fujitsu that this is a fundamental part of the POLSAP
Project and cannot be completed without it. Therefore, it is recommended that an
Archiving Strategy is undertaken as part of the Blueprint Phase to define how
migration of archive data will be achieved.

Fujitsu will make use of the SAP LSMW (Legacy Systems Migration Workbench) for

data loads., In addition, POL areis looking into the use of Datanomics for data
Cleansing.

POLSAP General Ledger Accounts will be mapped to the existing General Ledger
accounts in POL-FS as part of the analysis phase and the migration requirements
and approach determined as part of the analysis. It has been confirmed that for
migration purposes transactions currently sitting on POL-FS will use the conversion
rate in POLF-FS and those sitting on SAPADS will use the conversion rate in
SAPADS. It is-assumed that any currency conversion rates would be derived from
POLFS-and- net SAPADS-

Once the design is complete the Service Readiness Review process will commence
coordinating all activities from the Project and the Stakeholders to ensure the new
service moves smoothly from development, through acceptance into Live Service.
The review will ensure that the project includes ‘non-technical’ tasks such as user
training, work instructions, user-community communication and business process
re-engineering.

Fujitsu will engage a service transition manager early in the project who will be
responsible for identifying the products and services required for transition to live
service. They will also be responsible for ensuring that the project delivers all the
required products and services to enable smooth and successful transition into
ongoing support. The primary tasks of the Service Transition Manager will be:

: Planning and management of the activities required for Service Introduction:
Service Descriptions, Operation Level Agreements and underpinning
contracts with 3rd parties;

Training of Core support teams and relevant 3rd parties to enable support of
the solution;,
Recruitment of the incremental staff identified as part of the proposal;,

> Business Continuity Planning;,
o Security Operations.,

+ Providing an assurance role that the solution meets the ongoing service costs
identified in the proposal, identifying discrepancies and escalating as
appropriate;

+ Working with the Applications & Infrastructure Project Managers to identify

what deliverables are needed by the support team,
Managing the Service Readin view process within the inti,

+ Chairing discussions on Service.>
