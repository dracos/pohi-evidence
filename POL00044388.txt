REGINA v JOSEPHINE HAMILTON
[SOUTH WARNBOROUGH)
WINCHESTER CROWN COURT
MENTIO! 19™ NOVEMBER 2007
CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0685

The Defendant appeared before the Court today. The prosecution was represented by
Mr Richard Jory of 9-12 Bell Yard, London, WC2A 2JR and the Defendant was
represented by Anita Saran.

The Defendant pleaded Guilty to the false accounting counts 2-15 on the Indictment.
The case has been adjourned to the 25" January 2008 for pre sentence reports.

The Defendant has been informed that full payment must be made prior to that date.
The theft count has remained on file on the understanding that it should be proceeded
with if the money is not repaid

It is believed that the Defendant has monies which will be available at the end of the
year. If the Defendant does not repay then consideration will need to be given to the
practicalities of proceeding with the charge of theft or whether confiscation proceedings
should pursue.

I note that the compensation outstanding is £36,644.89.

I note that the figure canvassed of £40,201.58 is a sum which includes interest, the
greatest sum will no doubt be pursued should confiscation proceedings be brought.

It has been made clear to the Defence that there must be some recognition that the
Defendant had the money short of theft and that a plea on the basis that the loss was
due to the computer not working properly will not be accepted.

As stated above the next hearing is on the 25" January 2008
