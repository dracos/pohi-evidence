and | do some work for the business from home. This normally involves buying

stock, pricing and preparing vouchers. | also care for my husband as he has
never fully recovered from a stroke he suffered in 2008.

In early 2021, | was diagnosed as suffering from Phobic Anxiety Disorder.

POST OFFICE HISTORY

We bought the New Mill Post Office in 2002 for £69,950.00. It was mine and
dream to run a Post Office so | was happy to support his decision to
make an offer on the local branch. We knew it would involve a lot of hard work,
but we wanted to invest in the business and set ourselves up financially for
retirement. We used all our savings and re-mortgaged our house to make up

the purchase price.

. | was employed by the Post Office as a Registered Assistant at the New Mill

Post Office. | would work in the evenings and weekends and would help
to close the shop, do cash collections and carry out small
administrative tasks.

On the 28" June 2008, | took over in the role of Sub-Postmistress at the New

Mill Post Office in Huddersfield. My husband ‘had been the Sub-
Postmaster at this branch since we purchased it in 2002; however, he suffered

a stroke in 2008 which is why | took over. At the time | was also working as an

Page 2 of 19
insurance claims manager. In this role | was responsible for, amongst other
things banking, time sheets and petty cash.

9. | was never officially appointed as the Sub-Postmistress. | had contacted our

Business Development Officer as | was struggling afte: 7
recall her coming round and | thought she was going to help me, but instead
she just gave me a box of chocolates and manager's access on the computer.
She said as we didn’t have a manager | needed to have access. She told me a
charter was going to be written on what to do if there were errors, but this never
materialised.

10. Following an audit on the 27" May 2010, | was suspended from the position of

Sub-postmistress.

CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AND ANY PROCEEDINGS/CONVICTION

41.Wher.. was Sub-Postmaster, he experienced several shortfalls. These
were normally small amounts so we simply made them up out of our own
money. | would withdraw the cash from our personal accounts through the ATM
at our shop. | would estimate that between 2002 and 2008, there was around
£1,000.00 in shortfalls.

12.We would try and look into the shortfalls, but it would take hours and the helpline
never really helped us resolve the issue. It was extremely stressful.

13.When | took over the branch. | experienced yet more shortfalls, which were
getting larger over time. It was all very confusing. To make matters worse, at

the time | took over, two local Post Offices were closed so their business was

redirected to us. | was absolutely run off my feet.

Page 3 of 19
14. By 2008 | was going to the paper shop at 5.30 in the morning to sort the papers,

| would then open the Post Office for 9.00am and work all day. | would close

between 5.00 — 5.30pm so that | could drive an hour to se in hospital.
| always had to ring to make sure | was okay to close the branch. Once | came
home from the hospital | would do my work for my claims manager role. | did
this for 19 weeks. | was exhausted.

15.1 tried calling the helpline numerous times about the shortfalls, but they were
not helpful. | was not told other people were experiencing the same issues so |
felt totally alone.

16.On balance nights, my employee and | were often there for hours trying to
balance the system. She would be on the phone to the helpline, but we never
got any help. Eventually, they made it so that the line closed at 5.00pm which
wasn’t helpful as we did not balance up until after this time. We then had to call
the next day, but the line could ring for half an hour and then get cut off. We
would have to wait 24 hours for someone to ring us back and then sometimes
it would need to go to the second or third line and it could be days before you
heard from them and by this time more problems had developed.

17.By March 2010, the shortfalls were amounting to £22,000.00. | was sinking
under the pressure of running the branch, holding down my job and caring for
my husband, but | felt as if | had no option but to carry on as | didn’t want to
lose the branch and our pensions.

18. On the 27 May 2010, the Post Office came in to take an audit due to concerns
about the amount of cash | was holding overnight. The local bus company would

deposit coins on a night. There was too much for me to count on an evening as

so | would do it the next day.

| had mixed feelings at the time of the audit; | knew | had been making minor
mistakes, but | just could not understand why the shortfalls were so significant.
| used to spend hours trying to work out where | had gone wrong, but eventually
| just gave up as | had so much going on. | knew if | declared the balance as
wrong | wouldn’t be able to open the next day so | would just declare the figure

it said.

. | remember feeling relieved when the auditors came as | couldn’t cope with the

amount of stress the shortfalls were causing me and | felt that someone was
finally going to help. However, | was also so worried about what all my family
would think about me. | felt | would be humiliated because | thought it was me
making all the mistakes.

When the auditors arrived, | panicked and told them | had to go to the doctors,
because | didn’t want to be there, | was so scared. | recall driving to Denby

Dale. | didn’t take a phone with me and | thought about ending my life. It was

only because | knew that needed me that | didn’t go through with it.

| realised that | had to face up to the matter and with the help of my daughter,
returned to the branch later that afternoon and confessed that | had been
making some minor mistakes. | advised the auditors that | was not taking the
money and that | would declare the balance even though | knew it wasn’t right
because otherwise | could not open the next day and there was no one to help
me on the helpline.

The auditors did not appear to be aware that the Sub-Postmaster had suffered
a stroke.

The final audit showed a shortfall of £48,850.05. The shortfall had doubled in

the space of two months.

Page 5 of 19
25.1 felt so guilty. | thought it was my fault that the mistakes were happening and
that | wasn’t capable of doing the job. | never considered that it was the
computer system that was at fault.

26. The day after the audit, on 28 May 2010, Helen Dickenson, a fraud investigator

..: at home. | remember her arriving and telling us

came to visit me and

that she was the “Post Office Police”. | had not told: GRO

nything about the

shortfalls, he was advised he could resign or face a disciplinary hearing.
27.He would not have coped with a hearing, at the time he couldn’t even read or
write. He therefore had no option but to resign.

28.A week later, | was interviewed by Helen Dickinson and Paul Whittaker from
the Post Office. Once the tapes had stopped, Helen advised me it could be one
of three options; my employee had taken the money; we had made lots of
mistakes or the Post Office had let us down. She said she would do everything
she could to dissuade the Post Office from pressing charges against me.

29.On the morning of my daughter’s wedding, 4'" September 2010, | received a
letter from the Post Office informing me that | was being charged with False
Accounting. | was advised by my solicitor to plead guilty and | did so on the
basis that it was made clear that | made no financial gain from the shortfalls.

30.On the 26" May 2011, | was sentenced to a 6 month probation order with 6

months of supervision.

THE HUMAN IMPACT

31.The human impact which the failings of the Horizon IT System have had and

continue to have upon me and my family are set out in the remainder of this

Page 6 of 19
statement. The section headings follow the particular questions posed by the

Inquiry.

WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING REQUIRED TO MAKE GOOD
APPARENT SHORTFALLS SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?
32.We were told that we needed to pay back the shortfall that had been found. We

had no option but to look to sell the branch as | could not risk losing our family

home as this had been adapted for ineeds following his stroke.

33.We had paid cash for the Post Office. We had worked hard all our life for this
money and it was our retirement fund.

34.We have purchased the business for just over £69,000.00. When it was valued
we were told it was worth £90,000.00 so we put it on the market for this price
the same week. We had an offer; however, when the buyer applied to the Post

Office, he was told it was going to become a Post Office Local and this meant

that the salary was reduced.

had been paid a salary of £34,000.00 per annum; however, this was
to be reduced to £13,500.00 per annum. The business had to be revalued and
decreased to £60,000.00. The buyer decreased his offer to around £30,000.00;
however, we were unable to accept this as this didn’t even discharge our debt
to the Post Office.

36.We put the business back on the market and received a further offer, but for
reasons | cannot recall he backed out.

37.We then had an offer from a cash buyer in the village for just under the value
and to me he seemed the perfect buyer. He had previously worked for the Post

Office as an auditor and knew our situation. He had all his bank accounts set

Page 7 of 19
up, he had completed his business plan and paid his deposit, but when he
applied to the Post Office they turned him down. It felt as if they did not want us
to find a buyer.

38.We spent two years trying to find a buyer. In the end someone approached us
to sublet a third of the building as a pharmacy. We spoke to the landlord and
this was agreed and all the correct contracts were arranged. We didn’t make
any profit from this.

39.The lease has recently been renewed on the building and due to a term in the
landlord’s insurance, the pharmacy has now been given its own lease rather
than subletting for us. This means we now only have a third of the building as
the post office was taken off us. It is therefore extremely difficult for us to sell
the one-third share and | think the only person we can sell to is the pharmacy.

40. There is also a clause in the lease that says that if the pharmacy decides to
revoke their license then we have to take the lease back. There is no option,
this will be enforced upon us.

41.Despite being unable to sell the business, the post office continued to chase
me for payment. They would hound me and | would receive threatening letters
from their solicitors. My daughter tried writing back to them to explain that | did
not have the money and to leave me alone as | was doing my best.

42.| remember at the point that | was really getting hounded. | saw something about
this happening to other people. | found a number for Alan Bates and | called
him. | remember coming off the phone knowing this was not just me and this
just grew and grew. | was put onto a firm of solicitors who had drafted a template
letter to send to the Post Office Solicitors to try and stop them from chasing the

payment.

Page 8 of 19
43.1 recall the letter saying that we were aware that the horizon system was under
investigation and that until this was complete they should not attempt to get
money out of me. We sent the letter to them and received a response saying

that they would put the matter on hold.

44. It was such a stressful time dealing with all of this, and as [ was poorly

| did not have any support from him as he was not able to give me it. | was also
caring for him.

_} was not able to go back to work, because of his stroke and the Post

Office was taken off us immediately and new agency staff were put in there the
following day.
46.Because we were unable to sell the business, | had to keep the paper shop

going; however, the majority of the time | would hide in the back in the

stockroom. People used to think it was because of: “Istroke and | would
let them. | never told anyone what happened to me.

47.Money was tight and | ended up selling things including my mother’s jewellery
and father’s war medals. My brother doesn’t know this and | feel so guilty. |
worry he will ask me for them and | will have to tell him.

48. My brother, who was in his mid 60’s at the time, went back to work at a funeral
parlour in order to help us out. He opened a bank account and gave me the
card and all of his wages went into this account. He retired again when my

conviction was overturned aged 73.

parents who were in their late 80’s would also help us out. They

would go without things so that they could help us.
50. Because we only had 1/3 of the business and | was struggling to work we had

to employ more staff and this meant we were paying out more in wages.

WHAT WERE THE COSTS OF MAKING GOOD ALLEGED SHORTFALLS SHOWN

BY HORIZON?

51.

52.

HOW

| paid back the smaller shortfalls with money from our own business account as
mentioned above.
As detailed above, | would estimate that between 2002 and 2008, there was

around £1,000.00 in shortfalls.

WERE YOU AFFECTED WHEN ALLEGED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

SHORTFALLS OR DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?

| was out of my mind with worry over the investigation. At the time {_
could barely do anything for himself; | had to dress him and feed him and help

him to the toilet.

.| felt that | had let everyone down. | have strong values and | felt that | hadn’t

kept to these. There were times where | felt that | couldn’t go home, but | knew

| had to because “ineeded me.

| felt so guilty because | thought it was me making the mistakes. | have always
worked in a financial role. | have worked for a building society and then as a
claims manager, but these roles were all on paper. | thought it was me making
a mistake with the computer system.

| also felt very let down by the Post Office. | had received no support from them;
however, the previous year when we had suffered a break in and some

cigarettes were stolen they had provided us with support even though the break

in was to the shop and not the post office.

SHORTFALLS AND DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?

need to resign or he would be suspended with immediate effect with a
disciplinary hearing to take place. We also lost the Post Office with immediate
effect.

58. Luckily we had previously taken out income protection and mortgage protection

and this had all come into effect whe suffered his stroke. This meant

there was no mortgage on our family home and we have continued to receive

WHAT WERE YOUR FINANCIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST
YOU IN RELIANCE UPON HORIZON DATA?
59.As explained above, we tried to sell the business but in the end we couldn't, so

we had to keep the paper shop open.

result of his stroke.

61.As detailed above, my brother went back to work and gave all of his wages to
us so we could get by.

62. During my prosecution, | couldn’t get funding support for a solicitor as | had to
provide details of my income for the previous years and this had been good.
My brother therefore lent me the money for a solicitor. | think it cost him about

£5,000.00.

WHAT EFFECT DID IT HAVE TO BE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING CRIMINAL
OFFENCES AS A RESULT OF SHORTFALLS AND DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY
THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?
63.When | received the letter informing me | had been charged with False
Accounting, | was utterly devastated. | felt like my whole life had been turned
upside down and that | had ruined my daughter's wedding day. | considered
taking my own life. Without a doubt, this was the worst day of my life.
64.We were just about to leave for the wedding when the postman knocked on the
door with a recorded delivery letter. | put it to one side, but my daughter
encouraged me to open it as | needed to face what was happening.

65.My daughter wanted to cancel the wedding, but they had spent two years

arranging it around |

improvement

had made within two years of his stroke would be how

he would stay. It was also too late in the day to call the wedding off.

66.1 remember not wanting to be there and | did not enjoy the day at all. | took my
glasses off because | thought that if | couldn’t see anyone then they couldn’t
see me.

67.| barely spoke to anyone and | wasn’t in any of the photographs. We live in a

small cul-de-sac and because of the support | received after’,
all of our neighbours were invited to the wedding. | have recently found out that
they all thought that | didn’t approve of the wedding and this is why | didn’t speak
to anyone. This really upset me as it was not the case, | thought he was a lovely

lad.

Page 12 of 19
68.1 couldn’t even bring myself to look at the wedding photographs as they just
reminded me so much about what had happened. | wouldn't even have a picture
up in the house. It wasn’t until three months ago that this changed and |

managed to put two photographs up.

69.When all this is over, the plan is for! andi.¢ Ito do a vow renewal so

that | am able to enjoy the day.

70.1 was also very concerned about what Hfamily would think of me. | didn’t
want them to think | was a criminal.

71.In the valley that | live in, everyone knows everyone. | have never discussed
what we have been through with anyone. | feel embarrassed about it and did

not want people gossiping or feeling sorry for me.

WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL
OFFENCE AS A RESULT OF SHORTFALLS AND DISCREPANCIES SHOWN BY

THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM?

72.\ can still remember going to court which was an awful experience.:
my brother came and they sat in the gallery in their suits. Helen Dickinson was
also there and told me that | shouldn’t have been brought to court. | just did not

know what was going to happen to me and | was so worried about what would

happen to!_.GRO__: as | was still having to help him dress and wash and go to

the toilet. My daughter had also just found out that she was expecting a baby.
73.| remember standing there with the man next to me ready to take me down the

steps and | just thought, | might be going down there.

Page 13 of 19
74. My solicitor advised me that | should plead guilty to false accounting to try and
avoid a prison sentence. | agreed to do so on the basis that it was stated that |
had not received any financial or material gain.

75.1 hadn’t taken a penny and would have done anything to have proved my
innocence. | even asked if | could undergo a lie detector.

76.The Judge asked the Post Office representatives how much was missing and
not one of them knew. He said it was a sad situation as because | had pleaded
guilty he had no option but to sentence me even though he didn’t believe | had
done anything wrong. He therefore gave me the minimum sentence he could.

77.1 felt so humiliated going to the probation meetings. The first time | went,

came with me to support me but he was told that he was not allowed
in. There were people in there with tins of cider and | was just on my own. | felt
so frightened. | went through to another room with a lady and she said the only
thing | was guilty of was not shouting louder. | feel guilty of this to this day, but
| did try to shout and no one was listening.

78.The probation office was on the ring road on the corner that went round to the
retail park. | parked up and sat and watched the traffic lights so | could work out
the sequence so | could get in without people seeing me. | worked out | had
about 30 seconds to ring the bell and get in.

79.|In the end the probation officers allowed me to park in the back car park and
enter and leave by the back door.

80.1 had never even had a speeding or parking ticket before this conviction.

81. Following my conviction | stopped working in the shop and started to hide away.
| was so worried about what would be in the papers and kept thinking | would

be in the shop selling a paper with my photograph on the front of it.

Page 14 of 19
82.1 didn’t look for other employment because | felt that no one would employ me

with a criminal record.

WHAT EFFECT DID THESE ISSUES HAVE UPON YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES AND LOCAL COMMUNITY?
83.| stopped going out. | couldn’t go to any of the local shops and | wouldn’t even
put the bins out unless it was dark for fear of people seeing me. | would either
do it late at night or | would get up at 4/5am to put them out. | didn’t want to
bump into people as | didn’t know what had been said or what to say to them.
84. After my conviction was overturned, it was reported in the Yorkshire Post and
even then | feared that people would believe that | was guilty. My family have
been amazing at supporting me and have never once thought | had done
anything wrong. | have also found the support of my legal team has really
helped me.

85. Before my conviction was overturned | did feel that | had no support and it was

just me and GRO ecause | was not able to let anyone else in and tell them

what had happened because | was so embarrassed. | also wanted to protect

my family so it was easier to let people believe it was all because of -GRO q

stroke. | didn’t want my children hearing people talking about their mum.

jand sometimes the doctor would

ask me how | was. Sometimes | would say | was okay and other days | would

cry because it was all getting to me, but | could never tell them what went on.

double life. | couldn’t tell people the truth so | was forced into lying. | brought

Page 15 of 19
my children up to always be honest and it felt as though | was breaking my own
rule in not telling people what had really happened.

87.We lost almost all of our friends. We did tell one friend about what happened,

1 GRO |who lives just down the road from us because | have always felt you

need just one person and | could be truthful with her. At one point | was so low

that | melted down. _itablets into a cup for me to take. | just felt as
though | couldn’t cope, there were bills coming through the door which we were
struggling to pay, | was being chased for money and it was all over the media
that the horizon system was robust. Our friend happened to come by and saw

what | was doing. She saved me that day.

| would use our cars to run the elderly to and from church if there was a funeral
on; however, | stopped doing this after my conviction.
89.| have always been very generous, buying gifts every Christmas for the local

hospital and | used to be the trustee of a local social club before

born. Whilst doing this | helped organise sponsoring guide dogs. | have always
dealt with money. | just can’t believe that the Post Office has done this to me.

90.Since the conviction was overturned | have made progress in going out. |
started to try and go back to the shop. Initially when | tried to approach it, |
would start to feel sick and would shake so | would turn around and come back
home. Gradually | managed to get to the stage where | could park in the car
park. | then made it to the front door and in the last couple of weeks | have
managed to go behind the counter and serve some customers.

91.1 am still unable to go in any of the local shops. To help me get out more, my

daughter and son-in-law re-mortgaged their house and purchased a caravan in

Page 16 of 19
Skipsea which we go to every weekend as a family. It has really helped me and
| really enjoy going here; no one knows who | am so | feel that | am able to go

out and go in all the shops. We are also able to go out for tea there which | don’t

feel | can do at home. We have even been out to see: | which is
something | never thought | would do. We have been going here since
May/June 2021 and | feel like a different person. It’s like everything lifts from
me and | feel amazing. We don’t talk about what has happened whilst we are
there.

92.My Daughter and Son-in-Law have recently told my neighbours, on the other

side of my house of the house to them, about what has happened to me and

they have been fine about it.

93.1 have also recently spoken to. GRO | the person who runs the Post Office
in my shop about what happened to me. He advised that he used to be an
auditor for the Post Office and said that it was dreadful what had happened. He
said they could see what was happening, but were told to keep their mouths

shut or they would lose their jobs. This wasn’t nice to hear.

PLEASE DESCRIBE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECT WHICH THESE
ISSUES HAD UPON THE MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY?

94.My daughter has been impacted by what has happened. She became a very

angry person and her mood would change at the flick of a switch for no reason.

We wouldn't know what we had done wrong. She hid from me how bad things

were because she knew we had enough to cope with, but she would suffer from

paranoia and panic attacks and she wasn’t sleeping.

Page 17 of 19
95.One day she was driving home from work when she was getting palpitations
and thought she was having a heart attack so took herself to hospital. She was
having a panic attack.

96.She attended a psychiatrist for this and has got better, but it has still impacted
on her life. She worked at the local GP and this was another reason why | could
not tell them about my conviction as | did not want to hinder her. She was initially
a receptionist before becoming a secretary, and eventually assistant practice

manager. They eventually asked her to become the Practice Manager, but due

to supporting me and she felt unable to take on the job and therefore
in the best interests of the GP she resigned and returned to her previous

employers where she remains today.

97.My son was still in school when suffered a stroke; however, he felt as
though he needed to become the man of the house and saved up his pocket
money to buy himself a tool kit to help around the house. He would come with
me to open and lock up the shop and help with any carrying or lifting. When he
finished school he took over running the shop and continues to do this.

98.He is also involved in volunteering for a charity called “you can shine” which
helps school children with their confidence and he is a football coach. He
wanted to do something like this professionally, but it meant that he would need

to go to college and he did not feel he could do this and so had to give up on

this dream.
