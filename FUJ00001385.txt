INTRODUCTION

PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is to describe how the LFS Service Introduction
process is to be carried out.

INTRODUCTION

LFS provides an interface with SAPADS for the purpose of the central control of
cash and stock. To achieve the full benefit of the service, all Horizon outlets must be
operating LFS and their parent cash and stock Distribution Centres must have
automatic replenishment enabled.

The LFS service introduction process must take into account both the Pathway plan
(document [5]) and the migration plan for the Distribution Centres (document [4]).

APPROACH TO MIGRATION

Horizon CSR+ Outlet Migration

Outlets will commence operation of the LFS functionality immediately Horizon
CSR+ is implemented.

There are two outlet migration paths to CSR+ and therefore to LFS:
1. From CSR outlet to CSR+ outlet (*backfill’ office);
2. From manual outlet to CSR+ outlet (‘new’ office)

Horizon CSR+ outlet migration will be controlled by the Pathway plan (document
[5]) and by a spreadsheet shared between Horizon Release Management and ICL
Pathway Customer Services.

Distribution Centre Outlet Migration

When the Distribution Centre migration process is complete and the Automated
Distribution Centre is fully automated, the cash and stock in each outlet will be
automatically replenished. Cash and stock distribution will be handled by separate
Distribution Centres. Each outlet will receive cash from a regional ADC and stock
from the national ADC at Hemel Hempstead.

Distribution Centre outlet migration is a two stage process for both cash and stock:
1. From Distribution Centre (DC) to ADC;
2. From ADC to ADC with automatic replenishment enabled.

Distribution Centre outlet migration will be controlled by the SAPADS plan.
(document [4]).

0.1. Horizon CSR+ Migration and Distribution Centre Migration.

The Distribution Centre outlet migration plan is independent of the CSR+ outlet
migration plan. The LFS Service Introduction process must therefore allow for:

(a) The different states in which an outlet and its parent cash and stock
Distribution Centres may exist;

(b) The migration paths between those states.
The following matrix identifies the different combinations of Distribution Centre and

outlet states which may exist and the migration paths between those states which are
relevant to LFS:

Notes:

(a) A tick identifies a possible state and an arrow identifies a migration path.

(b) The above matrix applies to both cash and stock distribution.

(c) Automatic replenishment can only be implemented for an LFS enabled outlet.

(d) The introduction of automatic replenishment for stock is not planned until after
the planned CSR+ completion date.

SERVICE INTRODUCTION PROCESS

LFS Functionality

The functionality described in the LFS interface Specification (document [1]) will
operate immediately an outlet is upgraded to CSR+, irrespective of the status of the
cash and stock Distribution Centres which support the outlet.

SAPADS will utilise the information supplied by LFS after CSR+ is implemented in
an outlet to assess and define the outlet replenishment requirements. NB This is an
essential pre-requisite for implementation of automatic replenishment.

During the CSR+ pilot SAPADS will supply standard cash planned orders to support
each of the pilot offices. No stock planned orders will be supplied.

Subsequent to the CSR+ pilot and before the Distribution Centre migration to
automatic stock replenishment, SAPADS will supply cash planned orders only for all
outlets. No stock planned orders will be supplied. Indicative volumes for cash
planned orders are supplied in the AIS (document[1]).

On completion of the migration to automatic stock replenishment, cash and stock
planned orders will be supplied. Indicative volumes for cash and stock planned
orders are supplied in the AIS (document [1]).

During the pilot, SAPADS will supply an advice notice file every day.

Subsequent to the pilot, SAPADS will send advice notes when necessary. Note that
this does not guarantee that an advice note file will be sent every night.

Rejections will occur as stated in the AIS for both planned order and advice notice
files. Subsequent to the CSR+ pilot, therefore, rejections will be caused by the
supply of planned orders for outlets which are not automated with either CSR or
CSR+.

Post Office Cash Handling and Distribution (CHD) will notify the outlet of changes
in the arrangements for the supply of cash planned orders, stock planned orders and
advice notices supporting the outlet.

EPOSS Functionality

The functionality described in the LFS Function Description (document [2]) will be
available for operation immediately an outlet is upgraded to CSR+.

The following remittance buttons will be barred from the CSR+ screens as they are

unnecessary to the operation of CSR+ and their use for inventory products would
result in incomplete LFS information being supplied to SAPADS:

Fl - In Supply Division;

FS - Out Supply Division;
F2 - In Other Post Offices;
F6 - Out Other Post Offices.

The F1, F5, F2 and F6 barred remittance buttons will be removed when there are no
remaining CSR outlets. The removal of the buttons will be implemented via an OBC
request initiated by BSM OSG.

The following remittance buttons will also be barred from the CSR+ screens:

F9 - In SSO/ DoF NI
F130 - Out SSO/DoF NI

The F9 and F13 barred remittance buttons will be removed when the centralisation of
stock project is complete. This will take place before the end of the CSR+ pilot. The
removal of the buttons will be implemented via an OBC request initiated by BSM
OSG.

Once the buttons defined in 3.2.3 and 3.2.5 are no longer required, and probably at
the same time as the later of these two actions [i.e. 3.2.3], the opportunity will be
taken to re-organise the Remittances screen. This change will be implemented via an
OBC request initiated by BSM OSG.

The barring of remittance buttons on the CSR+ screens removes buttons which are
needed by offices for which centralisation of stock is not complete. The
centralisation of stock project is scheduled to complete after the CSR+ pilot
commences, but before any further outlets upgrade to CSR+. Horizon Release
Management and ICL Pathway Customer Services will liaise to ensure that no outlets
for which the centralisation of stock project is not complete will be migrated to
CSR+, either during the pilot or subsequent to it.

Procedures

The procedures supporting LFS described in the Horizon System User Guide
(document [3]) will be operated immediately CSR+ is implemented.

The User Guide procedures take into account the fact that outlets will be supported
by different types of cash or stock Distribution Centres.

Post Office Cash Handling and Distribution (CHD) will notify the outlet of changes
in the status of the cash or stock Distribution Centre supporting the outlet.

Training

For ‘backfill’ outlets which are migrated from CSR to CSR+, LFS training will be
delivered in the form of a workbook provided in advance of the CSR+
implementation.

For ‘new’ outlets which are migrated from manual operation to CSR+, LFS training

will be delivered by a combination of course and workbook provided in advance of
the CSR+ implementation.

Materials

CHD will ensure that all outlets are provided with barcoded collection pouches
before CSR+ is implemented in the outlet.

Third Party Notification

CHD will ensure that all third parties responsible for the delivery/collection of cash
and stock to/from outlets are notified of the CSR+ pouch handover process.
