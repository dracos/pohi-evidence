Rod

As discussed, here is a draft email to go to Fujitsu setting out the CCRC’s queries on the KEL.

I don’t know when is the appropriate time to send it given the ongoing discussions with FJ of ways of working — please
can you let me know when it has gone to FJ or, alternatively, if and when you want me to send it.

My previous correspondence with FJ on this point has been with Pete Newsome.

Many thanks

Paul

Dear Pete

Following on from the helpful information you provided previously on the KEL, the CCRC have asked some follow-up
questions which I have set out below.

¢ How far back does the available KEL go?

¢ How easy is it to search? For example, is it searchable by branch, by area or by date
parameters?

¢ Is it searchable by issue? We have already explained to the CCRC that most of the
entries are not connected to branch accounting. Is it possible to say how many entries
are related to branch accounting?

¢ What is the retention policy that’s applied to the KEL?

Would you be able to provide answers to these questions please? Thanks again for all your help on this.
