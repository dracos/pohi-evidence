Training | received Page 1 of 6

3. | initially received training on Horizon in a classroom setting,
however, | cannot remember for how long or where it was held. When
Horizon went live in Branch there was experienced trainers with us, but

| do not remember for how long they were with us.

4. As a Field Support Advisor | was buddied up with an experienced
team member and worked with her for 6 months until | was comfortable
to go.out on: my own. My knowledge about the training side was gained
from working in branch and performing back-office duties. My buddy
trained me in all aspects of the role that | did not have experience with

such as balancing the Lottery and ATM's and in performing audits.

5. | received ongoing training within the Field Team and always had the
support of my manager(s). | attended all available training sessions and

team meetings to keep up to date with any changes/new products.

My role in relation to training.

6. Whilst at Aldershot CDO | would assist new Sub Postmasters with
balancing as and when required. This was before Horizon and was
termed as ‘follow up balancing’ and was after their on-site training and
was usually for one or two balances after their trainer had left. If they
needed more help it was referred to the Area Manager for further
support. My knowledge of balancing was from working.on the Crown

Office counter and performing Cash Account duties which involved

balancing the whole branch accounts.

7. | became a trainer in 1989 before Horizon was introduced working
directly with Sub Postmasters in their branches. | would train them in all
aspects of the role and how to balance their branch. This often meant
Jate nights as | would not leave until the balance was completed. | would
give Sub Postmasters my home phone number should they ever need

my help. They also had support from the Area Managers Office.

8. | joined the Field Support Team in 2012. | was buddied up with an
experienced Field Support Advisor and worked with her for 6 months
until | was comfortable to go out on my own. My knowledge about the
training side was gained from working in branch and performing back
office duties. My buddy trained me in all aspects of the role that | did not
have experience with such as balancing the Lottery and ATM's and in
performing audits. | performed classroom training to both Sub-
Postmasters, their staff and Crown Staff and on-site training to Sub
Postmasters. If | felt more support was needed onsite, | would raise it
with my manager. | always left my phone number with Sub Postmasters

so they could contact me if they had any issues with balancing.

9. When training | would ensure that my trainees understood the

balancing procedure and how to check and investigate any

discrepancies. | would not leave a branch until the balance was

complete.

10.After poor feedback from a trainee in a classroom, | was shadowing
a colleague, | felt | needed to change the way the training was
delivered. | covered the aspects as laid out but spent more time in
teaching the candidates how to serve a customer, whilst increasing the
knowledge in the services and to balance their tills every day. Also, how
to search for any discrepancies by using the different means available,

such as transaction logs.

11. | was aware of reported historic issues with that some Sub
Postmaster had with Horizon, but | never came across any whilst using

the system.

12.The training delivered was adequate for some who were trained to
use it and not so for others who found it challenging. There was support
for people who struggled, such as the Field Teams, who could revisit

them and the Network Business Support Centre.
