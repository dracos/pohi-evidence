Dear Angela

I hope you are well.

Last week I was requested by Paula and by Alasdair Marnoch (Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee) to provide
independent assurance over the activity you are leading to improve the culture and change process in light of the
draft Second Sight report. Alice has also asked to see me this week to outline her considerations and her viewpoint. I
have spoken with Susan and I have a copy of the high level plan via Simon Baker. Paula has also outlined her views on
scope. At this point that is all I have.

Alasdair has asked me to conduct initial planning to create an audit terms of reference for his review and approval.
Once I have seen Alice, this coming Wednesday, I need to touch base with you but I appreciate you are on vacation
this week. I am in the office until August 16" so I need to see you in good time beforehand so that Alasdair has a draft
Terms of Reference from me by that time.

I will find a point in our diaries in the meantime.

Regards

Malcolm
