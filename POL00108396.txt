Don't know how you want to play this but it links to our conversation about who should agree and sign the engagement
letter. We also need to consider how and when we put Deloitte in touch with FJ and the extent to which we should
involve them in agreeing the scope. All of which should, in my view, fall to Lesley to lead.

Rod is not around next week but could do a call after 89m on Monday. His involvement is almost exclusively linked to
the purpose of this advice - to defend against legal challenge. He has emailed the lawyer in FJ by way of introduction to
me so I can make the right intro with Deloitte (hope that makes sense) when we are good to go but I want to square off
the ‘handling’ issues in the first paragraph (and I think we should at least seethe draft engagement proposal before we
go any further).

I'll not respond to Gareth until I hear from you.

Best wishes
Belinda

Rodric/Belinda
Many thanks for ail the additional information today. Quite a bit to absorb.
In terms of an end of day update, we have secured estimated resources and have been progressing our internal take.

We have also started drafting our engagement letter thoughts, which continues to evolve and should be ready to share
with you in 1* draft on Monday. Clearly the Part 1 timeframes are quite challenging, so we are looking to limit the scope

POL-0106501
POL00108396
POL00108396

of activity in that area to the key areas we discussed; but at the same time, structure a framework for a Part 2 into the
letter that would enable the wider or deeper dive assessments to be approved by yourselves.

in terms of pencilling in some diary time next week to continue to progress things, could we perhaps arrange a call on
Monday afternoon, and ringfence some time to join you on site in Old Street on Wednesday?

Many thanks and regards

Gareth

Gareth,

As discussed earlier today, Post Office Limited is responding to allegations that the “Horizon” IT system used to record
transactions in Post Office branches is defective and/or that the processes associated with it are inadequate.

In order to respond to these allegations (which have been, and will in all likelihood continue to be, advanced in the
courts), Post Office wants to demonstrate that the Horizon system is robust, fit for purpose, and/or operates within an
appropriate control framework.

In order to determine whether or not Deloittes can help us in this regard, I attach the following documents:

1. “Horizon Core Audit Process” which outlines how Horizon has been designed to operate;

2. “Draft Factfile” which deals with how Post Office uses Horizon in our branch network;

3. “Description of Fujitsu’s System of IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office Limited’s POLSAP and HNG-X
applications”;

4. Atable of the themes which underlie some of the allegations that Horizon is deficient; and

5. “Note on Horizon Report” which outlines of the type of report we may require.

Could you please review these so that we can advance our discussions on a further call (or meeting) during the course of
tomorrow.

Kind regards, Rodric
