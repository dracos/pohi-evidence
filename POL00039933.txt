BA/POCL AUTOMATION PROJECT: TOWARDS AN_ INTER-

MINISTERIAL DECISION
1. We spoke about the letter from Joe Ashton to Hamish Sandison of earlier today.
2. Iam sorry that there appear still to be issues that concern you around the provision

of advice by the Joint Programme Lawyer. Given the need to get something sorted out in
time for us to put forward our respective submissions to the Treasury this evening, we did
not have the opportunity to discuss what the continuing concerns are. But I would be glad
if you could take me through them before too long, so that we can resolve them once and for
all.

3. In the meantime, you suggested that a way through for this particular work would be
for DSS/BA to commission work independently from Hamish. I agreed to this, but pointing
out that the basis for seeking his advice is of course that he is the Joint Programme Lawyer
with the expertise that goes with that, and it is in that capacity that we are seeking such
advice,

4, ‘You also confirmed that our agreement about how best to proceed supersedes the letter
earlier today from Joe Ashton to Hamish.

5. I have now written to Hamish accordingly; and I attach a copy of that letter.

6. Thank you for your help in sorting out the immediate problem.

Dear Hrsn ,

BA/POCL AUTOMATION PROJECT: TOWARDS AN INTER-
MINISTERIAL DECISION .

This note confirms that DSS/BA have sought some further advice from you, following up
your earlier Memoranda addressed to us and POCL on a possible exit Strategy, should
continuing with the BA/POCL Automation Project not prove possible.

- As you know, one of the pieces of work commissioned by Ministers is advice on the best exit

strategy to pursue, should they decide to halt the project on 9 December or shortly thereafter.
There are differing views between ourselves and POCL about the best strategy to pursue,
taking all the issues into account; and as a result, we and POCL have been asked to set out
our respective preferred strategies for the Law. Officers' consideration.

Our preferred strategy has been developed on the back of your legal advice as Joint
Programme Lawyer, and further informed by advice given by our Counsel. I should be
grateful if you could provide advice - in essence, the advice you have already given in your
memorandum of [ ] - but in a form that may be suitable to present as part of our submission
to the Law Officers. : -

I have agreed with Jonathan Evans, Network Director at Post Office Counters Ltd, that you
will be providing us with this assistance. :

Iam copying this letter to him and to David Sibbick at DTI for information; also to Catherine
Churchard, Solicitor and Legal Services Director at POCL; Robert Ricks, Legal Advisor to
the Treasury; Clive Osborne, Solicitor at DTI; and to Marilynne Morgan, the DSS Solicitor,
and Ron Powell the DSS legal advi: the project. - oo
