On 13 November 2006, I posted by Recorded Delivery, a summons

Magistrates Court at 10.00 hrs on Wednesday 06 December 2006.

I have signed the Certificate Of Service at the bottom of the
summons and returned the original to the Clerk to the Justices at
Aldershot Magistrates Court. A copy of that summons is enclosed
herewith, together with a typed copy of the Antecedents.
