Post Office Facts and Figures
Our role and reach

The Post Office has provided vital services at the heart of communities across the UK for
around 370 years. There are around 11,500 Post Office branches across the UK, 98% of
these are run with retail partners on an agency or franchise basis. 99.7% of the
population live within 3 miles of a Post Office and nearly 93% live within 1 mile. Along
with a significant online business, we are the biggest retail network in the UK, with more
branches than all the banks and building societies combined

Publicly owned following separation from Royal Mail in 2012, Post Office has
modernised 7,700 branches, with over 200,000 extra opening hours. Thousands of Post
Offices now open early in the morning until late in the evening, with around 4,000
branches open on Sundays, making Post Office services more accessible and convenient

The Post Office continues to evolve and adapt to meet the ever-changing demands of
customers. In the last few years, as part of a modernisation and investment programme,
more than 200 communities now have a brand new Post Office branch. In 2018, Post
Office also acquired Payzone’s bill payment business, providing customers with around
25,000 Payzone and Post Office locations to pay their bills

95% of the population say they use Post Office at least once a year and more than 850m
customer transactions are undertaken every year

In 2011/12, the Post Office was making a loss of £120 million. In 2017/18, Post Office
turned a growing profit for the second consecutive year, and further reduced our
reliance on taxpayer subsidy

As a commercial business the Post Office is driven also by its social purpose. As the hub
of many towns and villages across the UK it understands the important role the local
Post Office branch plays within communities, especially for older and more vulnerable
members of society

For many, the Post Office remains an important source of their customers’ social
interaction as well as providing important access to their essential needs. Postmasters
up and down the country offer more than just a range of services - in many cases they
are integral to their local community, making a meaningful impact to society within their
towns and villages
