Mr Coyne believes that 2 days will be necessary (as per the order), so we are content to proceed as per the
below for now, but just to flag that it is highly likely the expert(s) will want to return for a second day soon
after. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Coyne will want to inspect the system himself, and not be limited to a
demonstration.

The 28" June is now in Mr Coyne’s diary. If you could please confirm the final arrangements, or put the
experts in touch with the relevant individual at Fujitsu to do so.

Thanks

Imogen

Imogen,

Fujitsu have advised us that they can make the PEAK and TFS systems available for inspection (by way of a
demonstration by the relevant Subject Matter Experts) on 28 June. Fujitsu's view is that two hours for each system
should be sufficient and they are they are therefore reluctant to tie up the relevant resource for two consecutive days.
They have suggested that we proceed on the basis of a one day session, with the option of arranging a second day if
that proves necessary.

Please confirm that 28 June works for Mr Coyne and I will secure the date.

Imogen,

14 and 15 June are not suitable. Dr Worden is available on 21 and 22 June and during the week commencing 25
June. We have asked Fujitsu to confirm whether any of those dates are suitable. In the meantime, please let me
know if any of them are not suitable for Mr Coyne.

I’ve just tried to give you a call on the below - our expert is not able to keep both of those days free for much
longer (particularly not the Thursday). Can you please confirm the position ASAP. Given the limited time
available, I can take instructions on there being one day of access on Friday, and a further one the following
week if that is more suitable for both experts/Fujitsu.

Thanks

Imogen

As you know, the Judge made an order in relation to the experts having 2 days access to the PEAK/TFS
system by next Friday 15 June.

The Claimants’ expert is available on Thursday 14" and Friday 15" June for the inspection. Is this suitable
for Dr Worden and is Fujitsu able to accommodate this?

Thanks

Imogen
