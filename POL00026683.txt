WG discussions

1. SS productivity
The Working Group discussed SS’s note on productivity. SS confirmed:

© producing three reports each week was achievable. Despite the fact that it had been less
than three per week historically, they now have their processes in place and should speed
up.

© completion of Part Two will free up capacity, and more time will be freed up when all CQRs
have been submitted and assessed.

© that a projected end date of May 2015 was realistic provided PO reports continued to come
through. PO confirmed that it would continue to keep the SS hopper topped up - there are
currently 24 cases with Second Sight awaiting review.

JFSA expressed concern that the timescales suggested by SS would mean that the Scheme would
not be completed by the election.

ACTION: SS to discuss how to speed up SS productivity with BC at the 'caseflow' meeting
scheduled for 30 July. That discussion should cover possibilities of SS taking on additional
resource. BC to report back to the WG on the next call.

Case No. I Status

M004 Accepted by WG - deadline to be confirmed by AVDB.
M103 Accepted by WG (see below).

M138 Accepted by WG - deadline to be confirmed by AVDB.

M103 — this application appears to contain — on face value — an admission of theft. The WG agreed
that PO should review the case and if produce a short, sharp report articulating that they have
nothing further to add in light of the applicants admission, if this remains the case after review.
Whilst not to be prioritised this case could possibly be cleared quickly.

4. Priority cases

agenda item 9.

M128 CQR deadline 31 July. Applicant represented by Aver.

M150 CQR deadline 31 July. Applicant represented by Aver.

e M015 -SS are working on the draft CRR. It appears that although the applicant applied for funding
and the case appears on Aver's list as CQR received, Aver did not complete the CQR. When the draft
CRR issues, if the applicant requires funding for an advisor to assist with commenting on the report,
funding is already agreed.

explained following the last face-to-face WG meeting she undertook a review of the pipeline and the
way the investigation reports were being produced. She was now bringing in additional resource to
draft reports.

e M142 has changed their advisor from James Cowper to Howe & Co. Howe & Co have now
requested expenses. They have said:

‘In view of the time constraints we have arranged to see Ms Latreille on Friday 25" July. As the
post office in question is still run by Ms Latreille’s partner it is not possible for them to travel to
London for a meeting. I will have to travel to them, the cost of travelling to Taunton by train
which is the nearest mainline station to them is £95.50.Please confirm that this travelling

expense will be paid in addition to the fee of £1,500.00 + VAT’
POL00026683
POL00026683

The WG approved the request — but the WG expect Howe & Co to submit the CQR by deadline or this
case will be passed to PO for investigation on the information available.

ACTION: Chair to write to Howe & Co as per above.
10. Issues with resourcing / timings
N/A
11. AOB

* Progress letters to applicants

A draft letter has been sent to the WG for comment. Comments required by CoP Friday.

ACTION: Secretariat to begin sending update letters to applicants, taking account of comments
made by WG.

* Issue of Second Sight Part Two Briefing Report in relation to M001 and M002.

The WG discussed the next steps for Draft CRRs for M001 and M002. Both Draft CRRs reference
Part Two, however it is not yet finalised. The question is whether to invite comments from the
applicants before they receive Part Two (SS maintain the applicant does not need Part Two to
comment on the Draft CRR but they will need it in advance of mediation).

The Chair asked PO to consider by next week whether the decision on whether to mediate either
case is likely to be an issue and report back to the WG next week.

ACTION: PO to report on its view of mediation for M001 and M002 at the WG call on 31 July.

e SS raised concerns about delays if cases were held back pending Part Two as it may not be ready
for a few weeks. The WG agreed that:

SS should produce Part Two as quickly as possible using the information it had available

If SS were awaiting information from PO it should say so in the report — not continue to delay
SS should circulate Part Two in draft even if some sections are not complete

SS and PO should meet next week to discuss the draft and any missing information.

0000

ACTIONS: SS to circulate Part Two in draft
SS and PO to meet to discuss the draft and outstanding information.

*  Chair’s Mediation Test — PO received a copy of JFSA’s submission overnight. PO will respond to
JFSA and the Chair by CoP Tuesday 29 July. AB confirmed that his submission comprised two
documents with comments embedded. The Chair will make his decision within a week.

* Role of Working group in mediation decisions — JFSA to submit this week (24 July) — PO then
has two weeks to respond (by 7 August).

ACTION: PO to make its submissions to the Chair and JFSA by COP on 29 July.

* WG calls over the Summer — the WG agreed it would have a call next week (31 July) but as the
Chair and CA are away there will then be no calls for three weeks unless there is a need.
Otherwise matters will be dealt with by email and the Secretariat will continue to issue progress
reports
