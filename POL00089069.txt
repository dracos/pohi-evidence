I have been employed by, Post Office Ltd (formally known as the Post Office, Consignia and
Royal Mail Group) since 1978. Post Office Ltd employs me as a Security Manager and my
duties include the investigation of crimes committed against Post Office Ltd by its staff and
its agent's employees. I have held this position for 12 years.

On 7 February 2012 I received an enquiry concerning a discrepancy in the accounts at
Winsford Post Office branch 19a Dingle Walk Winsford CW7 1BA.

An audit undertaken on 2 February 2012 identified a shortage of £17,811.49 in the
accounts at Winsford Post Office. An audit report (RC/2) has been complied and I can
confirm that a number of Branch Trading Statements and Horizon Print outs were passed to
me by Richard CROSS Field Support Advisor who conducted the audit

Mr ALLEN declined to sign a copy of the auditors Record of Conversation (RC/1) admitting
that he inflated the cash on hand sheets and the accounts would be short by over £10,000.

On Thursday 19" April 2012 Mr Grant lan ALLEN was interviewed at Royal Mail House

Continuation of statement of Stephen BRADSHAW

SB/11. statement is a record of the accounts for Winsford Post Office declared by

Mr Grant lan ALLEN for the given period of the Trading Period (TP) showing

the amount of cash carried forward to the next Trading Period.

I now formally produce all exhibits with the identifying marks, SB/1, SB/3 to SB/11.

Mr ALLEN was also shown the Record of Conversation (RC/1) and the audit report (RC/2).
During the interview Mr Grant lan ALLEN said any shortages in the branch accounts would
be “rolled” into either the Post Office Managers or the Deputy Post Office Managers stock
unit. He then made admissions that he removed cash from his own stock unit KK to make
good the cash in the stock unit of either the Post Office Manager or the Deputy Post Office
Managers.

Mr ALLEN admitted that he recorded the shortages by inflating the unusable notes (SB/3)
when declaring the cash on hand. He also made admissions that the cash carried forward on
each of the Branch Trading Statements (SB/6 to SB/11) from his own stock unit KK was not
a true amount and the inflation of the cash commenced in April 2010.

When Mr ALLEN was reminded of his legal rights he indicated that he was not sure if he
wanted a solicitor to be present at the interview. The tapes were switched off at 12:07 and I
