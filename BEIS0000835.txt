POST OFFICE HORIZON SHORTFALL SCHEME
July 2024 REPORT

Introduction

Following discussion with the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, this report was
commissioned by the former Minister Hollinrake and will be produced quarterly by the
Department for Business and Trade (DBT). Due to the restrictions following the
announcement of the General Election, this report covers the months of May and June
2024.

The Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) aims to independently assess and resolve
applications from current and former Postmasters who believe they may have been
affected by shortfalls related to previous versions of Horizon. The HSS does not apply to
those who have criminal convictions or were plaintiffs in the GLO.

If a Postmaster is unhappy with their claim outcome, they can seek legal advice at Post
Office’s cost and also take advantage of a dispute resolution process that includes
independent mediation.

Observations

At the 28 June 2024, Post Office had received 1,887 subsequent applications
(applications received since October 2022) of which 1,438 have had eligibility
confirmed (either ineligible or eligible) and Post Office continues to work through the
eligibility assessment of the remaining applications. Of the 1,438, Post Office
considers upwards of 500 claims may be suitable candidates for a £75k Fixed Sum
Offer. Post Office expects to contact all claimants without an offer to provide further
details of the Fixed Sum Offer and options open to Postmasters in the short term.
1,453 of the 1,887 late applications were received in 2024. Before this, Post Office
was receiving applications at an average rate of c.20 per month and had appropriate
resources in place accordingly. Application volumes were expected to reduce further
in 2024. While the pace of new applications has slowed since the peaks in January
2024, we are still seeing c.25 new applications per week.
Additional resources have been (and continue to be) put in place in light of this
increase and the expected further application volumes. There may be some initial
delays in processing applications while the resource is onboarded/trained.
Post Office is considering what suitable service level agreements it can introduce,
similar to the GLO, to monitor the speed of claim to Offer, while appreciating the fact
that the HSS is different from the GLO in many regards, not least the unknown
volume of HSS claims. Once the £75k Fixed Sum Award approach is fully agreed,
Post Office will be in a better position to return to this important question.
