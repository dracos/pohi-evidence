I understand that our session has been pushed back to Thursday but I thought you would still like to see
the briefing pack in advance. It is still missing an enterprise architecture slide which I will have in the
next couple of days.

In the session on Thursday we would like to kick of with some background on Horizon before moving
into the SPM briefing. We will finish by giving you a demo of the current version of NBIT.

Regards

Chris
