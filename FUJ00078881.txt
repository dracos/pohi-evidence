Dear Tony, Ci

Thank you for your letter faxed earlier today. regarding CCN556. We have examined
the points.you make carefully and generally accept them. In terms of the design of
OBCS and the “hard coding-of CPP numbers”, we understand the previously
deployed argument that OBCS was originally intended only as an interim solution
and. some design shortcuts were taken. While we accept this,.1 would hope that in
implementing such changes as CCN556 (and the earlier CCN297) every opportunity
is taken to-ensure that.the design is made more flexible to ensure.a longer life for the

‘product and to make it more amenable to further.enhancement in the future. I know
you agree that it is in both our interests to ensure that OBCS is made as attractive
proposition as’ possible to Post Office Counters Limited's Clients.

In terms of the testing duration, our test team still consider the estimate you have
put forward to be-on the upper end of the expected range, especially as the testing
activity will be coincident with CSR+ activity rather than requiring a one-off specific
activity.

Neverthelesé, if you would please arrange for a revised CCN to be raised, taking
account of the amendment in paragraph 2 of your letter, we anticipate approving it
without further delay.

Yours sincerely, .
