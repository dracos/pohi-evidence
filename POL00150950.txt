Attachment: _DOC_30099979(1)_Suspense Account II - v4 RI.docx

Andy — further to our call this afternoon I have made the following further changes:

- Updated the “top ten” examples

- Added an Appendix A re banking. This is partly as additional detail for this paper and partly to be cross
referenced as a response to misunderstandings in Second Sight’s Second Report

- Deleted repetitions

- Moved the second example (from the old draft) into the “top ten”. le. moving the extra explanation on ATM
retracts

1am afraid my formatting has gone awry in some of it. I can’t work out how to sort out indents.
Thanks, Rod

Andy — please find attached my latest draft. Towards the end of it I have put some hashtags and explained that I am
continuing to rationalise the duplicate explanations of personal banking and to align with notes on banking in the

paper of responses to Second Sights Second Report.

However, I hope that the narrative up to that point gives you a good steer on where I am going in order that we can
discuss next steps on that.

There are (as marked) a few enquiries I am still making too. But I hope that this now gives a firmer basis for review
and discussion.

Thanks, Rod
