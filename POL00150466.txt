Belinda, Chris

Happy New year to you both.

Following a chat with Belinda yesterday, I attach a first draft note for the board which argues that, following the strategy
agreed last Summer, POL should now make a last attempt to bring the Scheme back on track, which would effectively
entail JFSA/MPs/SS making concessions it is unimaginable to think they would.

The effect of that refusal would be for us to have no option but bring the Scheme ‘in-house’, detailed plans for which we
can share with the Board at a later stage. This has the merit of breaking next steps into Sub-Committee/Board-friendly

bite-sized chunks, with no-one being called upon to make too much of a decision at any given stage.

It’s currently done as an Annex but we can review how best to present all the information we need to share with the Sub
Committee once we have all the necessary building blocks in place.

As I say, a first draft and it will doubtless benefit from your input — I can turn around comments/suggestions throughout
tomorrow.

Best wishes for 2015

Patrick
