Subject: Second Sight - contractual issues

Dear Andy
We spoke briefly.

I would be grateful if BD could produce a short bit of advice on the manner of implementation and consequences
of a future decision to terminate Second Sight’s engagement.

The advice needs to cover (but should not be limited to if other matters occur) the nature and extent of POL’s
ability to control access to, and uses of, all and any information it has provided SS; the duration and effectiveness
of that control in particular with regard to the Part II report they are preparing; and the legal and practical effects
of the 30 day notice period which the letter of engagement provides for.

I am also interested in the effects, in legal and practical terms, of a termination given that the letter of engagement
tries to make it clear that, although they are engaged by us, they in fact work to the WG. You can imagine the sorts
of arguments which might be made.

Timescale is short, I fear — this should inform a discussion taking place at senior level tomorrow.

Happy to discuss
