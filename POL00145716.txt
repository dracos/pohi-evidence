 Susan, Piero

 I've spoken to one of our insurance lawyers re the D&O cover.

 Summary

       •      The policy is unlikely to provide cover against the types of claims that SPMRs might bring against POL's
             directors arising out of the Horizon situation.
       •      One area that would be covered is a derivative action by POL or BIS against POL's directors for breach of
             their directors' duties. As advised previously, on the information we have seen, we don't believe that POL's
             directors have breached their duties.
       •      There is therefore no strict requirement for POL to notify its insurer at the moment — though, if in doubt, best
             practice is to notify.
       •      The risk of notification is that it would look bad for POL if it ever became public knowledge that POL had
             notified its insurer.
       •      To reduce this risk, it is recommended that rather than sending a formal written notification, POL speaks to
             Chartis (renamed AIG) and verbally notifies them so as to not leave a paper trail. In our experience, AIG may
             be prepared to accept a verbal notification.
       •      POL should make expressly clear to AIG that the notification is subject to litigation privilege (this should help
             protect against disclosure under FOIA).

 Policy

 In essence the policy provides cover against:

        •     Written demands for compensation or formal proceedings (civil, criminal or regulatory) brought against the
              D&Os which allege "wrongful acts". "Wrongful Acts" is defined (3.56) to include breach of duty qua director,
              breach of s260(3) Companies Act, employment practice violations, Sarbanes Oxley violations, and securities
              claims.
        •     Securities claims (defined in 3.45 essentially as violations of securities rules/regulations and derivative
              actions by shareholders)
                                                                                                                      POLOO145716
                                                                                                                   POLOO145716



     •    Investigations (3.26) — formal investigation into the affairs of the company or the D&Os by a regulator or
          government body "empowered by statute to investigate the affairs of..." the company and D&Os.
     •    Derivative claims under P11 of Companies Act.

The policy does not provide cover for defamation claims against D&Os.

Extensions to Cover

There are also several extensions of cover, most of which do not add materially to breadth of cover, going more to the
types of financial loss which can be recovered once the policy is triggered.

However, it is worth highlighting the Self Report Extension (2.14). Defined in 3.46 — 3.47, this is triggered by an
internal enquiry by the company into the affairs of the company following a "...formal written notification to an official
body [regulators or government bodies empowered by statute as above].., informing them of an actual or suspected
material breach of an insured person's legal or regulatory duties if and to the extent that such enquiry is requested by
an official body." We do not think this has been triggered yet.

Notification Obligations

Under Clause 5.5, POL has to notify "any claim" as soon as practicable, but must be during the policy (or relevant
discovery) period.

POL may also notify circumstances which are "reasonably expected to give rise to a claim". It is difficult to say with
certainty what this means legally other than the fact that it is an objective test. However, the threshold for notifying
something is likely to be a realistic possibility: something more than at least possible and less than more likely than
not. The usual advice in these circumstances is, if in doubt, notify. The provision specifies what information the
notice must contain, to whom and how it must be notified. Notice must be in writing, but we think that AIG would be
prepared to waive that formality and allow POL verbally notify.

FOIA and privilege

Notification to an insurer is potentially subject to disclosure under FOIA. Please note FOIA applies to all information —
verbal or written.

There is an exemption from disclosure under FOIA where information is privileged. Notification to an insurer, where
there is a known claim, is usually subject to litigation privilege.

However, litigation privilege only applies where "litigation" is actually contemplated, not where there is just the risk of a
hypothetical claim. In the context of claims against a director, we have arguably not yet reached the stage of
contemplated litigation, rather we are just dealing in hypotheticals.

Nevertheless, we would rely on Alan Bates' comment that he is aware of SPMRs lining up claims against POL's
directors as evidence of contemplated litigation.

As POL is in the nexus between live litigation and theoretical claims, we recommend verbal notification to AIG so to
balance insurance protection against brand protection.

Andy

The letter does nothing more than put POL's insurers on notice of the Horizon issues. It's very bland. My only
hesitation is whether this is strictly necessary to do. From a PR perspective, it would look bad if this got into
the public domain - sign of guilt / concern from the board.

I'd be happy to have one of our insurance lawyers look over the D&O policy to see if POL is required to notify
the insurers. If not, then we might want to hold fire on this.

I would recommend tweaking the first paragraph. The current version suggests that there are problems with
Horizon - when at present there are no systemic problems to report.

It should just say that the press have reported on "potential issues with Horizon" rather "financial
discrepancies have occurred in Horizon". Apologies, the letter is a pdf so I can't make changes to the
document itself.

Kind regards
