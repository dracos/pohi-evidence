Subject: Post Office: submissions to Baroness Neville-Rolfe on Network Transformation and on Horizon / BBC Panorama
Hi Andrew, Charlie cc. PS/Secretary of State, PS/George Freeman, PS/SpAds

Please find attached two submissions for Baroness Neville-Rolfe. These cover two current (urgent) issues for Post Office
which we mentioned to the Minister in our intro meeting today and which we would like to cover in a little more detail
in our catch up tomorrow. Grateful if these could go in tonight’s box (and thank you for allowing us an extra hour!)

The first covers Network Transformation, and in particular, the next steps for Post Office branches which have not
engaged in the transformation programme. (First Word attachment plus PowerPoint annex)

The second covers the Post Office Horizon mediation scheme, with particular focus on the BBC Panorama programme
on 22 June which is due to feature this issue. (Second Word attachment plus PDF annex)

We do not expect the Minister to come to a decision on these submissions overnight, but if she is able to read/skim
them ahead of tomorrow’s meeting that would be very helpful for both us and the Minister.

In terms of tomorrow's session, we would like to cover:
© Quick introduction to the rest of the POL team
e Network transformation (15 mins)
e Horizon (10 mins)

George, Rob — there is a chance that these issues could prompt media attention in the next few weeks. It might
therefore be helpful for SoS / SpAds to have sight of these submissions later this week. We are happy to provide any
additional information or background that you think might be helpful. We will of course continue to keep Press Office in
the loop on developments, particularly on BBC Panorama.

Many thanks

Laura
