Further to your fax of yesterday and as discussed this morning, I have’had a quick look
at the provisions in the Related Agreements (as amended by the Letter Agreement of 24th
May, 1999) regarding termination for convenience and set out my comments below.

Summary

1. - Under the Related Agreements, POCL may terminate the Authorities Agreement and
the POCL Agreement on not less than 12 months’ notice. On termination, POCL is
obliged to pay to Pathway an amount although the method of calculation of that _
amount and the extent to which that amount is capped is unclear. Termination by
POCL with a shorter notice period would expose POCL to a damages claim from -
Pathway for the amounts that would have been payable by POCL to’Pathway had 12

Authorities Agreement

2. Under Clause 902.6 of the Authorities Agreement, POCL may terminate the Authorities
Agreement on not less than 12. months’ notice. On such termination, POCL is obliged’
to pay to Pathway the Termination Charge as calculated in ‘accordance with Schedule
A9 of the Authorities Agreement. As that schedule has been left blank intentionally .
and the definition of Termination Charge in respect of the Authorities Agreement
refers only to Schedule A9 of that agreement, I do not believe that any amount is
payable in these circumstances.

CA991470.193 : 2 . 27th May, 1999

POCL Agreement

3. Under Clause 902.6 of the POCL Agreement, as with the Authorities Agreement, POCL
may terminate the POCL Agreement on-not less than 12 months’ notice. Again, on
such termination, POCL is liable to Pathway for the Termination Charge although this
time, that charge is to be calculated in accordance with Schedule A7 of the POCL
Agreement.

Schedule A7 of the POCL Agreement

4. Iv is not entirely clear to what extent, if any, Schedule A7 of the POCL Agreement
(paragraph 5 attached) has been amended by the Letter Agreement, particularly, i in
light of the payments that are to be made under Schedule 2 of the Letter Agreement.

5. In brief, the Termination Charge equals (i) sunk costs (less amounts recovered under
> the Scorecard) plus (ii) costs flowing from termination plus (iii) 15% of expected
Scorecard based revenues less (iv) 80% of the payment made on the acquisition of the
Project assets.

6. With regard to Pathway’s costs under paragraph 5.1(a) of Schedule A7, on a literal
view, there would be no netting off of costs recovered after.24th May, 1999 as there is
arguably no longer any Scorecard. On the other hand, it would make sense to reduce
those costs by the amounts paid to Pathway pursuant to Schedule 2 of the Letter
Agreement which sets out the new charging arrangements. A wider question is
whether Pathway’s sunk costs should be reduced by the amount written off in ICLs
accounts given that ICL had to bear some of the financial costs as part of the new deal.

hahaind 7=' ~ "With"regards to the’ profit’allowancé under paragraph 5.1(¢) of Schedule AZ, again, a
literal approach would result in the expected profit being nil if there is no Scorecard
anymore. Alternatively, it could be argued that a profit allowance based on the new
deal should be included. However, I am not sure whether simply taking 15% of the
Schedule 2 payments would necessarily reflect the underlying profit assumptions of
that schedule, if that is what the parties wish to do. c

8. The deduction for the asset purchase price at first glance is only 80 pence. It might, -
however, be possible to argue that a proportion of the Schedule 2 payments should be
* apportioned to the asset price. .

9. Although there are caps on the Termination Charge, it is arguable whether they are

still valid in light of the new pricing regime and the method of calculating the
Termination Charge. If the caps were to remain as they are, then based on a
