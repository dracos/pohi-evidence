It is the policy of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) to provide a secure working environment forI
the protection of employees, and also to ensure the security of all assets owned by orI
entrusted to Pathway.

This document fits into the structure illustrated below, with the BS7799 Code of Practice

2.0 Introduction

In May 1996, Fujitsu Services Pathway Limited, formally ICL (Pathway) , was selected to set
up and operate the services to automate counter transactions at Post Offices throughout the
UK.

The requirement to implement a Benefit Payment Service for the Benefit Agency was removed
when the UK Government’s major Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project was changed to a
Public Private Partnership (PPP) project during 1999.

The purpose of this policy document is to lay the foundation that will enable Pathway to
protect the integrity, availability and confidentiality of all assets associated with the services. It
also enables Pathway to comply with legislative and commercial requirements.

2.1 Service Overview

The agreement is a PPP project, whereby Pathway will automate 20,000 Post Offices and
provide the infrastructure which enables users to make automated payments at outlets
throughout the UK.

Computerised facilities at Post Office counters enable a range of Automated Payment Services
(APS) to be provided, allowing customers to make payments to utilities and other clients
supported by Post Office Limited (POL).

The Electronic Point Of Sale Service (EPOSS) supports all services, or products, provided by
the counter clerk to the customer.

The Order Book Control Service (OBCS) is a discrete counter application, transactions in
respect of which are recorded via EPOSS.

The services are designed to provide secure payment facilities, hence particular attention is
focused upon the security aspects of the services throughout their life cycle.

2.2 Scope

This Security Policy specifies mandatory security requirements to be applied throughout
Pathway.

Pathway has overall responsibility for the design, development, implementation, roll-out,
operation and support of the service throughout the contract period. Specific activities will be
subcontracted to appropriate organisations, which will be required to work within the security
framework defined by Pathway.

Pathway’s Security Policy must be compatible with POL Security Policy. The interfaces
between Pathway and all external organisations must be clearly defined and formally agreed
with the organisations concerned.

Security obligations for subcontractors involved in development activities (including Escher,
Oracle and Fujitsu Services ) will be subject to individual agreements with Pathway.
Commercial off the shelf (COTS) products will be provided by the appropriate product
suppliers (including Microsoft).

2.3 Policy Review

Once approved, this policy document will be formally reviewed at least annually and after any
significant security incident or occurrence of fraud, and updated whenever necessary.

Responsibilities for approval, review and issue of Pathway’s Security Policy and Procedures
are defined in section 4.

3.0 Objectives

This document provides a definition of Pathway’s high-level Security Policy.

Pathway will establish an infrastructure that will minimise and control liabilities to itself and
POL.

The Security Policy defines the requirements for Pathway enabling it to protect the integrity,
availability and confidentiality of information used and produced by the services. This includes
making adequate provision for:

e Business Continuity, and
© compliance with relevant legislation.

The responsibilities for policy implementation are defined (in section 4) in order that the policy
requirements can be communicated throughout Pathway. This will ensure that all parties are
fully aware of their responsibilities and legal obligations.

Pathway has stated its commitment to ensuring that it encompasses the very best commercial
practices for security. Pathway’s aim is to be fully compliant with BS7799.

Compliance with legislative requirements (including the Data Protection Act 1984') and
BS7799 is considered under “Compliance” (in section 10).

3.1. Business Objectives
The business Objectives are:
1. Identifying and managing risks

Protection of information assets

2

3. Protection of IT assets

4. Provide continuity of services
5

Maintenance of Pathway’s reputation.

’ Change to Data Protection Act (1998) will be subject to CCN approval.

Version: 7.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 28-MAY-2002

3.2 IT Security Objectives

Pathway’s overall IT security objective can be summarised as achieving the requirement
expressed in the following policy statement:

It is the policy of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) to protect its investment in IT assets, and to
ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information conveyed, processed or
stored, by the services.

1. Security measures in Pathway’s IT systems will ensure appropriate confidentiality,
integrity and availability of services, software components and data, whether in storage or
in transit.

2. Physical and logical access to the IT systems will be controlled, with access granted
selectively, and permitted only where there is a specific need. Access will be limited to
persons with appropriate authorisation and a “need to know” requirement.

3. Authentication, whereby a user’s claimed identity is verified, is essential before any access
is granted to any IT system. Authentication mechanisms are also required to ensure that
trust relationships can be established between communicating components within, and
external to, Pathway’s services.

4. All users of Pathway’s services will be individually accountable for their actions.
Accountability for information assets will be maintained by assigning owners, who will be
responsible for defining who is authorised to access the information. If responsibilities are
delegated then accountability will remain with the nominated owner of the asset.

5. Audit mechanisms are required to monitor, detect and record events that might threaten
the security of the Pathway services or any service(s) to which it is connected. Regular
analysis of audit trails is essential to facilitate the identification and investigation of
security breaches.

6. Alarm mechanisms are required to alert security personnel to the occurrence of security
violations that could seriously threaten the secure operation of Pathway’s services. These
alarms will be used to trigger prompt investigation and remedial action in order to
minimise the impact of any security breach.

7. Pathway will monitor all developments and operations to maintain assurance that its
services are performing in accordance with approved security procedures and controls.
This will give a high level of confidence that all information is being protected during
processing, transmission and storage.

3.3 Legal Obligations

Pathway must remain fully compliant with all relevant legislation and regulations.

In addition to the existing legislative obligations, identified in section 10.2, it is important to
track and anticipate emerging UK and European regulations that could affect Pathway’s
operation.

4.2 Pathway Security Board

The representatives on Pathway’s Security Board are nominated by the Director, Customer
Services, and approved by the Pathway Board.

The Security Board participants, which will include Horizon Security Liaison staff, represent a
broad range of interests to ensure that alternative perspectives are considered.

Whenever necessary, the Security Board can commission independent specialists to undertake
studies, investigations or audits.

Security Board responsibilities include:

ownership of Pathway’s Security Strategy,

determining the adequacy of Pathway’s Security Policy definition,
formal review of all Security Policy documents,

review of security incidents, on a regular basis, and

liaison with external bodies and specialists.

4.3 Security Manager

The Security Manager is responsible for ensuring implementation of policy and procedures,
and maintaining “best practice”, within the remit of Pathway.

Pathway’s Security Manager’s responsibilities include:

physical and environmental security,

monitoring for compliance with Pathway’s Security Policy,

providing the point of contact for reporting all types of security incidents,
ensuring that security incidents are recorded and investigated,

ensuring that security relevant events are recorded,

ensuring that system audit trails are analysed on a regular basis,
documentation of Pathway’s Security Policy,

owner of Pathway’s Security Procedures,

4.4 Security Administration

The description “Security Administration” has been used to describe Pathway personnel
assigned to roles with particular responsibility for security.

Contract Controlled Document
FUJ00232499

FUJ00232499
Fujitsu Services PATHWAY SECURITY POLICY Ref: RS/POL/002
Version: 7.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 28-MAY-2002

Pathway’s Security Manager is the normal line manager for this group, hence many of the
activities assigned to Security Administrators will be to support the functions listed in section
43.

Wherever possible, Security Administrators will act in a supporting or monitoring role rather
than as a Service Provider for the operational services. In this capacity they can:

monitor compliance with Pathway’s Security Policy,

implement Pathway’s Security Procedures,

conduct independent reviews of compliance to policy and procedures,
report actual and suspected security incidents, and recommend changes, to
enhance Pathway’s security controls, to the Security Manager.

4.5 Responsibilities for Physical Security

The local Site Managers have responsibility for physical security at all sites used by Pathway.

At some sites, notably Data Centres and support sites, Pathway can benefit from existing
security infrastructure in order to protect against threats from physical and environmental
sources.

At Post Office outlets, the Post Office Manager has particular responsibility for safeguarding
the Pathway equipment installed.

4.6 All Personnel

All service users, most of whom will be at Post Office counters, will be included in Pathway’s
awareness and/or training programmes. Security aspects, an integral part of these
programmes, will be set in a context appropriate to the user’s role (for example, Post Office
Manager or clerk).

All Pathway employees, subcontractors and system users have security responsibilities and
they will be required to work together in support of this security policy. Personnel who may
not regard themselves as any kind of “system user” will still have security responsibilities. In
particular, they are expected to be vigilant in reporting anything they believe may be
suspicious.

Promoting security awareness, throughout Pathway, to subcontractors, and within Post
Offices, is an important responsibility assigned to Pathway’s Security Manager.

Publicising security reporting and escalation procedures will be part of this awareness strategy.

4.7 Reporting Security Incidents

Pathway will establish effective procedures for reporting, acting upon and escalating all
incidents that could affect security. It is the responsibility of all users of the Pathway services
and Pathway personnel to use these procedures.

Pathway’s Security Manager is responsible for ensuring that all incidents are recorded,
investigated and resolved with appropriate urgency. This will include liaison with Horizon
Security Liaison staff to review incidents and actions.

5.0 Responsibilities For Audit

The Director of Programmes, is accountable for the Audit function within Pathway, as
illustrated in figure 1.

The Audit Manager’s responsibilities, listed in section 5.1, are primarily concerned with
managing the internal Audit function within Pathway but they also include liaison with POL
audit personnel.

As the point of contact with external audit personnel, the Audit Manager will need to maintain
regular contact with many Pathway groups (e.g. Customer Service, Programmes, Commercial
and Finance) to co-ordinate audit related activities.

The Security Event Management function, illustrated in figure 1, encompasses the routine IT
Security activities concerned with security relevant events recorded by Pathway’s systems. It
is really part of the day-to-day security administration activity, but has been highlighted to
identify the need for regular analysis of event logs.

5.1 Audit Manager’s Responsibilities

Pathway’s Audit Manager is responsible for ensuring implementation of Pathway’s Audit
Policy and maintaining “best practice”, within the remit of Pathway.

The Audit Manager’s responsibilities include:

planning and carrying out audits of Pathway’s business functions,
examining and evaluating the results of (business function) audits,
developing and agreeing improvement programmes,

monitoring and reporting improvement activities,

monitoring for compliance with Pathway’s Audit Policy,
providing the point of contact for all audit related matters,
overall responsibility for Pathway’s Audit activities,
documentation of Pathway’s Audit Policy,

being the owner of Pathway’s Audit Standards,

documentation of Pathway’s Audit Standards,

communication of Audit policy and standards within Pathway,
co-ordinating the evaluation of all new audit products proposed,
specifying and arranging Audit education and training,

liaison with POL audit personnel,

liaison with Fujitsu Services Group Audit personnel, and
recruitment selection of Audit personnel.

5.2 Business Function Monitoring Responsi es

The description “Business Function Monitoring” has been used to describe Pathway personnel
assigned to roles with particular responsibility for Audit.

Pathway’s Audit Manager is the normal line manager for this group, hence many of the
activities assigned to Business Function Monitoring will be to support the functions listed in
section 5.1.

Wherever possible, Business Function Monitoring will act in a supporting role rather than as a
Service Provider for the operational services. In this capacity they can:

monitor compliance with Pathway’s Audit Policy,

implement Pathway’s Audit Standards,

conduct independent reviews of compliance to policy and standards,
report actual and suspected security incidents, and

recommend changes, to enhance Pathway’s audit controls, to the Audit
Manager.

5.3 Security Event Management Responsibilities

The description “Security Event Management” has been used to describe Pathway personnel
assigned to roles with particular responsibility for security relevant events recorded by
Pathway’s systems.

Pathway’s Security Manager is the normal line manager for this group, hence many of the
activities assigned to Security Event Management personnel will be supporting functions.

Wherever possible, Security Event Management will act in a monitoring role supporting the
audit related security administration activities. In this capacity they can:

¢ ensure that specified events are being audited on the relevant platforms,

¢ ensure that all access (and attempted access) to Pathway’s systems is

audited,

monitor usage by Pathway operations and management staff,

analyse the audit logs generated by the different Pathway platforms,

assist with investigations (as assigned by the Security Manager),

extract copies of audit information for investigation purposes,

ensure that archived audit information is being stored securely,

implement Pathway’s Security Procedures (particularly with regard to

audit),

report actual and suspected security incidents, and

¢ recommend changes, to enhance Pathway’s security controls, to the Security
Manager.

6.0 Personnel Security

Staff concerned with the operations and management of central services are to be managed
under the guidance of Fujitsu Services Personnel Policy Manual and associated documents.

Staff working on high-risk areas in the organisation (those classified as “sensitive”) are to be
subject to more frequent vetting reviews and internal audits. This applies to Pathway’s own
employees and to staff from subcontractor’s organisations.

6.1 Recruitment Selection

All applicants will be subject to an appropriate level of vetting, using criteria approved and
provided by Fujitsu Services Group Security. This will include checks on their identification
and financial circumstances.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 28-MAY-2002

Business and personal references will be checked for all applicants.

6.2. Job Descriptions, Contracts and Assessment

Pathway will apply best commercial practice, based upon BS7799, to include security
considerations within:

Employees Terms and Conditions for Employment, and generic job descriptions.

6.3 Security Education and Training

Pathway’s education and training programme will promote security awareness and explain the
importance and use of security controls.

The programme will include:
¢ all Pathway employees,
© training for all system users, tailored to their particular role, and
© appropriate training for contractors and third parties.
7.0 Implementation Policies
The following subsections provide an overview of the controls required for:
e asset classification and control,
¢ physical and environmental security, and
© system access control.

Pathway’s Security Procedures will provide more detailed guidance based upon the
corresponding BS7799 sections. This will include the provision and maintenance of an asset
register.

7.1 Information Classification

All information used by Pathway will be handled in accordance with its classification, as
specified by its owner. Information owners are required to classify all information that they
own, in accordance with a process that will be jointly agreed.

The sensitivity of information will be measured by the consequences of a potential security
breach associated with that information.

Pathway will assume that aggregation cannot increase the classification of any information.

Pathway’s Security Procedures will include guidance on protective marking and handling of
information.

7.2 Safeguarding POL Records

Pathway will protect all manual and electronic records supplied by POL in accordance with
agreed contractual obligations. The records will be safeguarded from unauthorised disclosure,
modification, loss, destruction and falsification.

of establishing secure areas for the protection of IT facilities. The physical security measures
will include:

specialist site security staff in attendance 24 hours per day,
surveillance and intruder detection systems,

multi-zone areas controlled by a card access system, and
regular security reviews and audit checks.

All equipment and cabling will be well maintained and protected against environmental
hazards, including fire and water damage.

Post Offices pose some significant challenges for several reasons:

Pathway will use approximately 20,000 sites throughout the UK,
Pathway cannot control the physical security at Post Offices,
Pathway owns the IT assets installed in each Post Office,

high specification commercial PCs will be installed at each site,
Pathway cannot vet or select Post Office personnel, and

changes to the Post Office operating environment can occur.

The security measures associated with installed equipment will take these
factors into consideration to reduce Pathway’s risks to an acceptable level.

7.4 System Access Control

Control of access to Pathway’s systems and data will be in accordance with Pathway’s Access
Control Policy, which will be based upon analysis of security and business requirements.

The Access Control Policy and associated Security Procedures will specify:

a clear definition of responsibilities for all authorised users,
specification of roles and responsibilities for all types of system usage,
control of access to all Pathway systems components,

control of access to all data within the Pathway systems,

control of access to all stored information and documentation,
control of access to database facilities and tools,

control of access to applications running on servers and workstations,
control of access to the network and network management systems,
procedures for allocation of access rights to IT systems,
management, assignment and revocation of privileges,

identification and authentication of human and system “users”, and
password management, including password generation and expiry.

Accountability of individuals is essential and segregation of duties will be enforced where
appropriate.

Wherever authorisation is given orally, normally over a telephone link, additional verification
methods must be used.

7.5 Cryptography

Pathway will comply with Government Policy with regard to the protection of Government
Data.

Pathway will seek the guidance of Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG) on all
matters concerning cryptography. This includes:

choice of encryption algorithms,

strength of mechanisms,

encryption of information stored on disks within Post Offices, and
encryption key management (including key generation, distribution and
change).

8.0 Administration of Security

The following subsections provide an overview of the controls required within Pathway’s
organisation. Pathway’s Security Procedures will provide further guidance, based upon the
BS7799 controls, for:

© computer and network management, and

e system development and maintenance.

8.1 System and Network Management

Operational control of Pathway’s services will be managed by a central System Support unit
responsible for system and network management.

The system privileges and access permissions required to perform management functions are
considerably higher than those assigned to normal users. Pathway will therefore ensure that:

¢ staff assigned to management functions are carefully selected,

¢ physical and logical access controls are clearly defined and rigorously
implemented,

individuals are not granted unnecessary privileges,

separation of duties is achieved whenever appropriate,

individuals are held accountable for all system changes,

the ability to grant and modify access permission is controlled, and
all significant system changes are recorded.

8.2. Audit Management

Pathway will ensure that:

all security critical events are time stamped and recorded,
auditable events are carefully selected to minimise overheads,
audit trail information is protected from modification,

audit trails include a record of all significant system changes,

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 28-MAY-2002

¢ effective audit analysis reduction and analysis tools are used,
e all observed system irregularities are investigated, and
¢ audit trails are archived and stored for an agreed duration.

8.3 Systems Development and Maintenance

Pathway will ensure that system security, considered at the requirements analysis stage, fully
reflects the business value of the information assets involved. The analysis will consider:

e identification and authentication of human and system “users”,

© control of access to information and services,

© segregation of duties,

© secure operation in degraded mode,

© incorporation and analysis of audit trails,

¢ data and system integrity protection,

© use of encryption to prevent unauthorised disclosure of data, and

e system resilience, including operation in fall-back mode and recovery.

All software developed by or for Pathway will be specified and implemented using proven
methodologies, taking care to ensure that:

© input data validation is comprehensive and reliable,
© processing protects against errors and attacks, and
integrity checking is performed where appropriate.

Pathway will ensure that software development activities are fully supported by procedures
and standards that cover all aspects of the development process. Audits and reviews will be
conducted to ensure that the procedures are being applied effectively and that the supporting
documentation meets approved standards. Security testing will provide confirmation that the
security functionality of the systems has been implemented to meet the agreed security
specifications.

Assurance during development will be supported by the definition of security requirements,
security architecture, detailed security design, design reviews and security testing.

Design and specification changes will be reviewed to ensure they do not compromise the
security of the systems.

All software will be subject to appropriate acceptance procedures prior to integration with
other components.

8.4 Malicious Software Control Policy

Pathway will analyse threats associated with malicious software and, where appropriate, will
implement effective controls. These controls will include virus prevention, virus detection and
appropriate user awareness procedures.

8.5 Information Exchange Control

Pathway will define, agree and enforce (with relevant parties) procedures for the exchange of
information handled electronically and by other means. The procedures used will comply with
legal and contractual requirements and will depend upon the sensitivity of the information.

In particular, the exchange of information, with POL, will be subject to formally agreed
controls.

8.6 Control of Proprietary Software
Proprietary software will only be used within the terms of the licence conditions.
Unauthorised copying of software and documentation will be prohibited.

Pathway will not permit any modified or non-standard software components to be
incorporated unless the modifications have been applied and validated by the normal supplier,
and approved by Pathway’s Security Manager.

Pathway’s configuration management system will maintain an inventory of all proprietary
software used by their services.

8.7 External Contractors and Suppliers

Pathway will ensure that appropriate safeguards cover the use of external contractors and
suppliers. This will include agreements with contractual terms and conditions and checks on
the integrity of external contractors before any work is assigned to them.

External personnel will not be allowed access to any classified information without prior
written authority from the information owner and completion of a non-disclosure agreement.

Suppliers of goods and services (including Escher and Oracle) will be subject to formal
agreements in support of this security policy. Individual agreements with suppliers of standard
COTS components are not required.

Evidence of the adequacy of suppliers’ security procedures will be sought where externally
supplied goods or services are used to process critical and/or sensitive information.

9.0 Business Continuity

Pathway will ensure that an effective business continuity plan is agreed with Horizon Security
Liaison staff and implemented to reduce the risks from deliberate or accidental threats to deny
access to vital services or information.

Plans will be developed to enable internal operations and business services to be maintained
following failure or damage to vital services, facilities or information. All relevant security
provisions will be maintained, even if degraded conditions are in effect.

9.1 Contingency Planning

In order to minimise any disruption to the services managed by Pathway, contingency plans
will be developed to encompass:

© operating in fall-back mode, and
© recovery (or Business Resumption) to full operational status.

9.2 Testing Contingency Plans

All contingency plans will be tested on a regular basis under representative operational
conditions.

9.3 Subcontractor’s Contingency Plans

Contingency arrangements will be examined and managed to ensure that risks are minimised,
wherever Pathway is dependent upon subcontractors (or third parties), for essential services or
supplies.

10.0 Compliance

Pathway is required to comply with legislative requirements and commercial standards.
