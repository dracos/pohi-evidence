Dear Richard,

Further to our exchange of emails today, I attach a revised version of the draft fax dealing with
Mr Castleton's "experts" reports. If you have any comments, please let me have them. I'd like
to bat this out to the other side as soon as possible to strengthen our case.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.
