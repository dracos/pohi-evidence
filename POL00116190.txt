Themes from Improvement Workstream &

Contact with branch

*Lack of awareness of the branch network by the people engaging with our branches

«Inconsistency of what information is captured during a branch contact

+Lack of confidence in quality and timing of Management Information provided to make contact with branches, leading to concerns that
contact does not add value to branch.

Branch Support

-Activity with a branch is often re-active and is a result of a problem rather than being proactive to prevent re-occurring problems

*Lack of understanding of what information is available to measure performance of branches

Inconsistency in the level of ownership between teams when trying to support branches with issues

+Subpostmasters are using informal networks to get support such as chat-rooms and twitter to find advice on losses and transactions
Perception that branches don’t want to report problems with accounts in case of suspension

*NFSP have raised specific issues regarding how we support absentee subpostmasters

*Lack of understanding of what analysis is completed following outbound contact with branch to understand what benefit it's had for
branch or for improving support/performance.

«Concerns that individual IT platforms used are out of date and unsupported.

Ownership and awareness

-Lack of consistent vision regarding the purpose of the team

*Teams are unaware of how branches perceive them and the service they provide

*Lack of quality measures within teams to measure the experience of the branch during the contact

*Lack of awareness of the role they play in the overall experience of the branch with Post Office

-An individual issue has also been identified during the initial discussions with Finance Service Centre regarding the contract with
Santander. Whilst they are contractually obliged to resolve discrepancies within 3 weeks, they are in arrears and are currently resolving
errors in Week 53. These errors are largely credits which are owed back to branch.

Training

View that the content of the training is not fit for purpose and does not meet the needs of the branches (validated by satisfaction survey)
«Specific branch cases demonstrate a lack of “Problem Management” ownership to understand and explain the technical problems being
faced by a branch

«Inconsistency or training provided to teams dealing with branches, including lack of documentation to capture what they are supposed to
be doing

Cross team working/one view

*Lack of communication across IT platforms used across the business.

+Lack of join up between teams to understand the issues facing particular branches and the network

*Lack of communication with other teams, especially in resolving issues
