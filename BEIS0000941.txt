1. Following discrepancies discovered between the Police National Computer (PNC) data
and court record data, we are gathering court records for every case. HMCTS have

continued to work with convicting courts to retrieve and supply these records.

2. The Court of Appeal have sent their first return to us, detailing whether they have
previously considered 258 Crown Court convictions against 39 individuals, meaning that
we can begin to send out our first letters covering in scope convictions for Crown Court

cases. A second batch of cases was sent to the Court of Appeal on 8 August.

3. We are now aware of 40 individuals that were not on our ‘known’ list of cases and have

been noted as Self Identifiers.

4. We have received HMRC data for cases where employment data was previously missing
to help the caseworkers evidence certain conditions in the Act.

NEXT STEPS FOR WIC 12 AUGUST

5. We will continue to work with the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) to see if they
hold any information which will help us to locate the remaining court records. The NPCC
have sent a request out to local forces and we will work with HMCTS to continue

searches based on any new information received.

6. The Court of Appeal will continue their assessment of whether any individuals have had
their conviction upheld or refused leave to appeal at the Court of Appeal (and so out of
scope of the Act) on further batches that we send them so we can send out letters to

individuals who were convicted in the Crown Court.
7. The casework team will begin to gather information for the self-identified cases.
