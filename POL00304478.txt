| spoken to Rodric. The interim answer to SS' question is:

V As requested at the WG meeting Post Office are asked to produce a formal certification that it is not
possible for anyone to access Horizon/HOL and amend transaction data without the knowledge of the
Subpostmaster or their staff.

"It is not clear what is meant by "formal certification" but enquiries have been made of senior personnel at

Fujitsu and in Post Office's IT team. There is no functionality in the Horizon system (through either a front-end

terminal or back-end server) to edit or delete transaction data once it has been transmitted from a branch to

the central branch data centre. The transmission of this data is encrypted, transferred to the branch data
centre and then stored in a separate audit server where they are sealed using industry standard secure
protocols to ensure the data's integrity. Although it is possible to input additional transactions into a branch's
accounts (eg. by way of say a transaction correction), a SPMR will always have visibility of these extra
transactions as they are shown separately in the branch's accounts. A more detailed note will follow on this
subject but this won't be ready before the Factfile needs to be submitted".

Have you had a chance to look at the attached note? SS are now pushing for this answer so that they can build it into
the factfile so we need an answer asap.
The question posed by SS is:

V As requested at the WG meeting Post Office are asked to produce a formal certification that it is not

possible for anyone to access Horizon/HOL and amend transaction data without the knowledge of the

Subpostmaster or their staff.
| wonder if, as a holding response, we could say:
"It is not clear what is meant by "formal certification" but enquiries have been made of senior personnel at Fujitsu and

First draft of the note attached — thoughts?

I've intentionally not referred to the "Winn/Lusher" email as it distracts from what is otherwise a very clear picture.

| suggest that you, me and FJ get the attached doc near to final form before we escalate to Angela, Chris and Belinda
for approval. It is probably then best that this document is sent by Angela to SS.

My hope is that this will hopefully put this matter to bed with SS and we will not need to escalate to the WG. However,
we'll not know that answer until we see the SS thematic report.

Subject: RE: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege
Rodric,

Please see Fujitsu’s response below.

Summary:

Y There is no ability to delete or change records a branch creates in either old Horizon or Horizon online.
Transactions in both systems are created in a secure and auditable way to assure integrity, and have either a
checksum (Old Horizon) or a digital signature (Horizon Online), are time stamped, have a unique sequential
number and are securely stored via the core audit process in the audit vault

Y Whilst a facility exists to ‘inject’ additional transactions in the event of a system error, these transactions would
have a signature that is unique, sub-postmaster id’s are not used and the audit log would house a record of
these. As above, this does not delete or amend original transactions but creates a new and additional
transactions

V This facility is built into the system to enable corrections to be made if a system error / bug is identified and the
master database needs updating as a result, this is not a unique feature of Horizon

V Approvals to ‘inject’ new transactions are governed by the change process, 2 factor authentications and a ‘four
eyes’ process. A unique identifier is created and can be audited for this type of transaction within HNGX,
Horizon would require more extensive work to investigate as explained below.

1. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? No

2. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? Once
created, branch transaction data cannot be changed, only additional data can be inserted. If this is required,
the additional transactions would be visible on the trading statements but would not require
acknowledgement / approval by a sub-postmaster, the approval is given by Post Office via the change
process. In response to a previous query Fujitsu checked last year when this was done on Horizon Online and
we found only one occurrence in March 2010 which was early in the pilot for Horizon Online and was covered
POL00304478
POL00304478

by an appropriate change request from Post Office and an auditable log. For Old Horizon, a detailed
examination of archived data would have to be undertaken to look into this across the lifetime of use. This
would be a significant and complex exercise to undertake and discussed previously with Post Office but
discounted as too costly and impractical.

3. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion? See Answer 2
4. If so:

a) How does this happen? See above

b) Why was this functionality built into the system design? To allow for data to be corrected if there were
any defects found in the system

c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality? As above and under instructions from Post Office Ltd.

d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access? This is achieved
through a number of industry standard controls (RBAC, 2 factor authentication etc) which are
robustly audited under ISO 27001 / IAS 3402, Link, PCI.

e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past? See above

5. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

a) What is "message store"?This is the repository (or database) where all transactions were written to in
the old Horizon system

b) Can this be used to access and change branch records? /t can be used to access the records. Data
cannot be changed, but new data could be inserted into it. Any such inserted data would be tightly
controlled by operational processes explained above.

c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records? The impact would depend on exactly what
records were inserted.

d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change? Yes, via the trading statement but spm’s are not
required to approve the change, this is provided by Post Office.

e) Why would this method of access be used? To correct errors if a software defect is identified.

f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access? As above.

Subject: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege

James,

Could Fujitsu please answer the questions below so that we can respond to a specific challenge put to us by Second
Sight in connection with a Mediation Scheme complaint, namely that:

"the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward [...] explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the
figures in the branches without the SPMs’ knowledge or authority".

The Winn/Lusher email is attached. The part of the email in question is:
POL00304478
POL00304478

“Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in
place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu these controls form the
core of our court defence if we get to that stage.”
Questions:

6. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?

7. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?
8. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion?
9. If so:

a) How does this happen?
b) Why was this functionality built into the system design?
c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality?
d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access?
e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past?
10. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

a) What is "message store"?
b) Can this be used to access and change branch records?
c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records?
d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change?
e) Why would this method of access be used?
f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access?
Please let me know if it would be easier to address these in a phone call in the first instance.
