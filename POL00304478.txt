 I spoken to Rodric. The interim answer to SS' question is:
         V As requested at the WG meeting Post Office are asked to produce a formal certification that it is not
              possible for anyone to access Horizon/HOL and amend transaction data without the knowledge of the
              Subpostmaster or their staff.
            is :not clear what is meant oy "formal certification" but: enquir ies have been made of senior oersonnel at
         Fujitsu and in Pest Off ce`; IT team. There is no functionality in the Horizon  izoon system (through either a front-end
         terminal or ba k >..nd server) to edit or delete transaction data once ._ has been transmitted front a branch to
         the central branch data centre. The transmission of this data is encr'pted, transferred to the branch data
         centr., .and then stared in a separate audit server where they are sealed using industry siandardd s.:.ore
         pro cools to ensure the data's integrity. Although it fs i. ossible.e to input adciit,ona t an saction.s into ._ br:anch's
         sccounts (e F.. by `^day of say a transaction correction). a SPMR will always have visibility of these        extra
         transaci:ions as they are shown separately in the 1" a€nch s account . A n1ore detailed note- will follow on this
                                                                                                                   .

Subject: RE: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege
Rodric,
Please see Fujitsu's response below.
Summary:
    V There is no ability to delete or change records a branch creates in either old Horizon or Horizon online.
        Transactions in both systems are created in a secure and auditable way to assure integrity, and have either a
        checksum (Old Horizon) or a digital signature (Horizon Online), are time stamped, have a unique sequential
        number and are securely stored via the core audit process in the audit vault
    V Whilst a facility exists to 'inject' additional transactions in the event of a system error, these transactions would
        have a signature that is unique, sub-postmaster id's are not used and the audit log would house a record of
        these. As above, this does not delete or amend original transactions but creates a new and additional
        transactions
    V This facility is built into the system to enable corrections to be made if a system error / bug is identified and the
        master database needs updating as a result, this is not a unique feature of Horizon
    V Approvals to 'inject' new transactions are governed by the change process, 2 factor authentications and a 'four
        eyes' process. A unique identifier is created and can be audited for this type of transaction within HNGX,
        Horizon would require more extensive work to investigate as explained below.
      1. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? No

          2. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? Once
          created, branch transaction data cannot be changed, only additional data con be inserted, if this is required,
          the additional transactions would be visible on the trading statements but would not require
          acknowledgement / approval by a sub-postmaster, the approval is given by Post Office via the change
          process. In response to a previous query Fujitsu checked last year when this was done on Horizon Online and
          we found only one occurrence in March 2010 which was early in the pilot for Horizon Online and was covered

Subject: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege
James,
Could Fujitsu please answer the questions below so that we can respond to a specific challenge put to us by Second
Sight in connection with a Mediation Scheme complaint, namely that:
"the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward 1...] explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the
figures in the branches without the SPMs' knowledge or authority".
The Winn/Lusher email is attached. The part of the email in question is:
                                                                                                               POL00304478
                                                                                                             POL00304478




"Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in
place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu these controls form the
core of our court defence if we get to that stage."
Questions:
       6. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?

       7. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?

       8. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion?

       9. If so:

             a) How does this happen?
             b) Why was this functionality built into the system design?
             c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality?
             d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access?
             e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past?
       10. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

            a) What is "message store"?
            b) Can this be used to access and change branch records?
            c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records?
            d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change?
            e) Why would this method of access be used?
            f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access?
Please let me know if it would be easier to address these in a phone call in the first instance.
Kind regards, Rodric
