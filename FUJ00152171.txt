1.0 Introduction

Prima facie evidence to be presented in support of criminal prosecutions is obtained solely
from the Horizon System Audit Server. This computer output is admissible in evidence
provided that the integrity of the system can be demonstrated if required. On some
occasions it may be necessary to provide "honest" certification of computer generated
evidence or provide "expert" witness.

There is an additional requirement to produce witness statements in support of Post office
instigated prosecutions.

2.0 Scope

This process describes the production of computer evidence originating within the Horizon
system to support criminal prosecutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This
process also identifies secondary evidence, which may be required to demonstrate the
integrity of the system and the information contained within it.

This process also describes the required content of witness statements produced in support
of evidence submitted to the Courts.

3.0 Production and Retention of Computer Evidence

4.0 Certification

4.1 Certificates

Traditionally, PACE certificates are signed by a senior member of the Computer
Operations staff responsible for managing the computer installation and its associated
networks. ICL Outsourcing performs this role as a managed service for ICL Pathway,

The certificate (see example at Appendix A) contains a declaration including the
statement “/ sign this certificate knowing that I shall be liable for prosecution if I
have stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true”, it is

therefore in his rational self-interest to ensure a) that the logs are adequately
comprehensive and b) that they are investigated thoroughly.

Certification Process

The manager of the ICL Pathway Fraud Risk Management team, or his deputy, will
advise a nominated member of ICL Outsourcing of the relevant dates and times for
which a PACE certificate is required. The ICL Outsourcing nominee will consult
operational records pertaining to computer and network operations on the dates and
times advised, in order to satisfy himself that the certificate can be signed with
confidence. A statement should accompany the certificate to the effect that additional
(supporting) evidence to uphold the certificate can be produced if so desired. To offer
all the evidence without it being requested would only serve to flood the courtroom
with documentation.

Supporting Evidence
Requirement

In order to demonstrate the integrity of a Horizon PACE certificate for the Benefit
Payment Service, it is necessary to describe the information flow from CAPS to OPS
and from OPS to the FCMS and to illustrate where cryptographic and integrity
protection are applied.

Types of Evidence

Given the size and complexity of the Horizon system, it is conceivable that the integrity
of the PACE certificate will be challenged by Counsel in order to discredit a
prosecution. If it is not possible to demonstrate the certificate’s integrity to the Court’s
satisfaction, a very dangerous precedent will have been set and all subsequent
prosecutions will be automatically jeopardised. However, the corollary is also true and
a successful demonstration of honest certification will stand all subsequent
prosecutions in good stead.

Comprehensive records pertaining to the site(s), services and individuals concerned
should be able to be produced for all material times. These records will serve to show
that the relevant services were available at all material times, were operating properly
and had not been used inappropriately.

This secondary evidence should include, but is not restricted to, the following (

I have been employed by ICL Pathway for x months. I have been employed as IT Security Analyst
esponsible for Audit Data Extraction and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer
system known as Horizon, which is the computer system used by Post Office Counters Ltd. I am
authorised by ICL Pathway Ltd to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system.

Prior to the system being introduced, Post Offices ran a weekly manual or electronic cash balance
n a counter register system. This was the system in which all transactions performed by counter
clerks would be entered on a daily basis onto their weekly balance sheets or input into their
computer systems. At the end of the accounting period they would amalgamate the daily
ransactions, include their stock and cash on hand and arrive at a balance.

IA new system has been introduced within the Post Office Counters Offices and this is known as
Horizon. Each counter position has a computer terminal, a visual display unit and a keyboard and

inter. This individual system records all transactions input by the counter clerk working at that

ounter position. Each clerk logs on to the system by using a series of passwords. The transactions
jperformed by each clerk, and the associated cash and stock level information are recorded by the
Icomputer system in a stock unit. Once logged on, any transactions performed by the clerk must be

ecorded and entered on the computer and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.
[The Horizon system consistently records time in GMT and therefore takes no account of Civil Time
IDisplacements. The clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual display
nits is however configured to indicate local time.

(The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input into it.
t enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Post Office
Counters Limited e.g. National Savings Bank, Giro, Driving Licence Agency and Pension and
Allowances. The Horizon system also enables the clerk to produce a weekly balance of cash and
stock on hand combined with the other transactions performed in that accounting period.

[The system also allows for information to be transferred to the main accounting department at
Chesterfield in order for the Office accounts to be balanced.

(Continuation of Statement of:

[The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter applications:
the Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertains the validity of Benefit Agency order books
before payment is made; the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables PostMasters to
conduct general retail trade at the counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the
Automated Payments Service (APS) provides support for utility companies and others who provide
incremental in-payment mechanisms based on the use of cards and other tokens and the Logistics
[Feeder Service (LFS) which supports the management of cash and value stock movements to and
from the outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in outlets.

[The counter desktop service and the office platform service on which it runs provides various
common functions for transaction recording and settlement as well as user access control and
session management. Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then
replicated automatically to databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The
information is then forwarded over ISDN (or other communication service) to databases on a set of
central Correspondence Servers at the ICL Pathway Datacentres. This is undertaken by a messaging
transport system within the Transaction Management Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer
information to Central Servers that control the flow of information to various support services
including the Pathway Data Warehouse where an historic record of all data is stored.

Details of outlet transactions are normally sent at least daily via the system. Details relating to the
loutlet's stock holding and cash account are sent weekly. Details are then forwarded daily via a file
transfer service to the Post Office accounting Department at Chesterfield and also, where
appropriate, to other Post Office Clients.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS (the TMS journal) is taken daily by copying all new
Imessages to archive media. This creates a record of all original outlet transaction details including
lits origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
(TMS journal is maintained at each of the ICL Pathway Datacentre sites and is created by securely
replicating all transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They therefore provide the ability
to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded in two places to verify that
systems were operating correctly. All exceptions are investigated and reconciled. Records of all
transactions are written to Digital Linear Tape (DLT) audit archive media. When information
relating to individual transactions is requested, the tapes are loaded onto Audit Servers and the data
extracted via Audit Workstations. Information is presented in exactly the same way as the data held
lin the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of information requested.

IWhere data is stored on a computer, there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the
information is inaccurate because of improper use of the computer, and at all material times the
computer was operating properly or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly or was
lout of operation was not such as to affect the production of audit records or accuracy of their
contents.

(Continuation of Statement of:

(The integrity of audit data is guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and retrieval to
subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been established that provide assurances to PostI
(Office Internal Audit (POIA) that this integrity is maintained.

[During audit data extractions the following controls apply:

1. Extractions can only be made through the three Audit Workstations (AWs), which exist at ICL
Pathway, Forest Road, Feltham Middlesex and the two Data Centres at ICL, Quayside Centre,
Westwood Park, Wigan WN3 5GB and ICL, Bridal Road, Bootle GIR OAA . These are all
subject to rigorous physical security controls appropriate to that location. Specifically, the
Feltham AW — where most extractions take place — is located in a secure room subject to
proximity pass access within a secured ICL site.

2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is controlled by dedicated Logins, password
control and utilises the Microsoft Windows NT and Pathway security features defined in the
overall Horizon security policy.

3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Requests for Information
(RFIs), authorised by nominated persons within POIA. This log can be scrutinised on the AW.

4. Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.

a

Upon receipt of an RFI from POIA they are interpreted by Pathway Internal Audit. The details
are checked and the printed request filed.

The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.
Using the above information the relevant archive tapes are identified.

A request to load the tapes at the Data Centre is made.

SC eS

Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to DLT (Digital Linear
Tape) and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

10. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the DLT the checksum seal for the file is re-
calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original value calculated when the file
was originally written to the DLT. The result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

11. The specific RFI details are used to obtain the specific data.

12. The files are copied to the AW where they are checked and converted into the file type required
by POIA.

13. The requested information is copied onto removal CD media, sealed to prevent modification and
virus checked using the latest software. It is then despatched to the POCL (Post Office Counters
Limited) Audit Manager or Investigations Manager using Royal Mail Special Delivery. This
ensures that a receipt is provided to ICL Pathway confirming delivery.
