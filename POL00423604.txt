1 « Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the
implementation of controls ensuring Post Office meets it Whistleblowing obligations.
Whistleblowing is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post Office
board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
management of Whistleblowing throughout the Group’. It is one of a set of policies which
provide a clear risk and governance framework and an effective system of internal control
for the management of risk across the Group. Compliance with these policies supports the
Group in meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders, staff?
and other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

“Whistleblowing” refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing and/or
dangerous practices by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or to an
external party. A whistleblower is a person who raises a genuine concern in relation to
any wrongdoing, this includes criminal activity, regulatory breaches, miscarriages of
justice, damage to the environment, financial impropriety, reputational damage, any
breach of legal or professional obligations, dangers to health and safety and the deliberate
attempt to conceal it. In order to encourage Whistleblowing and provide appropriate
protections to whistleblowers, the governance arrangements described in this Policy are
based upon the following core principles:

* To encourage the reporting of any concerns as soon as possible in the knowledge that
Post Office will take all concerns raised seriously and investigate fully, and that the
confidentiality of all individuals will be respected;

« To provide guidance as to how to raise those concerns;

e To provide whistleblowers reassurance that all genuine concerns are raised without
fear of reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken;

e Post Office is committed to and oversees the implementation of the Policy in line with
the Group’s risk appetite. The Policy and associated procedures (set out or referred to
in this document) are proportionate to the risks and complexity of the Group;

e Post Office undertakes a training and awareness program to ensure employees are
aware of the Whistleblowing policy and procedure.

‘In this Policy “Post Office” and “Group” mean Post Office Limited and any wholly owned subsidiary.

2. In this Policy “staff” means POL or Group's permanent, temporary and fixed term employees, workers including temporary
workers, agency workers (where the terms on which they are engaged are not substantially determined by them),
contractors, consultants and anyone else working under a contract with Post Office, in all cases having regard to s.230(3)
and s. 43K ERA 1996

POL00423604

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all staff within the Group and outlines the manner in which
Post Office will encourage, receive and investigate incidents of whistleblowing and the
protections provided for whistleblowers by law.

In order to encourage reporting of wrongdoing, Post Office will, where appropriate, and
to the extent possible, follow equivalent principles to encourage, receive and investigate
incidents of whistleblowing by Postmasters, Agent Assistants, and members of the public
and will not subject any such persons to any detriment (including the termination of any
contract or relationship with Post Office) for raising a genuine whistleblowing concern in
an appropriate manner.

1.5. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements
including (but not limited to) the following legislation as amended or supplemented from
time to time:

e Employment Rights Act 1996
« Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998

1.6. Protecting the Whistleblower (Your Legal Rights)

Post Office has a statutory obligation to protect whistleblowers and will support any
individual person who raises genuine concerns under this Policy in an appropriate
manner, even if they turn out to be mistaken. In respect of a certain class of person
(broadly “staff” as defined under this policy) Post Office has a statutory obligation not to
subject such persons to detriment or to dismiss them for whistleblowing.

Where a member of staff is subject to a Post Office settlement agreement, any clauses
within it will not prevent the member of staff from whistleblowing. This should in any
event be made clear by the terms of the settlement agreement itself and staff should
receive independent advice in relation to those terms when entering into a settlement
agreement.

Post Office will, at all times, respect the confidentiality and protect the whistleblower’s

identity, however:

e It may be necessary in the course of an investigation to share this information with a
relevant stakeholder (e.g. an investigator).

e There is no requirement for a whistleblower to provide personal contact information,
but not providing this information may reduce Post Office’s ability to undertake a
thorough investigation into the concerns raised.

Post Office will take all reasonable steps to ensure that whistleblowers do not suffer any
detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern in an appropriate manner.
Detrimental treatment includes disciplinary action, dismissal, threats or other
unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. Serious action, typically
disciplinary action, is likely to be be taken against any individual who threatens or
retaliates against whistleblowers in any way.

If a whistleblower believes that they have suffered any such treatment, they should

inform the Whistleblowing Officer immediately. The Whistleblowing Officer should take
steps to address any victimisation, which may include working with the HR team to put

Internal and External Page 4 of 17 [FILENAME \* MERGEFORMAT ]

POL-BSFF-0238419_ 0003
POL00423604

POL00423604

appropriate measures in place. If the matter is not addressed the whistleblower (where
they are staff) should raise it formally using Post Office’s Grievance procedure.

In all cases the whistleblower’s concerns will be treated sensitively and in confidence.

1.7 The Whistleblowing Officer

Post Office has appointed the General Counsel as the Whistleblo' ing Officer who can be
[HYPERLINK "mailto:whistleblowingi""GRo

The role of the Whistleblowing Officer is to receive all internal reports raised, regardless
of the channel used, review any concerns raised and determine the best course of
action, if any. They may ask for further information in order to make this decision.

The Whistleblowing Officer is also responsible for ensuring that reports are investigated
and responded to in a timely manner. They are responsible for determining the
appropriate parties who should investigate the allegations raised, taking into account the
sensitivities and seriousness of the report and the need to protect the whistleblower.

The Whistleblowing Officer is also responsible for identifying key trends or issues, and
providing assurance to the Board that the policy is complied with.

1.8 How to Report Whistleblowing

Post Office supports and promotes a number of ways to provide reporting mechanisms:
* Direct to the Whistle PERLINK

e Via a complaint to a fr .g. customer complaints, NBSC and Grapevine.
These may be verbal or written communications.

e Contacting the “Speak Up” line, a confidential reporting service which is run by an
independent company NAVEX Global (formerly Expolink Europe Ltd)

Col he Speak Up line are:

[ HYPERLINK
"https://secure.ethicspoint.eu/domain/en/report_custom.asp?clientid=106826" ] which is
a secure on-line web portal

What should be reported?
Whistleblowers should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, certain wrongdoing
which affects others (e.g. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the Post Office).
The following lists some examples (this is a non-exhaustive list) of situations where an
individual may raise a concern:

« Where Post Office or the Group is in breach of any legal obligation to which it is
subject (usually a statutory rather than a contractual legal obligation)
Financial Crime including Fraud, Money Laundering and financing of terrorism,
Giving, offering or taking of bribes,
Financial mismanagement, Tax evasion and Misreporting
Racial, sexual, disability or other discrimination (Improper Behaviour) ,
Practices that could put individuals or the environment at risk,
Breach of Post Office internal policies and procedures
Concerns about slavery or human trafficking?, and

° More information in relation to Modern Slavery can be found here - [ HYPERLINK

POL-BSFF-0238419_ 0004
POL00423604

POL00423604

e Any conduct likely to damage Post Office’s reputation

This policy should not be used by staff wishing to raise complaints relating to their own
personal circumstances, such as the way they have been treated at work. Grievances and
matters such as bullying and harassment should be raised in accordance with the
procedures set out in the appropriate HR policy.

If an individual is uncertain about whether something is within the scope of this Policy they
should seek advice from the Whistleblowing Officer, whose contact details are set out in
this Policy.

1.9 Responding to Whistleblowing Reports

In all instances any whistleblowing reports, regardless of reporting method, will be
responded to within 5 working days and passed onto the Whistleblowing Officer.

All reports will be fully reviewed and investigated and any information, including emails,
or records of telephone calls, letters, or any other form of communication stored
securely and confidentially.

The time frame for investigating the reports raised is dependent on the nature of the
report and the investigation required, however, the whistleblower will be given feedback
via the reporting channel they have used, or have given the Whistleblowing Officer
permission to use (Speak Up line, e-mail or phone call) during the investigation and once
it has been concluded.

The whistleblower may be kept informed of any action taken, however, this information
may be limited if it is required to keep the confidence of other people.

Where a report received is anonymous, whistleblowers will not ordinarily be able to
receive feedback and details of action taken by Post Office may be limited.

1.10 External Disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating
and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases individuals should not
find it necessary to alert anyone externally.

However, the law recognises that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for
individuals to report their concerns to an external body such as a regulator. It will rarely,
if ever, be appropriate to alert the media at least without informing Post Office or an
external agency first and usually in that order.

We strongly encourage individuals to seek advice before reporting a concern to anyone
external. The independent Whistleblowing charity, Protect (formerly Public Concern at
Work) have a list of prescribed regulators for reporting certain types of concerns. Their
contact details are as follows:

Website: [ HYPERLINK "http://www.pcaw.org.uk/advice" ]-line/

Protect operates free, confidential advice to people concerned about crime, danger or
wrongdoing in the workplace. All Protect advisors are legally trained and supervised by
qualified lawyers and their advice is fully confidential and subject to legal privilege. All

POL-BSFF-0238419 0005
POL00423604
POL00423604

information, including emails, or records of telephone calls, letters, or any other form of
communication with Protect advisors is stored in a fully encrypted format.

Post Office Management Services (POMS) is directly regulated by the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA), Post Office Limited is an appointed representative of Bank of Ireland
(UK) Limited. As such individuals may decide to whistleblow directly to the FCA, and can
do so by using one of the following channels.

E-mail: [ HYPERLINK "mailto:whistle
Website: [ HYPERLINK "http://www. fca.org.uk/site-info/contact/whistleblowing" ]

Address: Intelligence Department (Ref PIDA), Financial Conduct Authority, 12 Endeavour
Square, London, E20 1JN

Whistleblowing concerns usually relate to the conduct of our staff, but they may
sometimes relate to the actions of a third party, such as a customer, supplier, agent,
Postmaster or service provider. In some circumstances the law will protect individuals if
they raise the matter with the third party directly. However, we encourage individuals to
report such concerns internally in the first instance.

2 « Risk Appetite and Minimum — Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has*:

« Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

e verse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

e verse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

e Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organisation

« Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented an action may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of policies and procedures, on a risk sensitive approach
which are subject to an annual review. The policy suite is designed to comply with
applicable legislation and regulation. The Whistleblowing Policy should be considered and
read in conjunction with other policies where relevant. These may include the Financial
Crime Policy, the Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, Health & Safety Policies and HR Policies
where relevant.

2.3. Who Must Comply?

All third parties who do business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and
business and franchise partners, will be required to agree contractually to this policy or
have their own equivalent policy.

Any investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy which is
available on the Post Office Intranet

“ The Risk appetite was agreed by the Groups Board January 2015

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

POL00423604
POL00423604

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each impacted business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum
control standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks
are managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:
