Statement of Information

The prosecutor has requested that the Court proceed to confiscation under Section 6 (3(a)), of the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (hereinafter called the Act)

It is considered appropriate for the court to proceed under Section 6(4), as it is believed that the
defendant has a criminal lifestyle as defined, and that it is therefore appropriate for the Court to
make the assumptions under Section 10 of the Act in determining the defendant's benefit. The
defendant is believed to have a criminal lifestyle as-

The defendant has been convicted of an offence committed over at least six months and
the benefit is at least £5,000 (Sections 75(2)(c),75(4)

« between the 1 day of January 2007 and the 20" day of August 2008 at Ibstock Post Office
stole £43,894.15 belonging to Post Office Limited

The Court is therefore required to decide if the defendant has a criminal lifestyle. If the court decides
the defendant has a criminal lifestyle it is required to decide if he has benefited from her general
criminal conduct. If the court decides the defendant does not have a criminal lifestyle the court must
decide if she has benefited from her particular criminal conduct

This is the statement of information dealing with all matters relevant by G Harbinson an Accredited
Financial Investigator into the financial affairs of Susan Jane Rudkin (hereinafter referred to as the
defendant) for the purposes of establishing

a) The benefit derived by the defendant

b) The nature of the defendant's available property, so far as it is known to me,
from which any Confiscation Order made by the Court may be satisfied.

Civil Proceedings
No civil proceedings have been commenced by the victim against the defendant.

Extent of Benefit from Criminal Conduct

Benefit derived from Charges

The total amount of benefit obtained by this defendant as a result of the offences in these
proceedings is calculated as follows:

Benefit derived as a result of the offences as charged

a) Benefit as a result of the theft. £43,894.15
Benefit as a result of or in connection with the crime

b) The gross turnover of the business during the relevant period £266,565.99

oc) Total benefit £310,460.14

The calculation of benefit (b) derived by the defendant has been made on the basis of the judgement of
Lord Justice Leveson in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in the matter of R v Neuberg [2007]
EWCA CRIM 1994 and Lord Justice Aikens in the Supreme Court of Judicature Court of Appeal
(Criminal Division) in the matter of R v SEAGER [2009] EWCA CRIM 1303 namely, that the benefit is
the grass income or turnover of the business for the period specified in the count on the indictment.

Calculation of Benefit

a) = the loss recorded at audit and the charge (Contrary to Section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968)
94

POL00052020

POL00052020

6) = (The gross turnover of the retail outlet at from 4th
January 2007 to 20" August 2008) minus (The Sup-postmasters pay from January 2007 to July
2008) minus (the audit loss- minus- the M&S Money payments from 25” January 2007 to 11°
August 2008)

= a)+b)

Therefore a) = £43,894,15

Therefore b) = (E444,646,30)-(E13 7,351.15) - (43,894.15 - £3,164,99) = (£266,565.99)
Therefore c) = £43,894.15 + £266,565. 99= £310, 460.14

The calculation of the benefit derived by the defendant has been made on the basis of the
judgement of Mr Justice McCulloch in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, in the
matter of R v K (TLR 01/10/1990), namely, that the benefit is the value of the property obtained.

This judgement has been followed by the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, in the matter of R v
John Adeyemi Layode, Court of Appeal, Criminal Division 12 March 1993.

Assumptions

Property transferred to the defendant after the relevant date

I have not scheduled any accounts showing unidentified lodgements within bank accounts held by
the defendant in this case. This is because although the Court may decide under section 1:2 of this
statement that the defendant in this case has by definition a “Criminal Lifestyle” the prosecution is
content that the benefit that the defendant has obtained from her criminal conduct is wholly

detailed in the defendants “Particular Criminal Conduct” of this statement and in this circumstance
there may be a serious risk of injustice if this assumption was made.

Property held at any time after the date of conviction

Uhave not scheduled any property held in this case. This is because i.
“(Title Number was purchased in November 2000. However the payments

I gairist the mortgage account for the property came from accoun
GRO} and into which criminal! property was placed and as such it may be that the court considers
the equity in the property benefit from crime.

Expenditure incurred after the relevant date

I have not scheduled any accounts showing expenditure within bank accounts held by the defendant
in this case. This is because although the Court may decide under section 1:2 of this statement that
the defendant in this case has by definition a “Criminal Lifestyle” the prosecution is content that the
benefit that the defendant has obtained from his criminal conduct is wholly detailed in the
defendants “Particular Criminal Conduct” of this statement and in this circumstance there may be a
serious risk of injustice if this assumption was made.
