1. Introduction

Currently there are a number of documents that describe the interfaces and
agreements made between ICL Pathway and POCL for change management of
Operational Business Changes laid down in [reference 10] — Service Matrix and
requirements for OBC product. There is a need to formally baseline these
documents under the contract. This interface agreement will incorporate the
agreements and become a contractually controlled document.. The working level
documents for OBC will comply with the agreements in this interface agreement.

This document exists in parallel with the OBC Requirements, Service Matrices /
Service Descriptions [ref 10].

2. Intent of this Agreement

The intent of the agreement is:

« To establish effective co-operation between ICL Pathway and POCL in the
delivery of Operational Business Change - Product, to the Post Office
counters

e Agree responsibilities and detail the interactions which must take place,
between POCL and ICL Pathway, to ensure the successful delivery of
changes within the Post Office retail network

This agreement is for the duration of Core System Release (fomerly known as New
Release 2) and will be reviewed at the end of Live Trial.

3. Scope

This document specifies how product change will be achieved through the
application of Operational Business Change procedures, which support the delivery
of pre-defined change types - as declared in reference [1].

The procedures supported by this document are those that will be used to manage
the delivery of basic and advanced changes for product Reference Data, where:

e a basic change is a change which consists solely of Reference Data which
requires no ICL Pathway intervention and may be submitted to ICL Pathway
without notice

e an advanced change is a change which requires additional ICL Pathway activity
and is subject to advanced notification

Specific areas described in this agreement are:

The information relevant to any given ADVANCED product change is
submitted by the Outlet Systems Group to ICL Pathway. The submission is
made to the Operational Business Change Product mailbox on an OBC2 form
or an OBC9 AP form. The receipt of the OBC form is the request for change
from POCL to Pathway.

At the same time (and if appropriate), a parallel submission of change
information will be made by the Outlet Systems Group to the POCL
Reference Data Operational Team — who make the relevant Reference Data

changes and pass them to ICL Pathway for application on the Horizon
system.

It is important to note that changes sent to ICL Pathway are separated into
‘Units of release’, that is an entity which, when properly authorised by OSG,
is available to be released to the ‘Live’ environment. This must be taken into
account when data is sent to ICL Pathway to ensure that all data required for
any change is included within a single ‘Unit of Release’ and that where data
for different changes are included within the same file set, all data will be
released at the same time. This means that data which has the longest lead
time will define the earliest that the ‘Unit of Release’ will be sent to the ‘Live’
environment.

The information relevant to any given BASIC product change is submitted by
the POCL Reference Data Operational Team — who make the relevant
Reference Data changes and pass them to ICL Pathway. Basic changes
consist of only Class 1 data [see ref 11 for a definition of Class 1 data]. The
receipt of the data file containing Basic (Class 1 only) data is the request for
change from POCL to Pathway.

The ICL Pathway Reference Data Team then follows the Management
Process for Operational Business Change — Product [ref 1] to manage the
delivery of the specific change.

7. Models

7.1 Introduction

This document describes several models which define the milestones for a change.
Each category in the RDCC can be associated with one of these models. The lead
time runs from initiating a change until the change is used on the counter e.g. the
change starts when the new product can be remmed in on the counter (NOT sold)
and the lead time in these models includes POCL times and Pathway times.

The models are:

Basic change [Type A only]

Advanced, simple change [Type A, plus after-the-event changes]
Advanced, standard change [Type A, Type B, Scorecard, Testing]
Advanced, complex change [requires Type C data]

Basic express [limited service]

Migration special [product to outlet mapping, only]

Tight Timescales [Contractual requirement]

Error correction

ercececeeee

7.2 Fast track

The Term ‘Fast track’ is used to refer to four different scenarios:

1. Basic Express
An agreed lead time for a specific requirement to change certain data quickly.
Basic Express is addressed by section 8.2 e.g. it applies to changing the price of
bus fokets in 2 days (end to end). The limits for its use are defined in that

2. Tight Timescales

A contractual requirement to make any kind of reference data change quickly, in
certain circumstances.

The service that meets the Tight Timescales requirement is described in section
8.8.

FUJ00232439
ICL Pathway ICL Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement Ref:CS/PRD/058
for Operational Business Change - Version:2.0
Product Date:8/7/99

3. Error Correction

When there is a need to correct errors quickly to reduce or remove the impact of
those errors quickly.

The method of changing data quickly for Error Correction purposes is described
in [ref 12] e.g. if data sent from POCL is found by Pathway to be incorrect, then

an incident will be raised to notify POCL of the error and corrected data will be

sent. The limits for its use are defined in that document.

4. Migration Special

To meet the need to apply a quick change to the Product to Outlet mappings for
an outlet which is being migrated. See section 8.3.

7.3 Impact of volume
7.1.1 Bulk changes

High volumes of OBC change, either in the form of many changes or one large
change, cause an overhead on both POCL and ICL Pathway operational units and
reduces the ability of the operational teams to achieve the milestones detailed in
section 8. In order to manage requests for high volumes of change POCL will
review bulk change situations and confirm with the operational units in POCL and in
ICL Pathway that the OBC requests can be met, in advance of agreeing with the
originator the deadline for delivery. Deviations to the models in this document will be
agreed on a case by case basis [see section 12]. The expectation is some planning
for bulk changes will be done in advance of normal lead times.

7.1.2 End of year

The end-of-year changes are an extreme form of bulk changes which need to go live
in March/April. They include cash account changes (not OBC), budget changes,
homecare stamp changes and tariff changes. The milestone models in section 8 do
not apply to end of year changes. End-of-year change needs to be managed as a
separate 'bulk change’ project.

7.1.3 Tariff changes

A tariff change may occur at other times of the year, but would still be a bulk change
and needs to be managed carefully.

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement Ref:CS/PRD/058

Product Date:8/7/99

8. Milestones

The milestones for these models are given in sections 8.1 - 8.7.

The models do not show activities that occur in parallel within Pathway. The
diagrams were produced in this way to allow a simple view of the milestones.

N.B. these milestones only apply for ONE change, and do not take into
account the impact of volume [see section 7.3].

ICL Pathway commits to all reasonable endeavours to deliver changes to ICL
Pathway agreed lead times. POCL must meet its milestones for end to end lead
times to be achieved.

When viewing these lead times it is important to take into account that ICL Pathway
can only prepare for an advanced change when the notification arrives. Processing
the change can usually only occur when all the necessary data has been supplied
by POCL. Where ICL Pathway ‘Type C’ data is required there is a need for ICL
Pathway Development activity. The timescale for this activity is dependent on the
type of change being made and must be taken into account in the overall ICL
Pathway leadtime. When ICL Pathway have completed work on an advanced
change the data is passed to OSG Farnborough for verification and authorisation.
ICL Pathway will not release changes to the ‘Live’ environment until authorisation is
received.

Lead times

Leadtimes must be measured with reference to the date that the change needs to
be at the outlet. This is not necessarily the date on which the change becomes
effective. Examples:

e if a product needs to be Remmed-in 6 weeks before the product is available to
sell, the lead time is measured to the date of Rem-In (when the data must be
functioning on the counter) and not to the Sell date,

e if a price change is a revaluation, the data needs to be at the counter 3 days in
advance of the change, to allow notice to be given to the Postmasters to revalue

e if achange is ready to be released 7days in advance of the date it needs to be on
the counter, the data does not need to be released until 3 days in advance.

SLA

The SLA for measurement of delivery of Reference Data to the counters is defined
in schedule G10 of the contract. The models below are built as if the authorisation
for a change is delivered overnight and the change being processed by ICL Pathway
the next working day. In practice, provided authorisation is received by ICL Pathway
by 4pm on any working day the change will normally be released on that day for
processing overnight according to the schedule.

8.2 Basic Express

An agreed lead time for a specific requirement to change certain data quickly.

Basic Express is addressed by this document. The limits for its use are:

only for the categories of change defined in section 9.2 below and

for changes which must be active on completion of the change

for changes which are received by Pathway by 10am and

it is anticipated that the volume of change will not be more than once a
week. Should the volume be greater, these changes will be processed but
the lead time cannot be guaranteed to be more than for a normal Basic
change. Service reviews will also be held.

ooofo

In order to identify that a change requires handling in this way the Change
Number must start with an agreed prefix and the other details must be as
described above. If a Change is delivered to ICL Pathway with this prefix but
the contents to not meet the specified criteria it will be processed according to
the normal leadtimes.

This service should be used sparingly as changes of this type are likely to have
impact on other changes already being processed by ICL Pathway and POCL.
If the limit is exceeded ICL Pathway and POCL may be unable to meet other
Leadtimes, OLA’s or SLA’s.

8.2.1 Timescales

Changes that involve only Type A data and are one of the named change types in
[section 9.2], the change must be required to be active on the counter within 48hrs,
the number of changes of this type are limited in number within any period, the
Change Number must have an agreed prefix.

Note: it is recommended that the normal e-mail communication is replaced by fax &
confirmed by phone for Express changes, due to the unreliability of the e-mail
system e.g. delivery can take over 3 hours.

8.3 Migration special

To meet the need to apply a quick change to the Product to Outlet mappings for
an outlet which is currently being migrated. It is:

for migration use only
© for Non-core Product to Outlet mappings only
for data received by Pathway by 10am

If the HFSO discovers that there is a discrepancy in the Product to Outlet
mapping (also referred to as non-core items) at the Outlet which he is currently
migrating there will be an agreed procedure set down in references [8 & 9] for
the HFSO to contact RDOT with the requested change. This change will be
notified to ICL Pathway by the fact that the Change Number is in an agreed form
e.g. XXffffff (where ffffff is the FAD Code for the outlet) and the change only
contains Product to Outlet mapping data for an outlet currently being migrated.
If the file sent contains any other data or does not have a change number of the
prescribed format the file will be treated as would any other data file.

This process may also be used immediately following migration where mapping
errors are subsequently found.

Once ICL Pathway have confirmed that the data is of the required type the
change information will be released to the ‘Live’ environment as quickly as
possible. The authorisation for this release is implied by the Change Number
and will be confirmed by OSG as soon as possible after the event.

8.3.1 Timescales

Migration special changes are changes (usually additions) to the reference data
defining which non-core products a particular outlet can sell, where the office has
been selling the item but the reference data does not reflect this. This data is
needed so that the cash account can record those sales, when it is migrated to the
Horizon system.

8.8 Tight Timescales

8.8.1 Requirement

ICL Pathway recognise the business need POCL has to implement changes in tight
time scales. Requirement 539/3 states there is a need to “implement changes to
Reference Data to tight timescales. An as example of such timescales, it shall be
possible to implement Reference Data changes consequent on a Budget by start of

business on the following day”.

8.8.2 Types

Analysis by POCL of the business requirements indicates that the drivers for change

are:

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

FUJ00232439

FUJ00232439
ICL Pathway ICL Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement Ref:CS/PRD/058
for Operational Business Change - Version:2.0
Product Date:8/7/99

e Governmental / legal changes
e Client requirements where there is a real business need (i.e. not due to bad
working practices)

and the types of change that require to be changed in tight timescales are:

e Price change

e Emergency cessation of a product

e Last minute amendments to details of a product introduction or change which has
been set up in advance.

8.8.3 Price Change

The most frequent changes to tight timescales are price changes and these can be
processed via the Basic Express route and so do not require additional agreements.

8.8.4 Emergency cessation

Normally cessation of a product is an Advanced Simple change with a lead time of 2
weeks. However it can be dealt with as if it was a Basic Express, with a lead time of
2 days, given that appropriate authorisation is received. The normal paperwork
would be processed after the event.

8.8.5 Last minute amendments

There are occasions when a change is known to be needed before the full details of
the change are available, and the final information may not be available until close
to the implementation date. Where this is the case an OBC change can be initiated
as normal, but with incomplete data and with agreed plans for when the final
amendments will be introduced.

For example:
Introducing a new product could be done by first producing a ‘dummy’ product,
which defines the cash account mappings and menu button, but has no real name or

price or product details included. The missing type A data could be completed or
changed when it is finally known, as if it was a Basic change.

8.9 Error Correction

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway/POCL Interface Agreement Ref:CS/PRD/058
for Operational Business Change - Version:2.0
Product Date:8/7/99

The need to correct errors to reduce or remove the impact of those errors.

The method of changing data for Error Correction purposes is described in [ref
12]. The time scale for implementing these changes will be derived from the
priority of the incident that is governing the progress of the change.

9. RDCC Categories

The RDCC categories (section numbers provided, based on release 2.0 of the
RDCC) that apply to these changes are as follows. The assumptions listed in the
RDCC must be adhered to in order to apply these categorisations.

The lead times given are end-to-end lead times and therefore include time for POCL

activity. ICL Pathway commits to all reasonable endeavours to deliver changes to
ICL Pathway agreed lead times

products.

e Ceasing AP Client, product or token may be implemented as an Advanced Simple

10. Volumes

The lead-time and milestone models were built on normal expected volumes. Any
deviation to the norm of more than 100% (one sixth of the yearly volume per month)
will result in an inability to achieve the lead times.

11. Commercial Implications

11.1 Order and Payment

a) Change orders will be accepted, as firm, once received by the OBC
Product Mailbox.

b) Currently the only chargeable Operational Business Change service is
AP Client Take On [ref 3]. Invoices for completed change activity on
this, or any future Operational Business Change service, will be sent to
POCL on a monthly basis and 30 day payment from date of invoice
conditions will apply.

11.2 Failure to achieve lead times

There are no liquidated damages or defined remedies for failure to meet any
milestone. ICL Pathway and POCL will both meet their own lead times on a
reasonable endeavours basis .

12. Deviations

Deviations to change requirements, standards and processes within the OBC
process will be managed on a case by case basis. No commitments, in terms
of delivery time, delivery standard or price can be given by ICL Pathway —
until the detail of the specific deviation is known and understood. Request of
the deviation should be submitted in advance of the OBC form. It will be
agreed between RDT, RDOT and OSG whether the deviation is possible. If
not, OSG will inform the business unit immediately.

Non OBC changes [ref 10] will be rejected by the OBC process and need to
be submitted as a Change Request.
