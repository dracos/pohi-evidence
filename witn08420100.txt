                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                          FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF
                          RODRIC DAVID ALUN WILLIAMS




I, RODRIC DAVID ALUN WILLIAMS, will say as follows:


INTRODUCTION


1.    I am an employee of Post Office Limited ("POL"), where I am currently a Head

      of Legal in POL's Remediation Unit. I have been in this role since around

      August 2020 when POL established the "Historical Matters" (now called

      "Remediation") Unit to address Postmasters' ("PMRs") complaints about

      Horizon following the conclusion of the Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd Group

      Litigation (the "Group Litigation"). I describe the previous roles I have held at

      POL in the `Background' section of this witness statement below.


2.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

      "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request sent to me dated 5

      December 2023 (the "Request'). I instructed a firm of solicitors to support me

      in my preparation of this witness statement. Most of this statement is within my

      own knowledge and I believe that the facts stated are true. Where I have



                                        1
                                                                                                    WITNO8420100
                                                                                                 WITNO8420100


                                                                  Witness: Rodric David Alun Williams
                                                                  Statement Number: W1TNO8420100
                                                                  Exhibits: None
                                                                  Date: 11 March 2024

        derived information from other sources, I say so, and that information is true to

        the best of my knowledge and belief.


3.      I take this opportunity to personally acknowledge and express my deep regret

        for the significant harm caused to so many individuals by the events the Inquiry

        was established to review. I recognise that everyone who has played a role in

        those events has a responsibility to assist this process. I hope that by giving my

        evidence and answering the Inquiry's questions to the best of my recollection,

        I can help the Inquiry to deliver on its Terms of Reference, to establish how

        these events happened, and to help those affected find closure.


4.      In a number of parts of the Request, the Inquiry has asked me to explain the

        steps POL took in relation to particular issues. This statement is                 evidence




                                                                                      my
        as an individual, based on my own awareness, and I am not speaking for POL

        or its corporate position. Nothing in this statement is intended to waive POL's

        legal professional privilege, and I am not authorised to do so. I understand from

        my solicitors that any legal professional privilege that attached to documents

        provided to me in connection with this witness statement has been waived, and

        although I am not party to the precise details of that waiver, I have sought to

        proceed on the basis that privilege has been waived in accordance with the

        POL 15 November 2021 response to the Inquiry's request to waive privilege.'


5.      I have been given a bundle of documents that were provided to my solicitors by

        the Inquiry, marked with unique reference numbers. I will refer to documents in

        that bundle below. I have had some opportunity to refresh my recollection from

        other documentation, such as material held by my employer POL that is


' See Response on behalf of Post Office Limited 'Legal Professional Privilege' dated 15 November 2021

                                               N
                                                                                           WITNO8420100
                                                                                        WITNO8420100


                                                         Witness: Rodric David Alun Williams
                                                         Statement Number: WITNO8420100
                                                         Exhibits: None
                                                         Date: 11 March 2024

      relevant to these events. As a current POL employee, I have also had access

      to my POL email inbox to assist me in contextualising that documentation. I

      have mainly relied on what has been provided by the Inquiry as I have not had

      the opportunity to undertake a detailed or comprehensive review of other

      material available to me.


6.    The focus of this statement covers a lengthy period going back to 2012, with

      significant emphasis on matters which took place not long after I joined POL in

      August 2012. Certain issues raised by the Inquiry came up more than once and

      at different times during this period, and my understanding of many of them

      evolved over that time. I have found it difficult to distinguish the state of my

      knowledge at any given time from what I may have learned later. The

      documents I have seen have helped to remind me of some things, but there is

      much that I cannot remember with certainty. I have also had a relatively limited

      time to prepare this statement bearing in mind the number of topics and length

      of time covered. If further relevant documents are identified in due course I may

      need to clarify or expand upon some matters.


Structure of statement

7.    Given that the issues and topics raised by the Inquiry often arise more than

      once and at different times during the period, as well as the overlap between a

      number of topics and questions asked by the Inquiry, I have structured my

      statement broadly chronologically and by topic in answering the Request:

PART 1: BACKGROUND


Career history


8.    1 have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications until




9.    1 graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from the University of Otago,

      Dunedin New Zealand in 1994, and was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of

      the High Court of New Zealand in 1995. I practised as a "barrister sole" in

      Wellington, New Zealand working on a variety of civil law related matters

      between 1995 and 1998, when I left New Zealand to travel to the

      United Kingdom. I first started working on legal matters in England and Wales

      in 1999 when I joined as an associate a small civil litigation practice in London

      called Ralph Hume and Garry, before moving to the London office of U.S. firm

      Duane Morris as an associate in 2000. 1 was admitted as a solicitor in England

      and Wales in 2002.


10.   Between mid-2003 and 20051worked for Duane Morris in New York on financial

      services litigation matters. I was admitted to the New York bar as an attorney in

      2006. 1 returned to England in 2006 where I continued to work for Duane

      Morris, before joining Manches LLP as a litigation associate in 2007, where I

      worked until joining POL in August 2012.


POLLectal


11.   I joined POL shortly after it formally separated from Royal Mail Group, where I

      believe the in-house legal team had been a centralised `group function'

      supporting the entire Royal Mail business. On separation, members of that

      team whose work focused on POL moved over to POL to form a dedicated POL

      in-house legal team. That process created the vacancy for an in-house civil

      "Litigation Lawyer", which I filled.


12.   When I joined POL, the team was headed by a General Counsel, who I believe

      sat on the 'ExCo' or `Group Exec'/'GE' committee of POL's most senior

      executives reporting to POL's Board. The General Counsel was supported by

      a Head of Legal (to whom I reported) and a further approximately 10 lawyers

      with various areas of specialism, including commercial contracts, procurement,

      IT, telecommunications, property, criminal law, and my litigation role. The in-

      house legal team was also supplemented with secondees from external legal

      firms from time to time.


13.   Throughout my time at POL, the shape of POL's in-house legal team has

      changed, generally expanding to meet the demand for legal support from the

      business. Following Chris Aujard's appointment as Interim General Counsel in

      2013, second and then third 'Head of Legal' roles were created, each of whom

      reported to the General Counsel. I continued to be line-managed by a Head of
                                                                                           WITNO8420100
                                                                                        WITNO8420100


                                                          Witness: RodricDavid Alun Williams
                                                          Statement Number: WITNO8420100
                                                          Exhibits: None
                                                          Date: 11 March 2024

      Legal, and around this time I started line-managing junior colleagues. A

      Legal Director role was created in 2016 following Jane MacLeod's appointment

      as General Counsel, with initially five Heads of Legal reporting to the Legal

      Director, who in turn reported to the General Counsel. I was promoted to "Head

      of Legal - Dispute Resolution & Brand" in 2017 as part of this expansion,

      continuing to line-manage junior colleagues as well as taking on more functional

      management activities (e.g. around the in-house legal team's operating models

      and budgets).


14.   In 2020, 1 moved out of POL's 'business as usual legal team to support the

      Historical MatterslRemediation Unit established to manage the steps being

      taken following the settlement of the Group Litigation. Prior to that unit being

      established, I believe I was the only POL-employed lawyer with dispute

      resolution experience, acting as the first point of internal contact within the

      business for contentious matters. I was, however, frequently supported by

      secondees from external law firms.


15.   The Historical Matters/Remediation Unit was established in mid-2020. POL

      employees with the skills and experience required to help POL resolve PMR

      Horizon complaints following the Group Litigation were transferred to this

      dedicated business unit, and I was transferred as part of this internal

      reorganisation given my experience in dealing with these matters, in particular

      through the Group Litigation. As far as I could tell, the transfer was a human

      resources process, which changed my reporting line. I initially reported to the

      unit director, and then from April 2022 to the unit's legal director once that role

      had been created. Since that time, I have transferred my responsibilities to

      other lawyers within the unit's legal team so that I would have the capacity to

      respond to a Rule 9 Request.


M Role at POL


16.   At the outset I would like to outline some overarching points about my time

      working at POL, namely:


      (a)    My role as an in-house lawyer;

      (b)    The types of tasks that I would typically be asked to assist




                                                                                with;
      (c)    The approach taken to external lawyers; and

      (d)    My role in relation to criminal law matters.


My role as an in-house lawyer


17.   As an in-house lawyer at POL my primary role has been to help POL manage

      its legal risks and the provision of legal support and advice to the POL business.

      As set out above, I was initially hired as "Litigation Lawyer", and I was promoted

      to "Head of Legal - Dispute Resolution & Brand" in April 2017. 1 note that many

      of the matters referred to in this statement relate to the period before this

      promotion. Colleagues within POL would contact me when they had a particular

      matter they thought required legal support, and I would look to ensure that

      appropriate support was provided having regard to the nature and timing of the

      request and the capabilities and capacity of the available resources. In my role

      I was contacted to assist with a wide range of matters, reflecting POL's diverse

      business. The diversity of the issues raised with me, and the limits of my own

      capacity, meant that throughout my time         POL I routinely referred matters to

      support. 1 would do so especially if the matter was outside of my areas of

      expertise, or was complex          likely to take time to conclude. I believe this




                                    or
      reflects the general practice of the POL in-house legal team throughout the time

      period covered in this statement.


18.   1 have often been brought in to assist with a specific part of a project or to get

      involved in a large piece of work already underway. I would not necessarily

      know all that has come before, and am not expected to remain engaged with

      every project or piece of work unless specifically required. On certain projects I

      may be included in email chains not specifically related to my contribution, and

      being copied into an email does not necessarily mean I am engaged on a

      particular issue or required to focus on it, especially if someone else on the

      chain is better placed to do so. If a question is directed at me that I am not best

      placed to answer or do not have capacity, then I generally refer it to someone

      better placed to deal with it. This approach is necessary to make my workload

      manageable and, again, I believe it is consistent with the approach taken by

      others within the POL in-house legal team.


19.   The circumstances in which legal professional privilege might apply to

      communications to or from me in the course of my work would be determined

      by the specific communication. Typically, I would seek to ensure POL could

      make a claim for legal professional privilege over any communication to or from

      me concerning the provision of legal advice (either from me or an external

      adviser), and/or if its dominant purpose was contemplated or actual litigation. I

      would often mark (or ask to be marked) as `privileged' communications in

      relation to which POL might later           to make a claim for legal professional
                                           wish

        privilege, recognising that this would not be determinative given that privilege

        is a question of substance not forma I cannot speak for how other members of

        the POL legal team approached privilege, but I tried to keep updated on

        developments in the law of privilege, and would seek external legal support on

        questions of privilege if circumstances required.


Tasks that 1 would typically be asked to assist with


20.     As I mentioned at paragraph [17] above, my primary role at POL has been to

        manage its legal risks and facilitate the provision of appropriate legal support

        and advice to the business. If a matter requiring such support is something I

        feel able to comment on then I may give my views. If it relates to a subject I am

        not familiar with or falls outside my areas of expertise, then I will either go to a

        subject-matter specialist myself, or direct the colleague who has raised the

        matter towards one. If detailed advice or sustained support is needed for an

        issue then, regardless of the subject matter, I engage POL's external legal

        advisers to deliver that support, often putting the external lawyers in direct

        contact with POL colleagues or embedding them in the POL team.


21.     Over the period covered by this statement, I have liaised with a number of

        different legal specialists, both in-house and external. I may have co-ordinated

        obtaining instructions or delivering advice within POL, or I may have served as

        an escalation point for the external advisers or others within POL who were

        working with them.




2 1 was also aware that as an in-house lawyer privilege might not apply to some of my communications
in the context of EU competition investigations, but in practice that was not a situation I was involved
with.

22.     1 have often been asked to distil or synthesise information provided from various

       parts of the business for other audiences within the business, particularly if the

       information concerns legal issues with which I have some familiarity.

       Sometimes I would be specifically told who the information was for. On other

       occasions I would provide it to those I thought best placed to receive and act

       upon it. My focus when carrying out such tasks is usually on the form of the

       information, making sure it is focused and comprehensible for its intended

       audience. I generally rely on others for the accuracy of the content, especially

       if it concerns areas outside my expertise, with my role being to `sense check' it.


Approach to external lawyers


23.    External lawyers would be engaged in the way which best supported the

        specific matter on which they were being instructed. Very broadly, the process

        could involve the member of the POL legal team directly engaging the external

        lawyer for discrete pieces of support or advice, or the external lawyers working

        directly with POL non-lawyer colleagues, with the POL lawyer acting as an

        escalation point or providing input on specific issues. The latter was often the

        case for large or long running projects, or for established business activities.

        For example, when I first joined POL the Agent Debt team would liaise directly

        with external lawyers at DAC Beachcroft and Womble Bond Dickinson

        ("WBD")3 and would not routinely involve a member of the POL legal team.


24.     External lawyers would be chosen based on their expertise and understanding

        of POL's business and operations. As an in-house lawyer, I would rely on them


3 Bond Pearce became Bond Dickinson on I May 2013 following the completion of a merger. The firm
later merged with a US firm to become Womble Bond Dickinson. In this statement, I always refer to the
firm as WBD.

      to provide the appropriate advice and support as, unless the matter concerned

       something I was familiar with and I had capacity, I would not be able to look

      behind it.


Role in relation to criminal prosecutions


25.   I have been asked by the Inquiry to comment on aspects of criminal

      prosecutions. Prior to joining POL, I had no real experience of criminal law

      issues, and, although I have developed some understanding of them through

      my employment at POL, I still do not believe I have a properly informed basis

      to express views on them now and would rely on specialist advice in this area.

      I did not prosecute PMRs on behalf of POL, or have first-hand knowledge of

      how Horizon was used in prosecutions. Prior to joining POL, I do not recall ever

      encountering the Criminal Cases Review Commission ("CCRC"). As noted

      above, I have through my employment by POL developed some understanding

      of criminal law processes, which I have obtained from criminal lawyers advising

      POL. If I ever sought advice in relation to aspects of criminal law I would rely

      on that, especially given I did not have any personal experience to test it

      against. Forthe same reason, if a matter I was involved in raised issues relevant

      to criminal prosecutions, I might not identify them.         much of the time covered
                                                             For




      by this statement, the criminal law advice POL received was managed within

      the POL in-house legal team by my colleague Jarnail Singh (POL Criminal

      Lawyer), with my role being to help collate or distil material connected to POL's

      prosecution activities.

Knowledge of Horizon following joining POL


26.    Prior to joining POL, I had no knowledge of the Horizon IT System. I was not

       briefed or trained in connection with Horizon as part of my induction, and do not

       recall it being discussed when I was interviewed for my role in 2012. 1 later

       received basic training on how to operate a Horizon terminal, but my limited

       understanding of Horizon as a system has really come from assisting with the

       legal issues I describe later in this statement. I have always relied on those with

       the appropriate technical or operational knowledge to provide instructions in

       relation to Horizon.


27.     The Inquiry has drawn my attention to some documents that predate my joining

       POL, and asked me to comment on my awareness of them when I joined. I did

        not read the Computer Weekly article dated May 20094 prior to joining POL,

        and I cannot recall there being any discussion within POL's legal department,

        or more Widely within POL, about Computer Weekly's reporting on Horizon

        around the time I joined. I do not recall reading the report by Rod Ismay (the

        POL Head of Finance Service Centre) of 2 August 20105 when I joined POL

        and believe I first saw it sometime in 2020. Nor do I recall seeing the Ernst

        &Young LLP ("EY") Report of 27 March 2011 when I joined POL. Although it is

        possible I was sent this, I do not recall if or when I first saw it.6

28.   I do not recall being involved in responding to questions raised by PMRs, the

      Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance ("JFSA"), IVIPs or journalists about the

      reliability of Horizon when I joined POL, nor being aware of complaints about

      Horizon. As I will refer to later, this did change over time.


PART 2: ENGAGEMENT WITH SECOND SIGHT PRIOR TO THEIR INTERIM




29.   1 was first exposed to the controversy around Horizon in September 2012, not

      long after I joined POL. The context for this was that I was asked by my line

      manager Hugh Flemington (Head of Legal), to assist a project team within POL

      led by Simon Baker (Head of Business Change and Assurance) with providing

      documents to Second Sight Support Services Limited ("Second Sight"). I

      understood this related to work Second Sight were undertaking, exploring

      whether Horizon could be the source of unresolved accounting shortages in

      Post Office branches.


30.   Second Sight had been appointed before I joined POL and I did not have any

      direct knowledge of that process or how the scope of Second Sight's original

      retainer was determined. As noted above, my first involvement was assisting

      the project team at POL with providing documents to Second Sight to support

      their ongoing work. Those documents included legal files, and, as a new lawyer

      joining POL, I felt I needed to raise the risks around disclosing legally privileged

      documents to a third party without putting a clear framework in place to govern

      their use. It was made clear to me by those within POL however that POL

      wanted to ensure Second Sight were able to see the privileged documents as

             of their review. I therefore worked with POL's external lawyers, WBD, to
      part

                                                                                                     WITNO8420100


                                                                     Witness: Rodric David Alun Williams
                                                                     Statement Number: W ITNO8420100
                                                                     Exhibits: None
                                                                     Date: 11 March 2024

       put a framework in place to allow that. This was agreed with Second Sight in

       mid-October 2012.


31.    Also in October 2012, Hugh Flemington asked me to look at a document,

       drafted by the JFSA,7 which aimed to encourage PMRs to come forward with

       any concerns they had about Horizon being responsible for accounting

        shortages in their Post Office branches. I therefore worked with Stephen

       Hocking, a public law partner at DAC Beachcroft, to agree with Second Sight

        and the JFSA a document entitled `Raising Concerns with Horizon' ("Raising

        Concerns"). Raising Concerns set out a process by which concerns regarding

        Horizon could be raised, and also clarified the remit, conduct and output of the

        work that Second Sight was undertaking (because a retainer for this had

        seemingly not been agreed at the time of Second Sight's appointment). Raising

        Concerns was agreed for publication in late December 2012.8


32.     While these tasks gave me some awareness of the controversy around

        Horizon, I did not get into the detail of Second Sight's work or the underlying

        complaints, and I was not involved in considering the merits of any of the

        concerns being examined by Second Sight.


Second Sight Spot Reviews


My role in the 'Spot Review' process


33.     I do not now recall when or how I first became aware that 'Spot Reviews' were

        being carried out in connection with Second Sight's work. I do recall that these

to me beforehand, for example when I was arranging for documents to be provided to Second Sight.

       were a mechanism developed by POL and Second Sight to understand better

       some of the specific complaints PMRs had raised, by looking into them closely

       to try to draw out and address key themes, questions and issues. This work

       was undertaken by the POL project team working with Second Sight, which did

       not include me, supported by external lawyers WBD.


34.    I remember reviewing drafts of a number of Spot Reviews to get a sense of

       what they looked like, and sharing some thoughts with WBD. I do not now recall

       my comments, although it is likely that they related to whether the Spot Reviews

       were comprehensible and would serve the purpose for which they were

       prepared. I recall that POL sought to organise the preparation and drafting of

       the Spot Reviews in a way that would maximise the potential for POL to claim

       legal professional privilege over them and any exchanges with Fujitsu relating

       to them as they were being developed. I believe the basis for this was broadly

       that they concerned contentious issues, which WBD as POL's solicitors (with

       recent experience of responding to Horizon related claims advanced by the law

       firm Shoosmiths) would investigate, draft and advise on as appropriate, before

       finalised, non-privileged, Spot Reviews would be released.8 I do not sufficiently

       recall the details of Spot Reviews to comment now on the points raised by Kay

       Linnell in her email of 14 May 2013.10 I do believe, however, that the Spot

       Reviews were prepared for Second Sight as forensic accountants to take

       forward through their investigation.

35.       I have been asked to consider draft Spot Review SR001.11 I do not recall having

          any meaningful input on this document during the Spot Review process, and,

          as noted above, I would not have been able to comment on the technical

          aspects of it.


Digesting information relating to the Spot Review process


36.       The Inquiry has asked me to comment on a draft email addressed to John Scott

          (the POL Head of Security) and Rob King (the POL Senior Security Manager

          and his deputy), which was sent to me and Simon Baker on 13 May 2013 by

          Dave Posnett (an Accredited Financial Investigator).12 The draft contains a

          series of bullet point updates on the Spot Review process. It appears from the

          email that I had asked for draft updates to be sent to me for forward

          transmission to John Scott and Rob King. I believe I requested this for two

          reasons. First, part of my role was sometimes to review andlor distil information

          provided by one part of the business comprehensibly for other parts of the

          business so that there was a consistent `joined up' position. Second, if the

          emails contained legal advice or concerned matters on which legal advice

          would be required then POL would be better placed to claim legal professional

          privilege over the material if it had been sent to or received by a legal adviser. I

          would not have been able to, or expected to, verify the factual statements Dave

          Posnett made in his draft email to me that "ln]one of the Spot Reviews to date

          have found specific faults with Horizon", and Dave Posnett did not seek my

       input on that point. When I forwarded the email to John Scott and Rob King on

       22 May 2014, this phrase was unchanged.13


37.    An email I sent to Paula Vennells (the POL Chief Executive) on 27 June 201314

       is anexample of me co-ordinating and distilling input from different parts of the

       business. The content would have come from various sources. I cannot

       remember who else was present at the meeting referred to in the email, but I

       copied my line manager Hugh Flemington and Alwyn Lyons (the POL Company

       Secretary) and the email was forwarded to Susan Crichton (HR & Corporate

       Services Director15). In terms of the contents of the email, my general

       understanding is that POL did not believe there were systemic issues with

       Horizon at the time because the system was being used in a large number of

       branches by a large number of users to process a very large number of

       transactions every day. If there had been systemic issues, POL therefore

       expected that there would have been complaints and business disruption from

       a much greater number of system users than it seemed to be experiencing. The

       Inquiry has drawn my attention to two specific passages in the email relating to

       criminal prosecutions and convictions:


               "Second Sight seem to be saying that because Horizon has "bugs", it is
               not safe for Post Office to rely upon the data it produces, e.g. in a criminal
               case to show branch shortfalls"

               "No cases since at least separation have seen convictions secured on
               Horizon-based evidence alone, e.g. there has also been a paper trail,
               money in bank account, and/or lies at interview exposed".

       For the reasons set out at paragraph [25] I believe these passages will have

       been provided by or derived from POL's criminal lawyers.


38.    The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on an email of 2 April 2013 sent

       from .Simon Baker to Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu, who was providing technical

       input on the Spot Reviews, and Andy Winn, who was a Relationship Manager

       in Rod Ismay's team at POL's Finance Service Centre.18 I was copied into this

       email along with a number of others but have no specific recollection of it now,

       and do not remember attending the workshop Simon Baker mentions. I have,

       however, found an email showing that Simon asked me to help find a room for

       the workshop on 10 April 2013 at WBD, who presumably were the "legal

       adviser" referred to in the email. The meeting appears to have proceeded at

       POL's offices and been attended by Gavin Matthews and Andrew (Andy)

       Parsons from WBD. The Inquiry has drawn my attention to the following specific

       passage in the email:


               "our responses don't...drive home our message in a compelling way —
               that would persuade MPs or the media or members of the public that
               there are no issues [with Horizon.]"
       I did not write this but, given that POL did not believe there were systemic issues

       with Horizon at the time, it seems to me that if there was a credible response to

       an issue raised in a Spot Review, then POL would have wanted that to be

       clearly articulated for others to see.

Civil recovery and the Spot Review process


39.    The Inquiry has asked me to comment on the extent to which POL continued

       seeking civil recovery of alleged debt from PMRs during the Second Sight

       investigation. I have been reminded by emails from the time that the Agent Debt

       team sought advice on the approach they should take to civil recovery when a

       Spot Review was pending. In response, I wrote to Alison Bolsover (Debt

       Recovery Senior Manager) to say that POL could not start taking civil action

       against any individual who had submitted an issue to Second Sight (in line with

       Raising Concerns referred to in paragraph [311 above). I asked Simon Baker to

       get a list of everyone who had done this, so it could be supplied to the Agent

       Debt team.17 I understand that the Agent Debt team did intend to halt all

       standard debt recovery processes for such cases, and that they were provided

       with updated lists as further cases came forward.


40.    In January 2013 the Agent Debt team had their own processes for discussing

       and seeking to resolve or recover branch shortfalls, with some cases eventually

       escalating to legal proceedings.18 As I mentioned at paragraph [23] above, the

       in-house legal team at POL did not typically get involved in this process.

       Instead, the Agent Debt team would deal directly with POL's external lawyers

       (in this case, DAC Beachcroft) who would contact POL legal if they wanted to

       raise a particular issue on a specific case.


41.    The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on an email of April 2013 from

       relating to debt recovery following the criminal conviction of Lynette Hutchings

       in August 2012.19 I have no recollection of this email or the matter to which it

       relates, but it indicates that the basis for seeking recovery was that the amount

       alleged to have been gained was the proceeds of crime. I can see that I raised

       the need to consider carefully what steps, if any, should be taken whilst the

       Second Sight investigation was still ongoing, and that I added Andy Pheasant

       of WBD to the chain so he could provide his input directly to the Agent Debt

       team. The email chain suggests that the Agent Debt team may have put their

       processes on hold, but, if this was not a case being considered by Second

       Sight, then my understanding is that there was an opportunity for the PMR to

       dispute recovery through the standard recovery process.


PART 3: SECOND SIGHT INTERIM REPORT


42.    I described my initial involvement with Second Sight's work in 2013 at

       paragraphs [29] to [32] above. Through this I gained some awareness of the

       controversy around Horizon. I did not, however, get into detail about Second

       Sight's work or the complaints about Horizon until later, when Second Sight

       came to publish an update on their findings in the Second Sight `Interim Report

       into alleged problems with the Horizon system' ("Interim Report") in mid-2013.

       At that point, POL received a draft of the Interim Report, and its impending

       publication generated significant activity within POL. As part of that, I was asked

       to assist senior management in relation to the draft Interim Report and POL's

       response to it. This involved collating and synthesising information from various

       sources on matters which the Interim Report might raise. I set out below at

        with senior management.


Knowledge of BEDs


43.     It was the imminent publication of the Second Sight Interim Report that focused

        attention on bugs, errors and defects ("BEDs") in Horizon and through this, I

        learned that POL was aware of two `bugs', which had been raised with Second

        Sight and would be discussed in their Interim Report. The information I saw

        indicated that these bugs had all been identified and resolved, and relevant

        affected parties had been, or were now being, informed. I discuss this further in

        paragraphs [44] to [54] below. It was also through the Second Sight process

        that I recall first becoming aware of issues relating to criminal prosecutions and

        duties of disclosure relating to BEDs. I discuss this further at paragraphs [72]

        to [75] below.


The Callendar Square bug and Horizon issues in litigation


44.    I have been asked to comment on some 1 July 2013 emails concerning the

        'Callendar Square bug' (sometimes called the `Falkirk' bug).24 These events

        happened over 10 years ago, so I do not now have a firm recollection of how

        they unfolded. As far as I recall, I was asked by Simon Baker to find out whether

        of the publication of the Second Sight Interim Report. This led me to put this

        question to WBD and DAC Beachcroft, given that to the best of my knowledge

        they were the POL external lawyers most likely to have supported POL in any

        civil action.


45.     This activity made clear to me that Horizon bugs had been discussed in two

        court cases, namely the 2007 civil case of Post Office Limited v Castleton

        [2007] EWHC 5 (QB) and the 2010 criminal prosecution of Seema Misra. In the

        context that I was looking at them in mid-2013 however, there was no reason

        for me to look into this further. That was because the cases had concluded quite

        some time earlier and there were no indications from those I was supplying the

        information to that anything further was required.


The local suspense and receipts and payments mismatch bugs


46.     I have been asked to comment on my knowledge in mid-2013 of the 'local

        suspense bug' (sometimes called the '14 Branch bug' or 'B14', reflecting the

        number of branches believed to have been affected). I have been referred by

        the Inquiry to some emails mentioning it from around the same time as those

        relating to the 'Callendar Square bug', referred to above.21 I believe that POL

        had brought the 'local suspense bug', along with the 'receipts payments

        mismatch bug' (sometimes referred to as the '64 Branch Bug', again reflecting

        the number of affected branches) to Second Sight's attention. The context in

        which I came to deal with these bugs was the same as I have described above

        in respect of the Callendar Square bug, and my role was again to collate and

        distil information for use by others considering POL's response to the Interim

        Report. I was also involved in instructing WBD to help POL write to notify the

        affected (non-POL operated22) branches about these bugs,23 with the WBD

        draft letters appearing to have been finalised by others within POL.24


47.     Although I cannot now remember precisely what took place at this time, from

        re-reading the documents provided to me by the Inquiry it appears that Lesley

        Sewell (Chief Information Officer) wanted to see a timeline of the steps taken

        with respect to the 'local suspense bug'. I discussed the matter with the relevant

        subject matter expert within POL, Andy Winn. I then recorded that discussion

        in an email which I circulated to the appropriate people within POL, copying

        Andy Winn to make sure I had fairly reflected what he had told me. Hugh

        Flemington then forwarded this to Susan Crichton and Jamail Singh, to ensure

        that the different parts of the POL legal team (who might be fielding enquiries

        from different parts of the business) remained up to date with developments.

        The letters were also shared with POL's external criminal lawyers Cartwright

        King for their input. Like the Callendar Square bug, the `local suspense bug'

        seems to have been known to those responsible for managing Horizon, and

        Fujitsu seems to have confirmed that the issue had been resolved. As far as I

        was aware therefore, the focus in mid-2013 was on making sure the PMRs

       whose branches had been affected were all made aware of the issue through

        these letters.


48.     The Inquiry has asked me specifically about my comment in POL00144855 that

       "Legal need to do a final cross check of the intended recipients to make sure

        they are not the subject of any prosecutionslinvestigations". This links to a

        second comment I made in POL00029622 ("reminder that no correspondence

        is to be sent on this issue until authorised by Post Office Legal'). As I explained

        at paragraph [221 above, at times part of my job would be to help manage the

        consistent movement of information within POL. In this case, where the legal

       team was `holding the pen' on the letters, that meant making sure the letters

       were not sent out until they had been approved by any other parts of the

        business which could be affected by them. .ln this case, that included POL's

        criminal law team, who were considering the bugs for disclosure purposes. As

       it transpired, one of the affected Post Office branches (operated by the chain

        Costcutter) was the subject of a prosecution being conducted by the Crown

       Prosecution Service ("CPS"), so advice was taken from POL's external criminal

       lawyers Cartwright King, who ultimately advised that POL could send the letters

       to the affected branches and that Cartwright King would address disclosure with

        the CPS (see paragraphs [491 to [50] below).25 Legal professional privilege was

        being asserted over this email because POL was taking legal advice on the

        form and content of the draft letters from its external civil and criminal lawyers.

        The final 'as sent' versions of the letters were not legally privileged.

49.     I have been referred by the Inquiry to an email exchange with Simon Clarke of

        Cartwright King on 3 and 4 July 2013, following a meeting I attended with him.26

        I do not recall that meeting but it seems my email attempted to summarise it

        and the actions arising from it. My email refers to the Costcutter prosecution

        that had been affected by the `local suspense bug'. The Inquiry has also shown

        me an email chain from 4 July 2013, which includes information provided by

        Gareth Jenkins at Fujitsu about when the 'local suspense bug' was raised.27 My

        role in this was again I believe concerned with ensuring that relevant

        information was shared with those who might need to act upon it. In this case,

        that seemed to be providing to Cartwright King the information collated on the

        `local suspense bug' to enable them to provide their advice to POL.


50.     I have also been asked to comment on an email sent by Hugh Flemington to

        Cartwright King, copying me, at 08:01 on 4 July 2013.28 1 believe this shows

        Hugh undertaking the same role as I described above, namely ensuring that

        they had the relevant information (in this case, Andy Winn's update to the `local

        suspense bug' timeline I had sent to them earlier). I do not know but suspect

        that Susan Crichton forwarded the email chain to Simon Baker so that he was

        similarly "joined up" on what was being said about the `local suspense bug'.


51.     The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on any concerns I had, arising from

        what I knew about the `local suspense bug', about the overall reliability of the

        Horizon IT system. From my involvement, my understanding was that Horizon

        had some errors, but these were few, affected a small number of branches, and

        were being identified, and that there were processes in place for identifying and

        resolving the issues.29




52.     The Inquiry has also asked me about any other BEDS I was aware of by July

        2013. At the end of July 2013, I was made aware of an issue by John Scott,

        after Dave Posnett had reported observing an anomaly at a particular Post

        Office branch during a security visit.30 I was copied into emails about this and

        asked to provide legal support as appropriate, Further emails that I was copied

        into confirmed that Steve Beddoe (Senior IT Services Manager) was looking

        into the matter, and would be passing information about it on to Fujitsu. As far

        as I was concerned given my newness to the issues, those who needed to be

        aware of the issue in order to resolve it were therefore involved.31


Michael RudkinlBracknell allegations


53.     The Inquiry has asked me to comment on two further emails from mid-2013,

        sent around the same time as those mentioned above.32 I believe the first

        relates to an issue which arose out of Spot Review SR005, and involved an

        allegation made by Michael Rudkin that he had observed an individual at the

        Fujitsu office in Bracknell demonstrating an ability to alter remotely transactions

        in the Horizon system. As far as I can recall, this was the first time I encountered

collated in one place. See details of the weekly calls at paragraph [69] to [71] below.

        the allegation that it was possible for Fujitsu or POL to gain `remote access' to

        Horizon and alter individual Post Office branch accounts. I now know this to be

        a recurring theme (albeit at times expressed differently) in PMRs' complaints

        about Horizon.


54.    As reflected in P0L00060580, Simon Baker asked me to help produce a

       witness statement from someone suitable at Fujitsu to respond to the allegation,

       which was being considered by Second Sight and which they wanted to

        address. I therefore put WBD in touch with Martin Rolfe, who had been

        identified as the appropriate person to respond to the allegation, and WBD duly

        prepared and agreed a statement with him.33


55.     The email chain at POL00099340 concerns stock adjustments relating to

       stamps. I do not recall playing any role. The chain was forwarded to me on 16

        July 2013, but I was on holiday. I assume that is why I then dropped off

       subsequent emails. Those involved included Simon Baker, Craig Tuthill (Head

        of Network Services), Lin Norbury (Agents Contracts Deployment Manager

       South), Angela van den Bogerd (People Services Director) and Rod Ismay,

       who, based on my limited experience at that time, were senior individuals within

        the POL business well placed to address Post Office branch processes and

        procedures being investigated by Second Sight.

 The Helen Rose report


56.    The Helen Rose report34 is a document I was asked to look at by Susan

       Crichton in July 2013. My email to her summarising the background to the issue

       explains that Second Sight had approached Angela van den Bogerd in 2012,

       prior to the Spot Review process being established, about a potential issue

       relating to a transaction reversal at the Lepton Post Office Branch.35 Angela van

       den Bogerd asked Helen Rose (POL Security Manager - Fraud Analyst) to look

       into the transaction data to see if she could identify any anomalies around the

       transaction reversal, and Helen Rose made enquiries of Gareth Jenkins at

       Fujitsu about it. Although it appears that the Spot Review process went into this

       type of transaction issue in greater detail, superseding Helen Rose's work, it

       appeared Helen Rose nevertheless packaged the work into a report, which

       Dave Posnett sent to me on 14 June 2013.35


57.    1 understand that Helen Rose marked her report as legally privileged because

       she intended to send it to POL Legal for review. Although Dave Posnett noted

       in his email to me that the Lepton Post Office Branch did not feature as part of

       the Second Sight Spot Reviews, he asked me to consider it and provide any

       comments, particularly in terms of using the data for evidence/prosecution

       purposes. I then forwarded the email and report on to Andy Parsons at WBD

       so he could consider the issue and give me an overview.37 Andy noted that

       (contrary to Dave Posnett's understanding) the reported transaction reversal at

         the Lepton Post Office Branch did relate to the Spot Reviews, but that the Helen

         Rose report did not undermine the Spot Review response. The advice was that

         the proposed solution in the report regarding the availability of data was a

         sensible one, but would probably need the support of Fujitsu.38 I then sent the

         report on to Martin Smith and Simon Clarke at Cartwright King on 8 July 2013

         and asked them to ensure that the issue was considered as                        of their review




                                                                                   part
         of the historic prosecution files and also in connection with existing cases.39 I

        criminal prosecutions.


Liaison with senior management in connection with draft and final Second Sight

Interim Report


58.     On 2 July 2013, 1 was asked by Hugh Flemington and Susan Crichton to

        coordinate revisions to a draft briefing note40 he had prepared for Paula

        Vennells, to provide a consolidated overview of the background to and issues

        arising out of the draft Second Sight Interim Report. I do not recall the origins

        of this draft briefing note, but at some point in the process I became the one

        `holding the pen'.


59.     1 have been asked specifically to explain the background to paragraph 25 of the

        briefing note concerning a Costcutter branch and any further work I carried out

        in relation to it. I set this out at paragraphs [461 to [51] above.

60.     The Inquiry has shown me an email dated 5 July 2013 from Paula Vennells.41

        This refers to a meeting I did not attend where the issue of charging PMRs with

        more than one offence was apparently discussed. I later became aware of

        allegations that POL prosecutors had been improperly charging defendants

        with theft and false accounting so that they would plead guilty to the `lesser

        charge' of false accounting. I comment further on this subject at paragraph [200]

        below.


Circulation of finalised Second Sight Interim Report


61.     I understand that Second Sight finalised their Interim Report on 7 July 2013.

        When the final Second Sight Interim Report was first shared with POL, it went

        to people at a senior level. Having looked at my emails it appears it was then

        forwarded on to me late the same evening.42 Having reviewed the final Interim

       Report as part of the preparation of this statement, it seems broadly consistent

        with the draft I had previously seen.


62.     l have been asked specifically to comment on Second Sight's use of the word

        `systemic' in the report, which I assume refers to paragraph 8.2(a), where

       Second Sight wrote that: "we have so far found no evidence of system wide

        (systemic) problems with the Horizon software". As far as I can recall, I

       understood this to mean that although Second Sight's Interim Report discussed

       some specific issues with Horizon and user support, they had not identified any

       fundamental flaw with the system which called into question its reliability

        generally. This was regarded within POL as a positive outcome, as reflected in

        Simon Baker's email at POLO0115985.


63.     1 am also referred to my email to Paula Vennells of 8 July 2013, which provides

        commentary on the Interim Report. Reviewing the position now, it seems that

        on the evening of Sunday 7 July 2013 Paula Vennells asked for a summary of

        the comments made within POL about the Interim Report for use on a call she

        would be having with Alan Bates from the JFSA the next morning. I prepared

        that summary the same night (with some direction from Susan Crichton) and

        sent it early in the morning of Monday 8 July 2013.43 1 cannot speak for POL as

        to whether this summary fully reflected all points of disagreement with the

        Interim Report. It did, however, reflect the general concern amongst those in

        POL who were considering the Interim Report that the document often failed to

        set out clear reasoning and evidenced basis for their findings which were

        required if POL was to understand properly and start addressing the issues

        Second Sight had identified. POL had tried to encourage Second Sight to set

        out the clear reasoning and evidential basis for their findings both when Raising

        Concerns was agreed and also I recall on a call I attended before the draft

        Interim Report was finalised:

64.     POL's strategic response to the Second Sight Interim Report was a matter for

       headline legal issues, as far as I understood them, that POL Legal had been

       asked to consider following the publication of the Interim Report.44


65.    The Inquiry has asked me to comment on this draft board update as well as the

       cover email attaching it that I sent to Susan Crichton on 22 July 2013.45 I do not

       now recall how the request for the update came about. Having reviewed emails

       from around this time, it seems that I sent my email to Susan on the only day I

       worked during a period of annual leave between 13 and 25 July 2013. I was not

       across all the workstreams mentioned in the draft board update so it must have

       been created by collating, distilling and checking information from other

       sources.46 There are placeholders and queries in the draft, including asking

       Jarnail Singh to confirm who the disclosure officer was when POL prosecuted

       criminal cases. I have been asked to comment on why there was a section on

       directors' personal liabilities. I believe this was included in response to a specific

       request from the Board. The information for this part of the update came from

       WBD who sent me a summary of director's duties and actions that could give

       rise to personal liability.47


66.    1 have been asked a number of questions by the Inquiry that broadly relate to

       two of the legal issues that arose from the Second Sight Interim Report: (a) the

       approach to criminal prosecutions and past convictions, and (b) the approach

       to resolving cases that Second Sight had been investigating. I was not leading

       on either of these issues but had varying degrees of awareness of them. These

      issues were being dealt with at the same time and there was overlap between

      the two, as POL was trying to ensure a joined up approach. It may be most

      helpful to the Inquiry, however, if I deal with questions relating to each issue in

      turn. I will first briefly introduce each issue, and then address it in greater detail

      under its own heading below.


67.   In short, after the Second Sight Interim Report the main change to the approach

      to criminal prosecutions and past convictions was that prosecutorial work was

      paused while POL's external criminal lawyers, Cartwright King, carried out a

      review of past convictions in order to ensure that POL complied with its duties

      of disclosure as a prosecutor (referred to as the "Sift Review"). I discuss my

      involvement in that process in Part 4.1 below (paragraphs [731 to [751). POL's

      prosecution policy was also redrafted with the advice of external counsel (see

      Part 4.1, paragraph [93] below).


68.   Similarly, after the Second Sight Interim Report the approach taken to resolving

      cases that Second Sight had been investigating, along with similar complaints,

      shifted to the 'Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme' (the "Scheme"),

      which had been developed by POL, Second Sight and the JFSA. The idea

      behind the Scheme was that PMRs would submit their complaints to the

      Scheme through written applications articulating their concerns, which POL

      would then review and report on through a Post Office Investigation Report

      ("POIR"). This material would then be passed to Second Sight, who would make

      their own assessment of the complaint and POL's report and recommend

      whether they thought the issues were capable of resolution through

        mediation.48 I deal with the Scheme, along with issues that arose in connection

        with it, in Part 4.2 below (paragraphs [94] to [101] and [115] to [123]). Part 4.2

        will also deal with the decision to instruct Linklaters for legal advice in

        connection with POL's contract with PMRs and the subsequent instruction of

        Deloitte (paragraphs [102] to [114] below).


Regular Conference Call


69.     The Inquiry has shown me an email concerning a regular Horizon conference

        call which was set up between POL and its external lawyers in response to the

        Interim Report.49 My recollection is that the purpose behind the calls was for

        issues with Horizon to be raised and recorded so there would be visibility of

        them across the business and to avoid operating in silos. I also recall that POL's

        external criminal lawyers were keen to have these calls so as to create a record

        of Horizon issues which they could consider for disclosure in prosecutions. I

        believe this position is reflected in an email I sent on 12 July 2013 to John Scott,

        address the concerns raised by Simon Clarke regarding allegations that

        material relating to these calls was destroyed.                 As I note there, my

        understanding was that these meetings were intended to be and were minuted

        so as to ensure there was visibility amongst the business of any Horizon issues.


70.    I have no reason to believe the minutes taken of these weekly calls did not fairly

       reflect the discussions that took place. The Inquiry has asked me if there were

        discussions regarding whether notes should be taken and, if so, in what format.

        As I mentioned above, my understanding is that the very purpose of these

        meetings was to ensure that issues with Horizon were raised and recorded, so

        keeping a record in minutes was always seen as important.


71.     l do not recall contributing much to the calls, which largely seemed to focus on

        operational issues. I do not recall attending the first two calls the Inquiry has

        asked about as I was on annual leave.51 The Inquiry has asked me to comment

        on the minutes taken of the call held on 31 July 2013.52 I do not now recall that

        call, but have no reason to believe that the minutes would not fairly reflect its

        content.


PART 4.1: PROSECUTION AND REVIEW OF CRIMINAL CASES FOLLOWING THE
SECOND SIGHT INTERIM REPORT

Cartwright King advice and the Second Sight Interim Report


72.    The Inquiry has asked me about a number of pieces of advice that were given

       to POL by Cartwright King immediately before, and then following, the

       publication of the Second Sight Interim Report. As I set out at paragraph [25]

       above, I had no background in criminal law and was therefore relied on

       specialist legal advice in respect of matters relating to criminal prosecutions.


Cartwright King 'Sift Review'


73.    Shortly before Second Sight published their Interim Report I became aware

       from activity taking place in the in-house legal team that the Interim Report, and

                                                                    Witness: Rodric David Alun Williams   -

                                                                    Date: 11 March 2024

        in particular its discussion of two bugs in Horizon, had raised a significant issue

        for POL's prosecution activities which needed to be addressed, as those

        conducting the prosecution did not seem to be aware of the bugs.


74.     The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email I sent to Simon Clarke and

        Martin Smith of Cartwright King on 5                  2013, shortly before the publication




                                                       July
        of the Second Sight Interim Report.53 This refers to a summary of all Spot

        Reviews and the underlying source documents. I recall that WBD had created

        a "Spot Review Bible" to collate information on Spot Reviews in one place. Spot

        Reviews were provided to Cartwright King so that they could consider this

        material when advising POL, in the same way and for the same reasons as the

        `local suspense bug' information referred to in paragraph [49] above.


75.     Cartwright King advised that in light of the Interim Report it was necessary for

        POL to carry out a review of past convictions (i.e. the Sift Review referred to at

        paragraph [67] above) in order for POL to comply with its duties of disclosure

        as a prosecutor. Cartwright King then proceeded to carry this out. I was aware

        of the process the Sift Review would follow having been sent the protocol for it
                            .
        on 13 July 2013, and I recall reading one or two reports on particular

        prosecutions to get a feel for Cartwright King's work. I could not and did not

        express a view on the substance however, and I do not recall having any direct

        involvement in the Sift Review beyond seeking updates on it from time to time.

        Brian Altman KC subsequently carried out his own review of the Sift Review,

       which I discuss at paragraphs [83] to [84] and [87] to [88] below.

76.     The Inquiry has asked for my views on a specific piece of advice provided by

        Simon Clarke of Cartwright King, which appears to be a product of the Sift

        Review, albeit from May 2014. The advice concerns disclosure in light of the

        case of R v HosiY I do not think I have seen this advice previously, and could

       not find a record of having been sent it. However, it appears to show that

        Cartwright King were considering whether the Helen Rose report or

        Second Sight Interim Report ought to be disclosed to convicted PMRs. As I

       cannot recall seeing this advice previously, and was not involved in the detail

       of the Sift Review process, I cannot say whether disclosure was made as

       advised by Cartwright King. My recollection generally, however, is that POL

       acted consistently with the disclosure advice given by Cartwright King.


8 July 2013 Advice from Simon Clarke


77.    I have been referred to another piece of advice from Simon Clarke dated 8 July

       2013.55 I can see from my emails that the 8 July 2013 advice was provided in

       response to an email Hugh Flemington sent to Simon Clarke and Martin Smith

       at Cartwright King that day, to. which I (among others) was copied.'Although

       cannot specifically recall reading it, it is very likely that I did. I do not now recall

       having any views on it, and note that the issues discussed would have been for

       POL's criminal lawyers to take forward.

10 and 11 July 2013 Advice on the Helen Rose report


78.    I have been asked to comment on an email chain of 10 and 11 July 2013.56 This

       followed on from my sending to Cartwright King the Helen Rose report referred

       to above at [56] to [57], which I understood she had prepared in that form so

       she could take legal advice on the implications of her findings. I asked

       Cartwright King whether the Helen Rose report attracted privilege and what

       information needed to be disclosed. Cartwright King's advice as specialist

       criminal lawyers was that the information in the Helen Rose report was

       disclosable in criminal proceedings. My response was to accept this and

       request that they disclose all the information required, which they were best

       placed to take forward. In this context, I was seeking clarification from

       Cartwright King about how legal professional privilege might operate in criminal

       proceedings, with which I was not familiar. I was not seeking to withhold

       information in the Helen Rose report from inspection and specifically asked for

       it to be disclosed.


79.    I had no informed basis then, and still have none now, on which to express a

       view on the criminal law advice received from Cartwright King57 about whether

       the Helen Rose report undermined Gareth Jenkins as an expert witness in

       criminal proceedings.

15 and 19 July 2013 Simon Clarke advice


80.     The Inquiry has asked me to comment on two further pieces of advice provided

        by Simon Clarke on 15 and 19 July 2013.58 I was away on annual leave at the

        time these pieces of advice were received but was, I believe, sent them on or

        around the time they were prepared. I do not now recall anything specific about

        the 19 July. 2013 advice, but I am likely to have found it useful information. I do

        however recall the 15 July 2013 advice raised Cartwright King's serious

        concerns about evidence which Gareth Jenkins had provided in prosecutions.

        I believe however that those concerns would have been taken forward as

        appropriate by POL's criminal lawyers and recall there being a general

        consensus following this advice that Gareth Jenkins could no longer be used

        as a witness in criminal proceedings.


2 August 2013 Simon Clarke advice


81.     On 2 August 2013, Simon Clarke provided further advice on document

        retention.59 As far as I can recall this was the first time I became aware of any

        suggestions about the "shredding" of notes from weekly conference calls. I do

        not know who made that suggestion. It certainly was not me and I was deeply

        concerned by it. I assisted Susan Crichton in drafting a response to the Simon

        Clarke advice.60 This expressed POL's concern about the suggestion that an

        attempt had been made to destroy material associated with the Horizon weekly

        minutes would continue to be taken and stored.


Initial CCRC Engagement


82.     The CCRC first contacted POL on 12 July 2013, after the publication of the

        Second Sight Interim Report.61 I have been asked to comment on an email sent

        by Susan Crichton to Andy Parsons            16 July 2013 regarding advice that




                                                on
        Cartwright King had given to POL on its response to the CCRC's initial letter. I

        was on leave at that time so did not get involved, but I am aware that the

       outcome was that POL decided to take further advice on how to respond, which

        led to Brian Altman KC being approached (discussed at paragraph [83] below).

       As far as I can recall, the action POL took following the CCRC letter of 12 July

       2013 is reflected in the correspondence between POL and the CCRC that has

       been provided to me by the Inquiry.62 I discuss the engagement I later had with

       the CCRC at paragraphs [154] to [155] and [158] to [166] below.


Brian Altman KC Advice


83.    As mentioned above, Brian Altman KC was initially approached following POL's

       receipt of the 12 July 2013 initial letter from the CCRC and, as well as advising

       POL on the CCRC, was asked to provide an interim review of the "Sift

       Review".63 As I do not recall contributing to the terms of reference to which Brian

       Altman KC's advice responded, I cannot comment on why POL decided to ask

       him to advise on the 'efficacy' rather than the 'safety' of convictions, or what the

       distinction between those words may be. I also cannot comment on how the

       time period covered by Brian Altman KC's review came to be set, although I

       believe from subsequent discussions that the 2010 cut-off related to the timing

       of the upgrade from Horizon Legacy to Horizon Next Generation or HNG:X,

       when as part of the upgrade each Post Office branch underwent a physical cash

       and stock check which balanced each branch's account, effectively resetting it

       on the new system.


Brian Altman KC's Interim Review of Cartwright King's Current Process


84.    Brian Altman KC provided his 'Interim Review of Cartwright King's Current

       Process' on 2 August 2013.64 That review was provided to Cartwright King, who

       produced a response on 13August 2013.65 Cartwright King addressed some of

       the concerns that Brian Altman KC had raised, and suggested that a joint

       conference would be useful to ensure that the Sift Review of criminal

       convictions was effective. The Cartwright King response was sent to Susan

       Crichton, with a request that it be sent to Brian Altman KC along with the Sift

       Review Protocol that Cartwright King had created66 and Simon Clarke's advice

       of 2 August 2013 on disclosure (referred to at paragraph [81] above).67

Conference of 9 September 2013 with Brian Altman KC


85.    The Inquiry has asked me to comment on two notes of the conference with

       Brian Altman KC that took place on 9 September 2013.88 1 do not recall these

       notes, but it is possible that they were sent to me at or around the time they

       were made. The first note was clearly taken by WBD. Although I recall attending

       Brian Altman KC's chambers on several occasions, I do not have any

       recollection of this conference specifically. Given the other attendees, I am likely

       to have attended to continue to make sure the actions being taken were "joined

       up" within POL, and that I could take forward any that might apply to me. I have

       no reason to think that the notes of the conference do not reflect what happened

       or omitted any material matter discussed. Since I have no clear recollection of

       the conference, I cannot add anything regarding what was said about any of

       the specific points mentioned in the two notes.


Conference of 4 October 2013 with Brian Altman KC


86.    I have been asked by the Inquiry for my recollection of a conference held with

       Brian Altman KC on 4 October 2013. 1 do not now have any specific recollection

       of this conference either, and, although I can see it in my diary, my emails from

       around the time suggest I may have been occupied with another matter and

       asked someone else to step in. In any event, it seems that this was a telephone

       conference call to assist Brian Altman KC complete his advice, by giving him

       an opportunity to discuss a number of the actions identified at the 9 September

       2013 conference with Cartwright King and WBD.

Brian Altman KC's backward-looking Review of Prosecutions


87.     I have been referred to the `Review of Prosecutions' that Brian Altman KC

        completed on 15 October 2013, which was emailed to me by Gavin Matthews

        that day.69 This was a "backwards-looking" review (as opposed to the "forward-

        looking" review Brian Altman KC later produced, which focused on what any

        future POL prosecutions might look like). The 15 October 2013 review

        commented on the Sift Review, and also proposed measures to control the

        collation and future dissemination of information about Horizon issues.

        Recognising the importance of this advice, I will have read it on or shortly after

        receiving it. Like others, I will have taken comfort from it that the approach POL

        was taking was sound, and that the appropriate people in and advising POL

        had access to the advice to take its actions forward.


88.     My attention has been drawn by the Inquiry to paragraph [641, [70], and [71] of

        the advice. These appear to relate to the time period covered by Brian Altman

        KC's review. I cannot add anything to what I have said at paragraph [83] above,

        In relation to paragraph [130] of the advice, I only add to what I have already

        said above at paragraphs [44] to [45] above in relation to the Callendar Square

        bug that the advice suggested it was no longer an issue having been fixed but

        might still need to be considered if the issue surfaced through the Scheme.

        Paragraph [129] of the advice accords with what I recall about Brian Altman

        KC's advice at paragraph [120] below. Consistent with this advice, and the

        approach we were generally trying to take at POL of `joining up' the legal experts

        with the work being undertaken to understand PMRs' complaints about Horizon,

        Cartwright King was involved in reviewing every application and POIR produced

        for the Scheme.


Board update of October 2013 in Respect of Brian Altman KC's advice


89.     I can see from documents provided by the Inquiry that in October 2013 I was

        approached by Martin Edwards (POL Chief of Staff) to comment on some text

        relating to Brian Altman KC's review that he intended to include in a report he

        was preparing. I duly did this, explaining the basis for the amendments I

        suggested be made.


90.     1 have been asked when the Board was made aware of the Helen Rose report,

        I do not know what the Board had been told about this report before October

        2013.7° Board papers were not generally shared with me in those days and I

        did not attend Board or Executive Committee meetings.71 I have been asked to

        comment on why I said in an email to Martin Edwards on 24 October 2013 that

        "it is sensible to keep references to the Helen Rose Report [to] a minimum as it

        may not be a live issue going forward' 72 The email chain shows that I worked

        with Martin Edwards to provide the information he needed for his purposes,

        which I understood to be a short summary that he was intending to include in a

        larger report also addressing other issues. In that context, I felt that the

        references to the Helen Rose Report (which I appear to have introduced in my

        first round of comments on the draft summary) could be kept to a minimum,

         particularly in light of the external criminal law advice received around it, which

        I also noted in the email.


Brian Altman KC's forward-looking Review of Post Office Ltd Prosecution Role


91.      Brian Altman KC provided his 'Review of Post Office Ltd Prosecution Role' on

         19 December 2013,73 finalising a draft he had shared in October 2013.74 As

        with his "backward-looking" advice, I am likely to have read this at the time I

        received the draft, or shortly afterwards. This was "forward-looking advice",

        considering the future of POL's prosecution role and revisions to its prosecution

        policy.


92.     The Inquiry has asked me to comment on Brian Altman KC's statement that

        'ttlhe Horizon data integrity issue was an exceptional instance of Post Office

        Ltd prosecutorial failure of serial non-disclosure in breach of Post Office Ltd's

        disclosure obligations". I understood this to refer to disclosure failures identified

        by Simon Clarke in his 15 July 2013 advice note, referred to at [80] above.75 I

        understood from paragraph, 5(iv) of document P0L00112937 that Brian Altman

        KC's view was that POL had, since the failings he identified, taken appropriate

        steps to remedy the situation, and had (or would) put in place processes to

        ensure that such failures were not repeated if any future prosecutions took

        place. I had no informed basis then, and still have no informed basis now, for

        expressing a view on whether POL should continue to act as a prosecutor in

        private prosecutions, and I do not recall ever being formally asked for my views

        on this.


93.     l was later asked to assist in coordinating, with the help of external lawyers,

        material for POL senior management about what a new prosecution policy

        could look like. This was done in conjunction with external lawyers and internal

        POL Legal colleagues, on the premise that POL would resume undertaking

        prosecutions. However, as far as I am aware, POL did not resume routine

        prosecutions.76


PART 4,2 MEDIATION SCHEME AND RELATED MATTERS


Setting up of the Scheme and Process


94.     Although paragraph 8.2(a) of Second Sight's Interim Report stated that: "we

        have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the

        Horizon software", (see paragraph [621 above), their work did not resolve the

        individual complaints from PMRs which they had been considering, or other

        similar complaints that could come forward. POL therefore sought to address

        and resolve the complaints through the introduction of the Scheme. People with

        a range of skills were asked to be involved in the Scheme, including with respect

        to operational matters around how Post Office branches work. Initially, there

        was significant optimism that the Scheme, which had been developed with

        Second Sight and the JFSA, could help to resolve the PMRs` complaints, albeit

        that many of these had not yet been articulated to, or looked into by, POL.




's I understand a few prosecutions took place where the evidence of criminal offending was completely
independent of Horizon.

95.     I do not recall having a specific role within the team managing the overall

        conduct of the Scheme, but I was available to them, as a member of POL legal,

        to provide such support as they or the external lawyers supporting them might

        require. I would also occasionally review specific pieces of work (e.g. POIRs or

        Second Sight reviews relating to particular complaints) to get a feel for what

        they looked like and how they were being dealt with to make sure they would

        support the Scheme's aims.


96.     The Scheme was supervised by a "Working Group", chaired by a retired

        Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) judge, Sir Anthony Hooper. The Working

        Group was composed of representatives from Second Sight, the JFSA and

        POL. The POL contingent was led by POL's then interim General Counsel,

       Chris Aujard, and its secretariat was provided by Belinda Crowe (who was, I

        understood, essentially POL's Scheme director). Although I believe I attended

       several early Working Group meetings by telephone conference when the

       Scheme was being established, I only recall attending one in-person Working

       Group meeting once the Scheme was up-and-running."


97.    WBD were instructed to provide the main legal support for the Scheme,

       consistent with the general approach referred to at paragraphs [23] and [24]

       above of POL using external legal support for large, long-running and/or

       complex matters. As noted at paragraph [88] above, Cartwright King were

       involved in reviewing every application and POIR produced for the Scheme so

          to provide specific criminal law input when this was required.


Legal Support for PMRs


98.       The Inquiry has asked me to explain how POL decided to offer Scheme

          applicants £1,500 excluding VAT to pay for professional advisers in relation to

          the Scheme.'& I do not recall how this decision was reached or who ultimately

          signed it off. I assume it was a commercial decision, having regard to

          considerations such as a range of possible adviser hourly rates. Financial

          support was also available for preparing for and attending a mediation (at £750

          plus VAT for a half day or £1,250 plus VAT for a full day). POL did recognise

          that a Scheme applicant might incur further costs and, as far as I am aware,

          POL always intended to keep an open mind about such costs as they might

          need to be addressed in order to resolve individual cases. It also appears from

          the Working Group document referred to me by the Inquiry entitled 'Key. points

          and actions from the conference call at 1pm on 5 December 2013' that the

          Working Group agreed that additional funding could be applied for in

          exceptional circumstances.79 Although I am recorded as having attended that

          call, I have no specific recollection of it.


Second Sight Reports for the Mediation Scheme


99.       As I explained at paragraph [68] above, as part of the Scheme Second Sight

          would make their own assessment of the complaint and POL's PAIR report into

          it. The Inquiry has asked me to consider an email chain from March 2014 which

        I believe relates to the report Second Sight prepared for the Scheme about the

        Castleton case."6 I had limited direct engagement with Second Sight, but to the

        best of my recollection the concerns expressed in this email reflect the concerns

        of those within the Scheme team about Second Sight's work, namely that

        Second Sight would make statements without setting out the reasoning or the

        evidence on which they were based (which was similar to POL's concerns about

        the Interim Report). They would also comment, sometimes quite stridently, on

        matters outside their areas of expertise, such as criminal law, and did not seem

        to reflect POL's position as explained in the POIR so as to present a balanced

        account. Ultimately though, there was little that POL could do about these

        concerns beyond raising them with Second Sight, given that Second Sight were

        acting independently of POL.


Issue of Remote Access in the context of the Mediation Scheme


100. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on some emails showing that advice

        was taken on whether, and in what form, to disclose the Helen Rose report to

        applicants to the Scheme.81 As far as i can tell, the position adopted by POL

        was to follow the advice and disclose the report.


101. The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on an email sent to Andy Parsons

        on 22 April 2014 concerning an internal POL email from 2008.82 As far as I can

        tell, I first saw the 2008 internal POL email when I was sent it on 14 April 2014

        in the context of a Scheme claim. The email raised the issue of remote access

        (albeit in a different manner from the way remote access was raised by Michael

        Rudkin, mentioned at paragraphs [531 to [541 above). I discussed this with Andy

        Parsons, who drew out for me the questions it raised for POL but which Fujitsu

        would need to answer.83 These questions were then sent to Fujitsu, whose

        responses were provided to me on 17 April 2014 and, I believe it was relayed

        to Second Sight. I believe that the question of how, and to what extent, Fujitsu

        had the ability to alter Post Office branch data remotely continued be explored

        with Fujitsu, but I do not now recall the details of what was done at this particular

        time. I assisted in providing an interim answer to this question in May 2014,

        based on what I had been told by Fujitsu's subject matter experts,84 and a more

        detailed explanation was completed by Andy Parsons in late 2014 for

        confirmation by Fujitsu.85 I do not recall considering at that time whether

        criminal law advice should be taken around whether this information needed to

        be disclosed, but I believe that such advice was sought from Cartwright King

       and Brian Altman KC when the issue arose again in mid-2015 in connection

       with the "Part Two" Report Second Sight was preparing as part of the Scheme.

Instruction of Linklaters And Deloitte


My involvement with the instruction of ,Linklaters in April 2014


102. I do not know precisely when or how POL decided to seek advice about the

        Scheme from Linklaters, but in March 2014 POL's Scheme team and Chris

        Aujard asked me to assist in getting Linklaters to provide advice to POL's Board

        on the legal claims and potential financial exposures raised by the claims made

        under the Scheme. My role in this was to help provide information to Linklaters

        to enable them to provide that advice, and work with them to produce a report

        which would be comprehensible and useful for the Board.


103. I am sure I reviewed and commented on the Linklaters report into the legal

        issues with the Scheme when it was received.° I believe that POL00107317

        was the final version of the Linklaters report, but I cannot be sure, as I was not

        responsible for sharing the final advice with the Board, and further amendments

        may have been made before it was sent to them. For completeness I have seen

        an email in which I forwarded P0L00107317 to two colleagues in the POL legal

        team for their information as it may have been relevant to their work. I do not

        know who else received the Linklaters report at this time, and I did not attend

        the Board meeting at which it was discussed.87

2014 (POL00107317)
87 At this time, I did not attend Board meetings or receive the document packs prepared for them, and
would typically only see extracts from the minutes of the meetings if I specifically asked for them.

104. I do not recall having any substantive input into the papers produced by

        Linklaters around the future of the Scheme, which the Inquiry has shared with

        me.88


My involvement with the instruction of Deloitte


105. As with the instruction of Linklaters, I do not recall precisely when or how POL

        decided to instruct IT specialists at Deloitte. I became aware of the decision

        when, around early April 2014, I was asked to help agree the terms of Deloitte's

        engagement. I understood that the aim was for Deloitte to provide an objective

        report into the reliability of Horizon along the lines recommended by Linklaters

       in their recent advice. This could enable Linklaters to advise further, and assist

       the Board in considering Scheme-related legal risks and financial liabilities.89

       Although I could assist in documenting Deloitte's engagement, I would not have

       engaged in detail with the substance of their work because I did not and do not

       have the technical expertise to do so.


106.   1 do not recall who or how the scope of the instruction to Deloitte was

       determined but, given the potential scale of the task it was likely to be an

       iterative process undertaken in stages, the first of which was a 'desktop' review

       of the available documentation dealing with the operational, controls around

       Horizon that should ensure it was processing transactions reliably. That is my

       understanding of why POL initially did not require Deloitte to "comment on or

       test the quality of the assurance work performed, nor opine on its adequacy,

        sufficiency or conclusions", which I understood would amount to an audit of the

        audit processes used, rather than a review of the assurance work itself. The

        same applies to Deloitte not being required to comment on "the integrity of the

        Horizon HNG-X processing environment (nor the legacy Horizon system)",

        which I understood was initially out of scope so that Deloitte's preliminary

        review could start with the assurance environment before turning to its actual

        operation.


107. There was an impetus to proceed quickly, and I recall that, as well as Chris

        Aujard and Belinda Crowe, Lesley Sewell was involved in signing off the

        Deloitte engagement letter.' My role in this as a POL in-house lawyer included

        recording in the engagement letter the legal context in which the instruction was

        happening, so as to support any future claim of legal professional privilege that

        could be made over Deloitte's work. As 1 mentioned at paragraph [105], Deloitte

        were instructed at the recommendation of Linklaters to inform Linklaters' advice

        on the legal claims and potential financial exposures raised by the PMRs' claims

        made under the Scheme, also bearing in mind that PMRs might sue POL over

        their allegations if mediation failed.

        this work, with my responsibilities being to ensure Deloitte were on track, that

        any important issues were promptly identified and that their output, in particular

        the executive summaries, were clear and digestible for the target audience. Two

        email chains, dated 22-23 April 201492 provided to me by the Inquiry reflect the

        type of support I provided. Although I did not understand the technical matters

        being discussed, I was still able to facilitate the work of those who did.


109.     The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on an email exchange I had with

        Mark Westbrook at Deloitte on 20 May 2014, which I explore in more detail in

        the section of my statement dealing with remote access at paragraph [145J.s3


110. The Inquiry has asked me to consider a number of draft Deloitte Project Zebra

        reports and draft Board updates.94 My recollection of Deloitte's `Project Zebra

        ~-- Phase 1 Report: Draft'95 was that it provide an overview of the work Deloitte

        had done so far and suggested some next steps. It prompted the Board to raise

        some specific questions with Deloitte in a Board meeting on 30 April 2014

        (which I did not attend, but was sent brief minutes of), including seeking

        assurance over how Horizon recorded and maintained transaction logs, both

        pre- and post-2010.96

111. I assisted in defining the scope of instruction for the second phase of Deloitte's

       work. This was not easy as I had not attended the Board meeting which

       instructed this, but the scope was discussed on a call held early on 7 May 2014

       which I. attended with Lesley Sewell, Gareth James and others. I followed this

       call up with a '"starter-for-ten' which aims to capture the essence of our call',

       which I emailed to POL and Deloitte colleagues shortly before a further call at

       4.30pm the same afternoon. I appear to have sent a further draft following that

       call for Gareth's review before a final position was agreed on 9 May 2014.97

       This second phase of work was reflected in a Change Order,98 reflecting the

       extension of Deloitte's work to demonstrating Horizon was operating with

       integrity and that the transition from the original Horizon Legacy to the current

       HNG-X had been properly managed. Deloitte then proceeded to draft a "HNG-

       X: Review of Assurance Sources Board Update",99 which I received and

       commented on 18 May 2014, and then discussed with Gareth James at POL's

       office on 19 May 2014. The final report, "Desktop Review of Assurance Sources

       and Key Control Features — Draft for Discussion" dated 23 May 2014 (the "May

       2014 Deloitte Report"), was released to POL on 26 May 2014.100


112. Once POL had received Deloitte's report, it was shared with Linklaters, who

       discussed it with Chris Aujard at a meeting I did not attend, before Chris Aujard

       emailed me to say the report may require "a substantial re-write". After speaking

       to Chris (I think by telephone), I relayed this to Deloitte and a proposed structure

        suggested by Linklaters for a "repackaged" report was sent to Deloitte on 29

        May 2014.101


113.     My role in relation to this further report is reflected in two email chains provided

        to me by the Inquiry.102 There was frustration within POL about the speed and

        form of delivery of Deloitte's work, which I believe Chris reflected in his email to

        Paula Vennells.103 Essentially, there seemed to be a disconnect between POL

        and Deloitte over the how best to present their work. This I believe led to Chris

        asking Deloitte to synthesise from their work and findings a shortened "Board

        Briefing" focused on Horizon's Core Audit Process.104 I was asked by Chris

        Aujard to keep working with Deloitte on this, which involved a number of

        discussions (by telephone and most likely also in person) and exchanges of

        drafts with Deloitte. This sometimes involved the exchange of whole draft

        documents. At other times we might exchange specific extracts being

        discussed (I believe POL.00031408 is an example of this, whereby specific text

        would be cut and pasted into an email which could be considered in email

        format while being discussed).


114. I did not attend the Board meeting or meetings which considered Deloitte's

        reports, and do not recall any specific actions arising out of them. Having

        reviewed my emails, I appear to have attended a call with Deloitte and POL IT

        and Internal Audit colleagues on 2 July 2014 to discuss next steps, with my

       primary concern being the "balancing transactions" process identified by

       Deloitte (discussed further below). I do not know whether any aspect of this

       work was taken forward by other parts of the business, but I sought to get

       Deloitte's permission to release the report to WBD and Cartwright King so that

       they could consider them as part of the support they were providing for POL.


The Mediation Scheme in mid-2014


Second Sight's Thematic Review and Briefing Report Part 1


115. lam aware that Second Sight produced two overarching reports in connection

       with the Scheme, although I do not recall the specific sequence of events that

       led to them. The first was the `Thematic Review and Briefing Report Part 1'

       (sometimes called the "Part One" report) which set out various background

       matters concerning Post Office operations likely to arise from applications to

       the Scheme. These matters would not have been familiar to those without prior

       experience of the operation of Post Office branches (for example, someone

       providing professional advice to a Scheme applicant). I do not recall having any

       material input into the production of these documents, although twill have seen

       them around this time.


116.   1 would not have sufficiently interrogated the detail of either the "Thematic

       Issues Report" or "Briefing Report — Part One" to assess points raised in Andy

       Parsons' emails and mark-ups, but because they were being raised directly with

        the POL Scheme team I would have no reason to think they would not be taken

        forward as appropriate.105


Changes to the Scheme


117. As 1 explained at paragraph [96] above, the Scheme was administered by a

        Working Group, chaired by Sir Anthony Hooper and composed of

        representatives from Second Sight, PMRs and POL. I was not a member of the

        Working Group and my involvement with its meetings was early on when the

        Scheme was being established, and I only recall attending one in-person

        Working Group meeting once the Scheme was up-and-running. I am therefore

        not well placed to comment on changes to the Scheme or what led to them.

        The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email from David Oliver circulating

        a briefing note for POL about the Working Group on 1 May 2014, which copied

        me and Andy Parsons of WBD.106 I do not know why I was copied into this email

        and cannot recall reading the briefing note.


Reviewing the issue of criminal convictions within the Scheme


118. The documents provided to me by the Inquiry show that POL had received

        advice from Brian Altman KC in 2013 about whether cases involving criminal

        prosecutions were suitable for mediation. This advice was given in the context

        of the Scheme being launched and various other issues relating to prosecutions

        that POL was looking into at the time.107


119. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email of 16 July 2014 to

        Chris Aujard, summarising advice that POL received in a further call with Brian

        Altman KC specifically in relation to the Scheme.108 I believe this call arose

        because the Working Group was looking into whether applications involving

        criminal convictions should be mediated under the Scheme. It seems from my

        emails that Cartwright King had provided some advice that the POL Scheme

        team wanted to test, which I suggested be done with Brian Altman KC.109 I do

        not now recall who else attended the call, but I sent my summary of it to Chris

        Aujard shortly afterwards on 16 July 2014. He was not able to attend the call

        but I believe would have wanted to know the outcome of it for his dealings with

        the Working Group.


120. Based on the call with Brian Altman KC, I understood his advice to POL to be

        that (bearing in mind Scheme cases were already being reviewed by criminal

        lawyers (see paragraphs [88J above)) there was a risk that things said or done

        at a mediation (e.g., an offer of compensation or even expression of regret)

        could in and of themselves be used to support an appeal against conviction.

        This would be "new" evidence in that it would not have been available at the

        time of the original prosecution, having only been created through.a mediation

        taking place several years after that prosecution.


121. Brian Altman KC was later asked for written advice on this issue, and I can see

        from his note dated 5 September 2014110 that he spoke with me and

        Gavin Matthews of WBD on 31 July 2014 about a proposal put forward by the

        Working Group Chair for dealing with Scheme applicants with a criminal

        conviction or caution. I presume this arose from a Working Group meeting

        which discussed the issue but which I do not believe I attended. My recollection

        is that the advice was in essence that the proposal did not mitigate the identified

        risks of mediating with Scheme applicants with convictions. The broad

        approach adopted by POL in light of this was to take three steps in relation to

        these PMRs: (a) provide them with the POIR for their case; (b) provide them

        with the Second Sight report for their case; and (c) confirm to them that POL

        would not be mediating with them.


Emerging concerns about the Scheme


122. While I was not close to the operation of the Scheme or Working Group

        dynamics, I do recall gathering from colleagues attending Working Group

        meetings that the Scheme was not functioning as well as hoped, seemingly due

        to a significant misalignment of expectations between some PMRs and POL

        regarding culpability for the events that had been raised and investigated, and

        what might be financially recoverable as a consequence. A wide range of

        monetary amounts were being sought (some very low and others very high),

       some of the concerns were not clear, and POL was operating on an

       interpretation of its rights and responsibilities underpinned by Linklaters' advice.


123. This led I believe to PMRs becoming increasingly unwilling to engage with

       POL's position in the Working Group, and there were real concerns amongst

       the POL project team about the pace and consistency of the reviews being done

       .by Second Sight.


PART 5: SECOND SIGHT'S PART 2 REPORT AND MEDIATION SCHEME
THEREAFTER

The draft Second Sight Part 2 Mediation Briefing Report


124. The draft `Second Sight Part 2 Mediation Briefing Report' (sometimes called the

       "Part Two" report) dated 30 July 2014 was a report produced by Second Sight

       to expand on common themes raised by PMR applicants to the Scheme now

       that a number of individual cases had been reviewed. I recall that the reaction

       to the draft from the POL Scheme team was that it raised matters that seemed

       to go beyond Second Sight's remit in the Scheme, and raised matters on which

       they did not agree and wanted to comment.11' One area of perceived overreach

       was Second Sight's commentary on the standard postmaster contract. I was

       asked to forward the draft Part Two report to Linklaters for their support in

       responding to this issue on 1 August 2014.112 I do not recall why Linklaters (as

       opposed to, say, WBD) was asked for support.

125. I was on annual leave between 4 and 12 August 2014. The documents provided

       to me by. the Inquiry show that Linklaters gave their advice on 6 August 2014

       and Belinda Crowe instructed WBD the same day to draft a letter to Second

       Sight regarding the draft Second Sight Part Two report, incorporating Linklaters'

       views as appropriate. I believe the letter was drafted on the basis that Chris

       Aujard would be the sender,113 but he was away on his own annual leave by

       the time it was ready on 14 August 2014, so the final letter was sent in my name

       with a covering email noting that I was dealing with matters while he was

       away 114 I was content to put my name to the final letter, having read a clean

       copy and satisfied myself of its content, as I knew it was the product of work

       between the POL team and supported by both Linklaters and WBD.


126.   Second Sight proceeded to issue the final Part Two report to the Working Group

       on or about 21 August 2014. The POL Scheme team then raised their concerns

       about the Part Two report with the Working Group. I can see from documents I

       have reviewed that on 22 August 2014, the Chair of the Working Group decided

       that the Part Two report should be released to Scheme applicants "as drafted",

       with all parties, including POL, being able to write to applicants setting out their

       position on the report.

Sharing the Second Sight Part Two report


127. The Second Sight Part Two Report was shared with Fujitsu upon receipt. The

        Inquiry has drawn my attention to the fact that three weeks later, on 15

        September 2014, 1 shared it with Fujitsu again, along with POL's draft

        response.i15 It was POL's usual practice to share a report like this with the

        potentially affected stakeholders, and POL needed Fujitsu to answer questions

        about the technical functioning of Horizon raised by the Part Two report which

        POL could not answer internally. I asked Fujitsu to look specifically at these

        technical areas. Fujitsu shared its response with POL on 16 September 2014. 16

       Its key concern was around the lack of evidence set out by Second Sight to

       back up the concerns they had raised. I shared the Fujitsu response with Andy

       Pheasant of WBD to get his views, but I cannot recall what the next steps were

       in relation to this.


128. The Inquiry has also asked me to comment generally on the relationship

       between POL and Fujitsu. I was aware that POL had a very substantial and

       commercially important relationship with POL, which extended beyond the

       PMR challenges about Horizon with which I was involved. Fujitsu seemed to

       have great confidence in Horizon, in particular its Core Audit Process, and

       seemed willing to provide to POL the information and support it asked for, and

       which POL needed given it did not have the internal expertise to provide. It is

       clear following the Horizon Issues trial that of some of that information did not

       the Known Error Log discussed further at paragraphs [222] to [223] below).


Information requested by Second Sight about suspense accounts


129. It appears that around the time that Second Sight were publishing their draft

       Part Two report they made a request to POL concerning suspense accounts. I

       understood the basic issue to be that Second Sight wanted to understand

       whether POL may have taken branch shortfalls into its suspense accounts, but

       I do not recall where or how this issue came to be raised, or being substantively

       involved in POL's response to it.


130. The Inquiry has showed me an email chain dealing with Second Sight's request

       for suspense data.117 I was uneasy about providing the requested information

       because it seemed to concern POL's relationships with its commercial partners

       rather than branch accounts. I therefore suggested a way in which the data

       might be summarised to help inform how the matter could be taken forward.

       From 4 to 12 August 2014 1 was on holiday, and I then appear to have been

       dropped from the thread and do not believe I participated further in the

       discussion around this issue.


131. I have also been referred to another email chain from early 2015 on the issue,

       which I am not copied into.'18 It appears from reading it that the "Rod" referred

132.   In the course of preparing this statement, I have revisited the Post Office

       Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme report of 2015 (sometimes called the

       "End of Term Report").' 1s This was prepared at the conclusion of the Scheme

       to capture in one place POL's overall review of the Scheme in a form which

       could be shared with applicants. Paragraphs 54 and 55 of the End of Term

       Report indicate that POL was "able to answer Second Sight's questions [about

       suspense accounts} when a shared understanding of the nature of the enquiry

       had been reached" and "Second Sight agreed that it needed no further

       information on the Suspense Account".


Communications and public affairs strategy during the Scheme


133.   POL's Communications and Public Affairs ("Comms") team was responsible for

       engaging with MPs both generally and with respect to the Scheme. I would

       provide support to that team as and when it was required, usually by providing

       specific information or ensuring consistency with previous communications.


134. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email from Mark Davies sent on

       23 January 2015.124 This email appears to reflect his personal views on the

       Second Sight Investigation and Horizon issues generally, and is responded to

        views were shared within POL.


Advice from Tom Weisselberg KC


135. The Inquiry has drawn my attention to an email from Patrick Bourke

        summarising a conference with Tom Weisselberg KC in November 2014.121 The

        POL Scheme team had instructed Tom Weisselberg KG to advise on the

        amenability to judicial review of any decision POL took with respect to the

        Scheme, and in particular the prospects of a successful judicial review if it

        decided to close the Scheme. I do not believe I was party to the decision to take

        advice from Tom Weisselberg KG, so do not know what specifically triggered

        this. A conference with Tom Weisselberg KC was scheduled for 24 November

        2014. I was sent the instructions prepared, I believe by Patrick Bourke, on 20

        November 2014. 1 recall attending the conference and agree that it is fairly

        summarised by Patrick.

136. I have been asked to comment on an email from Patrick Bourke sent on

        consequences, of any decision by POL to terminate Second Sight's

       engagement122, and some related documents123. I can see that Patrick Bourke

        stated that a discussion would be taking place at a "senior level" on 6 February

        2015, but I do not recall being involved in those discussions or the preparations

        for them. The outcome of that work was, in essence, to close the Working

        Group, have Second Sight complete its (revised) Part Two report and its case

        review reports for all the remaining applicants to the Scheme (POL having

        completed all of its investigation reports by this time). POL would then offer

        mediation in all cases except those the subject of a final court determination.


137.    This position was reflected in the suite of correspondence emailed to me by

        Andy Parsons on 5 March 2015,121 which I (among others) reviewed and

        commented on. Although this outcome involved the termination on notice of

        Second Sight's existing engagement with POL, they were at the same time

        being instructed to continue to have a role in the Scheme, involving completing

        their case review reports directly for each Scheme applicant.125 A new

        engagement letter was signed between POL and Second Sight on 15 April

        2015. 1 believe therefore that this reflects a change to the structure within which

        Second Sight would complete the same work, rather than the cancellation of

        that work.

        Second Sight about it in June 2015.128 l do not recall who precisely asked me

        to look into this issue, but it will have come from the POL Scheme team. The

        exchange begins with a letter from me to Second Sight, in which I asked Second

        Sight a number of questions about its handling of the report, over which POL

        was asserting legal professional privilege. Second Sight had referred to the

        letter in a Case Review Report prepared in the context of the Scheme. The

        basis on which POL was asserting privilege was that the 2006 document

        appears to have been prepared for the Corporate Security Criminal Law Team,

        with the penultimate paragraph of the report expressly reading "These papers

        are now forwarded to you for sight and advice on the sufficiency of evidence as

        to whether criminal charges are brought against Mrs Hamilton".


139. As noted at paragraph [25] above, I have no experience or expertise in criminal

        matters, so am not able to determine whether there was anything in the report

        capable of casting doubt on the safety of Jo Hamilton's conviction. However, as

        noted at paragraph [88] and [97]] above Cartwright King were reviewing cases

       in the Scheme for that purpose and had reviewed this specific case.


PART 6: KNOWLEDGE OF REMOTE ACCESS PRIOR TO THE GROUP

LITIGATION


140. I have been asked a number of questions that relate to POL's knowledge of

       what has generally been described as "remote access", that is, the ability of

       those at Fujitsu or POL to alter transactions recorded by a PMR through Horizon

        without that PMR being aware. I am not an IT specialist and this was a highly

        technical matter, however, to assist the Inquiry I set out at this juncture what I

        recollect my knowledge to be of the issue at different stages prior to the

        commencement of the Group Litigation.


2013 Allegations of Remote Access


141. As I mention at paragraph [531 I first became aware of remote access

        allegations in mid-2013 in the context of the Spot Reviews where a PMR had

        alleged that Fujitsu could remotely alter transaction records. As I explain at

        paragraph [54], 1 instructed WBD to obtain a witness statement for Second

        Sight in response to this.


Remote Access in Spring 2014


142. In April 2014 in the context of the Scheme, the issue of remote access came to

       my attention again. I again discussed this with WBD, who advised what

       information should be sought from Fujitsu. I wrote to James Davidson of Fujitsu

       on 17 April 2014 and asked whether POL or Fujitsu could change branch.

       transaction data without a PMR being aware of the change. He confirmed that

       POL could not change branch transaction data without a PMR being aware of

       the change. He stated in his summary that there was "no ability to delete or

       change records a branch creates in either old Horizon or Horizon on line.

        Transactions in both systems are created in a secure and auditable way to

       assure integrity'.127 Fujitsu explained that it was possible for additional

       transactions to be inserted by Fujitsu (and not POL) in the event of error and

            summarised the security process for doing so (known as `balancing

            transactions'). They had only identified this occurring once since the migration

            to Horizon Online, in March 2010, and stated that this was covered by "an

            auditable log„


143. I believe, but cannot be certain, that the information that Fujitsu provided in April

            2014 was shared with Second Sight. I explain this and some of the follow up

            work at paragraph [1011. Around the same time, POL had instructed Deloitte to

            undertake its desktop review of the Horizon system. The explanation that

            Fujitsu had given in April 2014 about the possibility of balancing transactions

            was also shared with Deloitte.128


144. In May 2014 documents were being prepared by Deloitte for POL's Board. The

            May 2014 Deloitte Report states in a table at Appendix 2 that there were

            database access privileges that "would enable a person to delete a digitally

            signed basket" and that such privileges were restricted to authorised

           administrators at Fujitsu. It also mentioned that there were database access

           privileges that would theoretically "enable a person to create or amend a basket

           and re-sign it with a 'fake' key", again such privileges were restricted to

           authorised administrators at Fujitsu.129 The version of the Board Briefing shared

           with me by the Inquiry states that it was possible for "Fujitsu staff with suitably

           authorised privileged access to delete data from the Audit Store". I do not

           believe that anyone within POL (and certainly I did not) properly focused on or

        understood this until they were highlighted in the context of a later internal

        review carried out by Sir Jonathan Swift (see below at [150]-[151]).


145. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email exchange I had with Mark

        Westbrook at Deloitte on 20 May 2014 in relation to a version of Deloitte's draft

        update to the board.13° The reason for the exchange was that I had gathered

        that Deloitte had identified that a specific control on the audit store was not as

        secure as understood by POL, and I wanted to know a bit more about it in case

        it raised a "red flag" which required escalation. Mark's reply was that it a

        theoretical possibility for which there were other controls, that Deloitte was

        looking into it further and continuing to ask questions of Fujitsu and that Deloitte

       would address it in their final report. As with other Horizon related technical

        information, the detail of this audit store issue was outside my area of expertise,

       and in light of Mark's response I do not recall giving this further consideration.


Balancing transactions and Second Sight in Autumn 2014


146. 1 am referred by the Inquiry to correspondence from Fujitsu forwarded to me

       and others on 23 October 2014 by Belinda Crowe.131 The context for this was

       that the issue of access to Horizon data had arisen again in relation to two

       cases in the Scheme on which Second Sight had completed a report, and

       Belinda Crowe sought to form a common understanding of what was and was

       not possible with "remotely accessing" Horizon in order to appropriately

       respond to these allegations.132 It was intended that a meeting be held with

        Fujitsu, but this was cancelled and James Davidson instead sent through a note

        explaining how integrity in Horizon was "assured" through the Core Audit

       Process. In this note he stated that "Transactions as keyed in at the branch,

        once "committed" cannot be altered.., any changes required centrally to

        committed Transactions can only be done via the creation of additional

        transactions",' 33 i believe in this email James Davidson was trying to emphasise

       the importance of Horizon's audit store as the best record of branch

       transactions, rather than documents derived from it which (as I believe the

       Helen Rose Report discussed) could present a misleading picture. It was in the

       context of this email from Fujitsu that I forwarded to Belinda Crowe the Spot

       Review Bible on 31 October 2014 and drew attention to Spot Review 5

       regarding Mr Rudkin, referred to above at [53], so that his allegation of remote

       access could be seen at the same time.134


147. The information that Fujitsu had provided to Deloitte about balancing

       transactions was provided to Andy Parsons in November 2014,135 and I

       understand he had a call with Fujitsu to discuss the remote access point. He

       summarised the current understanding of remote access and balancing

       transactions into a note that was then shared with Fujitsu to approve the

       content.136 The note would then be used as part of POL's response to Second

       involved in this process, but was copied into emails.138


Cartwright King and Brian Altman KC advice on balancing transactions


148. As noted above, POL also provided the Deloitte Project Zebra report to

       Cartwright King, initially as part of the work they were doing to locate another

       expert on Horizon in February 2015.139 Cartwright King asked further questions

       in response to this, which needed to be looked at closely, and which Andy

       Parsons and I ran down with Fujitsu.14° This culminated in a report being

       provided by Fujitsu on balancing transactions in July 2015. Further advice was

       also sought from Cartwright King and Brian Altman KC on how to address

       balancing transactions in light of the further information provided by Fujitsu.

       This is reflected in the advice chronology at POL00021799. I have located an

       email of 27 August 2015 that Andy Parsons wrote to Brian Altman KC reflecting

       his understanding of Brian's advice in respect of disclosure of information about

       balancing transactions to PMRs who had been prosecuted, which was

       confirmed with Brian Altman KC.

Second Sight Part 2 Report


149.    In April 2015 Second Sight published their revised Part Two report, which

        included a new section 14 on the balancing transactions process.141 That was

        then sent to POL's external criminal lawyers, and POL worked                         its reply

        document which it shared with Second Sight on 16 April 2015.


Swift Review and Remote Access


150. As mentioned above, the issue of remote access came up again in the context

        of the review carried out by Sir Jonathan Swift.142 I believe it was apparent by

        January 2016 that a focus area of that review would be balancing transactions,

        which is why I believe I forwarded to Mark Underwood143 (Head of Portfolio:

        Legal, Risk & Governance) some of the advice POL had previously received on

        the issue. 444 It also appears that, by mid-January 2016, Sir Jonathan Swift had

        provided to POL an advanced draft of the his report (the "Swift Review"), and

        that Mark Underwood had summarised its recommendations into a "grid". As

        can be seen in the "Proposal" column of that grid, POL agreed to send to Sir

        Jonathan Swift the advice received with respect to balancing transactions

        (which I presume is why I asked WBD to collate this for me into one place in

        the POL00021798 and POL00021799 documents).

151. Sir Jonathan Swift had spoken with Second Sight, Fujitsu and Deloitte in the

       course of this process and reviewed information from Fujitsu. The final version

       of the Swift Review pointed out to POL that a Deloitte report from 2014 had

       flagged the theoretical possibility of Fujitsu 'superusers' making remote

       amendments to branch accounts, which had not been focused on before,

       meaning that what Fujitsu and POL had previously said about remote access

       was wrong. Sir Jonathan Swift therefore recommended further advice be taken

       on balancing transactions and Fujitsu's ability to amend and delete data in the

       audit store, which POL proceeded to take (see further paragraph [183] below).


PART 7: POL WORK IN RESPECT OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS 2014-2016


Supply of Documents from Fujitsu


152. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on two documents, a draft memorandum

       and a note on securing data for future prosecutions, both from around July

       2014.145 Beyond being aware of the general need for POL to preserve data in

       support of its prosecution activities (e.g. as part of any IT transformation

       project), I do not recall having a specific role in relation to these documents,

       which were being managed by POL's criminal lawyers. I was aware that POL's

       contract with Fujitsu contained provisions concerning the court case support

       that Fujitsu should provide to POL, because I considered these provisions with

       POL's external solicitors CMS Cameron McKenna in around 2013 when the

       contract was updated. I did not at this time, between 2014 and 2016, know

       whether or not those provisions could apply to the Known Error Log ("KEL"),

           PinlCLs and PEAKs (an individual incident recorded on the KEL) which Fujitsu

           maintained in relation to Horizon, and did not need to turn my mind to this

           because Fujitsu were generally responsive to POL's requests for information

           without POL needing to raise contractual rights.


153. My understanding of how POL's contractual rights with Fujitsu could relate to

           KEL however grew in the course of the Group Litigation, with POL's position

           being summarised in the 'Post Office Submissions in relation to the Fujitsu

           Contract' specifically addressing this issue,146 which were filed on or about 31

           July 2019.


January and February 2015 Engagement with the CCRC


154. On 14 January 2015, the CCRC sent a letter to POL along with a notice under

           s.17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (a "s.17 Notice"), seeking disclosure of

           Brian Altman KC's advice (which had been referred to in correspondence POL

           exchanged with the CCRC in July 2014) and "the preservation of any materials

           associated with the affected cases". I believe this was the first time the CCRC

           had formally exercised its statutory powers, so a short letter was sent to the

           CCRC by Chris Aujard on 20 January 2015, acknowledging receipt of the

           CCRC's letter.147 POL then sought advice from its external lawyers on the

           CCRC's statutory powers and how best to respond to the CCRC's letter. POL

           understood the importance of the CCRC and wanted to cooperate with it, but

          needed to understand the legal foundation and context given the very broad

          requests for information the CCRC had made.

155. After considering the advice received, POL sent a more substantive response

       to the CCRC on 11 February 2015. This was drafted with the assistance of

       external lawyers and sought clarification of the CCRC's functions, while

       expressing POL's commitment to working with the CCRC.148 - The CCRC

       provided the requested clarification on 12 February 2015, after which a further

       letter was sent to the CCRC by the new POL General Counsel, Jane MacLeod,

       on 27 February 2015.149 This enclosed Brian Altman KC's report and confirmed

       that all materials reviewed as part of the Sift Reviews and the Scheme would

       be preserved. It also asked for clarification of which of Brian Altman KC's

       findings or recommendations were being sought. I was involved in completing

       a first draft of this letter with Gavin Matthews of WBD, which was then reviewed

       by Brian Altman KC and Jane MacLeod before being sent.15°


Simon Clarke's Response to the Deloitte Report


156.   I have been asked to consider the 27 March 2015 note of advice from Simon

       Clarke in response to the Deloitte report of 23 May 2014. 151 In February 2015,

       POL was again engaging with the CCRC, following their letter of 14 January

       2015 referred to above at paragraph [154]. Although I cannot recall for sure, I

       suspect that this contact from the CCRC is what prompted POL to seek advice

       from Simon Clarke about whether disclosure of the Deloitte report needed to

       be made in respect of past prosecutions. The Inquiry has asked me specifically

       about paragraph 6 of Simon Clarke's note of advice, which records a summary

       of a telephone conference I attended with him and Andy Parsons, While I do

       not recall this conversation specifically, I have no reason to believe that it has

       not been fairly recorded. My involvement in these matters related to providing

       instructions and information to Cartwright King, and this paragraph is consistent

       with me acting in that role.


157. POL had done work on remote access and balancing transactions in the context

       of Second Sight's work, and obtained the information summarised at paragraph

       6 of Simon Clarke's note in that context. At this point in time, the focus was on

       whether the May 2014 Deloitte Report needed to be disclosed in past criminal

       cases (i.e. as had been done with the Interim Report and Helen Rose Report in

       the Sift Review).


Meeting with the CCRC in May 2015


158. POL started receiving s.17 Notices in relation to specific cases in March 2015.

       These were forwarded to Cartwright King, with instructions to start collating and

       preserving responsive documents given that they would know from their

      experience of working with POL on prosecutions the type of information that

      would need to'be provide to the CCRC and where that would be located. WBD

      were also instructed to help POL manage the responses overall, as it was

      quickly apparent that responding to the s.17 Notices would be a significant

      exercise.


159. In its 12 and 27 February 2015 letters, POL had offered to discuss the best way

      to progress matters with the CCRC. On receipt of the first tranche of s.17

        Notices, Jane MacLeod suggested that this be expedited, which led to a

        meeting being arranged with the CCRC on 8 May 2015.152 I exchanged emails

        with the CCRC to determine the matters that could usefully be discussed, with

        the focus being on how POL could best facilitate the CCRC's reviews.153 I also

        prepared a `speaking note', which collated information that might be relevant in

        the meeting, and which I hoped would serve as a general primer to help bring

        Jane MacLeod up to speed on the background, bearing in mind that she had

        only recently started as POL's new General Counsel.154


160. I recall that the meeting was held at POL's head office and was constructive

        and cordial (as was the case with all my interactions with the CCRC). One of

        the main actions taken away was Jane MacLeod's suggestion that POL set up

        a file sharing platform to facilitate transfers of data to the CCRC and to help

        manage the volume of material which would be provided. Following the

        meeting, POL worked with the CCRC to set up the "Millnet" electronic document

        review platform, and continued to collate responsive material, including

        relatively substantial volumes of electronic data. WBD were instructed to assist

        POL in tracking and disclosing the materials to the CCRC over the Millnet

        platform as I did not have the capacity to address the requests directly myself.


161. On 10 and 18 September 2015, I wrote to the CCRC updating them on

        progress, and again inviting them to discuss with POL how best to progress the

        disclosure process. The CCRC responded on 1 October 2015, inviting POL up

       to their offices in Birmingham "to take stock", and a meeting was ultimately held

       there on 6 November 2015.


Meeting with the CCRC in November 2015


162. The Inquiry has asked me to consider two documents relating to that meeting,

       on 6 November 2015. These are the `speaking note' for the meeting,155 which

       adopted a similar format to the speaking note for the May 2015 meeting, and

       an updated version of the document containing a note of the meeting.156 Both

       documents were prepared by WBD at my request.


163. 1 recall the meeting focussing on disclosure, including electronic document

       management and the provision of both specific documents and broader

       categories of material. The CCRC's investigation was still at an early stage, it

       was for example continuing to receive new applications, so my memory is that

       we only. discussed                  about disclosure in the sense of needing to
                              "concerns"




       identify the documents which would be most helpful to the CCRC amongst what

       was likely to be an extremely large body of material. Although the note of the

       meeting shows that we discussed the material that Fujitsu might hold, I do not

       recall any discussion about BEDs, KELs, PintCLs or PEAKs.


164. Following the 6 November 2015 meeting with the CCRC, I recall that POL

       began collating the material discussed at the meeting as well as continuing to

       respond to further s.17 Notices as these were received. I emailed the CCRC on

       4 December 2015 and 5 January 2016 to update them on progress, before

        sending a substantive reply on 13 January 2016.157 Following that reply, the

        CCRC and I continued to exchange emails in which the CCRC identified, and

        POL sought to provide, a variety of information relevant to its investigations both

        in terms of documents and also through responding to written questions.


2016 Engagement with the CCRC


165.    1 continued to liaise with the CCRC throughout 2016, with the support of

        Cartwright King and WBD.158 WBD would source and collate responses to

        CCRC requests into draft emails, which they were well placed to do given their

        involvement in POL's responses to the PMRs' Horizon complaints. I would then

        review the draft emails before sending final responses to the CCRC. In doing

        this, I was relying on WBD for the accuracy of the material being provided and

        had confidence in that given their work with POL generally. I always tried to

        conclude emails to the CCRC with an offer to provide anything further they may

        require, to underscore POL's ongoing commitment to providing to the CCRC

        any information that would assist their process. Once sent, I forwarded to WBD

        the final emails sent to the CCRC for their records.


166.    The inquiry has asked me to comment on an email I sent to WBD on 25 April

        2016.159 1 do not recall the conversation referred to in that email, but it is likely

        to have concerned the requests POL was receiving from the CCRC.160 In my

        email, I asked WBD whether advice received from Cartwright King in December

       2015 in relation to disclosure in past prosecutions should be revisited with Brian

        Altman KC, with a view to POL taking a more pro-active approach to disclosure.

        I believe I raised this because I wanted to be sure POL was complying with its

       disclosure duties.


PART 8: POL COMMUNICATIONS WITH EXTERNAL ACTORS 2014-2016


Engagement with Baroness Neville-Rolfe of Autumn 2015


167. As stated above, POL's Comms team was responsible for engaging with

        parliamentarians. The Inquiry has referred me to email correspondence relating

       to a meeting between Baroness Neville-Rolfe (the Parliamentary Under-

       Secretary of State for Intellectual Property) and Lord Arbuthnot, including an

        email summary of that meeting circulated by Patrick Bourke on 17 September

       2015.161 I do not believe I attended the meeting, so my email on 18 September

       2015 only responded to the content of Patrick Bourke's summary. In particular,

        I provided my observations on the suggestion that POL should interview POL

       or Royal Mail personnel who had been involved in Jo Hamilton's prosecution

        many years earlier. My email refers to a "red folder". This was a ring binder

       (which happened to be red) containing hard copies of some contemporaneous

       documents from Jo Hamilton's prosecution files, which I had collated around

       the time of the Panorama broadcast (discussed further below at [171]-[174]).

       On their face these documents showed liaison between POLIRoyal Mail

       investigators and legal advisers, over a period of time, about the evidence in

                                                         Witness: Rodric David Alun Williams

      the Jo Hamilton case, and the charges that could be brought based on that

      evidence.


168. The Inquiry has asked me specifically about my comment at point 18 of my

      email of 18 September 2015 that: "perhaps most importantly, any interview will

      be covered by the CCRC's S. 17 Notice for Jo Hamilton and therefore would

      have to be disclosed to the CCRC". My view, as expressed in (a) to (c) of point

      18, was essentially that I did not see the benefit of conducting interviews in

      2015 given the amount of time since the events in question and the uncertainty

      around what was being asked, such that any interview would be inherently

      unreliable and the type of 'new material' which POL had been advised against

      creating in the context of the Scheme (see paragraph [120] above), but would

      be disclosable to the CCRC regardless of how accurate it was. Nevertheless,

      had this proposal been pursued further, I am most likely to have suggested that

      further formal advice be taken from POL's criminal law advisers as to its risks.


Engaciement with the Media


169. Generally, POL's Comms team was responsible for POL's engagement with the

      media. I was typically the contact for Comms within POL's in-house legal team

      if they felt they needed legal support, which could range from ad hoc reviews

      of statements they were proposing to make, to legal advice in respect of

      proposed broadcasts. I would arrange external legal support where that was

      required, usually from CMS Cameron McKenna ("CMS") whom I had been

      introduced to shortly after joining POL. As I have set out above at [17], my role

      as an in-house lawyer was one of legal risk manager, and this was my focus in

      POL's engagement with the media.

170.    I have been asked to consider selected correspondence with the BBC,

        Nick Wallis and internally within POL from December 2014 to January 2015.162

        My recollection of this time was that Comms team was concerned that the BBC

        was proposing to broadcast a piece on the One Show about PMR Horizon

        complaints, which would be damaging to POL. I was therefore asked to support

        the Comms team in its exchanges with the BBC, for which I obtained external

        support from CMS. I believe the legal input into POL's exchanges with the BBC

        is reflected in the documents shown to me by the Inquiry. I am not aware of

        POL threatening to issue proceedings against the BBC, and I was not asked to

        consider issuing proceedings as a consequence of the correspondence or the

        broadcast.


171.    The Inquiry has raised a number of questions about POl's approach to the

        planned broadcast of an episode of Panorama, "Trouble at the Post Office",

        about POL and Horizon on 17 August 2015.183 My recollection of this time is

        that POL wanted to know what Panorama was planning to say in the broadcast,

        so it could provide an informed response for the BBC to consider before it aired.

        This was initially explored through exchanges between Comms (with legal

        support) and the Panorama editorial team. As the broadcast came nearer, and

         POL felt that its position would not be fairly portrayed, a formal letter from CMS

        was then drafted and sent on 10 August 2015 so POL's position was understood

        and reflected as the broadcast was being edited.


172. The statement "it is not possible for Post Office or Fujitsu to remotely edit

        transactions as they were recorded by branches" essentially repeated POL's

        statement made to the BBC on 4 August 2015 and focused on balancing

        transactions.164 It is however incorrect, as it was theoretically possible for

        administrators at Fujitsu with the appropriate level of privilege to alter

        transactions. The statement should therefore have reflected that possibility of

        "superuser access", which Deloitte had identified in their 2014 reports.165 It is

        regrettable that it did not, but this was not deliberate; I did not intend to mislead

        the BBC. As noted above at [144J, this was not something I believe that anyone

        within POL registered at the time.

173.    Insofar as Richard Roll's contribution to the Panorama broadcast was

        concerned, I did not know, and do not believe anyone within POL knew, who he

        was before the broadcast of the Panorama episode. After seeing his

        contribution, I did note that he had not worked for Fujitsu or in the IT industry

        for a lengthy period of time, and so would not be commenting on the Horizon

        system as it was currently operating. I am aware that some enquiries were

        made by POL to Fujitsu about Richard Roll's employment with them shortly after

        the broadcast.166 Richard Roll's allegations were subsequently looked into as

        part of the Swift Review.167 Following the broadcast, POL reviewed its

        engagement with the editorial team and at the direction of the Comms team

        pursued a formal complaint against the BBC about the broadcast. This

        complaint was not upheld.


174. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email chain involving discussions

        about the Panorama programme with the Shareholder Executive (which

        managed the government's investment in POL at that time).168 Mark

        Underwood has asked me in that email whether I was happy with the lines he

        had drafted, but those lines do not appear to be reflected in the email chain at

        POL00102517 and I cannot now recall what they were. My discussion with Mark

postmaster knowing" the Swift Review states that "[t]he specific comments in the Panorama programme

          contents of it.


175. My understanding of POL's general attitude and strategy at that time towards

          the media, and its aims in dealing with them, was that the media could and

          would report on POL: It was therefore important to maintain an open dialogue

          with journalists so as to get an insight into what they might say and try to ensure

          they reflected POL's position, with matters only being escalated to formal legal

          intervention if it was felt essential to ensure a balanced presentation of POL's

          position in the finished publication.


PART 9: THE SWIFT REVIEW AND FOLLOW UP ACTIONS


The Swift Review


176.      In October 2015 Tim Parker became the Chairman of POL (the "Chairman"). I

          was not a party to the discussions which led to this, but on taking office the

          Chairman was asked by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Baroness

          Neville-Rolfe, to determine whether any further action was necessary to

          address PMR's Horizon complaints, as formally made in a letter dated

          10 September 2015.169 In order to do this, the Chairman asked POL's General

          Counsel to identify a suitable barrister who could provide independent advice

          to him, and following that to provide the barrister with any information they

          required. This independent advice would inform the Chairman's response to

          Baroness Neville-Rolfe, and I (with others) helped the General Counsel to

          facilitate this.

177. 1 helped to identify a number of (then) Queen's Counsel as potential candidates

        to provide the independent advice sought, based on my own experience and

        recommendations from WBD. A draft email was prepared by Patrick Bourke

        and Mark Underwood to send to the Chairman proposing two possible

        candidates on 1 October 2015. That email also suggested some text to describe

        very generally the potential scope of the review, while noting that the appointed

        QC would ultimately advise on this. I do not know how or why the Chairman

        chose Sir Jonathan Swift. He was appointed with a junior barrister to assist him,

        Christopher Knight. As a result, the independent review carried out on behalf of

        Chairman became known as the "Chairman's review". I refer to final report as

        the "Swift Review".


178. Following their appointment, I drafted instructions to Sir Jonathan Swift and

        Christopher Knight, which repeated the general text on scope sent to the

        Chairman on or about 1 October 2015. These instructions recorded that the

        Chairman required Sir Jonathan Swift's advice on the actual scope of the review

        and how it was to be framed, the process by which the review should be

        conducted, and the nature of the final report.17° It was hoped that the final report

        would be completed by Christmas 2015. In the draft instructions, I also set out

        some background information and identified some potentially relevant

        documents to help Sir Jonathan Swift read into the matter ahead of an initial

        conference with him on 8 October 2015. Following this conference Sir Jonathan

        Swift proposed `Terms of Reference' for discussion with the Chairman.171

179. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email from Jane MacLeod to

        Sir Jonathan Swift on 22 October 2015, summarising the outcome of a meeting

        held between the Chairman and Sir Jonathan Swift to discuss the review

        process.1 I do not recall attending that meeting.


180. Following the meeting between the Chairman and Sir Jonathan Swift on 22

        October 2015, I was asked to support Sir Jonathan Swift and Christopher

        Knight by providing to them whatever information they required. We were

        working to a fairly tight deadline to provide documents, particularly given the

        time of year, but POL was committed doing this. The sources of the information

        provided to Sir Jonathan Swift would most likely be self-evident, enabling him

        to investigate further as he thought appropriate. POL's approach to the

        provision of documents is reflected at paragraph 3 of the Swift Review:173


               "The legal department of POL has been the source of most of the
               information provided to us, but we have determined what information
               should be provided. No information we have requested has been
               withheld from us and we are grateful for the assistance we have received
               from both POL".


181. Although I do not recall precisely when I first saw it, I would have been sent a

        copy of the Swift Review very shortly after it was completed. I do not recall how

        widely the Swift Review was circulated or whether or not it went to the Board.

        The recommendations in the Swift Review were consolidated into an action

        grid, prepared I believe by, my colleague Mark Underwood.174 Advice was

        sought from Brian Altman KC in respect of recommendations (1), (2) and (6);

        Deloitte were instructed to undertake the analysis and reviews recommended

        at (3), (4), (5) and (8); and WBD were instructed to carry out recommendation

        (7), in coordination with Sir Jonathan Swift.


182. On 18 April 2016, POL received a draft claim form in what would become the

        Group Litigation (covered in detail in Part 8 of this statement, below). I

        discussed this development with WBD and Anthony de Garr Robinson KC, who

        by this time had been instructed as leading counsel for POL in the Group

        Litigation, and also with Sir Jonathan Swift. Given the overlap between

        Sir Jonathan Swift's recommendations and the issues to be litigated in the

        Group Litigation, Sir Jonathan Swift was content for his recommendations

        (which remained his recommendations notwithstanding that litigation) to be

        taken forward through the Group Litigation.175


Deloitte's Project Bramble


183.    1 believe that some of Sir Jonathan Swift's recommendations led to the initial

        instruction of Deloitte in respect of what became known as 'Project Bramble'. I

        do not recall having direct engagement with Project Bramble, where I believe

        the engagement with Deloitte was largely managed by others within POL,

        supported by WBD. Those closer to the work would raise any issues that might

        arise from them, for example as in POL00029990.


184. 1 do not know how widely the Project Bramble reports were circulated within

        POL, but it is unlikely to have been wider than those working on the Group

        Litigation. Because Deloitte's Project Bramble work was developing 'work in

        progress' which would inform POL's position in the Group Litigation, I do not

       think the reports were disclosed to the CCRC. The CCRC at this time was

       however being updated on progress of the litigation and supplied with

       documents raised in it, including the expert reports prepared for the Horizon

       Issues Trial. I also note Brian Altman KC's advice of 26 July 2016 was that until

       the full reviews recommended by the Swift Review were completed (which

       included those being sought as part of Project Bramble) he could not advise on

       the extent that disclosure to defendants in criminal prosecutions brought by

       POL was necessary 176


PART 10: THE GROUP LITIGATION


Outline of my role in the Group Litigation


185. The majority of matters covered in this statement involved me acting in the

       manner described under the heading "My role as an in-house lawyer at POL"

       at paragraphs [17]-[18]. I did however play a more active role in the Group

       Litigation because of the scale of the litigation and my familiarity with the

       litigation process. For example, I recommended that a steering group be

       created comprising senior representatives from across different parts of the

       business, to ensure there was a `client' from whom substantive instructions

       could be taken (the "Steering Group", described further at paragraph [190]

       below), and I helped POL structure its interactions with third parties during the

       Group Litigation in a way that would help assert any applicable privilege over

       documents relating to the legal proceedings.




176 See paragraph 16
                       of the advice of Brian Altman KC of 26 July 2016 (POL00112884).
                                                                                            WITNO8420100
                                                                                         WITNO8420100

186. In other respects, my role remained consistent with what I have said earlier. For

       example, I was the principle contact between POL and the external legal team

       conducting the Group Litigation at WBD. I would be a sounding board and

       source of information for them, monitored matters as they arose for escalation

       to the Steering Group, and sought updates from them on matters when required

       for internal management purposes or to keep track of the general "direction of

       travel". I do not, however, recall personally directing or undertaking substantive

       work myself or setting the overarching strategy, for which POL's instructions

       would come from the Steering Group or (as became the case more often as the

       Group Litigation progressed) POL's Group Executive or Board.


187. My role within POL did change as a result of the Group Litigation. Whereas the

       other matters covered in this statement were only ever one of many things I

      was doing at a given time (albeit significant ones), by mid-2018 the intensity of

       the Group Litigation meant I needed to focus on it full-time, so that any other

      matters were handled by backfilled secondee resource.


188. My main role in the Group Litigation was therefore to maintain a general

      overview of the constant developments as the case evolved and make sure it

      kept progressing towards resolution, for example by monitoring progress

      against deadlines, and helping to ensure the right people were linked up to

      deliver certain outputs. Particular examples of my role are discussed in the rest

      of this statement in response to specific matters raised with me by the Inquiry.


189. Reflecting on it, the Group Litigation was the critical event in my dealings with

      the PMR Horizon complaints, given that it enabled the concerns raised by

      PMRs and POL's positions on them to be consolidated, clearly articulated,

       forensically tested, and ultimately determined, thereby providing the best

       opportunity for resolution.


POL decision making in respect of the Group Litigation


190. i have been asked to comment on how POL made decisions in respect of the

       Group Litigation. The breadth of issues raised in the original Claim Form in the

       Group Litigation made clear to me that, in order to respond to the claims in an

      informed and timely manner, POL's lawyers would need to consult and take

      instructions from a central group of representatives from across the business.

      In around April 2016, 1 therefore suggested to POL's General Counsel that a

       Steering Group be set up for that purpose. It was initially thought that the

      Steering Group could meet fortnightly to work through a standard agenda,

      although it was always recognised that this would need to be flexible to meet

      the demands of the litigation. An email showing the proposed format was sent

      on 23 May 2016,177 and its first meeting was held on 7 June 2016. The idea, as

      the Steering Group's Terms of Reference sought to reflect, was for the Steering

      Group to provide the necessary instructions to conduct the litigation to POL's

      external lawyers, considering both standard agenda items and specific matters

      for which papers would be prepared, and to escalate matters within POL as

      appropriate.178


191. As far as I can recall, this remained the management structure for most of the

      Group Litigation. In or around January 2018 the Board also decided to set up

        a sub-committee dedicated to the Group Litigation. I was not party to the

        decision to set up that Board sub-committee, but I recall that it was intended to

        afford a smaller group of Board members sufficient time to consider the litigation

        (which was nearing the first, Common Issues trial) where full Board meetings

        did not allow enough time given all the other matters on the Board's agenda.

        The Board sub-committee therefore met separately shortly before each Board

        meeting and I sought to align those meetings with the litigation timetable. I do

        not recall routinely attending Group Executive, Board or Board sub-committee

        meetings in the earlier stages of the Group Litigation, but I did on occasion (for

        example when POL's leading counsel attended). I did however start to attend

        these meetings more regularly following the handing down of the Common

        Issues Judgment in March 2019.


The early stages of the Group Litigation


192. i view the early stages of the Group Litigation as beginning when we received

        the Claim Form in April 2016. That set out brief details of the claim, and we

        were told by Freeths LLP, the solicitors representing the claimants, that these

        would be more fully set out in a Letter of Claim which would shortly follow. WBD

        were immediately instructed and asked to identify potential leading counsel to

        act         POL. The Inquiry has shown me an action list sent to me by Andy
              for




        Parsons, the lead partner on the Group Litigation, following a meeting we had

        on or about 20 April 2016.179 While I do not recall the details of this specific

        meeting, I believe the matters set out in the 20 April 2016 action list were the

        sort of preliminary issues that POL might need to address following receipt of


179 Email from Rodric Williams

                                                                 Witness: Rodric David Aiun Williams

        the Claim Form and hence were likely to have been discussed shortly after its

        receipt.


193. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an action point in that list, referencing

        document preservation. Document preservation is a key aspect of all litigation,

        and around this time I recall sending emails to several distribution lists within

        POL notifying them of the litigation and the requirement to secure and preserve

        documents they held.180 A WBD associate worked to follow this up and identify

        the potential sources of documents so that they would be available for

        disclosure, which eventually led to a pool of many millions of documents being

        corralled for potential use in the litigation. This was not a straightforward task

        given the broad allegations made, the absence of particulars of claim and POL's

        document management, but I note that the vast majority of documents used in

        the litigation were disclosed by POL and enabled the claimants successfully to

        prove their claims.


194. POL was also aware that some documents were held by third parties outside

        the scope of its control, such as Royal Mail and Fujitsu. At this point there was

        a lack of particularisation to the pleadings, so the scope of disclosure and

        documents required from these third parties was unclear.


Legal professional privilege


195. The Inquiry has asked me whether POL sought to maintain confidentiality

        and/or legal professional privilege over information relevant to the discovery

        arid rectification of BEDS, or over remote access, or over POL's preparation for

      the Group Litigation. I believe it was always understood that legal professional

      privilege does not apply to facts, so the facts about BEDS and remote access

      would not attract privilege. It is, however, possible (and indeed usual practice)

      to claim legal professional privilege over communications between a lawyer and

      their client for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice. The same applies

      to communications between a lawyer and their client or a third party for the

      purpose of obtaining advice or information in connection with existing or

      reasonably contemplated litigation. In both cases, this applies to

      communications that contain or are informed by factual information. I consider

      it to be professionally essential to seek to safeguard and maintain a client's

      legal professional privilege as far as possible in the context of litigation, and I

      do not recall any instruction from POL to waive privilege over documents

      qualifying for it.


196. 1 was consulted on or informed of certain decisions about privileged documents,

      but my recollection is that this was infrequent. In the Group Litigation, the

      disclosure process, which included review of documents for legal professional

      privilege, was (as it had to be given its scale) managed by the external legal

      team seeking to follow the court ordered disclosure process.


197. As noted at paragraph [185] above, I helped POL manage its interactions with

      third parties during the Group Litigation, and sought to do so in a way that would

      maintain legal professional privilege over documents. In particular, after the

      claim was filed POL sought advice in May-June 2016 on the implications of the

      Group Litigation for POL's ongoing work in response to the Swift Review given

       its apparent overlap with the Group Litigation claims. The Inquiry has shown

       me two documents that relate to this advice.181


198. As described at paragraph [181] above, the Swift Review made a number of

       recommendations on which POL had begun work in February 2016. When

       Antony de Garr Robinson KC was instructed, he was asked to advise on this,

       and expressed the firm view that this work should be taken forward through the

       Group Litigation. I do not now recall the full details of the conference, but the

       WBD letter is a fair summary. I thought the advice was sensible for two reasons.

       It would strengthen POL's claim to legal professional privilege over

       communications in the Group Litigation on matters which had also been raised

       by the Swift Review, and it would also enable POL to consolidate work which

       would otherwise have had to proceed in parallel (and likely duplicative)

       processes. However, given that following Antony de Garr Robinson KC's advice

       would affect POL's response to the Swift Review, I asked WBD to record his

       advice in a letter182 which could be shared with Sir Jonathan Swift to see if he

       was comfortable with the approach POL was now proposing to take. In reply,

       Sir Jonathan Swift confirmed that he was comfortable with POL dealing with his

       recommendations as part of the Group Litigation rather than separately.183


199. The Inquiry has asked me who gave advice to the Chairman or others on

       whether to provide the Swift Review to the Board, UKGI (which manages the

       Government's investment in POL) and/or HMG. The Swift Review was

        independent legal advice to the Chairman. I do not know who else the Swift

        Review was shared with as I did not have any direct contact with the Chairman

        over it. My focus at this time was instead on taking forward its

        recommendations.


200. As noted at paragraph [181] above, one of the recommendations in the Swift

        Review was that POL seek independent criminal law advice as to whether the

        decision to charge a PMR with theft and false accounting could undermine the

        safety of any conviction for false accounting where (a) the conviction was based

        on a guilty plea, following which/or in return for which the theft charge was

        dropped, and (b) there had not been a sufficient evidential basis to bring the

        theft charge.184 Brian Altman KC was therefore consulted on this, and the scope

        of his review exercise was then discussed with Sir Jonathan Swift. Once the

        scope was confirmed, Brian Altman KC undertook the review and provided his

        written advice to WBD on 26 July 2016,185 who forwarded it to myself and others

        at POL.186 POL's focus by that ' time was on the Group Litigation, and in

       particular on responding to the claimants' Letter of Claim for which a Letter of

       Response was being drafted. WBD noted when circulating the outcome of the

       review that Brian Altman KC had also confirmed it was consistent with the

       relevant parts of the Letter of Response, and that consequently they did not

       believe any further action was required.

       Altman KC's review. I note that he proceeded to address the matters raised in

        that paragraph in the subsequent and final paragraphs of his review. Given that

        POL's focus was at the time on progressing the Group Litigation, I do not believe

        any further action was taken in connection with the review.


PART 10.1: POL'S OVERALL STRATEGY DURING THE GROUP LITIGATION


202. At paragraphs [190] to [191] above, I outlined the role of the Steering Group

        and mentioned that papers would be prepared for that body on specific issues

        where instructions or oversight were required. The Inquiry has asked me to

        comment on two papers of this kind prepared by WBD for the Steering Group

       meeting on 11 September 2017.187 The purpose of documents like these was

        to inform and stimulate discussion within the Steering Group, with a view to

       confirming the approach POL would take. The context for these two papers was

       that by this time, POL had carried out the initial phase of work required to

       respond to the Letter of Claim, and had sent its Letter of Response on 28 July

       2016,188 following which there was one further exchange between the parties

       in October and November 2016. All of this was done with a view to obtaining

       constructively an understanding of the claimants' case and the issues POL

       would have to address, so as to determine the best way to manage the Group

       Litigation to resolution. By the time of the first Case Management Conference

       ("CMC") in the Group Litigation in October 2017, POL was much better informed

       about the case so needed to take a step back and make decisions about the

      "general direction of travel", i.e. the approach to take to the litigation as a whole,

      which would then also inform POL's position at the first CIVIC specifically.


203. I believe the two Steering Group papers reflected the 'blue sky thinking' that

      was done on the possible approaches which could be taken to the Group

      Litigation, so that POL could consider a variety of options. I do not believe the

      options presented were necessarily mutually exclusive, nor do I believe were

      they 'set in stone', such that (as the document notes) POL's position was able

      to develop (as it would need to) as the litigation progressed. That said, some of

      the options were unlikely to be given serious consideration: in particular "Settle

      now" (although it was always contemplated and indeed expected that the

      litigation would ultimately be resolved through settlement), and "Attrition" (which

      I do not recall being seriously considered or pursued at any stage of the

      litigation).


204. Ultimately, it became clear that in order to resolve the Group Litigation, the

      parties would need to focus on two fundamental areas that were common to

      most of the claimants' claims, but on which the parties were diametrically

      opposed such that the court's intervention on them would be necessary. These

      were the nature of the legal relationship between POL and PMRs, and the

      reliability of Horizon, both of which were discussed in the options paper. I

      believe the determination of these issues through the Common Issues and

      Horizon Issues trials was essential to POL's goal of resolving the litigation and

      the PMR's Horizon complaints, as it represented the means to test

      independently and resolve with certainty the claims and POL's position on them

       which, as the matters discussed elsewhere in my statement show, it had thus

       far failed to do,


205. The documents also reflect that this was a large-scale High Court civil law claim

       focused on issues like the construction of commercial contracts and IT system

       performance. The claim was brought by a respected commercial law firm

       backed by substantial litigation funding. It was not about matters of criminal law,

       which were the domain of other courts. I therefore believe it was appropriate

       that one factor being considered when assessing how POL should respond to

       the claims was the costs implications the litigation would have, including for the

       claimants' fenders. This was not however the only consideration.


Letter from Freeths of 16 October 2017


206. The Inquiry has asked me to consider a letter from Freeths to WBD and an

       email commenting on that letter from Andy Parsons, both dated 16 October

       2017. These relate to the Fourth Witness Statement of Andy Parsons,

       submitted ahead of the first CMC.189 At that time in October 2017, 1 was heavily

       involved in an unrelated piece of urgent litigation concerning an important

       business objective, so I was not as engaged in the Group Litigation as I was at

       other times. I do not specifically recall this letter from Freeths or the related

       email, but I do not believe POL or WBD ever adopted or pursued a strategy of

       wasting time on side issues, nor do I believe allegations of professional

       misconduct were made to obtain an advantage in the litigation.

207. The litigation proceeded in accordance with a very tight timetable, which

          generated substantial amounts of inter-parties correspondence. Some of this

          would be shared with me either for my input or so I could get a sense of the

          direction of travel for how matters were progressing. Given the scale of the

          litigation and the pace at which it was required to move, 1 believe it was

          inevitable that some of the correspondence would be intemperate, but my

          general recollection of the letters I saw was that they enabled the litigation to

          advance.


Judgments of 10 November 2017 and 17 October 2018


208. i have been asked to consider the judgment of Bates & Others v. Post Office

         Limited [2017] EWHC 2844 (QB), which was sent out in draft to the parties on

          8 November 2017 and handed down on 10 November 2017, after the first CMC.

          On reading the judgment, I identified the criticisms that the trial judge had made

         in it about the parties' behaviour to the General Counsel and a small group of

         colleagues. While these criticisms were expressly levelled at the parties "more

         or less equally', I considered that the main message was that the parties would

         need to co-operate more if they were to meet the tight timetable, failing which

          "draconian costs orders" could result. I do not believe this led to any change in

         the strategy for the litigation because, as noted above and in my email at the

         time, I believe POL had been                     to cooperate with the claimants for the
                                           trying




         expeditious resolution of the litigation. I nevertheless added (with WBD copied)

         that POL not only needed to cooperate but also be seen to be cooperating.19°

209. The Inquiry has also asked me to consider the judgment in Bates & Others v.

         Post Office Limited [2018] EWHC 2698 (QB), which the parties received on

          15 October 2018,'9' shortly before the start of the first, Common Issues trial on

          5 November 2018. As I noted in the email I sent shortly after receipt of the

          judgment,192 I was disappointed to read the further criticisms that the trial judge

          had made of the parties' conduct of the litigation, because as far as I was

          concerned, POL had been trying to progress the case properly. I believe POL

         was doing so. Indeed, both trials remained on track to start within the tight

         timetable ordered and costs budget by the court and no sanction had been

         sought or ordered. My contemporaneous emails show that an update on the

         judgment was provided to UKGI on 16 October 2018, and that a briefing was

         held with UKGI on 17 October 2018, which seemed (insofar as the Group

         Litigation was concerned) to focus on potential outcomes and contingency

         planning. I do not recall any challenge concerning the conduct of the litigation

         arising from these events.


PART 10,2: INFORMATION SHARING


210. As I mentioned in paragraph [195] above, POL had a general (and I believe

         understandable) concern about maintaining confidentiality and, where relevant,

         legal professional privilege, over the materials being created in connection with

         the PMRs` Horizon complaints and its conduct of the Group Litigation. I believe

         this was reasonable given the third party scrutiny being given to POL's

         approach, and the potential for the conduct of its defence to be undermined if

         that confidentiality was not maintained.


211. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email chain concerning sharing

         information about the Group Litigation with UKGI,193 I recall that, in mid-2016,

         an official from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (as it then

         was) approached POL with a request for a discussion with a member of the

         Department's legal team about the Group Litigation. That meeting took place

         on 4 August 2016, which I attended as far as I recall with Patrick Bourke and

         Andy Parsons. At the meeting we gave an overview of the litigation as we saw

         it at that time, and essentially asked that POL be permitted to conduct the

         litigation without external influence. I do not recall taking any specific actions

         away from this meeting.


212. 1 do not know what prompted UKGI to seek a more structed information flow

        about the Group Litigation in February 2018, as referred to in the first email in

        the chain I have been asked to consider. In response to that request, I was

        asked by POL's General Counsel to try to formalise information sharing

        arrangements in a manner which could, so far as possible, protect any

        applicable legal professional privilege in the information that would need to be

        shared. As can be seen from the email chain there was some toing and froing

        between UKGI and POL over the form this should take, before the information

        sharing protocol was agreed in or around June 2018.19¢

213. The Inquiry has asked me to explain my comment, in an email of 11 May 2018,

        that:195



                "The distinction between confidential and privileged information is
                artificial. There is no basis for it in law (privilege is founded on
                confidentiality), and I see no reason why UKGI should not treat
                everything they receive from us on the Group Lit as confidential (surely
                the need for that is obvious?)."

        This was a comment in an internal email to Patrick Bourke, Jane MacLeod and

        Andy Parsons, copied to Mark Underwood. With hindsight, it should perhaps

        have read "the distinction between confidential and privileged information that

        UKGI is drawing in its comments on the draft protocol is artificial...". I appreciate

        that legal professional privilege will not apply to all confidential documents. I am

        also aware that confidentiality is a cornerstone for maintaining privilege, such

        that privilege will be lost if privileged material is not kept confidential. I was

        concerned that the changes UKGI wanted to make to the draft information

        sharing protocol would narrow its protections to only cover privileged material

        provided by POL. This was concerning because, particularly in litigation, the

        existence of legal professional privilege over a document may not be obvious

        (especially to someone outside of POL unaware of the document's context). I

        was aware that Government provides robust protection in relation to the

        handling of confidential information, and I wanted that protection to apply to any

        documents shared by POL concerning the conduct of litigation, irrespective of

        whether they might also be legally privileged. This was sensible in

        circumstances where the presumption should be that all material being

        provided would be confidential and deserving of those protections given the

        sensitive matters to which it related (namely the "Postmaster Complaints" as

        defined). Reviewing this exchange now, it seems that this issue was swiftly

        resolved by applying the information sharing protocol's protections to

        "Privileged and Confidential Information", defined as including both legally

        privileged and other confidential material.


214. Once the information sharing protocol was agreed, I provided updates to UKGI

        and the Department in accordance with it and I do not ever recall being

        challenged on POL's compliance with it.

217. In July 2016, WBD were working with POL's counsel on POL's response to the

        claimants' Letter of Claim. They were preparing a draft Letter of Response from

        material to which they had access, or that I or others within POL could provide,

        which would then be circulated to POL for consideration and comment. The

        draft Letter of Response raised a number of specific issues on which WBD

        wanted the Steering Group's instructions, and (in line with the Steering Group's

        operating practices outlined in paragraph [190) above) these were distilled into

        separate papers. This can be seen from the email chain dated 13 July 2016 to

        which I have been referred by the Inquiry.197 In the example paper given to me

        to comment on, WBD's recommendation was to confront the issue of BEDS

        head-on by identifying the three BEDS that had been noted by Second Sight,

        but that POL should also recognise that this would not be an exhaustive list of

        BEDS in case more emerged later. This position was ultimately reflected in the

        Letter of Response, at paragraph 3.10.1(a) and Schedule 6. 198 1 do not recall

        any specific disagreement about this (or indeed on any of the other decision

        papers) within the Steering Group, whose working practice was to discuss and

        give views on an issue before reaching a consensus on it.


218.    Shortly before the Steering Group meeting at which the Letter of Response

        papers were discussed, WBD raised an issue with remote access having been

        identified through a combination of responding to the Letter of Claim and the

        further work Deloitte was doing (referred to in paragraph [183] to [184]

        above).199 At paragraphs [141) to [149] above, I explained that POL's position

        on remote access up to the point of receiving the Swift Review had focused on

        `balancing transactions', and not the 'superuser access issue (first discussed

        at paragraph [144] above) which had been missed when POL was responded

        to Panorama (see paragraph [172] above), and on which the Swift Review had

        recommended further investigation (see paragraphs [181] and [183J above).

        The focus was initially on correctly expressing the position in the Letter of

        Response, but there followed a discussion about managing the impact of this

        change of position.200 The fact POL had not previously commented on Fujitsu

        `superusers', and that this possibility was inconsistent with past statements,

        was escalated to Paula Vennells by Jane MacLeod, and may have been

        escalated to the Board if thought appropriate.201


219. The final Letter of Response was very lengthy at some 99 pages including

        schedules, and addressed a large number of issues. I was aware of the process

        that WBD and counsel followed to prepare this letter, namely using existing

        materials and seeking specific input from subject matter experts to prepare a

        draft, which, when sufficiently advanced, was circulated to me and others for

        comment,202 I then reviewed (as did others) advanced drafts of the Letter of

       Response and provided comments on it based on my own understanding of the

       issues it traversed. I have no reason to believe this process did not ensure the

       letter accurately reflected POL's understanding of, and positions on, the various

       issues as at that time.

Generic Defence and Counterclaim


220. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on a number of paragraphs of POL's

        Generic Defence and Counterclaim.203 As with the Letter of Response,

        discussed in paragraphs [202] above, I was not involved in the substantive

        drafting, but did review advanced drafts of the document.204 As noted at

        paragraph [185] to [186] above, my role as in-house lawyer in processes like

        this was mainly to track the work of the external legal team against deadlines,

        ensure it was broadly in line with POL's expectations (or address issues that

        were not), and to escalate when challenges arose (such as not finding

        information, people being unresponsive etc.). I believe the process for

        preparing the Generic Defence and Counterclaim was essentially the same as

        that for the Letter of Response, and again I will have provided questions and

        comments on this document to the external team to based on my own

        understanding of the issue being traversed. I have also located emails from

        WBD to Fujitsu and Deloitte asking them to review, comment on and identify

        any inaccuracies in extracts from the claimants' draft Generic Particulars of

        Claim and POL's Generic Defence (including as referenced in the Inquiry's

        question 116).205 Again as with the Letter of Response, I have no reason to

        believe that this process did not ensure the Generic Defence and Counterclaim

        accurately reflected POL's understanding of matters at the time it was made.


PART 10.4: DISCLOSURE


Disclosure of investigations guidelines (October 2016)


221.    The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an email from WBD to me on 5

        October 2016 relating to the disclosure of investigations guidelines.208 I do not

        recall this email; at this time, I was dealing with the unrelated piece of urgent

        litigation concerning an important business objective referred to in paragraph

        [206] above and, as the email was marked "not urgent but ... to consider ...

        when you get a chance", I may not have paid particular attention to it. I have

        searched for a response but been unable to locate one, nor any emails

        afterwards that shed light on the issue. I do not know whether, or, if so, when

        the investigation guidelines referred to in the emails were disclosed, but I do

        not believe POL sought to "suppress" disclosure during the litigation. I note the

        email was sent relatively early in the litigation and before orders for disclosure

        were made, and my recollection of POL's approach to disclosure was to provide

        to the claimants' the disclosure they required so far as that was reasonably

        possible. This to me was because, as referred to at [204] above, I believe it was

        POL's ultimate aim in the Group Litigation to reach a conclusive outcome to the

        PMR Horizon complaints, and this would not be possible if the outcomes could

        be undermined (whether through the courts or other avenues) on grounds of

        inadequate disclosure. As POL sought to explain in its Closing Submissions to

        the Horizon Issues trial,207 giving disclosure to the claimants was not always

        straightforward given some of the wide-ranging requests and at times absence

        of particulars of claim to inform the parameters of disclosure. However, as

        already noted at [193) above, POL did provide substantial disclosure to the

        claimants, which they did not take issue with through any applications to the

        court, and which enabled them to prove their case.


Disclosure of KELs and PEAKS


222. I do not now recall any direct conversations with WBD, Fujitsu or others in POL

        concerning the KEL log or access to it, although it is clear that I was copied in

        to email correspondence about it.208 My overarching recollection about the KEL

        is that it was something which Fujitsu created, used and stored, to which neither

        POL nor anyone else outside Fujitsu had access. POL was therefore dependent

        on Fujitsu for information about and access to the KEL. The same applied to

        PEAKS, which I do not recall being aware of prior to the Group Litigation and

        whose function only became apparent to me as the litigation progressed.


223. In preparing this statement, I have considered the 'Post Office Submissions in

        relation to the Fujitsu Contract' filed in the Group Litigation on 31 July 2019.209

        This fairly summarises my understanding of the position with respect to the

        KEL. It explains that POL felt disclosure of the KEL (which would not be

        straightforward given the technical means by which it was held) should be

        addressed as part of Group Litigation disclosure generally. Nevertheless, in

                                                              Date: 11 March 2024

        September 2017 POL offered the claimants' IT expert Jason Coyne inspection

        of the KEL at Fujitsu's premises. I believe this offer was consistent with the

        approach to disclosure discussed in paragraph [221] above, and is referred to

        in paragraph 39 of the Fourth Witness Statement of Andy Parsons.21° I recall

        that in order for this inspection to take place Fujitsu required Jason Coyne to

        sign a non-disclosure agreement, and that I was a party to communications

        around this. Following Jason Coyne's inspection of the KEL at Fujitsu's

        premises in November 2017, it was agreed that the KEL should be disclosed,

       as it was in May 2018 once a technical solution had been created to enable

        this.


224. I therefore do not believe POL had any sustained objection to disclosing the

       KEL, and as paragraph 27 of the 'Post Office Submissions in relation to the

       Fujitsu Contract' note, the KEL was not the subject of any contention by the

       time the Horizon Issues trial was ordered. I note that when, after the Horizon

       Issues trial had concluded but before judgment had been given, Fujitsu

       revealed to POL that a large number of versions of the KEL previously thought

       to have been destroyed were in fact available, the claimants and the court were

       promptly notified of this so that the claimants could inspect them if required.


225. The documents relating to KEL disclosure to which the Inquiry has drawn my

       attention show that WBD were in dialogue with Fujitsu about the KEL disclosure

       in September 2017.211 I do not remember playing a role in the drafting of WBD's

       letters to Freeths or Andy Parsons' witness statement addressing the KEL, but

        reading them now the contents fit with my memory of what Fujitsu was saying

        about the KEL at that time.212 The Inquiry has asked me to comment on a noting

        paper for a Steering Group meeting on 16 October 2017, relating to this

        issue.243 This was prepared by WBD to give an overview of where matters were

        in the litigation, and was designed to stimulate discussion so POL could give

        instructions for the conduct of the first CMC. I note this says that POL would

        continue to push back' on the KEL, which I take to mean that POL would

        maintain its position as set out in the Fourth Witness Statement of Andy

        Parsons, namely to offer inspection of the KEL notwithstanding POL's then

        pleaded case that it was not relevant.


Disclosure to the CCRC


Generic Defence and Counterclaim and its queries on KELs


226. Although the Group Litigation was not concerned with criminal law matters, as

        noted at paragraph [205] above, POL understood that it would give rise to

        information which might be relevant to them and to the CCRC's investigations.

        Accordingly, in addition to the specific requests for information received from

       the CCRC, POL sought to keep it updated on the litigation as it progressed. We

       also sought to keep Cartwright King engaged so that they were aware of the

        progress of the Group Litigation and could advise POL accordingly.

227. The Inquiry has drawn my attention to two email chains relating to this from

        January and July 2017.214 The first of these illustrates how I liaised with external

        lawyers to support the CCRC's work during the Group Litigation. I sent POL's

        Generic Defence and Counterclaim to the CCRC in response to their request

        for it, and also provided the Generic Particulars of Claim for ease of

        reference.215 I believe I flagged paragraph 50(4) to them to ask whether this

        dealt with the questions they had separately raised in relation to the KEL

        because this represented the most recent statement of POL's position on the

        issue. The email chain shows that I continued my practice of liaising with WBD

        (Paul Loraine) as POL's external legal support for responding to the CCRC

        given my own lack of capacity, which in this case also involved WBD drafting

        questions Fujitsu would need to answer. The July 2017 email chain shows

       POL's continued engagement with the CCRC over the further questions it was

       raising, consistent with the understanding described at paragraph [222] above.

       I facilitated a visit by the CCRC to Fujitsu in Bracknell to view the live' KEL in

       March 2018 and POL remained open to taking forward any further questions

       the CCRC might have on the KEL.


Correspondence regarding PEAKs in late 2018


228. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an exchange of letters between WBD

       and Freeths on 2 October and 28 November 2018, relating to the disclosure of

       PEAKs.216 In between the dates of the two letters I note that POL's strike-out

      application in the Group Litigation was heard and determined (on 10 and 17

      October 2018 respectively) and the Common Issues trial commenced (on 7

       November 2018). This was therefore a very busy time. I now understand that

       PEAKs were an internal log of the fixes applied to known Horizon errors which

      was kept by Fujitsu. I do not recall these specific letters and, as I note below at

      [237], I was less involved in the Horizon Issues trial preparation given its subject

      matter and other demands. In light of that, and the issue appearing to be an

      interlocutory one being progressed by the external legal team, it may not have

      required or been given my attention. Reviewing the position now, it seems the

      existence of PEAKs had been confirmed to Freeths in December 2017 and,

      following a request to access them on 4 June 2018 from the claimants' expert,

      Jason Coyne, POL made arrangements for both parties' experts to have access

      at Fujitsu's premises on 15 June 2018. In September 2018, once technical

      issues with extracting them from the Fujitsu database had been resolved, the

      PEAKS were disclosed without affecting the trial timetable.


PART 10.5: PREPARATION FOR THE COMMON ISSUES TRIAL


My involvement in preparation for the Common Issues trial


229. As I explained at paragraph [204] above, I believe POL wanted the Group

      Litigation to resolve the PMRs' Horizon complaints. Determining the Common

      Issues and confirming the legal relationship between POL and the PMRs was

      an essential step towards this, given that it would bridge the gap between the

      parties' often diametrically opposed positions on them. WBD and the counsel

      team were responsible for preparing the case for the Common Issues trial. My

      role was as described at paragraphs [185] to [1 883 above.

  Disclosure and redactions


  230. Disclosure and the redaction of documents were dealt with by WBD, which

        employed what I consider to be a standard team structure for large scale

        disclosure exercises, where responsive documents are stored in an electronic

        document review platform and identified through the use of search terms. The

        majority of responsive documents are then reviewed by paralegals in the first

        instance, escalating matters through increasingly more qualified lawyers as the

        document under review may require. Disclosure in this case was a very

        substantial undertaking, with approximately 18 million documents being

        considered for review and over 500,000 disclosed within a tight time frame,

        enabling the Common Issues and Horizon Issues trials to proceed as directed.

        Of the disclosed documents, my understanding is that fewer than 500 had

        redactions, on grounds of either privilege or confidentiality.


  231. The Inquiry has specifically highlighted the redactions to the 'Zebra Action

        Summary' in the trial bundle.217 I was typically not involved in day-to-day

        decisions on disclosure and redactions. However, I received an email from

        WBD on 26 July 2018 raising a number of questions about privilege in this

        document.218 I do not now recall this specific issue, but having reviewed my

        emails from this time, I believe I discussed it with WBD the next day by

        telephone, which I presume addressed the issues raised and enabled the

        appropriate disclosure to be made.

Case on the "settle centrally" button


232. The Inquiry has asked me how POL's case on the "settle centrally" button was

        prepared. I refer to my comments at paragraphs [217] and [220] above on the

        process adopted to prepare POL's Letter of Response and Generic Defence

        and Counterclaim. As the factual basis POL's case on "settle centrally" was an

        operational matter, it was not something I could comment on meaningfully and

        do not therefore think I will have made any material contribution to it. The Inquiry

        has also raised cross-examination of the claimants, which was largely a trial

        conduct matter determined by counsel. I do recall one discussion during the

        Horizon Issues trial about whether, in cross-examination, POL's counsel should

        put to a PMR witness that evidence they had given might amount to false

        accounting. Although this was not actively pursued I thought it appropriate to

        pose the question given it was I recall part of POL's case that false cash

        declarations would make it impossible to determine when and how a branch

        shortfall arose.219


Angela van den Bogerd's witness statement


233. Preparation of witness evidence for the Common Issues trial was dealt with

        directly between WBD and the relevant witnesses. I did however read and

        comment on the draft witness statements in much the same way I did the drafts

        of POL's Letter of Response and Generic Defence, namely to understand the

        gist of the evidence being given and make comments from my own knowledge

        where appropriate.

234. Angela van den Bogerd was the lead corporate witness for POL in the Common

        Issues trial, so I looked at her statement a little more closely than others. On 20

        August 2018 1 was copied into emails between Andy Parsons of WBD and

        Angela van den Bogerd over the preparation of her witness statement, and

        comments were marked for my attention.220 Angela van den Bogerd gave

        evidence on a number of matters reflecting POL's corporate position, for which

        there was no readily identifiable individual witness, so some of her evidence will

        have been based on information drawn from across POL's business. For

        example, her statement included information to contextualise various POL

        processes which had changed over time. My role was to address any

       comments specifically raised for me or point things out based on the knowledge

       I had developed of POL's business. My response on 23 August 2018 is an

       example of me flagging to Andy Parsons some information within my personal

       knowledge about work I knew had been done within POL (e.g. relating to ATMs

       and MoneyGram), in case it was helpful or relevant to include in what was

       essentially a corporate statement.


235. The Inquiry has asked me why I included in my email to Andy Parsons the

       following `overarching point':221


              "One overarching point on the witness statements: please make sure
              you are giving the witnesses the "health warning" on signing a statement
              of truth, i.e. they need to be confident that what they are saying is true
              to the best of their knowledge and belief, and that they don't accept
              something just because it's been through the lawyers."

        1 sent this at the time I had been reviewing and commenting on all of the POL

        witness statements for the Common Issues trial (of which Angela van den

        Bogerd's was one of, if not the, last), so the comment was of general application

        to all of POL's witnesses. Throughout my career it has been my practice to

        make this point explicitly to witnesses, even when they are experienced

        professionals, so that there is a clear understanding of the significance of what

        they are doing, and a paper trail recording that. I had no reason to believe that

        any of POL's witnesses would not be giving truthful evidence, but I did want

        them to be sure of what they were saying, and not, for example, feel they could

        rely on assumption or received wisdom.


236. I cannot comment on Mr Justice Fraser's findings at paragraph 544 of his

        Common Issues Judgment.222 I do however believe, based on my experience

        of working with her, that Angela van den Bogerd would have been diligent and

        given evidence to the best of her knowledge and belief.


PART 10.6: PREPARATION FOR HORIZON ISSUES TRIAL


My involvement in preparation for the Horizon Issues trial


237. As was the case               the Common Issues trial, POL's preparation for the Horizon
                              in




        Issues trial was led by its external legal team at WBD and counsel. I had less

        involvement in POL's preparation for the Horizon Issues trial than I had done

        for the Common Issues trial. This was partly because I was engaged in the

        Common Issues trial and attended court for significant periods of that

        preparation, and partly because the Horizon Issues trial was not about the legal

        relationship between POL and PMRs, but about factual or expert technical

        evidence about Horizon on which I had less to contribute. As noted above,

        much of POL's case on Horizon (including key issues such as BEDs and remote

        access) had already been set out in documents exchanged between the

        parties. As that had been derived from Fujitsu subject matter experts, much of

        the evidence similarly needed to come from Fujitsu employees. The

        contribution that I could therefore make was small, and I do not recall having

        any material input on the preparation of POL's witness evidence for the Horizon

       Issues trial, or material insight into the extent of the involvement of Fujitsu

        personnel in that process.


Witnesses and evidence


Robert Worden


238. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on a Steering Group Noting paper:

       Expert Report of Robert Worden'223 I believe this was intended to update the

       Steering Group as to the progress and overall conclusions of POL's expert

       witness Robert Worden, whose work as POL's appointed IT expert was of

       significant interest to POL. Paragraph 3.1 of the Steering Group document sets

       out the discussion POL's legal team was having with Robert Worden as to how

       to convey his opinions. I was aware that Robert Worden wanted to present his

       evidence in a quantitative way, using statistical analysis to demonstrate his

       conclusions, whereas POL had pleaded its case on a qualitative basis, so the

       external legal team asked him whether he could present the evidence in that

       way. I do not recall having any direct input into Robert Worden's evidence or

       these debates specifically, although I may have attended some meetings with

       him to get an understanding of his work given its importance to POL's case.


239. I cannot recall the detail of any discussions on this, but do recall the main

       concern within POL's legal team was that the quantitative analysis did not

       coherently convey Robert Worden's findings, which were generally positive

       about Horizon and supportive of POL's case on it. The feedback I had from

       POL's external legal team was that Robert Worden was very much his own man

       (as evidenced by his later volunteering of a third report to the court (see

       paragraph [246] below)). I was not therefore surprised that he maintained his

       quantitative analysis, but was pleased he also accepted the team's suggestion

       to present his findings in a more qualitative manner, with I believe both analyses

       ultimately being included in his report.


Gareth Jenkins


240. A conference was held in September 2018 to discuss whether to rely on

       Gareth Jenkins as a witness at the Horizon Issues trial. I attended that

       conference, along with counsel for the Horizon Issues trial, Anthony de Garr

       Robinson QC and Simon Henderson of counsel, Simon Clarke and Martin

       Smith of Cartwright King and Andy Parsons of WBD. As can be seen from the

       email Andy Parsons had written, which I forwarded to Cartwright King ahead of

       the conference,224 there was a concern about using Gareth Jenkins as a

       witness in the Horizon Issues trial given his previous role as a prosecution

       witness, and Simon Clarke's advice to POL of July 2013 that his credibility as

       an expert witness had been "fatally undermined'. A briefing paper to the

       Steering Group in December 2016 had also noted that Gareth's Jenkins'

       credibility had been damaged such that he could not give evidence in future.225

       My recollection of the September 2018 conference was that a firm view was

       formed that Gareth Jenkins should not be called as a witness because of his

       previous involvement        a witness in POL prosecutions, which were not the
                              as




       subject of the Horizon Issues trial, An alternative Fujitsu witness was therefore

       sought to present Fujitsu's current understanding of the problems Horizon had

       experienced, which ended up being Torstein Godeseth.


Robustness of the Horizon system


241.   I do not recall the first expert reports of Jason Coyne and Robert Warden

       causing POL concerns about the reliability of Horizon because they were, from

       recollection, largely positive about Horizon and indeed gave POL confidence in

       its case. Robert Warden's evidence remained consistently positive, but Jason

       Coyne's supplementary report served on 1 February 2019 recast his case to

       focus on some 22 bugs identified following his review of PEAKS. I was not close

       enough to the technical or factual detail to have firm views of my own on the

       overall implications of this. It was of course ultimately a matter for Mr Justice

       Fraser to make findings based on the evidence, including that of the experts

       who were producing their own reports. I do recall that my main concern with the

       Horizon Issues trial was about the potential impact a negative judgment about

        the Horizon system as operating in 2019 might have, given the loss of

        confidence that could lead to in a business-critical system being used in

        thousands of branches to process millions of transactions each day. In terms of

        any concerns about reliability of Horizon as impacting on convictions of PMRs,

        my comments about the different roles of the High Court and the CCRC at

        paragraph [205] above apply equally here.


Remote access in the Horizon Issues trial


242. As described at paragraph [218] above, the position on remote access changed

        over time as the Group Litigation unfolded. During the Horizon Issues trial itself

        the evidence of two Fujitsu witnesses, Stephen Parker and Torstein Godeseth,

        changed through successive witness statements and in cross-examination,

        with Mr Justice Fraser himself observing, in paragraphs 545 and 549 of his

        judgment,226 that it was only through the trial process and the evidence of

        Richard Roll that the true position on remote access became known, namely

        that .transaction data can be edited by Fujitsu without the knowledge of
        PMRs.227


Briefing to the Board subcommittee on the Horizon Issues trial

        KC briefed Board members about the upcoming Horizon Issues trial. At this

       judgment. It was unusual for me to attend the Board subcommittee but I was

       present and I recall Anthony de Garr Robinson KC going through his speaking

       note, of which I had been sent a copy in working draft.229 I have no specific

       recollection of any questions asked by the subcommittee in response to the

       briefing. The minutes for the meeting were taken by the assistant company

       secretary Veronica Branton and appear to reflect it fairly so far as I can recall.

       I am not sure why the phrase "critically robust" was used in the minutes, but

       recall that the question of whether Horizon was robust or not (and therefore

       unlikely to have been the cause of losses in the claimants' branches) was the

       critical issue in the Horizon Issues trial.


244. As the note reflects, POL had set itself a high bar to meet at trial. This inevitably

       gave rise to concerns about the prospects of success, particularly when

       meeting that high bar in large part depended on witnesses coming up to proof

       and Mr Justice Fraser preferring POL's evidence to that of the claimants. I

       believe Anthony de Garr Robinson KC's advice was that all litigation carries risk

       and it was possible the court would prefer Jason Coyne's evidence, which had

       improved through his supplementary report on 1 February 2018. Nevertheless,

       there was still significant confidence in POL's case. I do not know whether

       Deloitte reports were provided to the subcommittee, but Deloitte's work is

       mentioned in the minutes.


245. As far as I recall, POL's main commercial concern going into the Horizon Issues

       trial was the operational impact of a negative judgment on the Horizon system

       as it operated in 2019, as described at paragraph [241] above. As I have

        explained, it was not the role of the Common Issues and Horizon Issues trials

        to determine the safety of convictions. That was a matter for the CCRC and the

        criminal appeal courts which would consider any cases the CCRC might refer.

       I continued to provide Group Litigation materials to the CCRC, including the

       experts' reports and the Horizon Issues Judgment. Following the Horizon

       Issues Judgment POL also sought advice on its implications for its criminal law

        obligations from Brian Altman KC and Peters & Peters LLP.


Robert Worden's third report


246. In May 2019, the Horizon Issues trial was ongoing but Robert Warden had not

       yet been cross-examined. Following the conclusion of POL's factual evidence

       at the beginning of April 2019, Robert Warden indicated that he had come up

       with a different way of looking at the issues, and felt it was his duty as an

       independent expert to volunteer a third report to the court. This was not

       something that had been requested by either POL or its legal team, and I do

       not believe any application was made for permission to file the third report.

       However, Robert Warden felt he needed to provide it to the court directly himself

       and I do not believe it would have been for POL to dissuade him from acting in

       line with what he felt to be his duty. Robert Warden did provide his report directly

       to the court and my understanding is that the claimants' counsel and expert also

       received it.23° I do not know if Robert Worden was encouraged to send the

       report directly to Mr Justice Fraser's clerk, but I do not believe it was done on

       instructions from POL.231

PART 10.7: RECUSAL APPLICATION


247. POL received the draft Common Issues Judgment on 8 March 2019. The

        judgment came as a shock given the extent to which POL lost the case and the

        criticisms levelled against it. However, as the draft was delivered the Friday

        before the Horizon Issues trial started, I was in court for that trial and not part

        of the team which took the recusal application forward. Although I was aware

        that the application was being considered by POL senior management, WBD

        and counsel, I was not party to the discussions held or decisions made on it.


PART 10.8: ENGAGEMENT WITH CCRC DURING GROUP LITIGATION


248.    The Inquiry has asked me to comment on an agenda for a meeting with Fujitsu

        on 28 February 2017.232 I recall this meeting was arranged shortly after the

        Group Litigation Order was made, which required the parties to plead their

        cases through the spring and summer of 2017. As POL would require significant

        support from Fujitsu to do this, the meeting was held to ensure that Fujitsu

        would provide the agile, timely and accurate support POL required, and that it

        was aware of the consequences if it did not. From the agenda, I can see that

        the objective was to secure Fujitsu's commitment to supporting all necessary

        investigations, whether in connection with the Group Litigation or the CCRC.


249, As referred to in paragraph [1651, when Fujitsu's input was needed to respond

        to the CCRC I would generally ask WBD to prepare questions for me to send

        to Fujitsu, and I would then relay the answers back to the CCRC, usually stating

        that the responses had come from Fujitsu. I do not think Fujitsu were in direct

         dialogue with the CCRC, at least until the CCRC asked to view the KEL when I

         facilitated the visit described at paragraph [227} above.


Advice regarding CCRC review


250. The Inquiry has also shown me a briefing note from WBD regarding the CCRC

         review in April 2017.233 Unfortunately, with the passage of time, I am unsure of

         the context in which this was prepared, or the intended audience. Brian Altman

         KC's advice, mentioned at 5.6 of the briefing note, was disclosed to the CCRC

        in my email to Miles Trent of 7 February 2018.234 As I understand it, Brian

        Altman KC's reason for proposing that it not be disclosed to the CCRC was that

        it was just his opinion, and the CCRC would reach` its own conclusions. As such,

        it was not given to the CCRC until it was provided following the provision of the

        Swift Review and subsequent request for related material.


Disclosure of PEAKS KELs and ARQ data


251. As explained at paragraphs [222] to [226] above, the KEL was initially

        understood to be a live and evolving database which was technically difficult to

        disclose. POL nevertheless facilitated the CCRC's viewing of the `live' KEL at

        Fujitsu's offices. This was offered on 15 November 2017 in my email to Miles

        Trent, and taken up by the CCRC in January 2018.23-

        took place in March 2018, but I do not believe I attended it.236 Later Fujitsu

        found a way to extract the KEL, so that it could be disclosed. ARQ data was

        provided to the CCRC as requested,237 as were the expert reports produced for

       the Horizon Issues trial.238 I cannot now recall what disclosure of PEAKS data

        occurred, but POL's approach was to provide the CCRC with the materials they

        required, so whenever they made requests we did what we could to meet them.

        For example, following a meeting on 28 July 2017 we were able, with

        assistance from Fujitsu, to put together a detailed response to outstanding

       questions Grant Thornton had raised for the CCRC about local suspense

        accounts, transaction corrections and discrepancies, which was attached to my

       email to the CCRC of 24 September 2017.239 As noted previously, WBD

       supported me in preparing correspondence and collating material for the

        CCRC, and my role was to try to ensure our responses fulfilled the CCRC's

        request, consider whether anything further could be provided, and conclude

       with the offer to provide anything further they may require.


252.   The Inquiry has asked me to comment on the issues the CCRC raised

        regarding the Misra transaction logs.240 My concern was to ensure that the

        CCRC had the documents and information it required to perform its functions.

       When the CCRC asked questions about the Misra transaction logs, I believe I

       will have followed the usual process of asking WBD to track down the

        information and prepare a draft reply,         I could review this and relay the answer
                                                  so

          to the CCRC. This appears to have included locating the original files and

          creating better, more legible, scans of the transaction logs 241


PART 11: FOLLOWING THE GROUP LITIGATION


253. Following the settlement of the Group Litigation, POL needed to deliver the

          commitments it made in the Group Litigation Settlement Deed. Most

          significantly, this required me to work with Herbert Smith Freehills LLP to

          establish for POL the Historic/Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS). I was also

          involved in onboarding Peters & Peters LLP to conduct for POL the post-

          conviction disclosure exercise (PCDE) required following the Horizon Issues

          Judgment and generally support POL with developments concerning PMR

          convictions.


254. My recollection is that POL's Board was directly engaged with POL's external

          lawyers in respect of the HSS, PCDE and other work concerning PMR

          convictions. My role was to facilitate that engagement by coordinating with

          POL's external lawyers the materials necessary to enable the Board to give the

          external lawyers the instructions required to progress matters. This involved

          working with the external advisers to identify the key decisions that needed to

          be made, provide the information needed to inform and support the decision-

          making process, ensure this was delivered in a timely and digestible form, and

          then take such further action as the Board might require. This also involved

          substantial engagement with those representing POL's shareholder to secure

          the funding POL required to offer compensation to affected PMRs (whether

          through the HSS or following an overturned conviction), and to comply with the

                                                             Statement Number: WITNO8420100

       conditions upon which funding would be provided. The Board would then make

       the necessary decisions and give the required instructions to POL's external

       lawyers. This involved substantial activity and liaison within POL, and with its

       shareholder and external advisers, which activity was made more challenging

       due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.


PART 12: GENERAL


255. I have always thought of my professional role as being dispute resolution. I

       regret that the various processes intended to resolve the PMRs' civil law based

       Horizon complaints have not yet achieved that resolution. I hope that will

       happen soon. I hope my statement assists the Inquiry in completing its

       important work. I am happy to assist further if required.
