Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 27/01/03

1.0 Introduction

The Horizon system generates significant amounts of data that is of interest to Post Office Ltd
Internal Audit and other groups. The Horizon System Audit Manual [2], and the supporting
Audit Data Catalogues [4-8] provide further information on the structure, form and content of
this data, referred to in this document as ‘audit data’.

Subject to certain constraints the audit data must be made available to POLIA or other
authorised groups within time scales established in the Audit Data Retrieval Requirements
(CSR+) [3] and the Network Banking Internal Audit Requirements [10].

This document establishes the process for requesting audit data extractions and subsequent
activities undertaken to locate, retrieve, extract & filter and prepare for despatch on behalf of
authorised requesters.

2.0 Scope

Should future releases of Horizon bring about changes to the way that data is extracted this
process will be updated to reflect those changes.

This process applies to ALL audit data extraction requests in respect of:
1. PSS ARQs

2. Other requests from POLIA.

3. Internal Requests

Internal requests for audit data extraction will also be subject to this process. In these cases
the use of an Audit Record Query (ARQ) form is optional but a PinICL must be raised to the
data extraction stack.

4.0 Audit Data Integrity

The integrity of audit data must be guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and
retrieval to subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been established to provide
assurances to Post Office Internal Audit that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply:

a Extractions can only be made through the Audit Workstations, which exist at Feltham and
the 2 Data Centres. These are all subject to rigorous physical security controls appropriate
to that location. Specifically, the Feltham AWs — where most extractions will take place —
are located in secure rooms subject to proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu
Services site.

a Logical access to the AWs and their functionality is controlled by dedicated Logins,
password control and utilises the NT and Pathway security features defined in the overall
Horizon security policy.

a All extractions are logged on the Audit System and supported by documented ARQs,
authorised by nominated persons within POLIA. This log can be scrutinised on the AWs.

a Extractions will only be undertaken by individuals previously notified to POLIA. Currently
this is limited to Pathway Audit and Pathway CS Security Prosecution Support personnel.
Any additions will be notified to POLIA

a Agreement has been reached with POLIA regarding their rights to witness extractions
without warning or to request repeat extractions that they can witness.

a Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit archive
and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

Fujitsu Services AUDIT DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS, Ref: 1A/PRO/004
Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 27/01/03

6.0 Overview

The process assumes that audit data has been Gathered, Sealed and written to audit
archive. The five main types of files are :

a. TMS Journals from the Correspondence Servers.
b. Flattened Oracle tables output from regular OBCS database purging cycles.
c. Transaction files to and from PO systems

d. AP Client Files
e. Tivoli Event files
All file types are referenced in the audit data catalogues [4-8]

The process is invoked through the receipt of an ARQ into Pathway CS Security PSS.
Expressed in business terms, the ARQ must be interpreted into its component Audit
Points and Sub-points. This then enables specific files to be identified and retrieved by
the Audit Retriever, formatted as appropriate and then further Extracted against the
ARQ criteria. Depending on the extraction method the data can be extracted to
standard MSExcel 95 before being placed onto CD-W or floppy disc for despatch to
the ARQ originator.

The following paragraphs present an overview of each step in the extraction process
and are ordered to reflect the actual processing of a Audit Record Query (ARQ) by
Pathway CS Security PSS.

6.1 Audit Record Query

All POLIA requests for audit data must be made via the Audit Record Query form.
This will contain a description, in business terms, of the times, outlets, events, items
activities that the Auditors are interested in. This request has to be interpreted by
Pathway CS Security PSS and mapped onto the Audit Points and Files described later
in this document.

Internal requests (e.g. from Pathway investigations personnel) will typically be in the
form of a PinICL on the ‘Dataextraction’ stack for CS Security.

6.2 Marking Files and Tapes
Based on the above interpretation of the ARQ, as many files of audit data that are
needed to satisfy the request are ‘marked’ for retrieval.

6.3 Audit Track Retriever

Polls the user area buffers and makes them available to sealer for seal verification

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 27/01/03

6.4 Audit Data Check Seal

To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive the checksum seal
for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive. The result is
maintained in a Check Seal Table.

6.5 Audit Trail Extractor

This is a facility that uses various tools to extract or reform the retrieved audit data in
accordance with the ARQ. It also places the information onto a CD-W, or other
suitable media, for despatch to the ARQ originator.

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 27/01/03

7.0 Retrieving & Extracting Audit Data
7.1 Receiving the ARQ

a) POLIA requests for audit data extractions must come to Pathway CS Security PSS
in the form of an Audit Record Query. An example of this form can be found at Annex
A. The ARQ may be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to Pathway CS Security PSS.

ARQs will only be accepted from persons fulfilling the following role or their delegate

POL Internal Audit. Casework Manager: _ Tel ::

Current names of persons fulfilling this role will be confirmed in writing by POLIA
Internal Audit and held locally by PSS.

If other parts of the Post Office, or other organisations, require audit data extractions
they must be channelled through POLIA to Pathway CS Security PSS.

Contractual limits and turnaround times for the provision of Audit Record Queries are
detailed in the document Network Banking Management of Prosecution Support. [11]

b) Internal requests will be in the form of a PinICL, allowing the requestor’s identity
to be verified. Requestors should state what media is acceptable (e.g. CD-W, email of
WinZipped file up to 500kB) The despatching of confidential data is bound by Fujitsu
Services policy. For TMS files - also referred to as “message store” or
“Correspondence Server”- they should also specify the output file format(s): text, MS-
Excel or MS-Access. (See Section 8 for more information).

POLIA and Internal requests are recorded on the PSS Database (User Guide for
Prosecution Support Database [12]). They should be logged to record the following
information: Request id (e.g. ARQ no.), the date the request was received, the FAD
and date range to search. Turnaround times are covered by contract as specified in the
CCD CS/SER/016.

7.2 Interpreting the ARQ

It is necessary to interpret the ARQ by identifying the audit points and sub points that
generated the records that are required and, through the Audit Data Catalogues [4-8],
the files produced at those audit points and sub points.

Carry out following procedure to Login and obtain necessary shares

1. Login 1 RH

2. Password : *#*# kK

3. Domain :PWYDCS

At this point the SecureI[D Authentication is invoked. See SecurID Normal Token
User Guide [9].

Carry out the following procedure to authenticate yourself as an authorised user

1. Enter passcode _: <personal 6 digit PIN and 6 digit SecureID token display>

The AW will present a blank desktop with a START icon in the bottom left of the

screen. Using pull up <Programs> will reveal the extent of products available for any
subsequent extraction work, as shown in Figure 1.

Start Menu

Figure 1

7.4 Preliminary Housekeeping

It is highly likely that an average ARQ will need a significant number of files to satisfy
it. To avoid the AW filestore becoming clogged with hundreds of files it is strongly
recommended that a working directory is established on the AW to hold all files
relevant to a particular ARQ:

1. Select <Windows_NT_Explorer> from the drop down menu.
2. Set up <New Folder> as D:\audit data\ARQ Reference No.
7.5 Targeting the Data Files

At this stage of the retrieval procedure the Audit Extractor Client is used to identify
and mark the files required for retrieval.

Unzipping Zipped Flat Files - It is strongly recommended that files to be unzipped are
transferred from the AS to the AW in their zipped state and unzipped on the AW. This
can produce space savings of the order of 90%.

NT Explorer is used as a tool for viewing files associated with an ARQ. As cach new
request is logged on the Audit Extractor Client using ‘New RFI’ a directory will be
created on the audit server for which the request was initiated from. Each directory
takes the Audit Extractor Client RFI Reference ic. POIA****. This main directory
holds the sub directories; Extracted_at, Restore_at and Retrieved_at. The main
directory includes a txt file named using the Audit Extractor Client RFI reference.
This files contains details of each process initiated through the Audit Extractor Client.
NT Explorer allows a window to view these files and directories.

11.0 Introduction to R-Query

R-Query is an interrogation tool used to extract data from a Correspondence Server. It
has powerful SQL type features, which are used to define the extraction scenarios and
the ability to output the results to standard MS-Office utilities.

It is a vital element in the Audit Workstation tool set and requires that a
Correspondence Server exists on one of the Audit Workstations or Servers. Details on
how to achieve this pre-requisite can be found earlier in this procedure.

11.1 Invoking R-Query and Connecting to a
Correspondence Server.

The Riposte Query initial screen is invoked from the start menu.

Fun Quey

The <Save and Restore> dialogue provides the opportunity to restore scenarios that
have already been scripted for further use.

SCENARIOS FOR RE-USE EXIST AT TWO LEVELS:
Those that are associated with the current Correspondence Server.
Those that have been saved to an external file or Catalogue.

Scenarios associated with the Correspondence Server exist only while that particular
CS exists. If the user believe that an extraction scenario is likely to be re-usable it’s as
well to remember that unless the scenario is saved to an external file it will not be
available if a new CS is built for another retrieval exercise.

Use these steps to re-use scenarios associated with current Correspondence Server.
Go to ‘Save and Retrieve Queries using Message Store’ window.

Select <Refresh> to list all scenarios associated with the current Correspondence
Server.

Highlight the required scenario and select <Retrieve>.

11.3 Running the Query

Normally the user would not actually execute the retrieval scenario until such time as
they had built the query statement (the Where tab), selected the fields (Select Cols)
and chosen the output medium (Output Options). However, at any time in this
sequence they can run the query statement by selecting <Run Query> using the button
on the “Save and Restore” tab.

Enter the required Post Office (FAD) code into the <Group ID:> field if it is not
shown.

Once this has been done an intermediate screen will be displayed, allowing the file
format to be confirmed — select the <Excel> or <Access> buttons or the “text” icon, as
appropriate to commence loading the package and complete the data transfer. This will
also allow the data format to be checked on-screen

Note: In the case of very large Correspondence Server files spanning a number of
days, an error may be generated on trying to save an Excel file. This will be because
the maximum number of rows (records) has been exceeded. Should this occur, the
range of dates should be covered, say one or two days at a time, and a number of
output files generated.

In rare cases it will theoretically be possible to produce a text output file that is too big
to be read by Wordpad. Should this occur, a possible response is to produce output
files for a smaller range of dates, or to initially create data as an Excel working file
which can be ‘Save As’ “Text, OS/2 or MS-DOS”.

It is good practice to check that all output files can be opened before they are copied
to floppy disk or CD-W for onward transmission.
