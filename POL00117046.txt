I hope the attached helps.

I'm afraid that I fundamentally disagree on Part Two. I am sure it is being written to support litigation against us. But
I have tried to cover Paula’s point below in the update note. And Mark has offered his view.

Let me know if you need anything further

Tom - can we cover Paula's point below in my note of earlier please? We can pick up in the morning

Thanks for this and for all you're doing on sparrow at the moment - it is much appreciated!

Ho Gavin, or even Hi Gavin!

Could you make sure the above has a bullet on the SS Report and how we plan to welcome,
respond, comment, use it to show the progress we have made on the themes it will cover, etc. At
the last discussion, Mark and some of the team were of the view that we should try and stop it.
Both Alice and I believe that would be unhelpful and play into the (false) narrative about secrecy
ete.

Thanks, Paula
