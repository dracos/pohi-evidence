MEETING DATES
Dates 2002.doc

Attached is the timetable for ASF and HSRF meetings for 2002. Both forums have now gone to bi-monthly meetings but
with a 'standby' date in the month where one isn't planned in case any burning issues arise.

You will notice that the HSRF dates are now a lot earlier than previously so it is vital that I receive feedback from the
operational review forums a couple of days prior to the ASF meeting - ideally by the 10th as detailed on the service
review feedback form. Sorry if this causes problems with dates you already have scheduled for next year.

I suggest that you still provide feedback on a monthly basis as one of the 'burning issues’ may come out of your reports
which would result in a meeting being called.

As you probably know these meetings are liable to change from time to time due to other commitments but I will keep
you updated as and when they occur.

Regards

Sue
