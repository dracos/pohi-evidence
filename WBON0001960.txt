Andrew and Amy
Notes from the meeting yesterday:

The meeting was restricted to 2 sections, these included a demonstration of how the KEL system worked and then
viewing of documents in the Dimensions system. Explanations were only provided when technical terms e.g. stages
in banking reconciliation were presented in the KELs. He did ask for an explanation of the recovery process but
greed that was not part of the scope of this meeting and would need to be picked up at an appropriate stage.

Mr Coyne asked for an overview of the Horizon systems and an explanation of the Core Audit System which he said
he would request through Freeth’s.

KELs

After taking a photograph of the instructions on how to use the KEL system and a discussion on what type of data
was held the following key word searches were done with the KELs picked out from the KEL title for printing listed
below. Many of the KELs contained more than one keyword so are listed below with the printed KEL in the pdf
attached (62 in total).

All the KELs in this search were form HNGX (Post 2008 when development KELs first appeared, one was found for
2001 but found to be a typing error and should have been dated 2010. One of the KELs printed was
Wrightm33145J which appeared to refer to a bug that was disclosed as part of the Second Sight report. He
reported he had not seen any of the documents and that he had only received the documents WBM supplied at
4.00pm on the previous day.

At the time of the meeting Horizon KELs could not be found. Later in the day after discussion the Horizon KELs
were identified in a historical section of the system so a re-visit may be required to view these KELs.

Searches

e¢ Correction — returned 37 KELs

© Discrepancy — returned 48 KELs

e¢ Balance — Returned 70 KELs

« — Reconciliation — Returned 98 KELs
e Fixed — Returned 272 KELs

Mr Coyne went through a list of documents from the list which were found based on the searches above from the
Schedule 2 and 3 lists. He will then produce a list of documents that will be requested through Freeth’s. They all
appeared relevant but would need to be checked before release. He did ask to see several major incident reports
that were included in the document set so we will get more questions on these documents once they have access
to them.

Pete
