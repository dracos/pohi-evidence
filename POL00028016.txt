This dispute case was raised by the postmaster in January 2021. It relates to a £650
discrepancy which was settled centrally on the 5 December 2020. The case has been
investigated by Tier 2; however, the postmaster would like the case investigating
further.

Investigation Overview

Note: Within this section the dispute should be broken down into sections to investigate.
For example:

The postmaster raised there was a £650 discrepancy, however this can be broken down
into the following points to be investigated:

Point 1 - The postmaster states there was an initial discrepancy of £250 on the 25"
November 2020.

Investigation findings against this point. This can include images or copies of
transactional information, which will assist in explaining the investigation to the claimant
and internal colleagues.

Point 2 - The postmaster states there was a 2" discrepancy on £400 on the 30"
November 2020.

Investigation findings against this point. This can include images or copies of
transactional information, which will assist in explaining the investigation to the claimant
and internal colleagues.

Inve: jation Conclu

Note: This section is to finalise the findings of the Investigation Overview section into a
conclusion on the case.

Additional Case Findings

Note: This can be findings which do not specifically relate to the case, but are
appropriate to send on to a different team in the business; for example the branch are
processing reversals for small value transactions to cash, which could highlight the
branch taking retail transactions at the Post Office counter. This would be something to
feedback to the Area Manager.

Additional Support Required

Note: This section can contain any support which is recommended as being required. For
example; It is recommended that the branch is provided additional training and support
around cash declarations and lottery accounting. This additional training would then
need to be requested by the analyst.

Business Improvements

Note: This section is to note any potential business improvements which have been
raised through the investigation.
