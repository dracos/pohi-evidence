Martin
Thanks for the advice below.

At the Working Group meeting last Thursday POL floated the idea of not mediating criminal cases (as per your advice)
and received fierce push back from JFSA and some resistance from Tony Hooper. For various reasons, we never
directly addressed the question of mediatin :- those questions are likely to be raised
on the weekly WG call on Thursday.

POL would prefer to avoid leaving the WG with a "yes / no" decision on whether to mediate a criminal case or not. To
that end, we are considering the idea of holding a face to face meeting with the "criminal" applicants to the Scheme
rather than mediating. This allows POL to frame the meeting differently — for example, we could setup the meeting to
“explain POL's findings" rather than "settle" disputes, and make clear that no compromise is being offered.

POL have asked me to get your view on whether the criminal risk is different for this type of meeting rather than
mediating? If POL were to go down this route, please could you also advise on what steps / measures it could take to
further reduce any risk (eg. letters setting out the basis for the meeting, criminal lawyers at the meeting, etc.).

Please bear in mind that POL are going to get pushed hard on this topic by JFSA / Tony Hooper so your advice needs
to be very robust. We may need to set up a meeting / call with you and POL so that they can test your thinking.

I'd be grateful you could provide the advice by close tomorrow. It would be useful if it could again include some
speaking notes.

If you need more context, please feel free to give me a call. Best on the mobile as I'm travelling a lot today.

Kind regards
Andy
