                                                             Dated: 24 October 2023




                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY



        FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DEBORAH ALISON EDWARDS




I, Deborah Alison Edwards, will say as follows...



Introduction



   1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 23 August

      2023 (the "Request").



   2. The facts within this statement have either come from my own recollections

      and knowledge or rely on the documentation that has been provided by the

      Inquiry. As these events happened over 16 years ago I am unable to recall

      specific events but have provided as much detail as possible in order to assist

      the Inquiry.

  3. I can confirm I was assisted by the Post Office in confirming insurance

     coverage for support in preparing my statement. I have also been assisted by

     DAC Beachcroft LLP in the preparation and drafting of my statement.



Relevant Background



  4. I am a former employee of Post Office Limited ("POL"). I joined POL in June

     1989 and left the company on 30 September 2016.



  5. During my employment at POL, I worked in several different roles. My first

     role was as a Counter Clerk where I worked until 1995 when I became a

     Branch Auditor. As a Branch Auditor I would visit POL branches to audit

     branch cash and stock, ensuring subpostmasters and their staff members

     were compliant with POL process. I left this role in July 2007 to become a

     Field Change Advisor where I would assist branches who were planning to

     refurbish or relocate.



  6. In June 2009 I became Assistant Branch Manager at Crewe Crown Branch

     Office. As Assistant Branch Manager my role was to manage POL employed

     staff members, plan weekly duties including seating plans and break times,

     coach the team in sales and complete random and unannounced stock unit

     checks.



  7. In February 2012 I moved to become Property Project Manager ("PPM"), a

     role I held until I left POL in September 2016. As a PPM I visited branches at



                                    Page 2 of 30
                                                                                    WITNO9080100
                                                                                 WITNO9080100




   the request of Field Change Advisors, working with the subpostmaster to plan

   and calculate the cost of changes to physical counters. During my time in the

   Property Project Team, I took a temporary promotion to Senior Property

   Project Manager between May 2015 to October 2015.



8. The Inquiry has asked me specifically about my position as a Field Support

   Advisor ("FSA"). I did not hold the job title of FSA as this role came in much

   later than when I was in the team and I had already moved roles. My job title

   was Branch Auditor. After six years working as a Counter Clerk I applied for

   the role of Branch Auditor and was successful at interview. The role involved

   me attending Post Office branches to verify assets and check procedures

   were being adhered to. When I started in the role I had good experience of

   working in a Post Office branch from my time as a Counter Clerk. In my role

   as a Counter Clerk I would help the subpostmaster count the cash and stock

   on hand in branch to help them complete the branch accounts each week.

   Also as Crown Office Counter Clerk I would help with counting cash and stock

   and doing the weekly account for the stock unit I worked on. Completing

   these tasks gave me good experience for the work I did as a Branch Auditor.



9. After being successfully appointed as Branch Auditor I initially spent time

   accompanying the other Branch Auditors on audits and was shown the

   processes and procedures to follow. I mainly learnt the role from on-the-job

   training, shadowing and mentoring. I was given competencies to complete to

   demonstrate my ability to do the role. I cannot recall the exact details now but

   remember this focused on specific elements of the role such as calculating the



                                  Page 3 of 30
                                                                                          WITNO9080100
                                                                                     WITNO9080100




      value of pension payments or building the branch balance. Over time I would

      have less coaching and would need to demonstrate to my line manager that I

      had met specific competencies as they observed me on audits. When I was a

      Branch Auditor, I worked for several line managers although I can now only

      remember the names of two; Glyn Burrows and Kevin Orgill. During my time

      in the role, I felt I was always treated with respect and professionalism. I felt

      competent in the role and had no concerns with the competency of my

      colleagues.



   10. During my time as Branch Auditor, I did not have any responsibility for

      disciplinary matters or interviewing those accused of criminal offences. I had

      no involvement in disclosure for criminal or civil proceedings or litigation case

      strategy. My role was limited to the audit of the branch and concluded when

      the audit report had been completed. I had no further involvement in

      progressing cases or liaising with other Post Office departments. The only

      time I can recall any further involvement was when a case had gone to court

      and I was asked to produce a witness statement, however such requests were

      unusual.



   11. I estimate I attended approximately 3 audits per week during my time as a

      Branch Auditor. I cannot remember the names of the different branches but

      would attend a broad range offering different services.



The audit process and the polices/practices in place

                                                                                      WITNO9080100
                                                                                    WITN09080100




   12. During my time in the Audit Team my role as Branch Auditor would involve me

      verifying POL assets, by counting cash and stock (for example postal stamps,

      saving stamps, postal orders etc) and completing post audit reports to ensure

      assets were tracked and branches were complying with the business

      requirements and standards. It is over 16 years since I was a Branch Auditor,

      and I can no longer recall the policies and practices that were in place in

      relation to the audit or when these policies and practices changed during the

      time period.



Recruitment and training of Auditors



   13. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the following documents:



         i.   "Assurance Review - Recruitment (Vetting & Training)" (version 1.0, 27

              October 2009) (POL00032698);

        ii.   "Network auditing approach, methods and assurance" (2013)

              (POL00086765);

       iii.   "Training & Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088453);

       iv.    "Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088557).



   14. In regard to the first two documents, the Assurance review (POL00032698)

      and Network auditing approach, methods and assurance (POL00086765),

      both these documents were produced after I was in post as a Branch Auditor.

      In regard to the other last two documents, Training & Audit Advisor

      (POL0008453) and Audit advisor (POL00088557) I do not recall previously



                                       Page 5 of 30
                                                                                     WITNO9080100
                                                                                  WITN09080100




   seeing these documents but note that the role of Training & Audit Advisor was

   a role that came in after I had left the Audit team. I do recognised elements of

   the Audit Advisor description which formed part of my role.



15. I never recruited anyone during my time as Branch Auditor and my only

   experience of the recruitment process was when I was recruited into the team.

   I can no longer recall the recruitment criteria or how the selection process was

   completed. I applied for the role as an internal candidate, was interviewed

   and was successfully appointed. I remember there were internal people, like

   me, recruited into the team from other areas of POL but do not remember if

   they tended to come from specific teams.



16. I am unsure if there was a minimum level of qualification and/or experience

   before you could conduct a branch audit. I did not have any specific

   qualifications for the role but had good experience of Post Office branches.

   As set out above, Audit training was completed on the job and a Line Manger

   would have to sign off a Branch Auditor as compliant. I was not a line

   manager in the Audit team and did not conduct this process but was signed off

   compliant when I was inducted into the team. I cannot recall the criteria that

   would have been used to assess whether a Branch Auditor was compliant but

   remember it was based on achieving specific competencies as I have noted

   above.



17. It is over 16 years since I was a Branch Auditor, and I can no longer recall the

   finer detail of any induction, training or refresher procedures. As far as I recall



                                   Page 6 of 30
                                                                                       WITNO9080100
                                                                                      WITN09080100




      following my appointment I attended audits and shadowed colleagues for a

      number of months to learn the audit process. The length of time spent

      shadowing was dependent on how long it took an individual to learn the tasks

      for the role. This could be dependent on the types of audits they were

      shadowing as not every branch would include the full set of procedures and it

      may take longer to ensure an individual was fully compliant. Once a person

      was considered compliant they would be observed by an Audit Manager and,

      where appropriate, signed off as compliant. Following this induction period

      Branch Auditors were also provided with mentoring from more experienced

      colleagues to support their continued development. As a Branch Auditor you

      had a yearly appraisal. The appraisal would review the work you had

      completed in the previous year, review line manager observations and

      consider whether you had met the expected standards.



   18. From my experience working within the sub-Post Office and Crown network, I

      believe I had the right skillset for the role of Branch Auditor. As a Counter

      Clerk I had completed stock unit balances and cash accounts in branch for

      some time and was fully conversant with how branch accounts were prepared.

      I think this gave me a good understanding of how a branch operated and

      manged its cash and stock on a day-to-day basis.



   19. From what I can now recall I did not have any concerns about the training that

      was provided or the ongoing support in the Audit team.



The planning and scheduling of audits

                                                                                     WITNO9080100
                                                                                    WITN09080100




   20. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the document "Audit Plan & Scheduling,

      Chapter 1 of the Audit Process Manual (Version 8.0) (2010)" (POL00084650).

      I was not in post as an Auditor when this version was in place. I do not

      remember any version of this document. Looking at the document it appears

      that this would have been used by the Audit Manager and I do not believe it

      would have been readily available to the Branch Auditors.



   21. I have very limited knowledge of the scheduling process as this was not part of

      my role. I was only aware of the weekly schedule that was provided to me by

      the Audit Manager. The weekly schedule would provide me with details of the

      branches I would be auditing the following week, although it may provide for

      slightly longer in exceptional circumstances, such as when the Audit Manager

      was going on holiday. I am unaware of how the weekly schedule was

      produced.



   22. I am also unaware of the circumstances in which branch audits were

      scheduled, how promptly they were scheduled or how frequently a branch

      would be audited. It was not part of my role to make any enquires or complete

      an investigation before a branch visit and I am not aware of any steps that

      were taken before an audit took place. My role was to verify Post Office

      assets on site and did not extend to any actions taken before or after the

      onsite audit except for preparing the audit report.

         (version 5.1, May 2010) (POL00084801);

                                                                                 WITN09080100




   I have reviewed the documents and note that POL00085534, POL00087627,

   P0L00088252, P0L00087672, P0L00087614 and P0L00087688 were not

   published or available when I was in the role of Branch Auditor. I cannot recall

   the other documents from my time in the role.



24. When commencing an audit a selection of reports would be collected from the

   Horizon system. This was usually done by the Lead Auditor although they

   would sometimes delegate this task to one of the Auditors. These reports

   would be used to verify cash and stock items and to build the account of the

   office which included checking receipts and payments. Cash on hand would

   have been verified to the report held at the branch. This report would have

   been completed by the subpostmaster or their staff at the close of business

   from the day before. As far as I am aware the Auditors and subpostmasters

   had access to the same information when an audit was conducted. From my

   recollection there were no differences in the source information according to

   the type of audit being conducted. I cannot recall any differences between

   Crown Office branches and other branches when conducting an audit.



25.The Branch Auditor leading the audit would keep the subpostmaster up to

   date with their progress throughout the audit. This would normally involve

   letting them know when each unit of stock or cash had been counted and what

   the outcome of that unit had been. During the audit the subpostmaster may be

   asked to clarify if all cash or stock had been counted. Once the cash, stock

   and receipts and payments had been verified, any discrepancies would be re-

   verified and any discrepancies, shortfalls or surpluses were discussed with the



                                 Page 10 of 30
                                                                                      WITNO9080100
                                                                                 WITN09080100




   subpostmaster. Time was allowed for the subpostmaster, if they wanted to, to

   check the discrepancies and confirm them. Once discrepancies had been

   checked, the result of the audit would be shared with the subpostmaster. After

   the conclusion of the asset verification, a set of procedural question would be

   asked. At the end of the procedural question section any points raised that

   were not in line with current procedures were discussed with the

   subpostmaster and guidance was given to enable the subpostmaster to

   correctly follow the procedures. Branch Auditors were always available to

   listen to subpostmasters' questions or queries. If any queries or questions fell

   out of the Audit domain, the Branch Auditor would ask the subpostmaster to

   raise the query with the Helpline.



26. I was aware of the process of asking subpostmasters to make good any

   shortfalls at the time of audit. I believe this was the subpostmasters'

   contractual obligation. It was also the case that when a surplus was identified

   the subpostmaster was informed and they could withdraw the surplus. I would

   have been made aware of this process through my training and this practice

   was in place throughout the period that I was a Branch Auditor. Where there

   was a shortfall the Branch Auditor could accept cash and/or a cheque from the

   subpostmaster to cover the shortfalls. I have been asked by the Inquiry for my

   views on this practice and whether I questioned it at the time. I did not have

   any views on this particular practice and accepted it as it was part of the

   process. I did not question it at the time.


27. If a discrepancy or shortfall was discovered the Lead Auditor would discuss

   the details with the subpostmaster who would be given the opportunity to


                                  Page 11 of 30
                                                                                     WITNO9080100
                                                                                WITN09080100




   check that the discrepancies were correct. During the audit the

   subpostmaster would be given the time he needed to check the discrepancy

   amounts but I am unsure whether they had the opportunity to provide any

   further information or undertake their own investigation into the discrepancies

   as this would be dealt with by the Security/Investigation team and the Contract

   Team after the audit was complete.


28. I have been asked by the Inquiry if it was possible to conduct a branch audit

   in circumstances in which it was not possible to access the Horizon IT System.

   Assets could be physically counted and then recorded on Branch Auditors'

   computers to be verified once the Horizon system was re-instated.



29. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the documents Audit Trail Functional

   Specification (version 8.0, 18 October 2004) (FUJ00001894) and Global User

   Account (September 2016) (POL00002841). I cannot recall seeing or using

   FUJ00001894 and I was not in post as Branch Auditor when POL00002841

   was in place.



30.The Inquiry has also asked me whether Fujitsu were involved in the audit

   process. As far as I can remember Fujitsu were not part of any audits I was

   involved in and I am not aware of any involvement they had in the audit

   process.



31.The Inquiry has also asked me to comment on the Audit Global User Account.

   I do not recall the Audit Global User Account or any audit measures that were

      in place in respect of the Audit Global User Accounts so am unable to

      comment any further.



Prosecution of Carl Page



   32. I have limited recollection of the prosecution of Mr Page as my role was limited

      to completing the audit, as part of the audit team, and later completing a

      witness statement. I do not recall much about these events and can only

      recall completing the witness statement as it was provided to me by the

      Inquiry.



   Initial Investiaation by Customs & Excise



   33. 1 was a member of the audit team who attended the Rugeley branch on 14

      January 2003. 1 would have first been made aware of the audit by the weekly

      audit plan which set out my schedule of work. I do not recall being made

      aware of any of the issues at the branch prior to the audit and do not recall

      when I first became involved in Mr Page's case, other than when I was asked

      to complete a witness statement.



   34. I do not recall being made aware that HM Customs and Excise had raised

      issues with this branch and I am not aware of them completing any audits. I

      also do not recall being made aware of Staffordshire Major Crime Units

      involvement prior to the audit that took place on 14 January 2003.

                                                                                      WITN09080100




   35. In my experience as an Auditor it was normal practice for the Auditors to have

      no prior knowledge of the issues before they attended an audit. This

      protected the integrity of the audit by ensuring the audit was not prejudiced by

      the ongoing investigation. The investigators may have an expected outcome

      from the Audit but we would have no prior knowledge and would approach an

      audit with no expectations of what we might find. We may be made aware

      that an investigation or security manager would be attending the audit but we

      would have no knowledge of their investigation. They would not be part of the

      audit and we would only report the outcome to them.



Audit of Rugeley Branch



   36. As noted above, the first I would have known about this audit was when I was

      provided with the weekly audit plan, this would have been received the week

      before. I was unaware of any circumstances surrounding the audit or why it

      had been requested. My role was to ensure the audit was completed. I can

      see from my Witness Statement in the proceedings against Carl Page

      (POL00093897) that the audit appears to have been requested by the Post

      Office Investigation Team.



   37. I am aware from the information shared by the Inquiry that there was a team of

      four Auditors allocated to the audit of Rugeley Branch: myself, Kevin Orgill,

      Glyn Burrows and one other. I cannot recall who the fourth Auditor was and

      am only aware that Mr Orgill and Mr Burrows were the other Auditor's that day

      by the information that has been shared by the Inquiry.

                                                                                   WITN09080100




38.Tasks on any audit are allocated by the Lead Auditor. From reading my

   Witness Statement (POL00093897) I can see that I was allocated to check the

   foreign currency stock unit that day. I cannot recall the events of that day but

   under the normal process when each task was complete audit documentation

   would be returned to the Lead Auditor providing the results of the checks and

   highlighting any discrepancies. At this point discrepancies would be shared

   with the subpostmaster who would be given time to verify them. The Lead

   Auditor would then prepare the overall account for the branch to determine the

   overall branch position. This would involve the Lead Auditor inputting into

   their laptop the results from the Auditors' counting and checks to calculate the

   overall position of the branch i.e. whether there was an overall shortfall or

   surplus.



39. I do not recall any discussions I had with either Mr Page, Manish Patel or any

   of the investigators during the audit but usually when I have identified any

   discrepancies I would discuss them with the Lead Auditor who would then

   arrange for them to be shared with the subpostmaster and anyone else as

   appropriate. This would also enable the Lead Auditor to write the audit report.



40. I cannot recall the details of the outcome of the audit but using the information

   within my Witness Statement (POL00093897) and the Expert Accountant's

   Report of David Liddell (POL00062201) as a reference point, they indicate a

   number of discrepancies were found. Unfortunately, after the time that has

                                                                                  WITNO9080100




   now passed I am unable to remember any further details in regard to these

   discrepancies other than what is exhibited in these documents.



41. I cannot recall the documents I considered in the audit but can see from my

   Witness Statement (POL00093897) that I would have been responsible for

   collecting any Horizon reports and reports from the Forde Moneychange. I

   would have recorded the values of the currencies, stock items and Travellers

   Cheques on hand. This was specific to the tasks I had been allocated by the

   Lead Auditor. I was not responsible for completing any documents after the

   audit. This role would normally be completed by the Lead Auditor.



42. I have been asked by the Inquiry whether ARQ logs were sought by POL from

   Fujitsu in this case and, if not, why not? I am not familiar with the term 'ARQ

   Logs' and cannot confirm if they were sought by POL from Fujitsu in this audit

   or any other audits which may be relevant to the Inquiry.



43. I have also been asked by the Inquiry whose decision it was to suspend Carl

   Page. I have no recollection of any discussions in regard to the suspension of

   Carl Page and as an Auditor would not expect to be made aware of this

   decision. I would expect this decision would be made by the Investigation

   team and would not require the input of the Auditors other than in providing

   information from the Audit.



44. My role as Branch Auditor was to count cash and stock items on hand in

   branches using information and documents held at the branch. I was not part

      of the Post Office Investigation Team and did not have any involvement in any

      further investigations of Mr Page.



R v Carl Page



   45.The Inquiry has asked if I have been involved in any other proceedings

      against SPMs, their managers or assistants or Post Office employees

      involving the Horizon IT system before this case. I do not recall any other

      proceedings due to the time that has now elapsed but as noted above, on rare

      occasions I would be asked to provide a witness statement by the

      Investigations Team. This would involve me setting out the steps that were

      taken at Audit. I cannot recall any other involvement, or whether they

      specifically involve Horizon issue. I was never asked to attend Court as a

      witness but was aware that by producing a witness statement I could have

      been called.



   46. I was asked to complete a Witness Statement (POL00093897) in the case

      against Mr Page and Mr Whitehouse. I cannot recall who asked me to

      complete this document but this request would normally be made by the Post

      Office Security and Investigations Team. I also cannot now recall who I had

      contact with when completing this document. The discussions would be

      reflected in the content of the Witness Statement but I cannot recall any

      further discussions that I had with counsel or POL's legal representatives

      about my witness statement.

  47. I can see from the Letter from Ms Debbie Helszajn to Mr Tom Cleary dated 11

     April 2005 (POL00067102) that I was listed as a witness required in this case.

     I was aware that by completing a witness statement I may be called to give

     evidence and I provided my availability. However, I cannot recall being told

     the date of the court case or that I would not be called. I did not give evidence

     at the trial. I do not recall any other involvement I had in this case and I do not

     recall being made aware of the outcome of the proceedings.



  48. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in

     Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited [2021 EWCA Crim 577] in

     particular paragraphs 277 to 285 (POL00113278) and what my reflections are

     now on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mr Page was conducted

     by Post Office. I have no reflections on the investigation and prosecution

     made by Post Office Limited. My understanding of the investigation is limited

     to the audit and I appreciate there has been a much wider investigation and

     prosecution. I do not feel I can comment any further on these issues as I was

     not part of the investigation.



The Prosecution of Tahir Mahmood



  49.As with the case of Mr Page, I have limited recollection of this case. My only

     involvement was as part of the audit team and later completing a witness

     statement. I can only confirm completing the Audit Report as it has been

     provided to me by the Inquiry (POL00066040).

The Audit at Ten Acre Street Branch



   50. I do not recall any events which led to the audit of Ten Acre Street Branch and

      taking into account normal process I do not believe I would have been aware

      of the case against Tahir Mahmood when I was asked to complete the audit.

      I would not be aware of the circumstances that had led to the audit and I

      would have received notification of the audit through the weekly audit plan.

      Although I do not recall any details of why the audit was requested I can see

      from reading the Audit Report (POL00066040) that it was requested by the

      Internal Crime Team.



   51. I can also see from the Audit report (POL00066040) that I was the Lead

      Branch Auditor that day, assisted by Guru Aubby. As was normal process I

      would have allocated us both tasks. The cash on hand would have been one

      of the first tasks to be completed, alongside the collection of reports from the

      Horizon system. I expect I would have built the account for the audit on a

      laptop, as Mr Aubby counted the stock items. All discrepancies would have

      been checked and the subpostmaster, or their staff, asked if they wanted to

      check the discrepancies. Once the physical verification had been completed

      the result of the audit would have been shared with the subpostmaster. I can

      see from the Audit Report (POL00066040), although I cannot recall this

      directly, that two members of the Internal Crime Team were present, they

      would not have played any part in the audit but would have been advised of

      the outcome. From what I recall when member(s) of the Internal Crime Team

                                                                                        WITNO9080100
                                                                                   WITN09080100




   (this is the former name of the Investigation and Security Team) attended an

   audit they would wait for the outcome so they could speak to the

   subpostmaster. I would not be part of those discussions.



52. Due to the time that has passed since I was a Branch Auditor I cannot recall

   all of the documents that would have been considered during the audit. I recall

   this would have included:



      a) A copy of the branch monthly accounts (known as a cash account and

          in later years branch trading statement);

       b) Audit reports from Horizon; and

       c) Voucher/Receipt for customer payments/cheques on hand.

   I cannot recall if this is a full list of documents.



53. I cannot recall any direct conversations I had with the Internal Crime

   Managers who were present at the audit but can see from my Audit Report

   (POL00066040) that after asking Mr Mahmood a question, I refer the

   response to Colin Price, from the Internal Crime Team, who then spoke to Mr

   Tahir Mahmood. Having read the document, I would have indicated to the

   security team what the result of the audit was, and where the discrepancies

   are and any disclosures from the subpostmaster to explain the discrepancies.

   I am afraid after this time I cannot recall the details of this discussion. At the

   conclusion of the audit, I would have advised the result of the audit check,

   giving details of any discrepancies.

54.Again, I cannot recall any direct conversations I had with Mr Mahmood during

   the audit. I note from reading my Audit Report (POL00066040) that I asked

   Mr Mahmood 'was there anymore Post Office cash in hand.' This would be

   normal and Auditors would ask subpostmasters to confirm that everything had

   been counted.



55. Whilst I do not recall the outcome of the initial audit I can see from reading the

   Audit Report (POL00066040) that the audit notes a total discrepancy of

   £33,437.39. This amount is made up of:



       a) Cash on hand difference of          £33,575.72

       b) Cheque on hand difference of        £200.37

       c) Stock difference of                 £66.83

       d) Previous weeks balance result       £4.79



56. I have been asked by the Inquiry whether I considered the shortfall unusual in

   my experience and whether I had any concerns about it. It is important to note

   that the Audit team were required to approach audits without prejudice, and

   we were not there to form an opinion on the reasons why there were

   discrepancies. On occasion a subpostmaster may provide a reason for a

   discrepancy which would be recorded however this would be for the

   Investigations team to consider and not the Auditor. I would not ask any direct

   questions of the subpostmaster to establish the reasons for the losses and my

   role was to establish factually whether there was a surplus or deficit in the

   branch. Therefore, in answering this question I did not consider the shortfall

   unusual at the time and would expect this to be a matter of concern for the

   Investigations team.



57. Following the audit I would have completed an audit report. This is exhibited

   at document POL00066040. I can see from this document that the report was

   provided to:



       a) Sue Mudderman — Contract and Services Manager

       b) Colin Price — Investigation Manager

       c) Martin Ferlinc — National Branch Audit Manager

       d) Glyn Burrows — Data Analyst.

       e) John Jenkinson — Operations Manager— Branch Audit Team.



58. I do not recall any other involvement I had in this case, and I do not recall

   being made aware of the outcome to the proceedings.



59. I have read the Judgment in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office

   Limited (POL00113278) in particular paragraphs 319 to 323 and what my

   reflections are now on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mr

   Mahmood was conducted by Post Office. I have no reflections on the

   investigation and prosecution made by Post Office Limited. My understanding

   of the investigation is limited to the audit and I appreciate there has been a

   much wider investigation and prosecution. I do not feel I can comment any

   further on these issues as I was not part of the investigation.

Prosecution of Hughie Thomas



   60.As with Mr Page and Mr Mahmood's prosecutions I have little knowledge of

      the prosecution of Mr Thomas and my role was limited to the Audit of

      Gaerwen Branch and later completing a witness statement. I can only recall

      completing the witness statement as it was provided to me by the Inquiry.



The Audit at Gaerwen Branch



   61.Again, as with both Mr Page and Mr Mahmood, I would not have been aware

      of the circumstances or issues that led to the audit and would have received

      my normal notification of the audit through the weekly audit plan.



   62. I was again the Lead Branch Auditor in this audit, assisted by Mal Rennard. I

      would have followed the same process as the other audits set out above,

      allocating tasks between myself and Mr Rennard. From reading my Witness

      Statement for the Proceedings against Hughie Thomas (POL00047942), it

      notes that Mr Rennard counted the cash on hand and I counted the stock

      items on hand. All discrepancies would have been checked and the

      subpostmaster/staff asked if they wanted to check the discrepancies.



   63. I cannot recall the details of the discussions I would have had with Mr Thomas

      but note that some details are contained in my Witness Statement

      (POL00047942). This document notes that Mr Thomas said, "it's been going

      on for a year or so, I think something is wrong with the computers." After this

                                                                                   WITN09080100




   time I cannot recall this comment or any further details that Mr Thomas

   provided at the time. I cannot recall, prior to my involvement in these

   proceedings, any other individuals attributing shortfalls to Horizon. As an

   Auditor I would refer any comments that were made to the Contracts Manger

   so they could be investigated further. It was not uncommon for

   subpostmasters to provide explanations, but it was not my role to assess

   whether they were legitimate concerns. If a subpostmaster provided a reason

   for the shortfall the process would be to write the wording down and ask the

   subpostmaster to sign it to say it was a true reflection of the discussion. I

   would ensure this information was passed on through the audit report to the

   Contract Manager who I would expect to assess whether there was any

   further action required.



64. Whilst I do not recall the outcome of the initial audit I can see from reading my

   Witness Statement (POL00047942) that the audit notes a total discrepancy of

   £48,454.87. This amount is made up of:



       f) Cash on hand difference of          £48,157.79

       g) Stock difference of                 £297.08.



65. The Inquiry has again asked me whether I considered this shortfall to be

   unusual in my experience and whether I had any concerns about it. As was

   the case with the audit of Ten Acre Street Branch I would not have reached

   any conclusions on the discrepancies and would have left this for

   consideration by the investigations team.

   66. The Inquiry has asked me to provide further details of my conversation with

      Emlyn Hughes, Contract Manager, regarding discrepancies at the bank. I can

      see from page 2 of the Offender Report for Hughie Thomas (POL00044861)

      that the reference is to online banking. I called Mr Hughes but do not recall

      the details of this conversation other than the purpose would have been to

      inform him of the outcome of the audit.



   67. The Offender Report (POL00044861) also notes that following the call Mr

      Hughes and Steve Bradshaw from the Investigation Team arrived at Branch.

      It also notes that Mal Rennard contacted the Horizon System Helpdesk.

      Whilst I can see some of the details are provided in the Offender Report

      (POL00044861) I cannot recall any further details regarding these events.



   68. Following the completion of the audit I would have completed an audit report.

      I cannot remember who the report would have been shared with, but normal

      practice would be to report shortfalls to the Contracts Manager who in turn

      may ask that it is also shared with the Security Team.



   69. Following the completion of the report I cannot recall any further involvement

      in this case.

  70. I cannot recall the name of the person who requesting me to complete a

     witness statement (POL00047942) in the case against Mr Thomas. This

     request would normally be made by the Post Office Security and Investigation

     Team but I can no longer remember and am unsure who would have

     requested this statement.



  71. I also can no longer recall who I had contact with, or the discussions I had,

     other than that which is apparent from my Witness Statement (POL0047942).

     I do not recall being made aware that Mr Thomas had pleaded guilty to False

     Accounting on 29 September 2006,



  72. I have read the Judgment in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office

     Limited (POL00113278) in particular paragraphs 149 to 155 and what my

     reflections are now on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mr

     Thomas was conducted by Post Office. have no reflections on the

     investigation and prosecution made by Post Office Limited. My understanding

     of the investigation is limited to the audit and I appreciate there has been a

     much wider investigation and prosecution. I do not feel I can comment any

     further on these issues as I was not part of the investigation.



General



  73. I have been asked by the Inquiry to what extent I considered a challenge to

     the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to ongoing or future cases.

     As I have set out above, I was not primarily concerned with the reasons for the


                                    Page 26 of 30
                                                                                     WITNO9080100
                                                                                    WITN09080100




   discrepancies in my role as this was the responsibility of others. I was focused

   on completing the audit; therefore, it is unlikely I would have paid specific

   attention to an individual challenge to the integrity of horizon and would have

   expected this to be picked up through the subsequent investigation.



74. I have been asked by the Inquiry whether I consider investigations regarding

   bugs, errors and defects in Horizon were sufficiently carried out by POL or

   whether POL sufficiently passed information to Fujitsu. It was not my role to

   investigate those matters at the time and I would not have been aware of any

   information exchanges between POL and Fujitsu. I would expect that where

   an audit flags up a discrepancy which could not be explained it would be

   raised with the helpdesk and further investigations would be completed.

   Alternatively, if reasons were shared with the Auditor this would be passed on

   to the Contract Manager. I cannot recall what information was shared in

   regard to bugs, errors and defects in Horizon, so cannot comment on whether

   it was sufficient but do not consider that it was pertinent to my work area at the

   time for the reasons set out above.



75. I do not have any other matters to bring to the attention of the Chair of the

   Inquiry or anything that I consider relevant to the Inquiry's Terms of Reference.
