Andy,

As discussed, please see the attached which sets out the high level issue which Cartwright King (our criminal law
solicitors) has identified with the Fujitsu evidence Gareth Jenkins has been providing in support of the criminal
prosecution cases conducted for Post Office Limited. A more detailed note should arrive on Monday, which I will
forward to you once I have it.

Can you please consider this in light of the contractual arrangements we have with Fujitsu, and draft a suitable email
(which could alternatively be used as a script for a call) to Fujitsu to put it on notice of the issue,

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Kind regards, Rod
