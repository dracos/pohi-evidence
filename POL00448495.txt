I Item 2 I Compensation I

Points To Make

1. You should ask the Minister what progress has been made on our proposal to appoint an
independent forensic accountant to look at Capture. We wrote to DBT suggesting this and
that they review RU investigation work to date and perform any other due diligence work
necessary. We believe DBT are about to agree to this and could make an announcement this
week.

2. Simon can provide an update on the funding agreement needed to support the delivery of a
£75k minimum payment in HSS. As was raised last time, Post Office cannot ‘go live’ with this
until we have both commitment from DBT and HMT as well as board approval. We believe the
total of the back book payments will be an additional c£130m.

3. Simon can also speak to progress on the HSS Appeals Process
