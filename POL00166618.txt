John,

I have had a look at some figures for this office and agree with Steve that it looks decidedly
dodgy.

I have attached a report below detailing their cash movements. Those days in red are days when
the office has not declared properly and the figures are generated, but as you can see the ONCH
(column C) fluctuates dramatically from a few hundred some days to tens of thousands other
days and the payments don't account for the large net stock movements.

Certainly in recent weeks the cash holding is inflated every Wednesday for no apparent reason
and despite the system requesting the Office to return cash every Wednesday, nothing ever is.

\ certainly have concerns over this office, the figures are very erratic and certainly warrants further
investigation.

Please let me know if you decide to audit the office - though I appreciate that it is pretty remote -
and let me know of the outcome.

Have spoken to postmaster who was not very forthcoming with information. Asked why he had
not sent back cash this week as from cash declared figure on wednesday he seemed to be
holding excess cash. He said has not been able to process special delivery's the last few days as
horizon system been down. Know there has been problem with Horizon at a lot of offices the last
two days. I asked him how much cash he had on hand at moment , to which he replied he was
not sure. I asked him to return all excess cash when system is back fully functional and to monitor
holdings looking at planned orders and if not agreeing with requests for cash to be sent back to
contact cash management with reasons as to why he thinks planned order is incorrect. I
explained that excess cash in branches costs post office limited money and is also a security risk
to himself and that if had a robbery and had not been sending excess cash back could be held
liable.

He also advised me that he is taking on work from an office which is closing next week and so
does not at present know what his payments are going to be. Have told him he will need to
monitor holdings carefully and adjust with cash management as appropriate.

Postmaster was reluctant to give information and as he said system would at present not allow for
him to do specials did not ask for numbers of special delivery envelopes he is going to return
cash in.

Not sure he will return anything and got feeling he did know how much cash he had on hand but
did not want to tell. I feel that he may be inflating figures from conversation had with cash
management and a audit might be needed as could be threat to po funds. Rang Antonio Jamasb
from po line service team who said that system hardware problem would have affected this
branch but should not have prevented doing a special delivery transaction as it was effecting on-
line services. He said that the only thing would have been that office address would not have
been verified but didn't think this would have prevented transaction being completed.

Please can you provide me with an update in respect of potential problems at the above branch
(RE: e-mail from Andy Bayfield). finish up for leave shortly and want to ensure that any action in
my absence is followed up by a colleague.

Thank you

John Jenkinson rang. They are a tiny island office and have a Hanco ATM. They occasionally
receive rems of 3-SK.

As you can see they sometimes declare 10s of thousands and the next day just a few thousand
(sometimes hundreds). Their payments don't account for the NSMs. Don't know how much the
ATM uses daily.

They were rung earlier in the year for a Cupid call. Said he was short staffed.

This office looks decidedly dodgy. Please can you see if there is anything of use to John.
Thanks

Steven
