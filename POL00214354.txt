You need to have a look at this. Its Second Sight's list of questions to inform Part Two. You will see that this is
a pretty considerable fishing expedition which includes a lot of general requests. We will need to do a formal
response setting out where we are not providing information - for example, the contract, investigation
procedures. But grateful for your view on approach before I start this.

Best wishes
Belinda

I've converted SS' questions into a Word doc (attached) as I thought this might be a little easier to use /
edit and embedded some comments.

There are some sensible questions in here but there is also a massive fishing expedition for information
that does not address issues raised by Applicants. I've highlighted all the questions that I think are just
fishing for info in blue. There are also a number of questions that are outside the scope of the
Scheme. Most telling is the fact that there are only a handful of questions about Horizon; nearly all the
questions are about accounting practices.

My guess is that it is going to take quite a lot of work to answer all these questions. We may want to
follow the approach we used for the Factfile ie. break the questions into sections, identify the key
technical person in POL to answer those questions, prepare draft answers and then have a senior and
separate sign-of team. Just a thought...

Kind regards
