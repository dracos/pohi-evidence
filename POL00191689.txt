Horizon report - media and Parliamentary report

Our strategy in relation to media coverage was to seek to contain coverage to those outlets which
have followed the issue for some time. Supported by an external agency, Portland
Communications, we were successful in doing so. This meant some high profile coverage on the
BBC News at 10 on Monday and on Radio 4's Today Programme, but beyond this, and a small
piece in Metro, there was no other mainstream media coverage of the report. The news cycle in
relation to the report lasted little over 12 hours (from a short piece on BBC 6pm news through to
a Today programme item at 7.40am the following day). This is highly satisfactory, all the more so
as no national newspapers followed up the story (though we are currently dealing with a
Telegraph enquiry).

We decided not to accept interview requests from the BBC on the basis that doing so could give
broadcasters a new line on which to run the story.

We were also proactive in challenging inaccuracies and contacted the BBC legal team through
our external lawyers to register concerns over misleading headlines. This was successful in
changing headlines and rebalancing coverage.

There was substantial regional coverage in those areas with ex-subpostmasters which are being
examined by Second Sight.

We had a high (80%) key message penetration rate across all coverage.

We expect coverage in Private Eye and in Computer Weekly and are developing a
communications strategy for the coming weeks and months.

Key to this is building relationships with the journalists who are following the issue in particular.
James Arbuthnot MP was successful on Tuesday 9 July in persuading the Postal Services
Minister, Jo Swinson, to make a House of Commons statement on the report.

The minister handled this event effectively. Questions came from those MPs with constituents
whose cases are being dealt with by Second Sight. A key element of the parliamentary session
was the demand from MPs for Second Sight to continue to be involved in the review.

The session did not receive media coverage other than on Today in Parliament on the BBC.
