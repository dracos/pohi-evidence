In thinking how to progress this. I think the next step, once you have put something down in writing, is to review it with
myself and Angela.
if you are ok with this, I will set up a dial-in with the four of us.

Simon,

Since the call on Friday was cancelled, I thought I should drop you an email with what I was going to suggest.

Is it possible to find out the exact date and time that this issue occurred (together with the Branch}?

It sounds like it was fairly recent and if it is within the last 4 weeks we can pull back detailed logs from the Branch of
exactly what the SPMR did which gives a more complete picture than the archive records or the info in Credence / POL

SAP.

If you want this progressed, then please let me know asap, since time may be running out.

Is this perhaps what has been happening to Jenny O'Dell (Spot Review 21). See "I had a phonecall last week
from Alex..." From "Rita" in this email trail.

Question why have u got to adjust quote 9 RMSF, 10 RMSF large, 1 SD up to 100g. If you sell
these through Business Suite in serve customer screen the stock is adjust automatically. You get
paid the same.

Subject: [SPMRs] Stock adjustments

I had a phonecall last week from Alex at Chesterfield, to tell me that I had been doing stock
adjustments on postage when I shouldn't have been, and I needed to do a new reversal and a
stock adjustment to fix it. Going back to Ist April the total amount was £885.42. I pointed out
that I never do stock adjustments for postage, but sell and reverse as required. The only time I
ever use stock adjustment is if I have put a cheque through as cash, when I go to stock
adjustment and adjust the cheque figure to correct it. I have checked that my assistant does the
same. He said he would send proof.

Got the letter today and there is according to them, an adjustment going through every
wednesday, when we balance up. So I printed off a transaction log for the last four wednesdays,
and the figures quoted by Chesterfield are being put through as as adjustment by Horizon each
week just after rolling over. I phoned Alex, who put me on to his supervisor. I said we count the

POL00099340

stamps every week, and sell any that are under and reverse any that are over. This is mainly
RMSF and SD stamps, and the odd Ist class or whatever that we have missed. Then I declare
stamps and cash, and roll over. The system then produces this stock adjustment. She said that

doing a stamp declaration is the same as doing a stock adjustment. So I have a discrepancy

showing for every week since Ist April. She says my stamps and cash should balance before I
roll over each week, or else the system produces a discrepancy. She said lots of offices are in the

same situation at the moment.
So what am I doing wrong?

E.g 10 July printed a stock on hand report. Other postage is £413.52.

Counted all the items on the report, short 1 Ist class stamp, 9 RMSF, 10 RMSF large, 1 SD up to

100g.

Put through a sale for all the stamps I am short, total £104.32.

Declared stamps, total £515.24.

Declared cash and currency, rolled over at 17.45.
Transaction log shows the following at 17.46:
DD Postagestamp 1 101.72

DD Surplus disc 1- 101.72-

£101.72 is the difference between the other postage figure before sales and declaration, and after,

(e.g £413.52 + £101.72 = £515.24)

This is the figure that Chesterfield want me to reverse then stock adjust.

Thave a figure like this for every week since Ist April.
Should I do what they say, and if so what am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Rita
