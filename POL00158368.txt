Thanks Michele. I am happy with this and am trying to get Manys sign off. I would prefer the xx
millions of transactions per day and up to 750 per second at peak times figures to both be used if
possible.

Ruth - can you have a quick look please?

We don't refer to the specific cases Ms Smith mentions but I think this.is ok as we can't get into the
specifics of individual cases.

limagine she will write again.

The 11000 figure does not seem right - there cant be that many independents in a network of 12000?
Oram I missing something?

Thanks, R

Hi Richard

Many thanks - yes I was aware of the reply to Michael Rudkin as I pretty much wrote most of it but just
wasn't sure if it was suitable to use here.

Ihave made the suggested amends and added some comments in blue, to answer your own in red.
Re your amends on my first draft, page 2, the replacement para starting ' All new software’ was
already included in para 2 of the first page, so have removed and left at the start - I think it reads ok
but fresh eyes and all that.

Many thanks again for all of your help - I know how busy you are.

If you could let me have final approval, I will pass to Alan for sign off.

Kindest regards,

Dear Ms Smith

Thank you for your letter of 1 December in relation to one of your constituents, Mr
Julian Wilson and your concerns around the Horizon computer system. May I first
apologise for the delay in reply.

ongoing monitoring and control processes mean that any issues in a ‘live’ operation
are quickly identified and resolved, and ensure that should part of the system or
equipment fail, the integrity of the accounting records is always maintained.

Over the years the system has been tested both in and out of criminal and civil court
and has not been found wanting. Whilst I recognise that some subpostmasters have
found this difficult to accept, there is no evidence to doubt the integrity of the Horizon
system and we retain absolute confidence in its’ robustness and reliability.

Moving forward, as with any business we constantly look to how we can operate more
cost effectively but at the same time update and improve our systems and processes.
We are currently in the process of implementing a new version of Horizon, called
Horizon Online™. The preparation for the roll out of new counter software is at an
advanced stage and completion is expected to be by the end of April 2010. The new
system has been designed with extensive input from subpostmasters and other users
and will increase efficiencies and enhance the role of the subpostmaster.

Thank you for your email of 15 October and for bringing to my attention the article in Convenience
Store magazine and the meeting being held on Sunday 8 November in Fenny Compton. My apologies
for the delay in reply.

We are aware of the recent interest being taken in the robustness of the Horizon system by some
external parties. I am not sure exactly why this is as the system has been in place for around ten
years, successfully recording millions of transactions each day, and has proved time and time again to
be robust and fit for purpose.

Where concerns have been raised about Horizon or the computer equipment , they have been taken
extremely seriously and have been thoroughly investigated. I recognise that some people may find it
difficult to accept but no evidence has been found pointing to any fault with the system or technology.

All new software releases on Horizon are subject to rigorous testing prior to going live in order to
ensure the accuracy of the accounting processes. Our ongoing monitoring and control processes
mean that any issues in a 'live' operation are quickly identified and resolved, and ensure that should
part of the system or equipment fail, the integrity of the accounting records is maintained

In summary, we remain fully satisfied that the system and the processes around it offer a very high
level of security and resilience. We are completely confident that the system is capable of handling
the financial services transactions undertaken at our branches, and that it will continue to support any
new services that we plan to introduce in the future.

Thank you for your support on this issue - itis much appreciated. I do hope that you feel you can now
‘speak to your NFSP Branch and Region with confidence at Sunday's meeting.

Kind regards
Alan

Now I see this it all comes back to me. we definitely owe him a fuller response than currently drafted.
He is offering to help diffuse a tricky issue. We need to give him more if he is going to stand up and
defend us -

Also we cannot apologise for the delay due to me holiday - that was 2 weeks ago!

We seem to have left this until the last minute but clearly we now need to get this one done today

I know you are busy right now but in Richards absence can you get someone to see what we can
about this developing situation outlined below?

For some strange reason there is a steadily building nervousness about the accuracy of the Horizon
system and the press are on it as well now

Itis the more strange in that the system has been stable and reliable for many years now and there is
absolutely no logical reason why these fears should now develop

My instincts tell that, in a recession, subbies with their hand in the till choose to blame the technology
when they are found to be short of cash

Bizarrely the author of the email below was a very senior postmaster in the Fed who I know well but
who's wife was found to be defrauding us and we have prosecuted

Dear Alan

See attachment!!!
I presume you have already seen the article in the convenience store magazine.

My question to the business is;

+ esses Issthis article likely to have any-impact.on the contracts we already have with our existing : .
banking partners. Will our prospects of becoming a Post Bank be delayed if our clients start
to questions Horizons abilities and is it fit for purpose for the foreseeable future?

The reason for my question is, a Horizon pressure group has formed and they are to meet on Sunday
8" November 09 at Fenny Compton Hall in the Midlands and I wish to keep a balanced view and
present this to my NFSP Branch and Region before anyone attends this meeting. This should also
minimize adverse publicity to our industry which is already receiving enough bad press at the
moment. Currently the BBC, Panorama and Watch Dog researches are digging the dirt here in
Leicestershire.

I hope my request is not an imposition on your time or deemed as impertinent.
