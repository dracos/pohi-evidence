Cause and Action

Whilst there has been improvement in performance with
regard to ‘Calls engaged’, ‘Calls answered within 20 seconds’,
‘Calls answered within 40 seconds’ and 'Calls abandoned
through ring-off have seen a dip.

This reduction in performance has prompted ICL Pathway to
review the manpower model. Intensive recruiting continues
in order to increase the skill levels within the HSH and SMC.

As of the second week in May, an IVR system will go live on a
4-week pilot. It is anticipated that this will significantly
improve telephone SLA through demand management. The
TVR will enable the automated targeting of problems to the
resource most skilled to deal with the problem type.

4a Helpdesk Services Performance Summary

HSHD - Level 1 calls resolved within 5 minutes
HSHD - Level 2 calls resolved within 30 minutes
HSHD - Level 2 calls resolved within 45 minutes

82.0% of Level 1 calls were resolved within 5 minutes,
94.4% of Level 2 calls were resolved within 30 minutes.
97.4% of Level 2 calls were resolved within 45 minutes.

Cause and ion.

New outlets are being added to the live estate at 300+ per
week and our initial analysis of the call text would suggest in
many cases that a number of calls are taking longer to resolve
due to Clerk / PM unfamiliarity with the system.

The reduction in performance has prompted ICL Pathway to
review the manpower model, Intensive recruiting continues
in order to increase the skill levels within the HSH and SMC.

As of the second week in May, an IVR system will go live ona
4-week pilot. It is anticipated that this will significantly
improve Levels 1 and 2 SLA through demand management.
The IVR will enable the automated targeting of problems to
the resource most skilled to deal with the problem type.

It is worth noting however that during April the average
duration of Li & L2 calls was:

Li = 3 minutes 46 seconds
L2 = 17 minutes 07 seconds

In the meantime, we continue to ensure all HSH TSA are
aware of the need to resolve A&G calls quickly and effectively
without compromising customer service.

Cause and Action

Actions continue to be taken to attempt to define the root
cause of ICL Pathway missing these SLA. The hardware /
network call-to-resolution process has been significantly
reviewed with the aim of optimum implementation:

Existing process capabilities have been assessed and have
identified some discontinuities

The end-to-end process has been fully re-engineered

Sample calls are currently being run through the re-
engineered process

¢ Full rollout of the re-engineered process after testing is
planned before the end of May 2000

« Early indications looking at call samples and test results
are that the process will be much improved

RDMC Reference Data Delivery by Day C
RDMC Reference Data Delivery by Day D

98.67% of RDMC Reference Data was delivered by Day C.
99.04% of RDMC Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

This SLA was affected by a small number of offices not
receiving the tariff change reference data concerning the
scales update. This was mainly due to non-polling, though
further investigation revealed some outlets were legitimately
off-line.

Calculation of this SLA is based upon the delivery of ‘Core’
reference data to all outlets on a daily basis. The ‘Non Polled’
outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has failed to
return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data Centre. If
this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not received a
delivery of reference data. This method of calculation weighs
heavily in the direction of POCL as we cannot determine
whether or not the outlet has received this data prior to any
communication problem preventing an EOD, the assumption
therefore is that it has not.

CSR+ sees this SLA being calculated automatically to counter
level.

Performance Summary
98.58% of APS Reference Data was delivered by Day C.
98.63% of APS Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

Calculation of this SLA is based upon the delivery of APS
reference data to all outlets ONE day per month. The ‘Non
Polled’ outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has
failed to return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data
Centre. If this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not
received a delivery of APS reference data. This method of

Failure of this SLA is entirely attributable to ‘Non Polling’.

We are now working closely with POCL with the aim of:

1. Driving down the instances of non-polling due to:
i. comms failures
ii, counter switch off at the outlet
2. Mitigating the risk to POCL clients / customers in the
event of APS transactions failing to poll by reviewing the
escalation process and outlet documentation retrieval

Polled’ outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has
failed to return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data
Centre. If this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not
received a delivery of OBCS stop list data. This method of
calculation weighs heavily in the direction of POCL as we

Cause and Action
Failure of the Day B SLA can be attributed to the non-

March.
This failure was due to the BA data centre at Washington
being closed for 36 hours over the period, therefore no data
files were accepted.

4.6 I Implementation & Roll Out Performance Summary
The data required for the calculation of these SLA’s is
currently unavailable from both POCL, for the ‘Quality’
derived measures and from ICL Pathway for the ‘Repair’
measures. The provision of this data has now been escalated
as a high priority task within ICL Pathway and we expect to
have some initial figures for discussion at the May 2000 SRF
in respect of April 2000 performance.
48 Business Incident Management Performance Summary

87.5% of business incidents were cleared within 5 working
days of receipt. (The definition of ‘cleared’ being that
sufficient detail was supplied to POCL to allow reconciliation
or client settlement to take place).

Cause and Action
17 incidents did not achieve the SLA for the following
reasons:

© The number of incidents received and handled by MSU
increased from 434 in March to 585 in April 2000
(including 469 non-polled office reports)

© 15 of the 17 were EPOSS related incidents such as receipts
and payments, cash account or transactions that have
been dropped at the TPS harvester. These incidents are
complex, requiring in-depth analysis with technical
investigation in many cases, order to provide the
appropriate data for reconciliation purposes. This
inevitably takes much more time.
