Subject: FW: Post Office update meeting, Monday 24 March at 5.45pm

To see from Janet in James Arbuthnot’s office.

e We need to be clear how we want to handle the pre meet — I assume we want a separate conversation with JA
and if so what our rationale is.

e Alternatively do we ask for a separate meeting not the pre meeting — again we need to be clear why we want it
as we have to expect it will be disclosed to SS and JFSA.

Brilliant — many thanks for letting me know.

Til get this out tomorrow, and let's keep in touch on the way through to the meeting. I'll have a look in the
diary and see what would work for James for a pre-meeting meeting. It would be a good idea if Second Sight
and JFSA were at that meeting too, don’t you think? Is there a date and time (perhaps around the meeting of
the working group) where both would be in London, so we didn’t need to drag them up here for a pre-
meeting, and the meeting as well? Just a thought.

Kind regards,
Janet

Hi David,

Here is the draft of the email James will send to MPs tomorrow, with the agenda. Please let me know if you
have any substantive objections by close of play today.

Many thanks,
Janet

Dear Colleague,

As promised, the meeting to update you on progress of the Post Office mediation scheme will now take place
on Monday 24 March, at 5.45pm, in Room T in Portcullis House. I attach an agenda which we will follow to
give us the most use out of the hour available. I hope you will be able to attend and would be grateful if you
would let me know. If you can’t, you are welcome to send a representative from your office, but again, I
should be grateful if you would let me know.

I would like to mention a couple of matters in advance of the meeting. The mediation scheme is running, and
we must take care both to respect the privacy of individual applicants and to avoid skewing the mediation
process. Individual cases will not be up for discussion, but I am sure that if any colleague wanted to seek a
separate meeting with Post Office to discuss an individual case, Post Office would be happy to arrange this
separately.

I hope this is helpful, and look forward to seeing you on Monday 24 March.
