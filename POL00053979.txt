Dear Warwick,

Herewith my response to disclosure which I am forwarding to Issy Hogg subject to your approval.
Please let me have your response.

Jarnail Singh.

Dear Ms Hogg,

I refer you to my letter of the 27th January 2010 and my colleague Phil Taylor's three E-Mails of the
29th January 2010, copy attached for your information.

First E-Mail

In reply to your latest Defence Statement request for disclosure my Officer has now forwarded me the
following Instructions.

(i) Alan Stuart led the audit in October 2005 and his report is attached. He also stated that other
than completion of the cash, stock and compliance questionnaire, no other notes would have been
made at the time. At that time paperwork was retained for one month only unless there was a special
reason for retention beyond that time.

(ii) No notes were taken by the Auditors as above.

(ii) Mr Junaid Tanveer can be contacted on eithe!
(iv) My Investigating Officer has E-Mailed Tamiko Springer and her reply was as follows: "I have
checked my records. I don't have any notes on file for West Byfleet. I ceased to be responsible for
West Byfleet after March 2006".

I understand that you have already received the details requested in (v) and (vi).

Second E-Mail

Continued from last E-Mail.

5b) What enquiries were made, bearing in mind the request came from a trainer, as to
the cause of this loss.

Michael's reply - I am sorry I can't remember the training for the office, the
PSA and the learning actions will be on file for the office. I didn't raise
any issue as to loss of stock or cash during my time at the office

I have examined the file and the documents contained within it relate to Mrs
