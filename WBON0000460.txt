Pete
Hope you're well. Would you mind hoping with what is hopefully a quick query?
The solicitors for the postmasters have asked us to provide them with a copy of the 'known error logs' kept by Fujitsu
and all correspondence between Fujitsu and Post Office relating to the same. So we can respond to this request it
would be appreciated if you could confirm whether a Horizon "known error log" or a similar documents exist. We've not
decided yet on whether to provide this information (and so don't need any documents from you at this stage) — we're
just trying to scope out what might be covered by the request.
We would appreciate if you could help with the following:

1. What format do these logs take and where are they held?

2. What level of detail is included within the logs (i.e. are they generic logs for all Horizon errors or linked to
specific branches, do the logs explain the consequences of the error and the fix which was applied, etc)?

3. When did Fujitsu begin to maintain these logs and are they still maintained?
4. Are the logs capable of being extracted and provided to us?
5. Have Post Office previously been provided with a copy of these and, if so, to whom and when?

6. Has there been any correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu concerning these logs? I suspect loads
— but it would be good to just understand in high level terms how they are used.

I'm hoping that this questions are fairly easy to address but if they do need more careful thought, please let me know
and we can discuss how to tackle them.

If possible, a response by close of business on Wednesday would be useful.

Kind regards
Andy
