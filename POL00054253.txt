Jon/Mark

We are clearly not going to be able to provide the response requested by
POL Legal at this late stage and within the requested timeframe.

In POL Legal's urgent note of 8 February (attached) relevant timeframes
were identified - we will commence retrieving those transaction records
which fall within the current formal request. If there is a preferred
order for the remainder of the formal request please revert and we will
conform.

Please note that all other prosecution support activity will cease until
this request has been filled.

Also, you should note that I am warned for Court tomorrow, Tuesday 2
March, in Bolton for the case relating to Fishpool, one of Helen
Dickison's cases.

Kind regards
Penny

Hi Penny

The legal advice is that logs should be analysed for the whole of the
false

accounting period. I have been informed that this is from December 06
to

December 07.

Of course, I'll help all I can.

Are you sure you need 12 months, Jon? It's not just the retrieving,
it's

the analysis that will take the time (by Gareth) and frankly, I don't
think

we will be able to achieve this in the time left.

Jarnail has just telephoned me and asked me to get transaction log data
for

the above PO from 1st December 2006 to 31st December 2007. The logs
need

to be ordered through our current process and then given to Gareth
Jenkins

at Fujitsu to analyse and confirm by witness statement whether there
are

any errors within the Horizon system for the transaction log period.
Jarnail would like the statement by Friday 5th March 2010.

We could have transaction data available by the end of this week/early
next week for the suggested timeframes; we need an ARQ request from Jane
Owens to proceed.

URGENT
David,
Thank you. I would be grateful if Mr Jenkins is asked the following:-

1 In relation to the Eleanor Nixon statement, the information we
received that although Maureen Lyme states she cannot remember specific
Offices she has stated that pre August 2005 Offices were using a
separate

system for debit / credit card transactions called Streamline. Offices
would put debit / credit cards through this system and produce a
receipt,

which could be keyed into the Horizon terminals.

Some Postmaster / Clerks would key in the information into Horizon as
cash,

instead of debit / credit cards resulting in a shortage in Offices. If
Post Offices contacted Chesterfield at the time any Branch discrepancies
were dealt with, and sorted out with the individual Post Offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect account produce and not
a

problem with the Horizon system. No information is available for any
Correction Notices pre August 2005. So the Nixon statement is unlikely
to

have any relevance for our present case of Misra.

2 The areas where Mr Jenkins says for POL to respond should be
deleted

from his statement.

Mr Jenkins needs to comment on the third interim report received from
the

Defence Expert.

The quality of training of SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins

POL-0050732
POL00054253
POL00054253

expertise.
However I wonder if he might be prepared to comment on how it might be
possible to examine the Horizon data to investigate mistakes.

We are keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can
efficiently test their theories against the Horizon data. We do not

want

them to say that they will not have time before the Trial. We
anticipate

that it would not be very difficult to test their theories against a
short

but represented span of data example from the months when Mrs Misra has
admitted to false accounting. (15th November 2006 to 14th December
2006,

eth May 2007 to 16th June 2007, 14th November 2007 to 15th December
2007

and 9th January 2008. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider
practical and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test
their theories.

I also refer you to my E-Mail to you of Priday Sth February 2010 at
15.39
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

Thank you in anticipation of your help.

Kind regards.
