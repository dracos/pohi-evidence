Audit of Post Office® West Byfleet branch, FAD 126023

Section 1 - Introduction

An audit of the above branch was led by myself on Friday 14 October
2005. The purpose of this audit was to verify financial assets due to the
Post Office® and confirm compliance with a range of Business processes,
procedures and regulatory requirements.

Section 2 provides a management summary, including the financial audit
result.

Section 3 details a breakdown of the result of the financial audit.

Section 4 is a compliance certificate, which should be completed, signed
and returned (in the addressed envelope provided) by 04/11/05, to
confirm you have understood all the actions required for attention.
Please do not return the report, as this needs to be kept at your
branch for reference.

Appendix A details the areas of non-compliance to regulatory matters and
Appendix B details areas of non-conformance identified during tests of
selected policy and procedures. Both appendices include the actions
agreed with yourself during the closing meeting.

At the audit, you were given a questionnaire to provide feedback on the
audit process. If there is anything else you would like to bring to our

Section 2 - Management Summary

The financial audit revealed a current trading position of £ 3541.24 short.
A breakdown of this figure, including any pending transactions corrections
or losses being settled centrally, can be found in section 3.

Actions to address the areas identified were agreed with yourself in the
areas of Post Office card account, information security, travel insurance
and regulatory requirements.

Your attention is drawn most specifically to the points raised under travel
insurance, as this seems to be an area of significant weakness. You are
reminded that it is important that yourself and your staff are fully
conversant with the transaction, and the responsibility placed upon
yourselves for compliance with the various regulatory requirements in
order to conduct the transaction.

Your motor vehicle licences were also a problem, as no reconciliation has
been completed for several weeks. A reconciliation was not also possible
at the audit as not all final balance snapshots for the last few weeks could
be found. Using the on-hand figure provided to you, please ensure that a
reconciliation is completed weekly, and submitted at the period end to
Chesterfield.

Section 3 - Result of the Financial Audit

Financial assets to the value of £85554.20 were physically verified
compared to the amount due to Post Office® of £89095.44.

The difference between these figures is broken down as follows:

38.19 - Identified as a difference in cash figures
37.31 - Identified as a difference in stock figures
34.43 + Identified as a difference in foreign currency figures
3500.17 - Previous cash account shortage rolled into local
suspense
£ 3541.24 Total shortage

Comments and/or Recommendations:

POL00047738

As you are unable to make good the shortage, you must contact your
Contract & Service Manager, via the Area Intervention Office, as soon as
possible to put forward proposals to remedy the discrepancy.
