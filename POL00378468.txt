Thx. My point on JFSA was not around Horizon making the wrong entries and
calculations but more in the direction that the TV reports are suggesting this

is heading ie the system should be more configured to stop people making errors
and obviously if what the subpostmaster is telling us is right, then this could
open us up to criticism.

Rod,

Kevin has sent me this through. I thought you'd might to see from a process
viewpoint. There are appear to be two issues — the process of ‘recovery’ in
cases like this and the system process for adjusting the Horizon system. The
implication is that the banks have more appropriate systems in cases like this.

I don’t think this plays to JFSA allegations that Horizon is doing incorrect
things — there is no question but that the system has reported what was input -
but I could see it raising a question on the wider front that the processes and
systems around Horizon are not flexible enough.

On the case itself, this is being looked at, but it strikes me the potentially
unusual factor here may be that the person who ‘paid in’ is taking a

particular stance. I can imagine that is highly unusual and is presumably the
factor to be taken into account on how the case is handled. It would be
interesting to see how many cases of this kind of ‘input error’ do actually

lead to a dispute with the customer. One would imagine it to be very small- in
which case the issue might not be around the overall process — but on how we
handle the small number of disputes that do arise in these circumstances.

Thanks

Mike

Hi Mike,

Please see the attached.

If this is as the subpostmaster suggests then it feels like our processes have
failed us. We are gathering the facts but I wanted your involvement because of
a potential link to JFSA. This could give them the credibility they are

looking for. What do you think?

Kevin

Mike - would you please cc ECT your reply (as they are dealing and
responding with this ). Thanks. I GRO }
