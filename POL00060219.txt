In Strictest Confidence

JA and AP

2° Sight (2S) have given JA a strong indication that there are glitches in the Horizon system
AP and JA still trust each other

JA view has gone right back to the beginning he now believes Jo Hamilton may have a case
JA This investigation may only just be beginning, injustices have happened

2S believe there are glitches

AP said 2S have recorded one side of the evidence. Cannot make a judgement on this eveidence

alone
They have either used loose language or behaved in a way which isn’t right
AP POL has to be careful what it says or does as we cannot muzzle an independent review
JAs words — 2S have found glitches
There are glitches in the system
I believe this
1 or more allegations more than a glitch
We cannot have a cut off date
If allegations are true there will be all sorts of implications
JA didn’t realise we had not put our case, we have not given our evidence.
MP meeting will go ahead, they had thought the review would be finished by now
No one from POL will attend

JA will speak to 2S to ask them about what Alice has said

POL00060219
POL00060219

AP will write to JA (a letter which she will table at the meeting and is likely to be quoted in the press)

Letter to explain where we stand in the process, when we will be in a position to attend a follow up

meeting, hopefully before the summer recess, we will be ready to come, depending on the review
reaching a certain stage.

JA thinks reasonable for us to talk to 2S about a cap and increasing the speed. Suggested focus on
the best 2 cases they have, get POL evidence us a preliminary in depth investigation, then if prove
issue others get a lighter touch, (not sure how JFSA would feel about that).

JA will talk to 2S to challenge them that POL say haven’t had a chance to give their evidence yet.

no

2S need to think about what they are going to say at the MP meeting

Alice said she doesn’t feel we have a proper grip on the process

Very damaging position for her if 2S do not back what she says when JA asks. PV need to know this
JA believes injustices will be exposed

AP If so we will have to address these things, hopes we are not living in cloud cuckoo land and will
have to eat humble pie

JA 2S have come to a view are that there is evidence

ACTIONs

Send Alice a draft letter explaining our position and the process we are going through Simon to draft,
then to Martin E and Mark to review

SC to talk to 2S suggest and earlier conclusion, and focussing on 2 or 3 cases by summer
Then offer meeting with get out clause)
Find someone in the business to really drive this.

PV to have conversation with 2S tomorrow (Wed) after the Board, not in the dairy yet
