Abbreviation. Definition

APS Automated Payments Service (Schedule 18)

Girobank Client An AP Client that is connected to the AP Service via the AP Agent
Girobank.

Live Client An AP Client becomes live when the physical connection is established and

termination, to allow the harvesting, from the branches, of any delayed
Client transactions.

than Girobank.

[Terms defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning where used in this CCD]
