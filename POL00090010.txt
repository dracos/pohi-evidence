Please find attached my proposal for the workshop process on Tuesday 6" October, which
T have discussed with each of you.

The HPO has agreed to take this forward and plan the detail including final timings. I
believe the action fist Version 1 - /10/98 is sufficient in timing and content to ensure the
right inputs from each of you on the day. Please jet David know if you have a different
view.

My overall objective for the day is to get any residual issues in items a) through to g) off the
agenda either because we resolve them on the day, or we all agree a resolution Plan and
impact going forward.

If we achieve that then we can all focus on the key question, led by the HPO, which is :

“Can this programme be delivered in the timescales proposed, if, why not, and what impact
will it have on proposed timescales?”

On this o jon, PA's third engagement with the Programme, I believe it is for HPO to
present pec not PA; our job is to facilitate that.

Yours Yo
