Introduction

This document has been produced following the POCL / ICL Pathway Acceptance
Board Meeting of 18/08/99 and addresses the comments made in the minutes of that
meeting with respect to Acceptance Incident 408 and the statements made in the
POCL paper 4/408 — HSH Service Level Failure — 24/08/99.

This document provides additional information and explanation to that contained in
HSH Scripting, SLA Recovery and Resource Plan - CS/SMM/AI408 - 17/08/99 issued
to POCL as input to the Acceptance Board.

This document has been updated in the light of the Acceptance Workshop of 26/08/99
and the Call Volume/HSH Model Workshop on 8 September.

This document has been updated in light of the Acceptance Workshop on 14
September.

2 Scope

The scope of this paper comprises the content of AI408, the contents of the above
paper CS/SMM/AI408, the topics contained in the draft minutes from the above
Acceptance Board meeting and the paper 4/408 — HSH Service Level Failure.

The topics can be summarised as: -
e Plan for production and implementation of additional HSH Cash Account scripts

e HSH Resource Plan, comprising call volume projections and HSH staffing
projections

e HSH SLA Rectification Plan

3 POCL position

Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:

"Production of scripts is not complete"
"It does not take account of activities such as the need to train staff"
"Some items have already missed dates”

"Call volume projections and staffing projections contain assumptions that POCL
cannot agree based on experience to date”

On 24/08/1999 POCL also provided the paper A/-408 - HSH Service level Failure.
This supplemented the above points as follows:

e POCL’s experience to date is that some scripts have resulted in inappropriate
advice resulting in further calls to HSH and the National Business Support Centre.

POCL requires an explanation of how the call volume projections are produced
and the logic that supports this process.

POCL requires that the SLA rectification plan is produced and agreed.

4 ICL Pathway position

Taking the three main topics within this Al, ICL Pathway's position can be
summarised as: -

HSH scripting plan - The plan described in section 2 of ref. (1) remains the basis
for addressing this aspect of the AI. The Acceptance Board may not have been
aware that actions designated for the 17" and 18th August were completed on
time. Subsequent actions within ICL Pathway and POCL have been completed in
a timely and co-operative manner from all parties involved. The revised HSH
Cash Account script document was re submitted to POCL as Cash Account
Process - ICL/PW/DSP/PRO/023 - version 2.1 - 24/08/1999.

{At the Acceptance Workshop of 26/08/99, POCL advised that there were further
comments on the scripts and a joint POCL/Pathway workshop aimed at finalising
the scripts was planned for (and was held on) 02/09/99)

HSH Resource Plan - Call Volume prediction

ICL Pathway wish to ensure that POCL has confidence in the modelling tools and
management processes that are used to manage the Horizon System Helpdesk in
terms of staffing levels. The development of the HSH resource model draws upon
a decade of market leading experience of ICL providing Help Desk Services to a
diverse range of Clients.

Some of the key assumptions were introduced in ref. (1) and to supplement this
ICL Pathway proposed that a workshop be held with POCL to address POCL’s
concems. A set of objectives for this event was proposed in section 5.2. This
event was held 7-8/9.

The HSH has experienced a substantial increase in calls on Wednesday / Thursday
associated with outlets having difficulties in completing the Cash Account
process. This increase in business related calls was not predicted and it is ICL
Pathway's intention to establish a cash account domain of skilled staff with the
appropriate business knowledge dedicated to handling this increase.

ICL Pathway does not consider it appropriate for these complex business related
calls to be handled within the SLA constraints of the Level 1 / Level 2 call
definitions. These calls have distorted the SLA performance.

SLA Rectification Plan

The actions and target dates that will contribute to an improvement in the HSH
SLAs are set out in section 5.3.

Future activities

Following agreement of the new scripts, and in conjunction with the establishment of
the cash account domain, these scripts came into operation from 08/09/99.

It was agreed that a joint ICL Pathway / POCL review be held on 14/09/99. The
objectives of the review held on 14/09/99 being:

e Review scripts in light of operational use.
e Review, agree and include any additional scripts
e To identify any learning opportunities

Such reviews will continue in line with the recommendation in
ICL/PW/DSP/PRO/023

5.2 HSH Resource Plan

5.2.1

5.2.2

Background

The development of the model to support the resource requirements of the HSH was
based on ICL's previous experience in providing a wide range of Help Desk services
covering both systems and infrastructure call types. This was supplemented by a set
of assumptions covering the particular call types that ICL Pathway believed would be
generated by POCL's outlets.

ICL Pathway successfully applied the call volume and HSH resource model during the
period of Release la through to Release Ic. During this period there was good
achievement against SLA targets.

During the period of LT1 it became clear that the actual call patterns diverged from
those predicted by the models. In particular there were significant differences in call
volumes following the introduction of the first Wednesday cash account.

Following the second and subsequent cash accounts the continuing high level of calls
on Wednesday / Thursday, which had not been predicted by the model, required that
remedial action should be taken.

The resources of the HSH were supplemented by expert assistance from POCL and
Peritas (now termed KnowledgePool) who were able to successfully handle the
complex business related aspects of these Cash Account calls. This had a beneficial
impact on the call response times for the remaining calls being handled by HSH staff.

5.2.3, HSH Staffing review

At the 08/09/99 workshop on the Call Volume/HSH model ICL Pathway shared with
POCL the most up-to-date HSH resource plans for the remainder of 1999. These
separately identified the staffing for cash account calls. The predicted staffing level, in
terms of Full Time Equivalents, is set out below.

5.2.4 Conclusions

5.2.4.1 HSH staffing levels

From its analysis ICL Pathway believes that the HSH is sufficiently resourced now to
meet the call volumes for Level 1 and Level 2 call types. Further resource is needed to
augment performance on cash account days.

5.2.4.2. Cash Account Domain

ICL Pathway has therefore established a domain of specialist staff with the business
skills to handle Cash Account related calls. The solution for service levels for Cash
Account calls was discussed at the workshop on 7/8 September and further
suggestions were tabled at the workshop on 14 September.

The scripts now employed have been agreed with POCL and are to be reviewed
regularly to ensure they remain as effective as possible. Since the navigation of the
scripts is dependant upon information provided by the postmaster and may involve
returning to the counter terminal to provide further tasks as instructed, the time
elapsed will vary (e.g. closeness to telephone, frequency of external interruptions,
etc.). It was agreed at the acceptance meeting that benchmarking of Cash Account
scripts would add little value in determining the service performance and that a
qualitative approach would adopted as follows:

1. 100% availability of helpdesk staff skilled in providing the appropriate advice and
guidance. That is, no postmaster will be told that they would be rung back on
initially logging a call at the HSH.

2. No repeat call(s) from the same postmaster for the same incident in the same
accounting period.

On 21 September it was further agreed that

3. POCL will attend the HSH to audit that the approved call scripts have been
followed conscientiously and that consistent advice has been given. The
performance measure is 95% conformance.

Pathway suggests that Customer satisfaction with the Help Desk service should be
determined quarterly as described in requirement 914. Pathway will be pleased to
assist POCL in devising and conducting the satisfaction survey.

POCL may assure themselves that Cash Account service calls have been correctly
coded by the HSH through their existing Internet access to Powerhelp. The problem
type ID, described in Appendix A, may be used to construct searches as required

Should POCL wish to further understand Pathway’s processes for service level
measurement then Pathway would be willing to provide a two-day workshop on the
subject.

5.2.4.3 HSH Resource Planning workshop

In order to ensure that POCL share ICL Pathway’s confidence in the robustness and
flexibility of the tools and processes used in HSH Resource planning, ICL Pathway
has held a workshop with POCL to cover this topic in more detail.

The objectives of the event being: -

e To enable POCL to gain understanding and have confidence in the overall
philosophy of the call volume model and it’s relationship to the resource planning
model.

e To discuss and explain the factors and logic that apply to the modelling of call
types and call profiles

e To explain the iterative management processes that are supported by the model

e To review the impact of Cash Account related calls on service levels
