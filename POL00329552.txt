Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

Note provided by Peters & Peters regarding disclosure by POL in relation to Phase 4
hearings and witnesses

1. Peters & Peters Solicitors LLP ("Peters & Peters") are assisting POL with the work in relation
to the Criminal Case Studies. The content of this note has been provided by Peters & Peters.

2. In its letter dated 14 December 2023, the Inquiry directed POL to disclose the following
categories of additional documents by the following deadlines:

a. Any additional documents said to be related to Stephen Bradshaw by 4.00pm 20
December 2023.

b. For all other persons in Annex 1 (of the Inquiry’s letter), no later than 4.00pm 10
January 2024.

3. As confirmed in Herbert Smith Freehills' letter to the Inquiry dated 24 November 2022, the
current exercise of reviewing and producing material relating to Stephen Bradshaw is
complete.

4. At paragraph 5(b) (and Annex 1) of its letter, the Inquiry seeks disclosure of documents
related to the Rule 9 and Section 21 requests or of interest in respect of 19 potential
witnesses in the Inquiry. Taking into account the inherent constraints due to the forthcoming
holiday period POL would be grateful for confirmation from the Inquiry as to which cases
from the Devolved Jurisdictions the Inquiry has selected as case studies, in order that POL
can begin actioning this request in respect of all potentially relevant witnesses as soon as
possible. To that end POL respectfully requests this information by 4.00pm on Tuesday 19
December 2023.

5. This information is essential for POL to devise appropriate search terms to be applied over
the relevant repositories managed on behalf of POL.

6. POL notes the Inquiry's position that the list of custodians included at Annex 1 of its letter is
provisional only. In respect of its efforts to harvest, review, and produce material to the
Inquiry, POL would be greatly assisted by any indication (as soon as the Inquiry is able to
provide it) as to which of those custodians will not be called to give evidence and the order
in which any witnesses will be called to give evidence.
