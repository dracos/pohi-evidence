Dear Sirs,

Re: Khayyam Ishaq
Bradford Magistrates Court - 25' July 2012 at 10.00 a.m.

We enclose in duplicate the committal papers relating to the prosecution of Mr. Ishaq.

We are required to disclose to you any prosecution material which has not been
previously disclosed, and which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining
the case for the prosecution or assisting the accused’s case.

Attached to this letter is a copy of a schedule of non-sensitive unused material. Where the
word ‘evidence’ appears alongside any item, the items listed on the schedule are intended
to be used as part of the prosecution case. You will receive a written notice should the
position change. Material marked as available for inspection can be viewed by
arrangement with the disclosure officer.

A defence statement is required in Crown Court cases. Please provide your client’s
defence statement within 14 days. In accordance with our continuing duty to consider
disclosure, we will review the information you provide in the statement to identify any
remaining material which has not already been disclosed. The statement will also be
relied on by the court if you later make an application under section 8 CPIA. If you do not
make a CPIA-compliant defence statement where one is required or do so late, the court
may hear comment and/or draw an adverse inference.

It is essential that you preserve this schedule in its present form, as access to any material
will only be granted upon its production to the disclosure officer.

Nottingham office on

Yours faithfully,

Cartwright King.
