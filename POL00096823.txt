Alwen could you do a note for Alice... Or do we assume that Paula is keeping her in the loop.

Dear James, no problem at all.

Theresa has been in touch with Janet and we have agreed that you should send any case
details to our Company Secretary's office. Alwen will then be sure we liaise and track
them all properly.

1am on holiday for two weeks from Friday, but Alwen and Theresa are here if there are

any queries. And if we don't speak, I hope you have a good summer. Thank you again for
your leadership on this.

Dear Paula,

Thank you for agreeing to this. I am very pleased, and will let the
other MPs and Mr Bates know.

I wonder if you might advise what I ought to do with case details
that are being forwarded to me from other MPs? I think we
agreed that I can simply pass the details on to your office, and it
would be helpful if I could begin doing so, as it will enable me to
let the MPs know that their constituent’s details have been
forwarded to the right place. Can you let me know please to
whom these might be best directed?

Many thanks indeed.

Yours ever,

James

Subject: PRINTED SubPostmasters and 2nd Sight

Dear Paula,

I have just completed a very good meeting with Ron and Ian from
24 Sight, and Alan Bates from the Justice for SubPostmasters
Alliance. Mr Bates was accompanied by a forensic accountant,
Miss Kay Linnell. Both asked some challenging questions of Ron
and Ian, which they answered to Mr Bates’ and Miss Linnell’s
satisfaction.

However the other MPs and I take the view - which I think you
share - that so far as we can we should ensure that as the
investigation goes on it retains the buy-in of the sub-
Postmasters. To this end I should be grateful if you would agree
to setting aside a small amount of money (capped at £5,000) for a
forensic accountant nominated by the Alliance (likely to be Miss
Linnell) to carry out sporadic review of 2" Sight’s findings. We
discussed this at the meeting, and felt it would be the key to the
entire process working for everyone — my constituents and those
of other MPs, the SubPostmasters, and of course the Post Office
and its reputation.

I should be most interested to hear your thoughts.
Yours ever

James
