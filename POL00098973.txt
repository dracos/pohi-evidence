fact, for the record, I am hugely appreciative of the work going in by everyone and your teams over the
last few days.

debrief you. I am with the Fujitsu CEO at 8am then at a Crown vision event (visible leadership:) so
although I'll try and call personally it may not be possible.

>> The angle is turning I think, to Horizon is ok (hurrah) but we as a business are not. Ie., that we
have behaved in a heavy-handed way with some Spmrs who panicked, which resulted in them inadvertently
getting into a muddle and committing fraud. There is no suggestion that it is wide-spread and there is
recognition that other prosecutions were correct.

post the 3S/JA phone call. His view was that JA was very loose on detail and backed off a number of
points when challenged but that was pursuing this theme - ie., big institution poor duty of care.

Angela, I would like to know what flags we have in place in the NBSC and in Chesterfield today, to make
sure we pick up any signs of concern or incompetence or inability re Spmrs balancing etc. If accurate
answers are not available immediately, I need a steer for our phone call.

>> Susan, I will try to call you asap I finish with Duncan as would like more advice before the call.

>> Finally, I'd like our next steps updated please: there are a number of activities various of us have
committed to doing and I'd like a check all is on track. Could everyone come on the call with a list.
