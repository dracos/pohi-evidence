Gareth,
Yes there is a KEL (ballantj1759Q) which tells SMC to raise a call if they see this event.

I haven't noticed any calls (but I haven't been doing that sort of call recently). I do have a PM-raised call from a few weeks back which I
need to look at (the mismatch was only for a few pence so it has gone to the back of the heap).

Subject: Receipts payments mismatches
Anne,

I’ve been having a look at the NT Counter events from last week and spotted the following two:

totalReceipts=477 141.47, totalPayments=-47 1141.47. -
com. fujitsu.poa.ctrc. businesslogic. print. velocity. VelocityHelperFunction
27/04/2010 17:26 08602500101 I s ERROR.

totalReceipts=759968.17, totalPayments=-739968.17. -
com. fujitsu.poa.ctre. businesslogic. print. velocity. VelocityHelperFunction
23/04/2010 09:11 24121700101 I s ERROR.

These look like Receipts and Payments mismatches.

Jon advises me that there were also raised from the Office Snapshot erroneously, but that peak (194381) was fixed in CTRO25.08
which should be Live.

Have you been made aware of these or had any calls? I don’t know if there is a KEL for SMC to pick up any such events and raise
calls - there certainly ought to be one.

Regards

Gareth
