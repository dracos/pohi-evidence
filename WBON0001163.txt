Ahead of the Defence being filed, and to save time, given the suspense accounts work will go up to the wire,
can we draft paragraphs now based upon the following investigation result scenarios:

Analytic being targeted

e Little or no branches run by the claimants have had any money taken to P&L from suspense
accounts, whilst operated by the 198 claimants

e Direction of money going in the other direction (i.e. credited to branch) from the claimants
branches, during the period of time they operated them is far greater than any amounts being
taken to P&L

e Sample test proves all credits to P&L were taken appropriately

Realistic

e Little or no branches run by the claimants have had any money taken to P&L from suspense
accounts, whilst operated by the 198 claimants.

e Sample test proves all credits to P&L were taken appropriately

Backstop

¢ Little or no branches run by the claimants have had any money taken to P&L from suspense
accounts, whilst operated by the 198 claimants.
