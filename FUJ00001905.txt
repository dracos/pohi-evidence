Changes in this Version

Version I Changes

0.1 N/A. This is the first version.

0.2 Field 14 (Date, Expiration) required in [R3] for manual withdrawal transaction.

References to cheque deposits removed.

Distribution list corrected. Various typing errors fixed as per comments.

Response code 90 added. Use of "Fee" field in [A3] clarified. Use of Start_Date (as input
to [R1] fields 23 and 123) clarified. Corrected first character of field 60 in [E1] for ICC.

0.3 Mapping for subfield 2 of field 61 adjusted to align with change to AIS.
Clarified that, regardless of transaction type, NBX does not return balances to the

(insufficient funds), even if balances have been received from the FI.

Specified Reversal Reason Code mapping for the case where the card declines a
transaction after it has been authorised by the Fl.

counter if the response code for the transaction was neither 00 (authorised) nor 51

1.0 Clarified that in the case of transactions whose details are entered manually, the

Horizon - A&L Mapping Project: EMV - Banking and Retail
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE —_—Doc Ref: NB/IFS/034

2 Introduction

This document identifies the data mapping between the various message elements of the message sets where
NBX acts as the conduit between Horizon and A&L. It should be used in conjunction with the AIS (Ref [2]).

Any translations that need to be performed to convert from one particular message format to another are
identified, together with how the translation is achieved, where possible. In addition, the data that is required
by a message, but which is not present in the source message from another message set, is identified together
with an alternative source.

The following sources can be used to populate a message:

Transaction messages Data is mapped from a message element in one message to a
corresponding message element in another, possibly undergoing
translation.

Configuration The exact locations of configuration data will be specified in the design

documentation, but the essential property of values that are stated to be
configurable is that they can accommodate rapid amendment or
extension as required. Note that where a field is common to a number of
messages, configurable mappings are based on configuration data that is
also common to all the messages. So the mapping of such common
fields can be configured only once and applies to all A&L messages, it is
not configured individually on a per-message basis.

System Date The date as held on the NBX Authorisation Agent system.
System Time The time as held on the NBX Authorisation Agent system.
Fixed Value Data that always has a fixed value
2.1 Scope
The document considers the following message mappings:
Balance Enquiry [R1] to [R3] 0100
Withdrawal [R14] to [R3] 0200
Deposit [R14] to [R3] 0200
Balance Enquiry Response [A1] 0110 (or [R1]) to [A3]
Withdrawal Response [A1] 0210 (or [R1]) to [A3]
Deposit Response [A1] 0210 (or [R1]) to [A3]
Reversal Request [R3],[A1] and possibly [CO] to [E1] 0420/0421

Response Codes
Reversal Reason Codes

Reversal Request Response [E2] messages received from A&L are only used internally within the NBX (i.e.
they are not mapped to a Horizon message), and so are not within the scope of this document.

2.2 Structure

The message mappings are contained in an Excel spreadsheet, which has been embedded in this document.
To open the spreadsheet, double-click on the attachment icon. The first sheet contains a summary of the
message mappings that are included in the scope of this document. Subsequent sheets detail each of the
mappings in turn.

3 Notes on the Spreadsheet

For each message pair, the triggered message is shown on the left, with the triggering (or source) message on
the right. The exception to this is the “Reversal Request” [E1] message, which can be triggered either by a
[CO] message, or by a late [A1] Approve response from A&L, and is populated from a number of other
messages. In this case the right of the sheet contains elements from each of these messages, and an
additional column has been included to indicate which message the element comes from.

The “Source” column contains the details of how the message element in the triggered message is populated,
including the mapping between message elements in each of the messages where applicable. The “Source”
column also includes a description of any translations that need to take place in the NBX.

A greyed out row in the triggering message indicates that there is a field in the triggered message that is not
populated from data contained in that source message. In these cases, the triggered message field may be
populated from a different message, determined by the NBX or taken from Reference Data. Fields that have
been identified as being not required in the NBX — A&L Application Interface Specification document,
Reference [2], have not been included in the message.

A greyed out row in the triggered message column indicates that there is a field in the triggering message that
has no corresponding field in the triggered message. For example, fields provided in a A&L message that do
not map onto a Horizon field, are not passed on by the NBX, but are logged.

Similarly there are fields provided in a Horizon message that do not map onto a A&L field, and are not passed
on. The full list of fields in Horizon messages and their definitions and uses can be found in [4]; the following
fields which are not directly mapped to A&L messages are nevertheless relevant to NBX for the following
purposes:

Clerk_Identity Records identity of clerk operating at the outlet workstation (also
known as node or counter). This is required for audit purposes.

Client_ld Identifies a client of POL that is the end bank (card issuer) for a
transaction. This element is needed for reconciliation and
reports.

Digital Signature Used in conjunction with Signature_Type to check that the
message is valid.

Issuer_Scheme_Id A code to identify the Issuer Scheme, set from Reference Data at
the counter.

Message_Type Classifies the type of message being sent. e.g. R1 or CO.

Routing_Gateway Use to route transactions to the correct logical PI

Signature_Type Used in conjunction with Digital Signature to check that the

message is valid.

Transactions are uniquely identified in the system by a combination of the Riposte Group ID and Node ID of
the originating counter, together with the receipt transaction date (year and day), and the last 6 digits of the
message number component of the Horizon_Txn_Num field of the message which originated the transaction.
In messages to A&L this information is held in the form of the Terminal Identification (which is made up from
the Riposte Group ID and Node ID) and the Retrieval Reference Number (which includes the receipt
transaction date and message number information).

The following point should be noted with regard to the use of binary coded decimal fields in ICC data: in
communication with the counter this data is transferred using one character for each decimal digit, but if there
is an odd number of digits, an extra padding character, a zero, is included at the start of the number. It follows,
for example, that a field shown in the spreadsheet as having 3 BCD digits would actually be transmitted as 4
characters, the first being a zero used for padding. This encoding facilitates the counter's communications with
the Pin Pad. The spreadsheet indicates in such cases whether or not the padding is retained when mapping
the messages.

(The spreadsheet also contains some empty columns and rows, many of which are hidden, because it has
been requested that the cell numbers of information in this spreadsheet should correspond to those of
corresponding information in a similar spreadsheet which describes the Horizon - LINK mapping. Those empty
and hidden cells do not need to be considered with regard to the Horizon- A&L mapping.)
