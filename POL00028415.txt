Dave Miller to provide George McCorkell
with a written description of the PinICL
process,

When the PDA was in existence, a Fault
Management paper was produced outlining
the process for faults encountered, prioritised
and managed. This process is still being
followed. The paper has subsequently been
augmented by both the Management and
Support Notices for Model Office & End to
End testing produced by Pathway (latest
version 2.0 dated 18 October 1998), and by
the High Level Test Plans (HLTP’s). All
relevant documentation is distributed to all
groups including CAPS (Paul Noon).

Regarding the fixing, introduction and
support of faults, we have no visibility of the
process until we re-test in Model Office / End
to End, or until it is deferred onto the Known
Problem Register (Pathway have internal
processes and we do not have access to their
procedural documentation).

Input into CAPS Programme Board Report
for Meeting on 10/11.December 1998

Introduction
This report summarises the state of the overall HORIZON Programme as at
13 November 1998 (with additional updates to key areas).

Programme Overview
The major focus of the Programme at the current time is:

* supporting the existing live systems

* supporting the testing phase

* progressing the ‘Programme Management’ content of the Plan with
respect to the Live Trial, Multiple Benefits and the NR2+ Release

+ clarifying contractual issues and the acceptance process

+ Service Management development

* supporting the Treasury review and resulting negotiations.

Live Operations

The current Release continues to provide a Benefit Payment Service and
Order Book Control System for Child Benefit Payments in 204 outlets (119
in the South West & South Wales Region and 85 in the North East
Region). From an operational point of view, there are no major threats to
business continuity.

Fixes relating to Incomplete Transactions completed testing and were
successfully implemented at the counter on 9 October. There has since
been an encouraging reduction in the number of Incomplete Transactions
and the situation is being monitored closely to ensure that the expected
reduction in the number of incidents is realised. Figures for September
were 3 per 10,000 transactions. Current month levels are 1.6 per 10,000.

During October there were approximately 81,000 encashments (including
foreign encashments) with a total value in excess of £2.4m.

The Business Service Management Team continues to produce a monthly
Service Report which includes service performance reports and operational
issues / threats. The latest report was issued on 27 November. CAPS are
included on the distribution list.

Progress against the Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan
The Programme Master Plan (MP version 4) and Integrated Plan (IPP
version 1) will be formally updated following final agreement to the
‘Critical Path Plan’ that has been developed in the latest stage of the
Treasury Review. The HORIZON level 0 plan has been updated to reflect
this recent work as has the Pathway plan (version 6). Work is in hand to
understand and rationalise the differences between these plans.

The HORIZON plan has been baselined so that from an operational point
of view variations can be monitored and reported. A fortnightly

Cbi112

page 5 of 12

POL00028415
POL00028415

‘tumaround’ process is in place with feedback being received from all
functional areas on progress against plan.

The plans show the current key milestones subject to resolution of a
number of specific options around the Critical Path Plan in the area of the
POCL Child Benefit implementation. A comprehensive report of progress
against milestones will be reinstated when the current planning exercise
has been formally agreed.

The current status of key milestones planned for September/October (and
not previously reported as complete) is shown below:

Release Management
As the result of discussions between BA, Horizon and Pathway a change to
the plan (to allow additional testing time before starting migration) was
proposed. Plans based on starting migration in early March (rather than late
January) and completing by Easter were agreed in principle. This resulted
in a start to National Rollout of mid-August though the precise date
Cb1112 page 6 of 12

POL00028415
POL00028415

depended on the resolution of a number of detailed points. The start date
for live trial was set for 12 April. These dates have however been impacted
by the position on testing described below.

CAPS have provided details about the contents of their Release 4 and
agreement was reached on how this would tie in with Release 2+. A
Change Request to include on-line enquiries in CAPS 3.5 has been raised
and it has been agreed that this functionality will be provided between
Release 2 and 2+.

A paper describing the Release Contents of NR2 (Child Benefit only):has
been produced but this will need revision once Pathway have agreed the
Release Contents Description itself.

The overall plan is also dependant on satisfactory commercial agreements
being reached; discussions are ongoing.

Testing

MOR3 and E2E cycle 2 commenced on schedule on 12 October. A number
of problem areas were identified including counter reporting, the file
transfer mechanism to TIP, and transaction validation. There are also
continuing errors with the Cash Account though there has been some
improvement. Nevertheless; the large number of faults impacting financial
integrity indicate that this aspect of the system is not yet robust. E2E cycle
2 also experienced some serious problems during the office migration
period but these were partly caused by operator errors in Pathway. CAPS
have identified some issues they need to address in regard to BES
contingency.

Whereas there is progress against the declared testing scripts, there is a
greater concern following MOR3 that the business objectives are not being
satisfactorily met particularly with the ability to produce correct accounting
and reconciliation results. .

The Horizon Team is working closely with Pathway, TIP and CAPS to
address these issues. In addition a revised testing proposal has been put to
Pathway which would include an additional period of testing, focused on
financial integrity issues, prior to entry to the final Model Office Test pass.
Horizon believes it would be preferable to spend additional time to achieve
a quality system than risk failure of the Model Office Test with its
consequent implications.

Acceptance

Sign off of the Acceptance Specifications progresses slowly, with meetings
being convened to resolve the discrepancies. It now appears that it will be
December before all are approved. As at 30 November 12 of the 24 specs
have been approved. Outstanding specifications are being negotiated
between all parties with unresolvable issues caveated for escalation and
future resolution.

Implementation

Migration

The processes and procedures to be adopted for migrating offices have
been agreed. As a result a need for new Reference Data has been identified
and this is in hand.

Live Trial

Progress in this area has been limited due to the uncertainty surrounding
the commercial discussions on acceptance and the implications this will
have on the positioning of the Live Trial.

Surveys of the 204 post offices taking part in the trial have been concluded.

*86 are reported as needing minor mods, 56 major mods and 43 meet the
requirements. Currently there are 14 where solutions have been proposed
but not yet agreed. The 5 with “no solutions” have been re-surveyed and
solutions, acceptable to the post office, identified for each. Two offices
tequire a “trolley” solution and prototypes have been promised by Pathway
prior to Christmas.

National Rollout

HORIZON have submitted a proposal regarding the trigger points for NRO
during Live Trial and the proposed ramp up. This is based on a trigger five
weeks into the Live trial (even if this is deemed to be a 15 week Live
Trial). This trigger, and the ability of Pathway to cope with a 10 week
implementation window (including system aspects such as the rollout
database) are still being discussed.

5.2 Issues / Risks

An Issues Manager joined the Programme on 2 November and a Risk
manager joined on 26 October. A report on Issues and Risks follows.

6 Service Management Development
Work is underway on three main strands of work;

¢ Establishing a support centre

¢ Conformance

¢ Development/deployment of Business Service Management
principles. ,

Work continues to develop the new Support centre and recruit staff. A draft
plan has been developed and this is being impacted. Work is also in hand
to complete the outline business case for the Conformance project and to
finalise the organisation structure. Initial contact with POCL business units
has been made and Business Service Management walkthroughs are ~
continuing.

7 Future Releases

Release 2 + (introducing AP Smart and Logistics Feeder System
functionality)

Impact responses for the Change Control Note (CCN) for Logistics Feeder

System (LFS) are currently being analysed. A caveat on the CCN has been

raised regarding the need for a clear Quality Plan to enable HORIZON and

Pathway to manage the development.

The CCN for soft EVP (142E concerning score Card entries) is still being
negotiated.

The comments on the RCD have been passed to Pathway for clarification.
Of the 272 comments on the SADD 5.1, 143 related to Pathway issues and
meetings are being conducted to address these.

8: This report has been produced in accordance with the guidelines agreed
between Peter Crahan and the Horizon Programme Director on 15 April.
The area not covered is ‘Routine Commercial / Contractual Activity’ where
no request had been made by the CAPS PMO for specific detail, and no
input received from the Horizon Joint Contracts Team.
