Post Office Ltd - Confidential

The Committee agreed the minutes of the previous meeting and reviewed the open actions.

The Committee noted there had been some confusion over the description of AP 1776 ‘Camelot
Audit Lessons Learned’ and that it was not necessary for the current Camelot Audit to complete
before preparing a summary of lessons learned.

For points (i) & (ii) the JML update and audit, the Chair explained there was ongoing activity. MK
gave an update on (iii) the data cleanse activity underpinning regulatory training, noting that this
was much improved and that a process to update the data for new joiners had been developed.

3.6 Finance Controls

AR updated the Committee on the investigation into an unsupported £0.5m debit balance
discovered relating to the now-closed Merlin Cash Centre (incident initially reported in May 2017).
Investigation had revealed control gaps in POLSAP processes, and remediation had been
implemented, including a manual authorisation process for POLSAP journals, and further
remediation was planned.

3.1 FS Conduct Risk

JH introduced the paper noting that there were no issue of particular regulatory concern. JH noted
that a review of red video mystery shop results had shown that some Customer Relationship
Managers (CRMs) strayed from the approved regulatory wording during their customer discussions.
JH briefly explained the training and monitoring processes for CRMs to explain how such incidents
were resolved.

The Committee observed the putative training requirements included in FCA’s Insurance
Distribution consultation paper (which include 15 hours of CPD annually) and discussed the burden
of regulatory training which falls on branches as result of selling regulated products. The
Committee noted that there was a limit to how much training branches could absorb. The
Committee requested a further briefing on the potential training requirements of the Insurance
Distribution Directive in order to consider the future compliance burden against capacity in the
branch network (AP 1781). JM explained that the legal team had developed a regulatory
framework in response to an ARC action which would help inform the discussion, and the
Committee requested that the regulatory framework be brought to the September RCC meeting for
discussion (AP 1782).

The Committee discussed the POMS scorecard and requested that it be developed to make it more
similar to Bank of Ireland's scorecard & include some commentary (AP 1783).

3.2 Change Risk

JE introduced the paper. The Committee discussed the report and requested that the report be
developed to give more information about benefits realisation (AP 1784).

3.3 Financial Crime

SS introduced the paper and summarized the regulatory updates. The Money Laundering, Terrorist
Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 came into force on
Monday 26th June 2017 but the eKYC (electronic know your customer) requirements were still
unclear. Post Office would find it difficult to retain copies of ID documents the in branch, either
electronically or physically, and work was underway to clarify the requirement with the regulator.
Actio: ME to discuss with SS whether the eKYC requirements could be met through the
identity proposals that ME’s team were working on. (AP 1785).

The Committee briefly discussed the branch registration process, noting that a new process was
now in place. SS noted that with the increase in concern around terrorist financing, it was

important that this risk be considered as part of the screening requirements for new agents. SS
confirmed that there was work currently underway to assess the risk of unintentional terrorist
financing through the branch network.

SS noted that during August identity checking would be introduced at lower transaction levels; a
likely consequence would be an increase in transactions that needed to be investigated and
depending on levels, POL’s monitoring capability to deal with increased volumes would need to be
kept under review.

3.4 Annual Gifts & Hospitality Report

SS introduced the annual gifts and hospitality report, explaining that the existing process suffered
from gaps and a lack of enforcement. SS explained that a new gifts and hospitality reporting tool
had been developed, which would allow quarterly reporting for each business function, and which
was expected to be implemented during August. The Committee will be presented with an interim
gifts & hospitality report in November to demonstrate the outputs of the new reporting system (AP
1786).

The Committee briefly discussed the reporting limits and approved the proposed increase in the
hospitality reporting limit from £100 to £200 and the decrease in the gift given reporting limit from
£200 to £100.

3.7 Health and Safety

MH presented the H&S update. The Committee noted the increase in Supply Chain accidents and
the preponderance of parcel related incidents, and queried whether there was any single cause.
MH noted that no particular reason for the spate of accidents had been found. The Committee
discussed the age profile in Supply Chain, noting that the risk of back strain and similar injuries is
more likely in an aging workforce. AC noted that some offices had several members of staff off at
the same time which was affecting quality of service targets. MK noted that Royal Mail had the
same issue with regards to many of its operational staff.

MH noted that an annual Health & Safety ‘deep dive review’ had recently been undertaken by the
GE H&S Sub Committee (Safety Board) and focused on the three areas of property, security and
road risk for commercial and business drivers. The Committee briefly discussed the issue of
cladding around buildings and any potential fire risk. AC explained that relevant buildings in the
property estate were being tested.

MH also explained that mental health first aiders were to be rolled out across the business. OH
Assist would train up to 60 people across the business to act as ‘first responders’ to sign post help
to any members of staff showing signs of suffering from mental health issues. The Committee
approved of this initiative and noted that suitable comms should accompany the roll out to explain
the role of the mental health first aiders.

3.5 IT Controls and IT Tube Map

RB presented the IT Controls Update, explaining that development of the IT Controls Framework,
based on COBITS, was on track and that all 11 priority Cobit 5 processes had been reviewed and
the core suppliers’ controls identified, and gap assessments completed. The Chair queried whether
appropriate documentation processes were in place and RB noted that policies, processes and
standards were being developed as part of the framework.

RH presented the IT Risk Update, including the IT Tube Map. The Committee discussed the rate at
which IT risks were expected to reduce and noted that the tube map was helpful in displaying
changes in expected control status over time but because of scale was not able to show a gradual
diminution of risk.

3.8 Business Continuity

The Committee noted the paper

4.1 LRG Placemat

The Chair introduced the LRG Placemat using some slides (added to meeting records as Paper
4.1.1.1). The Committee discussed the placemat and the presentation of risks and controls. The
Chair explained that work was ongoing and that the September meeting would include a refined
LRG placemat, the first results from Finance and Operations. Work would now commence on the
roll out of the Placemat to Retail and FS&T business units.

4.2 Risk Incidents

RW gave the Committee a summary of the reported risk incidents since the last meeting. The
Committee discussed the categorisation of incidents, noting that fraud, theft and robbery should
be categorised as one category as incidents often changed appearance as an investigation
proceeded.

6.2 & 6.3 Financial Crime and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policies
The Committee approved the Financial Crime and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policies.

6.2 Protecting Personal Data

The Committee noted that this policy was a necessary part of the preparations for GDPR. RH had
some comments on the policy and agreed to send them to the Chair. This policy remains in draft.

6.1 Vulnerable Customer Policy
The Committee discussed the Vulnerable Customer Policy at length.
The Committee approved the Vulnerable Customer Policy.

6.5 Code of Business Standards

JW explained the approach taken to updating the Code of Business Standards. The Committee discussed
the revised Code and requested further work. The Committee requested that JW gather feedback and
update the policy and recirculate it for approval.(AP 1787).

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

Financial Services Conduct Risk Update

Author: Jonathan Hill Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

1.

This paper updates the Committee on current risks and actions in respect of
conduct risk. One of the key risks on the FS Risk register (also reflected in the
Post Office and POMS risk registers) relates to conduct risk. Conduct risk in the
regulated financial services context refers to risks to customers from poor product
design, distribution and selling processes as well as those risks relating to poor
product fulfilment.

Questions this paper addresses

2:

This paper provides an update on the key conduct risks and how they are being
managed.

Conclusions

3

Although the business faces some conduct risk challenges, some of which are
referred to below, they are being managed within the overall risk appetite. Post
Office has an averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or
deviation from business’ conduct standards. Key assurance on this is provided
through the MI dashboards and reports from Bol and POMS (attached).

However, there remain challenges from changes to the business model, including
regulatory changes, which require on-going focus to maintain conformance and
compliance. Our Principals can require us to cease activities where we cannot
demonstrate adequate controls to mitigate conduct risk.

Input Sought

5.

The R&CC is asked to note these developments.

The Report

Key Risks, governance and management information

6.

Conduct risks are measured and reviewed by FS&T Risk together with our Principals
on an on-going basis and management information is provided on the key risk
areas. These are reviewed at the Bol-Post Office Customer and Conduct Risk
Committee and POMS-Post Office Joint Compliance Committee, which meet
monthly.

Current risks and issues

Customer Relationship Managers (CRMs)

7.

10.

Li.

12.

As at 8 August there were 511 CRMs. The majority of these are active and digital
tablet enabled. During July a new Telecoms tablet journey was enabled, allowing
CRMs to engage with customers on Post Office Homephone, broadband and fibre
products. It is planned that the CRM programme will pause at this number of CRMs
for a period allowing the knowledge and processes of all the product journeys to
bed in.

We have a more positive engagement with customers (on an introductory basis)
on FS products through CRMs, which is carried out within a Training and
Competence (“T&C”) scheme that FS&T Risk oversee and monitor. Nevertheless
as we seek to innovate the CRM network, we need to ensure that the conduct and
operational controls in place remain appropriate.

The latest Video Mystery Shopping results for July were positive with only 3 out of
29 shops graded red. In each of the three red VMS the CRM did not provide an
overview of the full range of savings accounts and in two instances the customers
were not encouraged to read the application pack and consider the information
before making an application.

The T&C Framework outlines the process Senior/ Support Managers need to follow
when dealing with red VMSs. The actions are completed, documented and reported
back in the monthly BOI Regulatory Review VMS Report.

The weekly ASPM/RSDM development call includes a VMS performance update.
This includes a broadcast of the weekly results, the main causes of red & amber
grades and the actions ASPM’s and CRM’s need to undertake.

We will monitor the next round of mystery shops at the respective Bol and POMS
Committees.

Advertising breaches and issues

13,

14.

Bol repeated a concern that had been previously raised in relation to ensuring that
marketing materials passed their approval ‘sell by’ date are re-reviewed and re-
submitted for approval. Recent recruitment in the marketing team should make
these incidents less likely. The Head of Marketing has been asked to provide a
written response ahead of the next Bol Customer and Conduct Risk Committee.

On a related issue Bol monitoring has raised an issue in relation to a worsening
trend of out of date literature in branches. From its monitoring activity (April-June)
60% of branches have been found to have out of date literature available to

customers either on display or behind the counter. FS&T Risk will work with the
Retail Network team to ensure customers are given the appropriate literature and
review what more can be done to improve compliance in this area.

Branch Regulatory knowledge
15. A recurrent monitoring theme from both Principals is a concern about the level of

product or regulatory knowledge shown by a counter colleague when tested. Whilst
there may have been some gaps identified we are working with our Principals to
ensure that the questions tested are appropriate. For example, we would agree
that a counter colleague should know how customers can make a complaint but
would not necessarily expect them to answer questions about the FOS process.

Future issues

16. There are a number of significant regulatory initiatives on the horizon that impact

on Post Office and POMS:

a. General Data Protection Regime (GDPR) - February 2018. This project is being
led by the DPO and we are working with the team to assess and implement the
requirements

b. Vetting and ‘Fit and Proper’ - this is becoming an increasing priority for many
of our regulators (e.g., FCA and HMRC). There is a new vetting process in place,
but we need to risk assess new requirements (e.g., from HMRC) and assess
whether the scope of checks needs to increase.

c. Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) - extension to all regulated
firms by 2018. This will have a direct impact on POMS. POMS is leading a
project to implement this, which POL FS&T Risk is supporting, as it is the
company directly impacted. The FCA has confirmed, as expected, in its latest
Consultation Paper that Appointed Representatives such as Post Office will not
be directly subject to SMCR. However, further guidance on the approach to
SMCR for Appointed Representatives will follow.

d. Insurance Distribution Directive, one of the proposed key requirements is
increased CPD training for counter staff. POMS is leading a project to implement
this by February 2018, working with the Post Office Training and FS&T Risk
teams.

e. Payment Services Regulations (Payment Services Directive 2) rules were

finalised in July 2017 to be implemented in January 2018. As well as impacting
on the conventional payment business these are of significant strategic impact
as these regulations will open up access to the personal banking market for
new types of payment firms and also allow third party firms to perform
aggregation functions on behalf of and with the permission of consumers.

f. Vulnerable customers: This is an FCA/Ofcom priority area. A vulnerable
customer policy was agreed at the July RCC. We will shortly instigate risk
assessment work together with the Retail Business Unit to assess whether we
have any significant gaps in our approach.

Exceptions and key trends

CRM mystery shops - the CRM credit card pilot, which resulted in a number of red-rated mystery shops, has now ceased, CRM savings shops have improved, with 12 out of 70
(17.1%) being red rated in the 3 months to the end of July. Only 3 out of 29 shops were graded 'red' in July. While these shops relate to lower-risk introductory activities, remedial
actions are being followed up with Post Office and progress will be kept under close oversight for a period.

‘Advertising breaches and issues - Two material financial promotion breaches were recorded in July and related to in-branch current account leaflets remaining in the public
domain after their withdrawal dates, POL have confirmed that the reapprovals ‘were! missed’ as a result of the impact of the organisational restructure on the Marketing function.
This is the third month in a row that there have been such material breaches and, as such, this has been followed up with Post Office.

Branch regulatory knowledge - 2 out of 54 branches were rated red for ‘conduct and culture’ during the last three months. The red ratings resulted from a range of different issues.
The most prominent related to regulatory processes including the location of the branch ‘operations manual’ and gaps in staff knowledge of the FOS process. There were no red
rated branches in July.

Quality of Mortgage Advice - An improvement in 'C' grade cases from 9 to 2 in July and only 1 'D' case, improved the proportion of initial case checks passing QAT file checks, with
95.9% (89%) achieving an ‘A’ or 'B' grade. The 'D' grade related to advice which was considered unsuitable based on conflicting file notes. The QAT team continue to work with POL

to mitigate these errors.

Please note, reporting in relation to a number of new KRis will commence in September.

PAPER

3.2 Change Risk Update

Author: Jenny Ellwood Sponsor: Angela Van Den Bogerd Meeting date: 13 September 2017 (RCC)

Executive Summary

Context

This report provides an update on the delivery status of the Change Portfolio, the key
risk themes under management and the current highest scoring risks, referred to as
the ‘top risks’ within the Change Portfolio.

Questions addressed in this report
e What is the current delivery status of the Change Portfolio and key delivery
challenges?

e What are the key risk themes being managed at present and mitigation plans?
e What are the current top risks currently being managed within the Portfolio and
what is the performance of risk management based on the mitigation plans?

e What are the types of portfolio risks and how has this mix changed?

Conclusion

1. The current delivery status is Amber and the EUM and Success Factor
Programmes are experiencing some significant challenges.

2. The key risk themes we continually push against are: 1) what does the next 12-
18 months change activity look like and can we do it all, 2) what is the impact on
the network and is it manageable, 3) Why do we continue to underspend and 4)
what impact does this have on our benefits profile?

3. In terms of current top risks these are EUM Effectiveness, Delivery of 2017/18
Plan and IT Vendor Renegotiations. Work is underway on the mitigation activities
to move these risks to their target risk score position. An approved revised plan
and business case for EUM is expected by October, a review of the 2017/2018
change activities is underway with a detailed update scheduled for the Executive
Change Group (ECG) by the end of September and work is progressing well with
IT Vendor renegotiations with a Letter of Intent with Atos being signed and an
agreement secured to proceed with SISD contract changes to reflect a service
cost reduction and the transfer of some work in-house.

4. The type and mix of the portfolio remains broadly unchanged in this reporting
cycle. Key MI to evidence this is shown within the appendices. The new
integrated plan being developed, along with parallel capacity work, is also driving
discussions on potential risks and dependencies and progressing well. For this
reporting period the Portfolio risks have reduced to 25 and remain consistent
with the nature and complexity of the individual projects and the timeline.

5. Monthly health checks continue and Programmes are demonstrating they
understand their deliverables, risks and issues and work continues to improve
dependency identification, tracking and monitoring.

Input Sought

The ARC are asked to note the progress made since the last ARC, the top risks being
faced, how they are being managed and mitigated and to advise on any additional
areas/topics that should also be taken forward.

The Report

What is the current delivery status of the Change Portfolio and key delivery
challenges?

1. At the end of August 2017, the overall Post Office change portfolio status
remained Amber, this is taking into account the individual status of each
programme.

2. In terms of the Portfolio delivery status, we are currently reporting Amber. Key
delivery challenges include:

« Capacity: We are currently in the process of assessing (at project level)
capacity constrained areas’ ability to support all change. The output of this
review will be used to reassess the assumptions in the Strategic Plan.

« Enhanced User Management (EUM): The programme continues to explore
deployment options of the new identity management system and the Steering
Committee has identified significant additional scope required to ensure it is
effective and manageable within the Network.

« Success Factors payroll data migration: This has experienced ongoing
difficulties such that the current migration planned for October/November
2017 (which itself reflected an earlier 3 month’s delay) is under threat. A root
cause analysis exercise has been undertaken which suggests that issues have
arisen with the payroll data load particularly where employee records have
needed amendment during the period of upload thereby constraining payroll
comparison testing.

« Ongoing testing capacity: Constraints continue to be monitored and priorities
and appropriate scheduling are reviewed on a weekly basis. No immediate
concerns but one we continue to monitor through the integrated plan work.

What are the key risk themes being managed at present and mitigation plans?

3. In terms of key risk themes, we continually face challenges which are: 1) what
does the next 12-18 months change activity look like and can we do it all, 2) what
is the impact on the Network and is it manageable, 3) why do we continue to
underspend and 4) what impact does this have on our benefits’ profile?

4. To address the challenge of what the next 12-18 months looks like and the
impact on the Network, an extensive review of the Change Portfolio is underway.
This work has been led by the People and Change Director and has included
consideration of the impact of change on a number of key areas: IT, Network
Operations, HR Service Centre and Finance Service Centre. A full update on
activities is shown in paragraphs 14 to 15.

5. Additionally, work continues to try and establish the true impact and
requirements to meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The
programme has recently confirmed that:

e 17 out of 114 projects that have already gone live were concerned with the
use of personal data; and,

« 45 out of 199 project that are still in-flight have been identified as involving
the use of personal data. 20 of these have been classified as ‘high priority’.

6.

The project team has contacted 13 of the 20 high priority projects to confirm
their current lifecycle stage and the extent of the use of personal data. At this
stage the true impact of the work required to meet the GDPR is still unclear and
clarificatory work continues this month.

In terms of the Portfolio cost underspend, which currently stands at 7% at P4,
Finance are working closely with the Programme Finance Directors to establish
root cause and re-forecasts. Within period 4 we did see the cost spend
increasing gradually, however, they still remain significantly under both the
original budget and the current re-forecast. The current reason for variances are
as follows:
« Telco (Newcall) costs - are £3m above forecast as the next tranche payment
is sooner than anticipated, this is not an undersnend, but a timing issue.
* Network Development (ND) costs - are down} ND re-forecast was
planned for P5 reporting. P4 costs are in line
reforecast: i) IT Netwarks
) Risk & Resilience }raseveh), iv) Other IT

In terms of benefits we have continued to deliver the total value of benefits
anticipated each year. However, this has not necessarily derived from the
original Programme projected benefits specified, i.e. some Programmes have
delivered more which has compensated for those Programmes that have
experienced difficulties. The Change Finance Director is assessing what forum is
best to review and regularly challenge both costs and benefits tracking and a
proposal is to be made to the People and Change Director this month.
Discussions are already underway on the benefits MI we require reporting by
each Programme. The approach will be that Programme benefits tracking will be
consolidated into a central view via the Finance Directors. A review of the
approach taken in each Steering Committees will also be undertaken to ensure it
allows an appropriate level of monitoring and challenge.

What are the top risks currently being managed within the Portfolio?

9.

10.

11.

There are currently 25 open risks being managed at a Portfolio level, a net
reduction of -1 from the last ARC report in July 2017. The current top risks are:
i) EUM Effectiveness

ii) Delivery of elements within the 2017/18 Plan

iii) IT Vendor Renegotiations

The EUM programme is continuing to manage a number of challenges that must
be overcome to ensure full and effective deployment of the new Horizon system
access model. These include the need to obtain accurate data from agents, an
ability to communicate training requirements and to enable access to training
material to agents, agents’ assistants and PO Branch employees, to be able to
access data to confirm the vetting and compliance training status of all Horizon
users and to have business processes in place to manage data, password
management and system access issues.

Retail will now take the lead on the deployment phase of the project and work is
underway to develop an appropriate and scalable implementation plan.
Additionally, an Inflight Review has been undertaken to support Retail and looks

to answer the question on whether we can be confident that the Programme will
deliver from where we are now. Recommendations from both the Inflight and
the Network Operations Review were presented to the EUM Steering Committee
on 5 September and a plan and revised Business Case is now being produced for
approval in October.

14. The People and Change Director hosted a capacity review workshop on 8 August

2017 where all 76 projects within the current change portfolio were presented to

the 5 capacity constrained areas (IT, FSC, Retail, Network Ops and HRSC) for an

initial impact assessment. A follow up workshop was held on 29 August 2017 at
which it was concluded that:

* IT and Network Operations are the main areas where capacity will cause
impact on delivery. Additionally Network Operations, HR Service Centre and
Finance Service Centre will require appropriate early engagement from the
projects and sufficient lead-in time to uplift resource to accommodate any
increased activities;

« There are still unknowns that will impact ability to deliver e.g. GDPR; and,

* Recommendations to include need for prioritisation of all projects to make
priority calls where capacity constraints exist and ongoing demand

Capacity of IT Key Suppliers: There was a risk that key IT suppliers cannot
meet our change demands due to the pace of change and the concurrency of
activities resulting in delays to our “Change Portfolio” delivery plans. This
was closed on the basis that it was deemed that elements of this risk were
captured and managed under another risk (‘Complex Portfolio Planning & IT
Management’.

Resourcing Risk (Payroll Legislation): There was a risk that HMRC legislative
changes that came into effect in April 2017 could cause significant impact to
Change resourcing model and the way that it uses contractor staff. The risk
was closed on the basis that it had been managed down to target.
Unintended consequences on Operational Performance (People): There was a
risk that staff departures as a result of change being implemented may
impact the effectiveness of the control environment increasing likelihood of
new operational risks. The risk was closed through merger with a similar
portfolio risk (‘Op Performance — Process’).

Delivery (Integrated Plan Delivery Performance): There was a risk that our
delivery is all back ended and we hit business with too much change all at
once. Closed on the basis of replacement with risk on our ability to deliver
the 2017-18 change plan due to multiple capacity constraints.

The 3 new risks opened are:

GDPR: see paragraphs 5 to 6.

Delivery of 2017/18 Plan: see paragraphs 14 to 15.

Model Office Testing Capacity/Resilience: The Model Office is designed to test
counter releases and services in a live environment. There is a risk that the
introduction of new network routers and platforms (HNGA) introduces
complexity and additional time as testing needs to cover different branch
types, network routers and platforms (HNGX and HNGA). An additional risk
is that the Model Office has limited visibility of change projects in the pipeline,
which results in an ability to effectively plan and prioritise activities within
Model Office. We will monitor the demand from the integrated planning
activity and consider the capacity of the Model Office as a constraint during
this transition.

The table below, illustrates how the mix of risks at portfolio level continues to
flex and shows the open portfolio risks by severity.

Risk Weighting

Each portfolio risk has a weighting score calculated by
multiplying their impact/probability scores. When added
together this provides a cumulative portfolio score which
currently stands at 242.

The overall risk severity score has reduced by around 9%
since April 2017. This has been the result of risk closures.
The risks continue to be monitored in line with the change

3.3 Financial Crime Risk Update
Author: Sally Smith Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting Date: 13" September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

This paper updates the Risk and Compliance Committee on progress with the HMRC
Regulatory Activity project which has been established to manage both the HMRC’s Anti-
Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) audit and the risk
assessment work being undertaken to address Financial Crime Risks.

« What is the current position with the HMRC Audit and potential penalties?

« What is the current position on progress with the Financial Crime risk assessment
work and next steps?

« What are the impacts for Post Office of regulatory changes

Conclusion

1. Regular meetings are being held with HMRC and the HMRC audit action plan is on
track. The penalty natice_in.respect of historic premises registrations has now been
received and paid HIRRELEVANT)). HMRC are still considering the regulatory position
relating to Bill Payrters“and potential penalty for regulatory breaches relating to
Bureau de Change.

2. Risk Assessment work has progressed well and will be ‘business as usual’ by the
end of the current financial year. The Financial Crime Team are to support and
deliver workshops to product managers to embed the methodology across the
business.

3. Post Office continues to work with HMRC to understand the implications of the new
Fit & Proper test regime and for HMRC to clarify their interpretation and guidelines
in respect of eKYC and retention of identity documentation.

Input Sought

The R&CC is asked to review this report and consider whether further actions should be
undertaken.

4. Further meetings have been held with HMRC on the 26" July 2017 and the 23
August 2017. An updated Bureau de Change action plan was presented by the
project team in July, with improved timescales for delivery, and this has been
accepted by HMRC and is currently on track:

« New customer data capture and identification/address verification thresholds
and data capture improvements delivered into the Network on 30 August
2017

« A daily feed of all Bureau de Change activity into a central Post Office data
depository, with appropriate tools for rules based exception reports together
with the ability to undertake ad-hoc and holistic transaction monitoring is
scheduled for delivery at the end of January 2018

« Subject to procurement timeframes, PEPs and Sanction screening is expected
to be delivered by end February 2018 and eKYC by end April 2018.

5. HMRC advised they are considering a penalty in respect of breaches of Regulations
19 and 20:

« Regulation 20 (Risk Based Approach) - HMRC cited ‘behavioural’ failures
relating to the lack of up to date Bureau de Change risk assessments and
processes, and failings in relation to AML/CTF policy documentation (the 2012
version was current until 2016, with no evidence of review).

« Regulation 19 (Record Keeping) - HMRC cited observation of a lack of
knowledge as to where and how data was stored (no data dictionary
maintained), there were delays in data provision and that missing
transactional and due diligence data was identified during the audit. As such
HMRC believe POL was in breach of the requirements to maintain due diligence
information for a minimum of five years.

taken into consideration. Based on financial information provided by the

HMRC, and the pre-penalty notice will not be received until this work is
complete, and a decision about Bill Payments is made as this may impact
apportionment of costs of premises registration (see point 7. below). These

per annum and currently all costs are allocated to the
Buréau dé Change business - if Bill Payments are ruled as in scope for HMRC
regulation, this will increase the Bureau de Change gross profit calculation
and could increase amount of penalty calculation.

6. HMRC confirmed that whilst there were previous historic failings relating to Staff
Training (Regulation 21), they had evidence that throughout the audit Post Office
had been continually improving their AML/CTF communication plan to address this.

been entered into, HMRC had not identified many specific failures. Therefore Post
Office will not be fined for breaches to regulations 7 & 21 but are likely to receive
a warning.

After the meeting un the 26" July 2017, Post Office wrote formally to HMRC in
relation to the legal view that it was not directly regulated for Bill Payment services.
This is being considered by HMRC as part of a sub-sector review and is still with
the HMRC Policy and Legal teams for a decision. Until a decision is reached, HMRC
will not audit the Post Office in respect of this activity.

The penalty notice relating to historic premises registration issues was received on
10" August 2017; ) and has been paid.

Financial Crime Risk Assessment Update

9. The action plan in Appendix A gives full updates, but in summary:

« Drop and Go, MoneyGram, Gift Cards, Travel Money Card, International
Payments and Postal Orders are complete and will be tracked for annual
review going forward.

« Bill Payments work is due to be completed at the end of August and will be
issued to the product manager for review and sign-off. The Bureau de Change
control strength and residual risk scores are being re-evaluated as the
remediation solutions are delivered.

« Of the remaining products and services, the following approach will be
adopted:

i. Residual risk was last calculated in October 2016 by Thistle Initiatives,
this is now being reviewed in line with business changes and controls
identified from the high risk re-assessments completed. Current
assessment is that there are no high risk products and services
remaining that require remediation work, but this will be confirmed at
November R&CC once the work is complete.

ii. Product Manager risk assessment workshops will be rolled out from the
end of September 2017 in conjunction with the proposed Product
Manager training by Cranfield School of Management - attendees will
complete the Product Information Pack for their products and services
after these workshops. The Financial Crime Team will check these
completed documents against the existing risk assessment, and amend
residual risk calculations, as appropriate. These will then be diarised
for annual review going forward, along with the 8 high risk products
and services.

10. Non-conformance issues in the Network in July and August 2017/18 include 30
incidents identified at 24 branches:

e 17 branches are on the non-conformance watch list and manually monitored
monthly

e 1 branch has been added this quarter

e 1 branch has been removed this quarter

11. The volumes of suspicious activity reports (SARs) have reduced by c.20% in July
and August and this appears to be in relation to MoneyGram. MoneyGram
implemented new identification requirements from 20 June 2017 to meet new
requirements under the money laundering regulations and all transactions now

require identification to be presented and recorded. Customers sending or
receiving £800 or more have to present ID at the counter and upload an image of
their ID direct to MoneyGram via a dedicated upload portal in order for the
transaction to be completed. MoneyGram then check these against the details
captured at POS before they release the funds. At this stage we are not sure if the
reduction is because suspicious activity is being driven elsewhere, or staff fail to
be suspicious because they have taken identification. A branch focus article is
planned 14 September 2017 to raise awareness of the need to report all
suspicions. We will continue to monitor.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Risk Assessment update

12. The following has been completed since the last update in July:
« ABC policy - being submitted to September 2017 ARC for final approval.
« Gifts and Hospitality reporting tool launched.
« ABC training launched 8" September 2017.

AML/CTF training update

13. HR have confirmed that a process has been established to ensure that all new back
office staff and contractors complete training within 30 days of joining. Financial
Crime Team have established ongoing compliance checks.

14. As atthe time of writing there are c. 130 branches that have not completed training
as required and the Branch Standards Team are working through appropriate
intervention options with the Contracts Team and the Network Team to ensure
completion.

POMS MLRO report

15. A report on POMS activity has been produced by the Financial Crime Team and
MLRO and is being presented to the September 2017 POMS R&CC and ARC. No
material weaknesses have been identified and the governance framework is
currently considered to be effective in managing and overseeing the AML risks
within the POMS business.

16. From the risk assessment undertaken in April 2017, there were only minor
recommendations made and POMS evidenced a clear reporting structure in which
financial crime concerns are escalated efficiently to senior management. The
policies, procedures, monitoring, controls and both internal and external audits to
mitigate exposure to financial crime are in place and communicated effectively to
third parties. The risk assessment evidenced that all insurance products within
POMS remit were within the risk appetite set by the business.

Regulatory updates

17. eKYC - HMRC advise that they have not reached a decision internally regarding
the adequacy of eKYC for customer due diligence and the interpretation issues
between themselves and the JMLSG. We understand that a number of
organisations are raising queries with HMRC regarding this issue and Post Office is
to write formally to HMRC to request response and guidance regarding this issue

18. Fit & Proper test - HMRC is still undertaking internal analysis of the interpretation
and application of the requirements, in conjunction with discussions with the top
11 organisations directly regulated by them. Following the meeting on 26" July,
Post Office provided to HMRC some detail around the due diligence undertaken at

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE ADVISORY PAPER

3.4.1 IT Controls Update

Author: Rebecca Barker Sponsor: Sharon Gilkes, Rob Houghton Date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to update the RCC on the status of the IT Controls
Framework (ITCF); the most recent remediation plans; any emerging issues or
developments; and the next steps of the project.

Questions addressed in this paper

1. What is the current status of the ITCF?

2. What are the latest control/remediation results & what does this mean?
3. How will the controls reduce our risks?

4. What are the next steps?

Conclusion

1. Of the 193 controls in the ITCF, 108 are implemented, 64 are partially in place
(they do not fully mitigate the risk) and 21 controls are missing. Compared to other IT
Control Framework projects, the level of control gap is not unusually large for this
stage in the transformation. However, the issues highlight control gaps that would not
be expected at similar large and high-profile organisations, and provide a particular
challenge for the Post Office as a result of the extensive levels of outsourcing.

2. We are marginally below our forecast of the key controls being implemented. This
is because a number of remediation activities are reliant on key programmes including
the Security Operations Centre (SOC) and the implementation of the new Service
Integrator Target Operating Model. Remediation activities will be implemented as
these programmes deliver during 2017/18 and we are adjusting our plan to reflect
this.

3. We have reviewed the Manage Security and Manage Security Services RACM and
identified a number of controls that will reduce the overall risk severity on the IT Risk
Register; we are prioritising these.

4. We have set a target to close the remaining gaps in the ITCF by March 2018. We
expect to have controls operating against all identified key risks by fiscal year end,
with every control having been through at least one round of self-assessment and
sample audit checks undertaken on each process.

The Report

What is the current status of the ITCF?

1.

We are proceeding with the 11 processes in Tranche 1 (Priority 1 —- see
Appendix 2) included in the original scope of the ITCF. These are currently
going through remediation assessment: ensuring that controls owners are being
identified and remediation actions are being assigned. Remediation is being
monitored by IT Risk Management and KPMG.

We have reviewed and have full remediation plans for 4 Processes: Incident
Management, Change Management, Manage Security and Manage Security
Services.

The number of controls has slightly decreased from 215 in July to 193 in
August. This is due to consolidation and removal of several controls to better
match the control environment with the needs of the Post Office. We have
reviewed these controls with the Control Owners and Internal Audit, and
actioned their feedback.

Of the 193 controls, 108 are implemented, 64 are partially in place (i.e. they
address some but not all of the risk), and 21 are currently not in place. For all
the controls which are not implemented, we have identified and graded the
severity of gaps. This assessment has been refreshed to include likelihood (see
Appendix 1 for the new criteria).

Out of the 193 controls we have categorised 114 as Key Controls. These have
been assessed by the level of risk to the business i.e. “What is keeping us
awake at night?” The Key Controls will be remediated as a priority.

Following remediation workshops we have identified that the design of 108
controls is implemented. These controls have not been subject to detailed
testing and we may identify that the remediation activity is insufficient. Further
information on testing can be found below.

To enable ongoing monitoring of ITCF and controls self-assessment, we have
been developing test scripts for each individual process. This will include
sample testing and review of evidence retained as a result of ITCF controls
operation. The main purpose of test scripts is to enable testing of controls
found to be already in place and overall operating effectiveness of controls as
gaps are remediated.

We have discussed the requirements for the upload of the RACMs into TrAction
with Internal Audit. We have submitted 2 RACMs to the TrAction team, and we
are investigating the cost and timescale required to upload the 11 RACMs.
Incident Management, Business Continuity and Managed Security Services have
the highest number of controls not in place. This is because a number of the
controls are reliant on the implementation of the Security Operations Centre
(SOC), which is expected to be in place in Q4 and also the delay of the target

‘Actuals

11. We are marginally below our forecasted target of controls being remediated,
because a number of controls owners have been on leave. The August actual
remains the same against the July Actual as a result of challenges back from
the project and remediation examples not being evident. We expect the actuals
to increase rapidly upon implementation of the Security Operations Centre and

also when the governance has been restructured to align to the Target

Operating Model with our service integrator.

How will the controls reduce our risk?
12. We have reviewed the Manage Security and Manage Security Services RACM

and identified a number of controls (see table below) that will reduce the

overall risk severity on the IT Risk Register; we are prioritising these.

° Effective Incident Management/Change Management controls would have
reduced the overall risk of a Severity 1 incident which occurred on the
30th April 2017 and resulted in lack of connectivity to the live service for
multiple branches. In this case, back-end maintenance was not managed
via the correct Change Management channels and this resulted in an
engineer accidently shutting down the system. If the correct controls had
been in place to ensure that all maintenance/ prerequisites/ benign
changes were visible to the Service Integrator and Post Office the impact
may have been reduced. Human error cannot be prevented but the
controls around Incident Management/Change Management would have
reduced the overall likelihood and impact.

e Effective Manage Change and Acceptance controls would have reduced the
overall risk of an incident which occurred in June which resulted in
customers being unable to make Metrobank cheque deposits. The issue
was the result of a change that had taken place within the clients’ domain
which had not been tested correctly. We have several controls with the
Manage Change and Acceptance process which will reduce this risk going
forward. One of the key controls to support this will be that a model test
environment is in place which is representative of current and future
production environments. The remediation is currently being identified.

Continue to validate control designs and gaps with control owners and expand
control design to include defined control operators and audit trail. Walkthroughs
are scheduled to run over the next couple of weeks for the remaining 7 RACMs.
Test scripts will be finalised for all 11 processes by the end of September.

A workshop has been scheduled for 7th September to plan the operating model
for ongoing controls assessment. This will also determine if 3rd party off-shore
support is required.

Training with control owners will start in October. Following advice from the
Finance Controls Project this will be carried out in a staged approach and we
estimate will take 3 months to deliver.

Self-assessment will commence as the RACMs are rolled out and training is
completed with control owners.

As an awareness exercise and to provide support to the forthcoming EY Finance
Control Audit we will share the ITCF RACMS for Manage Change, Manage
Security Services and Manage Operations with EY.

Appendix 2 depicts the Tranche Priority processes for the ITCF programme.
Priority 2 process controls have not yet been started, these represent the
priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year in the following order: Manage
Assets; Manage Business Process Controls; Governance Framework; Enterprise
Architecture; Manage Configuration and Human Resources. Gap analysis and
remediation is expected to be complete by end January 2018.

In summary, we expect to have controls operating against all identified key
risks by fiscal year end, with every control having been through at least one
round of self-assessment and sample audit checks undertaken on each process.

RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE ADVISORY PAPER

POL Disaster Recovery
Position

Authors: Mick Mitchell/Rebecca Barker Sponsor: Rob Houghton Meeting date: 13™ September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

In July 2017, the POL Disaster Recovery Position paper outlined the current
Disaster Recovery (DR) position within POL and the need to implement a strong
DR Policy and Framework which is regularly tested and improved. This paper
provides an update on the remedial actions to date.

Questions addressed in this report
1. What is the progress since the last update?
2. What are the next steps?

Conclusion

1. We have carried out a full review of the current state of key services to
understand what has been tested and the status of testing that has been
carried out to date. We developed a Disaster Recovery Framework and

We have carried out a full review of the current state of key services to
understand what has been tested and the status of testing that has
been carried out to date.

We have defined a robust DR framework for IT Services which provides
clear definition of testing and recovery required.

Services are categorised by recovery time as as Gold (recovery time 5
hours), Silver (recovery time 24 hours) or Bronze (recovery time 96
hours).

We have assessed all DR services against the framework and 29
services are rated Gold, from 8 different Suppliers (further detail in
Appendix A). Of the remainder, 10 DR services are rated Silver and 13
Bronze. We are still in the process of reviewing these remaining Silver/
Bronze services but can confirm that 4 are compliant with the DR
framework with the rest still to be determined. We will prioritise this
over the next few months. We have carried out a review with business
and process owners to ensure that our IT DR plans align to the
Business Continuity planning needs of POL.

We have implemented improved governance around the process of
periodic IT DR testing from our supplier base. In future, the
postponement of IT DR tests will only be permitted subject to active
challenge and subsequent sign off by IT and business owners.

We have reviewed the existing IT Service Recovery report that Atos
provide and made key amendments that will ensure that POL IT can
give more visibility across IT and our business areas.

We have updated our risk logs to align with the above status.

What are the next steps?

1.8

1.9

POL IT will now ensure that we have the actions in place to mitigate
any outstanding issues, assess the costs involved to support any
required contract changes and schedule tests that have not been
scheduled or aligned to contract specifications.

We will review and refresh the framework, including the need for
further definitions of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery
Point Objectives (RPO).

RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE ADVISORY PAPER

Financial Reporting Controls

Author: Danielle Goddard Sponsors: Amanda Radford, Al Cameron Date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to update the RCC on the status of the Financial Reporting
Controls Framework (the FRC), the most recent control self-assessment results (July
2017), current areas of focus, and the progress made on the second phase of the
project.

Questions addressed in this report

What is the current status of the FRC?

What are the latest self-assessment results?

How are the current control gaps being addressed?

What were the results of the Merlin review and balance sheet review?

What progress has been made on the next phase of the FRC, and what are the
next steps?

vibwne

Conclusions

The existing framework has continued to expand (269 controls at end July 2017 from
262 at end May 2017) as we have introduced various new controls. Monthly self-
assessment is continuing in the TrAction online self-assessment tool and results are
being monitored.

Of the 269 controls at end July 2017, 191 (71%) were issued for self-assessment. 184
(96% of those issued for self-assessment) were operating effectively. Of the
remaining 7 controls, 3 were not performed in time but were subsequently confirmed
as effective, 1 was not performed effectively but mitigating procedures were
reviewed, 2 related to the change in the Fixed Assets control environment which is
under review, and 1 was not self-assessed but was later confirmed as effective.

Of the 78 controls not issued for self-assessment at the end of May, 55 were not due
to be operated in the period. 13 controls were in remediation, and 10 were yet to be
set to live. For the 13 controls in remediation, workaround controls are in place or
remediation is in progress. The 10 controls being made live for self-assessment relate
to the overall control environment and have been reviewed to ensure there were no
unaddressed risks which could affect the financial statements.

PwC testing is now complete excluding Spreadsheets for which we have draft results;
the results for the completed areas show that out of 80 controls tested, there were 12

amber exceptions and no red exceptions. The amber exceptions have now been

addressed. The draft results for Spreadsheets testing show that improvement is
required (rated as amber); work is already in progress to address this.

The Merlin investigation work is complete; the investigation has identified accounting
entries which could relate to missing cash. However, the cause of this potential cash
loss could not be confirmed to either be accounting errors following system outages, or
the theft of cash.

In response to the Merlin incident a new high risk gap was raised regarding POLSAP
journals, which has since been reduced to medium risk. An interim authorisation
policy has been implemented and user roles have been reduced to the minimum
required. Further work is still being performed to refine and monitor this. The FRC
team are working with the Back Office Transformation team to develop the longer-
term solution once POLSAP processes are migrated into CFS. A review is also
underway over HRSAP access and the control environment over its replacement
Success Factors.

The year-end review of Accounts receivable and Accounts payable is complete; testing
was performed over the material Receivables and Payables balances as at FY16/17
year end, with a focus on confirming balances had cleared (i.e. receipts or payments)
after the year end, and reviewing support for any uncleared items. The review
identified a number of adjustments, netting to a debit to the P&L of £65k. With the
exception of the Merlin cash centre balance, the adjustments mainly relate to aged
balances which are no longer required or supported, which are individually immaterial.
Further work is planned to complete balance sheet reconciliation training.

A Masterdata controls analyst and a Finance Service Centre controls analyst
(contractors) have now joined the FRC team. A permanent controls analyst has been
recruited to start in October 2017, who will perform monthly testing of controls.

Input Sought

The RCC is asked to note the progress made and comment on the priorities.

The Report
1. What is the current status of the FRC?

1.1 The controls within the 12 processes included in the original scope of the FRC are
being self-assessed by control owners on a monthly basis. Results are
monitored by the FRC Manager on a monthly basis. The results of the most
recent control self-assessment (July 2017) are summarised in section 2 below.

1.2 The controls framework is expanding and adapting each month. The total
number of controls at end July 2017 was 269, up from 262 at end May 2017.
The net increase of 7 controls related to the addition of 12 new controls, less 5
removed controls. The 12 new controls were one for each Process owner to

submit periodic conformation that they have reviewed the risks and controls in
their process. Of the 5 controls removed, 3 were merged with similar or linked
controls, and 2 were no longer relevant (one relating to the closed DB pension
plan, and the other relating to an accrual which is no longer required). All
control removals are reviewed before being removed from the CSA tool.

1.1. PwC have completed their independent testing of controls (excluding
Spreadsheets for which we have draft results) and have provided a
consolidated report, showing that of the 80 controls tested there were 12
amber exceptions identified and no red exceptions identified. The amber
exceptions mainly related to ownership issues and wording changes. These
have since been resolved. An extract from the PwC report is shown in Appendix
2a

1.2. PwC have provided draft results of their testing over Spreadsheets controls. The
control has been rated as amber, with some improvement required in order to
refine the controls defined and apply them consistently. The main
improvements required relate to change management and approval of changes.
Work has already begun to address the detailed action points raised by PwC,
including the introduction of a front sheet for each spreadsheet which requires
evidence of change management and approval. This is currently being rolled
out across the in scope spreadsheets (starting with those that PwC identified as
requiring improvement from their sample testing). PwC are developing their
comments before providing a formal report on Spreadsheets controls.

1.3. A permanent controls analyst has now been recruited, who will perform monthly
cycle testing over all controls. The controls analyst is expected to join the FRC
team during October 2017.

1.4. There were 13 open control gaps remaining at end of July 2017 for which
workaround controls are in place or remediation is being completed. None are
considered high risk; 9 are considered medium risk and 4 low risk. This includes
the control gap that was raised in respect of POLSAP journals, which was
classified in June 2017 as high risk, but subsequently reduced to medium risk
after temporary controls have been implemented. This is further discussed in
section 3.

1.5. There were 10 controls to be set to live at end of July 2017, all had owners but
were awaiting final confirmation to go live. These all related to controls which
sit under the overall control environment. None of these are expected to have a
direct impact on the financial statements but work is being done to bring these
live and into self-assessment by end December 2017.

2. What are the latest self-assessment results?

2.1. The results of the July 2017 self-assessment are summarised in the table below.
See appendix 1 for further detail of the July self-assessment results by process.

July 2017 - Total controls 269

Less: Controls in remediation -13
Controls to be set to live -10
Controls not due to be operated due to frequency -55

Total population for self-assessment 191 I 71%

Self-assessed and operated effectively 184 I 96%

Self-assessed but not operated effectively 6 3%

No self-assessment submitted i 1%

2.2. 55 controls were not due to be self-assessed for July 2017, this is because the
controls are annual, bi-annual or quarterly controls and did not fall due in the
month.

2.3. 3% (6 controls) were initially assessed as not operating effectively; 3 of these
were performed late, 2 related to Fixed Asset controls which are being
transformed as a result of the recent Fixed Assets review, and 1 was not
performed but mitigating procedures were in place. Conversations have also
been held with control owners to ensure that the controls are performed
effectively and on time for the next self-assessment.

2.4. 1% (1 control) had no self-assessment submitted. We have confirmed with the
control owner that the control was performed effectively and there were no
issues.

2.5. The August self-assessment is currently being performed and results will be
assessed mid-September.

3. How are the current control gaps being addressed?

3.1. There were no high risk control gaps at end July 2017, 9 medium risk gaps, and
4 low risk gaps.

3.2. In June 2017 a high risk control gap was raised regarding lack of authorisation
over manual journals in POLSAP. Under the original scope of the FRC, an
authorisation process was implemented over CFS journals and it has since been
identified that this should be extended to cover POLSAP. Work has been
performed to mitigate the risk and the control gap has been reduced to
medium.

3.3. Some POLSAP users require access to post manually in order to carry out various
transactions (manual file uploads, transaction corrections, cash receipts and
cash dispatches, treasury clearing account transactions, and client
settlements). There are various controls already in place to detect any errors or
issues as a result of these postings, for example; probity returns over POLSAP.
balance sheet GL accounts > £5k, independent authorisation of high value
transaction corrections, vendor reconciliations on client settlement vendors, and
bank reconciliations.

3.4. An authorisation process has now been implemented for POLSAP journals, this
was effective from 5 July 2017. The authorisation process covers manual
POLSAP entries which are > £250k in value, or > £30k for Transaction
Corrections and Supply Chain / Cash Centre postings which we expect to be
smaller.

3.5. Manual postings in scope for approval in July were sample checked to ensure
authorisation was provided by an appropriate authoriser; a 10% sample check
was performed (52 items). Out of the 52 items sampled, 34 items were agreed
to approvals sent into the POLSAP Approvals inbox, 17 items were agreed as
pre-approved through the normal payment approvals process which we agreed
would be out of scope for this separate approvals process. 1 item did not
receive approval; this was followed up and retrospective authorisation was
received. Sample testing will be extended to ensure there are no further
unauthorised journals.

3.6. Separate to this, a POLSAP user access review has been performed to remove
access from any users who do not have a critical requirement for access to post
manually into POLSAP. This resulted in 54 out of a total of 169 roles being
removed. A report is being obtained from Accenture to assess the last
transaction dates for these users. The reason for the high number of roles is
due to the size of the teams processing transaction corrections, settlements,
and cash receipting and despatching. Of the 54 roles removed, 7 were leavers
and 8 were Accenture support roles.

3.7. The Back Office Transformation (BOT) project is removing POLSAP and
transitioning the processes performed in POLSAP over to CFS. Access to post
manual journals in CFS is centralised and restricted to a small number of
individuals who have appropriate segregation of duties. The FRC team are
working with the BOT team to ensure that the CFS controls are applied to the
migrated POLSAP processes where appropriate.

3.8. After the transition into CFS, all manual journals which are not high volume or
time critical will be submitted centrally for processing and subject to the normal
CFS journal authorisation policy. However, there are some processes where
users require access to create a high volume of time critical manual
transactions (for example transaction corrections and cash receipting or
despatching). For these transactions, there are options which can be used in

CFS including value restrictions on the maximum value a user can transact, and
workflow approval based on defined approval limits. We will be defining
appropriate controls with the BOT team.

3.9. A review is underway over HRSAP access and the control environment in Success
Factors.

4. What were the results of the Merlin review and balance sheet
review?

4.1. In the last update to RCC, a review over the Merlin incident and a Balance Sheet
review over Debtors and Creditors were underway.

4.2. In response to the Merlin incident, the following investigation work has been
performed;

- An investigation was carried out over the financial records held and internal
controls in place, in order to identify the cause of the issue. A Deloitte Senior
Manager was seconded to the POL Accounting and Governance team to perform
this investigation.

- The investigation included review of the relevant debtor accounts, review of the
cash transactions carried out by the cash centre manager, walkthrough of cash
centre processes, review of cash transactions on the POLSAP outage dates, and
review of BACS payments to customers.

- Formal interviews were held with the former employee to understand the causes
of the unexplained balance.

4.3. The investigation performed has identified accounting entries which could relate
to missing cash. However, the cause of this potential cash loss could not be
confirmed to either be accounting errors following system outages, or the theft
of cash. The balance is not supported by any physical cash or asset, and has been
written off.

4.4. In response to the Merlin incident, the following controls have been implemented;

- An authorisation process over high value manual journals in POLSAP has been
implemented and sample tested; refer to sections 3.4 and 3.5 of this paper.

- POLSAP user access has been reviewed and 54 roles have been removed in order
to reduce risk; refer to section 3.6 of this paper.

- A control is being introduced to the framework for a bi-annual full cash count at
all cash centres. A full cash count was performed of all cash centres in July, the
results have been tied back to the relevant POLSAP GL accounts. Some cash in
despatch was not counted at the time of the count, but alternative procedures

were performed to trace each of these items in Horizon to the subsequent
acceptance by branches. No issues were noted.

4.5. The Balance Sheet review over Debtors and Creditors is now complete. Deloitte
secondees were engaged to assist with the review, which focused on testing the
material receivables and payables balances as at FY16/17 year end, with a
focus on testing the clearing of balances (i.e. receipts or payments) after the
year end, and reviewing support for any uncleared items.

4.6. The review identified a number of adjustments, netting to a debit to the P&L of
£65k. With the exception of the Merlin cash centre balance, the adjustments
mainly relate to aged balances which are no longer required or supported, which
are individually immaterial.

4.7. The review also identified a need for balance sheet training in some areas, which
we plan to carry out in October and November 2017.

5. What progress has been made on the next phase, and what are
the next steps?

5.1. We are currently re-assessing controls across Fixed Assets. The financial
reporting risk has changed within fixed assets due to the potential change from
full impairment to capitalise and depreciate and for this reason we are re-
assessing risks and controls in this area.

5.2. We are also re-assessing controls over Network Cash. As per section 4.4 of this
paper, a control is being added into the CSA tool for a full cash count to be
performed on the FY17/18 year end date, and bi-annually going forwards from
FY18/19. The FRC team are developing standard format procedures and
documentation for the cash counts.

5.3. Masterdata was added to the scope of the FRC after year end; 3 Masterdata
processes have been covered to date and 10 controls are now being self-
assessed on a monthly basis. Some control gaps were identified from the initial
3 processes covered, most being due to reliance on manual processes with a
lack of monitoring controls. None of the gaps indicate a risk of material
misstatement. A new Masterdata controls analyst has now joined the FRC team,
with initial priorities being over control gap remediation, Atos, and Payroll
(including review of Success Factors).

5.4. As noted previously, in reviewing the programme we have identified a further
four areas that we want to add to the FRC which were not considered high risk
for the original scope: agents’ debt; the branch correction process; agent
remuneration; and POMs. A business case has been approved to cover this, as

well as; the remaining Masterdata work to be performed, other Finance Service

and controls over the Finance Service Centre controls including the branch
corrections process. Recruitment is underway for an additional controls analyst
who will work on the other areas in scope.

At the time of our testing we found that nine controls (5.4.a.1-fixed asset, C9.2,j-payroll, C9.2.¢-payroll, Cg.2.r.2-payroll, C9.4.c-payroll, D1.g,b.1-record to report,
D1.to.b.1-record to report, D1.11.e.1-record to report, Ds.12.d.1-record to report) “in remediation” had been implemented without an exception. From the walkthrough
performed of controls in remediation, we believed the risks are appropriately addressed by the remediation plan in place.

We did identify controls which required updating or further clarity. These have been listed in the Appendix.

3.6 Business Continuity & Crisis Management
update

Author: Tim Armit Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13% Sept 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The level of awareness about continuity planning and crisis response continues to
increase. In line with ISO Standards methodology Post Office has a strong
Management System in place which meets our external requirements but gaps exist
across all areas in terms of implementing this system. Priority has been given to
customer facing operational areas, Chesterfield and Supply Chain with all other areas
within scope but of lower priority currently.

Questions this paper addresses

e How resilient are Post Offices’ current business processes, systems and
applications?
e What are the next priority areas to be addressed?

Input Sought

The Committee is requested to note the report.

3.6. Business Continuity

Conclusion

What is the status of business continuity?

1. The last RCC was presented with a high level road map of the status of business
continuity and crisis response. This has now been broken down into more detail
focussing on:

¢ Locations
¢ Business Functions
e IT Systems

2. There are 21 identified key sites, mainly Supply Chain CVIT locations. Each of
these is being visited and the site leaders worked with to agree crisis response
and contingency options. A summary of the sites visited so far, high level findings
and next steps is shown in the appendix below, this is ongoing work. Other keys
sites such as Chesterfield have undergone a relocation exercise which proved the
capability of teams to work in the recovery site successfully. On August 25th
Finsbury Dials tested its capability to work at home with no issues raised and
everyone able to work simultaneously remotely.

3. More detailed work on impacts and risks is required and this is ongoing. Until we
understand the impact of each business area, location and system not being
operational we cannot confirm if our recovery capabilities meet our needs.
Additionally if we do not clearly understand the risks inherent within our
operational environments we can’t confirm we are planning to mitigate for them.
Each site, system and business line will be analysed and reported on, this will be
complete by June 2018. To get to this position each business area and location
will be analysed for the impact it would suffer during an interruption to determine
at what point this impact becomes intolerable. Each location will have the risks
analysed and recovery strategies for all areas agreed. Priorities will be Supply
Chain, Chesterfield, IT systems. Then Banking Framework, Bolton, Finsbury
Dials. All other business areas will then follow.

4. IT Systems are being assessed for impact in conjunction with the IT Department.
IT are to report back to RCC on the impact of the loss of key operational systems
and business continuity are working with them to assess the impact of systems
failures across POL. Detail on this will be in the IT report.

5. Given the dependency on IT systems which is currently being addressed, the
review of each business function will be undertaken following the IT review. It is
planned to have plans for all business functions in place by June 2018. Banking
Framework and other key areas are being worked with but more focus on
business areas will be taken in 2018 in the priority order shown above.

3.6. Business Continuity

6. A spreadsheet listing all three key areas has been produced and every key point is
assessed against the key elements of the ISO standard to measure progress,
these are:

e Impact Analysis

. Risk Analysis

¢ — Recovery Strategies

¢ — Crisis Plans

. Business Continuity Plans
e Testing and Awareness

There are other components including supply chain analysis and plans for branches
that will be included once the basic levels are all in place.

Industrial Action

7. There is a risk that Royal Mail may have industrial action later in 2017. Business
Continuity have worked across Post Office to identify all the points of contact
between Royal Mail and Post Office. Business Continuity have met with a large
cross section of Royal Mail managers to discuss the risk of Industrial Action and
what mitigation and contingencies are in place and can be put in place. This is
ongoing with future meetings planned. It is thought unlikely that any industrial
action will happen before the end of October and it cannot legally happen for at
least 5 weeks.

Executive Declaration, Top Risks and Risk Section for ARA

PAGE 1 OF 7

Author: Richard Williams/Deana Herley Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to share the updates to the top risks and Executive
Declaration results since the RCC in May, and to review the updated Executive
Declaration and risk statements in the Annual Report and Accounts (ARA).

The Top Risks (where red means a rating greater than 3:4 / 4:3) is a summary based
on feedback from all GE members and is a consolidated view across the POL business.
In a number of cases, the scoring is based on factual incidents which have occurred.

The Executive Declaration process enables Group Executive (GE) members to consider
(and attest twice yearly) as a part of year-end procedures, if any additional disclosures
are required to the principal risks to be included in our ARA. The approach to disclosure
as set out in appendices 2 and 3 was collectively agreed by RCC on 4 May 2017.

Our principal risks form a part of the Governance statement in the ARA (see Appendix
5). These are drafted based on the position of top risks agreed by Group Executive
members and are supported by the Executive Declaration process.

Questions this paper addresses

What is the current profile of our top risks?

Why have we re-run the Executive Declaration?

What are the results of the re-run?

Are the Principal Risks as mapped in Appendix 5 the correct risks for inclusion
in the ARA, with descriptions of those risks appropriate?

PYwNP

Conclusion

1. Since May 17, changes to the Top Risks (see Appendix 1) have included the

following;

e We have 13 ‘Top Risks’ (up from 11 in May). Overall our red risk profile has
remained stable due to the aggregated score parity in overall risk movement.

e There are 4 new risks (defined as red rated risks having a score >12) which
have been identified by Finance and Operations through the Placemat “top
down” exercise, 3 being impacting ability to trade covering a) POLSAP
replacement (5/3), b) Agents Pay IT (4/3) and c) Replacement of SAP HR
(4/3) and a further risk covering cash risk (3/4).

e 3 increasing risks relating to impacting ability to trade (5/4 from 4/4), retail
proposition (4/4 from 4/3) and industrial action (4/4 from 4/3).

1 risk, government funding, is no longer deemed a top risk due to agreement
with government to a Network Subsidy Payment to 2020/21 and continued
investment over the period.

1 risk, IT delivery capability has reduced from a 4/4 to a 3/3 due to recent
hires, including CTO and approved IT People Strategy. IT Demand
Management will be insourced from Atos as of 4 September, enabling POL to
better control the demand pipeline.

The people capability and capacity risk has been considered and its rating
deemed acceptable by management, following the challenge from May ARC,
regarding impact of cost reductions with an outcome. We had c.90 reported
vacancies as a result of OSOP and there are now 7 remaining, with steps
being taken to reduce these gaps.

All other risks have remained unchanged.

2. In May, we completed the Executive Declaration exercise to support GE members
in considering (and attesting), if any additional disclosures were required in our
Annual Report, as part of our year-end procedures (Appendices 2 and 3). This
exercise has been rerun in August / September to consider changes, due to delays
in ARA sign off. By doing this now, albeit slightly earlier than usual, we propose to
use the results to replace the half year exercise in September / October, which
would be the usual timeframe.

3. The results from May have been reviewed and updated with GE to give an updated
position (Appendix 4). Since May, changes to the Executive Declaration are as
follows:

4 items have been removed due to no longer being of material significance:

1. Card payment rules are evolving and the cost of processing is rising.
Lower than forecasted impact due fewer card sales.

2, £950m Working Capital Facility. Initiatives in place to ensure
efficient use of our working capital.

3. Net liabilities provision. Various reviews have been completed
considering how we increase net asset provision.
4. Uncertainty over future investment from HMG. Agreement with

government to a Network Subsidy Payment to 2020/21 and
continued investment over the period.

5 new items (3, 7, 8, 9 and 15), 3 relating to fraud losses, 1 relating to IT

Disaster Recovery and 1 relating to Teleco Amortisation.

1 item (11) New Money Laundering Regulations have increased in potential

materiality, with the outcome dependent on consultation with HMRC over

agent scope.

4 items (5, 10, 12 and 17) have decreased in materiality, due to actions

taken to reduce exposure.

7 items have (1, 2, 4, 6, 13, 14 and 16) have remained unchanged.
There are no items of material significance that require specific disclosure in
the ARA. 11 items will be disclosed generically in the risk section of the ARA,
as summarised in Appendix 5.

4. The draft principal risks set out in appendix 5 are those which will appear in the ARA
and have been drafted based on the position of top risks (Appendix 1) and are
supported by the Executive Declaration results (refer to Appendix 4).

Appendix 2 — Materiality

« The items listed in the table below are possible “material” issues or concerns which
have been raised by Executive members for consideration for disclosure.

« Materiality has been defined for the purpose of this exercise as, "qualitatively and/
or quantitatively, as a cut-off point above which something takes on a greater
significance and may require a different course of action”.

e In deciding how to recognise an item as material, Group Executive members are
asked to assess whether it is something that is of a size or impact that would make
a difference to the Post Office or our stakeholders, e.g. influence our decision making,
cause us significant cost or reputational and/ or regulatory damage.

« Defined tipping points of materiality used to assess significance where defined, are
listed below:

Items Tipping Point

RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

5.0 Placemat

Author: Richard Williams/Deana Herley Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

At the end of 2016 it was agreed that Post Office would pilot a self-assessment
methodology to understand management's view of the effectiveness of the internal
risk and control framework. Following the Supply Chain pilot in May, the methodology
(referred to as the ‘Placemat’) has been rolled out, initially, in Finance and Operations
(F&O) and then in Legal, Risk and Governance (LRG) as part of a wider roll out across
PO which is expected to complete by the end of the 2017-18 financial year.

The purpose of this paper is to update the RCC on the status of the Placemat roll out
to date, the results from the F&O and LRG business areas, as well as future plans for
the roll out.

Questions this paper addresses

1. How do you read the Placemat and what is it telling us?

2. How are we driving value from implementing the Placemat?
3. How have we engaged with the business?

4. What are the governance arrangements in “run state”?

5. What is the timing of the wider Placemat delivery?

Conclusion

1. The Placemat has been populated with the results from F&O business area
(Appendix 1). The overall RAG scores have been informed by a “top down” view
of the 34 risks (net) of high importance, mapped to Placemat principal risk types
which now exist for this area (Appendices 1 and 2). As a 2" line function, LRG
mostly oversees and advises on the management of risks that are owned by 1%
line. Without a holistic view of the wider portfolio, it is difficult to give a complete
/ scored “top down” position for LRG at this stage. LRG watchlist risks are set
out in Appendix 3. In the interim, the Placemat for LRG will remain in a position
of “too soon to rate”.

2. The Placemat gives us a single point of reference on risk matters, and a more
meaningful representation of our overall risk picture. The reporting is supported
by both a “top down” and “bottom up” comprehensive identification and
prioritisation of risk.

3. Following completion of the Supply Chain pilot in May, the Placemat approach
was applied to the rest of F&O (15 teams). We have also completed it with LRG

(7 teams). We are joined up with the GDPR, Joiners Movers Leavers, and Legal
and Regulatory Framework project teams.

The Placemat approach helps to establish clearer accountabilities for risk
management across the 3 line of defence. As the roll out completes, operational
management (1st line) will take the lead on reassessment, with Risk and
Assurance (2 line) moving from enabling, to check and challenge. Internal and
External Audit (3° line) will provide independent assurance over the results and
will report as necessary.

During September, we expect to complete the rollout to Government and
Payments Services, the first area within Retail. In parallel, we are engaging with
Telecoms, which will also support their preparation for the ICO PECR audit
planned for January 2018. A full roll out in Retail is proposed by the end of
November. We aim to fully populate the Placemat by the end of the 2017-18
financial year to inform and support annual reporting.

The Report

How do you read the Placemat and what is it telling us?

De

Once fully completed, the Placemat will provide a view of how well the Post Office
as a whole and by each business area is managing the principal risks to the
business. The principal risks listed in the Placemat (Appendix 1) are the main
types of risks that a business is likely to face. The risks in each business area
are mapped to these principal risk types and the effectiveness of existing controls
is assessed. The harm table, which together with a risk matrix (Appendix 4),
underpin the Placemat’s overall RAG scores. The completed Placemat for the F&O
business area is shown in Appendix 1. A consolidated Placemat will be presented
at future meetings, reporting risks by exception in each business area.

So far, for the completed business areas, the Placemat is telling us;

F&O has identified 34 top down risks, converged into the 3 net risk RAG rating
categories and based on the average impact / likelihood (I/L) from the harm-
table scales,

Influencing Factors

Red: 4 (67% of the net red risks), relate to ‘Managing Change’ as a result of the
Back Office programme replacing a fragile PO SAP and HR SAP with CFS and
Success Factors. There are a number of Finance / HRSC processes in scope which
directly drive our numbers.

Amber: 11 (50% of the net amber risks) are assessed at I/L 2:5, with the
concentration of these in Network Operations and an alignment to a
corresponding project either planned or underway. All risks have amber rating
parity in their respective Placemat risk categories.

Green: 3 (50% of the net green risks) are assessed at I/L 5:1 and whilst a green
at PO level, at a local level, have been reflected in the Placemat as Amber.

Refer to Appendix 2 for further detail.

LRG has identified a “bottom up” view of risks and controls at a team level. The
risks identified would not exceed the materiality threshold at a PO wide level. An
effort has been made to build a “top down” view, in order to populate the
Placemat. As a 2° line function, LRG mostly oversees and advises on the
management of risks that are owned by 1° line. Without a holistic view of the
wider portfolio, it is difficult to give a complete / scored “top down” position at
this stage of the roll out. A watchlist of risks is set out in Appendix 3, including:
e Maturity of the culture in PO with regards legal, regulatory and contractual
compliance.
« Regulatory risk arising from increased visibility of PO and POMs to
regulators.
e Ensuring that the compliance framework imposed on us contractually is
viable and deliverable.
e Potential impact of Postmaster litigation on framework of our contractual
relationships with agents.
e Business engagement on GDPR.
« Poor contract management impacting PO financially and reputationally.
e Cyber Threat.
In the interim, the Placemat for LRG will remain in a position of “too soon to
rate”, however this will be reconsidered at each roll out and reassessment.
This is not a one-off exercise. The Placemat results will be reassessed by each
business area quarterly, which will involve the identification of any new risks and
review of current ones. It will also involve closing off risks that are no longer
relevant. This process will be fully scoped and piloted for F&O and LRG during
October, and presented back to the RCC and ARC in November.
At each meeting the paper will set out the movement of principal risks,
commentary on key controls, as well as any mitigating factors, informed by either
a roll out to a new business area or reassessment of an existing business area.
The Placemat process will also inform disclosures in our Annual Report for
2017/18 including: description of principal risks and uncertainties we face; any
concerns regarding going concern based on relevant accounting issues or

material uncertainties; and commentary on our review of risk management and
systems of internal control.

How are we driving value from implementing the Placemat?

14. An effective risk framework helps drive a culture where the implications of
decisions can be discussed explicitly and openly, and employees at all levels
understand how much risk they can take in pursuit of objectives. Whilst some
aspects of the risk framework have been developed, overall it is currently
underdeveloped, delivered on a siloed basis and not enterprise wide in design or
scope.

15. The diagram below highlights, through a series of steps, how the Placemat
deliverables will strengthen our risk framework components. This also illustrates
how the Placemat will standardise and unify what already exists (including group
risk profile, top down risks, risk registers, executive declaration, incident and
assurance reporting) to deliver more value out of it. The focus of activity to date
has been on identifying, prioritising and assessing the severity of risk.

Examples of how the core deliverables of the Placemat are embedding the
principles of sound risk management include:

Risk Governance I + It is designed to provide the Board and ARC with greater confidence

and Culture when discharging accountability of risk taking.
+ Clearer accountabilities and responsibilities for each of the lines of
defence.
+ Will help risk community to be aware of/understand what is strategically
important to the business, and what to watch out for.
+ Pathway to upskilling 1° line of defence in proactively managing risks.
Risk Strategy + Will help risk community to be aware/understand what is strategically
and Objective important to the business, and what to watch out for.
Setting + Standardised tools and techniques have been developed to populate

risk registers which have improved the quality of outputs.

Risk in Execution I + A comprehensive identification and prioritisation of top down risks.
+ Helps to recognise how a lack of, or gaps in controls could be driving
incidents or near misses.

Gives a single point of reference. The insights will help to answer the
question, how broad are the risks we are considering?

How have we engaged with the business?

20.

21,

Following completion of the Supply Chain pilot, the Placemat approach was
applied to the rest of F&O. In parallel, we have also applied the Placemat
approach to LRG. This work has involved approximately 50 workshops and follow
up meetings across 22 teams. We have engaged with GE and Senior Management
to identify “top down” risks and outcomes ensuring that process and outcomes
are aligned. Introductory sessions have also been given to other parts of the
business to get wider feedback and support in preparation for future roll outs.
We are engaging with a number of project teams to remove duplication and
leverage outputs with GDPR, Joiners Movers Leavers and Legal and Regulatory
Framework.

What are the governance arrangements in “run state”?

22.

Accountabilities in the “run state” will be split between the 3 lines of defence. In
the “run state” 1* line will take the lead, with 2" line moving from enabling to
check and challenge. The 3" line will provide independent assurance on the
results.

What is the timing of the wider Placemat delivery?

23.

During September, we will complete the Placemat rollout with Government and
Payments Services, with a full delivery of Retail proposed by the end of
November. In parallel, we will complete with Telecoms, prioritised to support the
business’s preparedness for ICO PECR audit planned for January 2018. We aim
to fully populate the Placemat by the end of the 2017-18 financial year with PO-
wide reporting brought to the May RCC and ARC.

need to have two approaches and to align them.

Risk Rating User Guide

‘The overall Risk Rating is calculated using a weighted average of risk that is considered appropriate, recognising that the applied rating is subjective,
and is based on the following

Impact - if risk exists, based on the harm table, what impact could this have on the business?

Likelihood - while risk by nature is inevitable, based on the harm table, what is the likelihood of this particular risk appearing in practice?
Combined score - takes the Impact Risk x Likelihood to calculate a combined score

Controls - weighting of controls to mitigate the perceived risk

Overall RAG - Residual Risk is the combined score divided by the mitigating controls

NB: Residual risk is the threat that remains after identified risks have not been eliminated by compensating controls. For each risk recorded, the Committee should determine and agree
whether to make plans to reduce it, avoid it, accept or transfer it.

PAPER

Post Office Legal and Regulatory
Framework

Author: Ben Foat Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

Post Office Limited (Post Office) is a multiline business operating across numerous
sectors including Financial Services, Telecoms, Retail, Government Services, and Mails
with a significantly unionised work force and, as a result of its public ownership, is
also subject to additional public sector legal obligations such as public procurement
rules. The Post Office is also directly or indirectly subject to numerous regulators
including HMRC, FCA, CMA, ICO, and OFCOM. As a distributor of a vast array of
products and services, it manages over 1,700 commercial contracts, thousands of
employment contracts, property licences and instruments, and hundreds of disputes
and complaints, all of which are generally underpinned by legislation and regulation.
Consequently, the legal risk across the POL group is broad and complex.

The ARC is to receive training prior to the next ARC meeting on Post Office’s
legislative and regulatory framework.

This report sets out, in draft, the legal and regulatory framework under which Post
Office operates and suggests who, within the business, is responsible for managing
compliance with those pieces of legislation and regulation. It solely focuses on the
material and most frequently encountered laws and is by no means exhaustive. This
work will be incorporated into broader discussions around accountability within the
business.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What are the material and most frequently encountered laws?

2. Who is responsible for ensuring compliance with legislation and regulation?

3. How are new legal trends and developments applicable to Post Office managed?
4. What do we need to do next to progress?

Conclusion

1. Appendix 1 is an overview matrix which sets out the top 48 material and most
frequently encountered pieces of legislation and suggests which GE member is

accountable or responsible, from a first line of defence perspective, for ensuring
compliance with those laws.

2. Appendix 2 provides a more comprehensive outline of those laws which are rated

‘red’ or ‘amber’ in terms of materiality (see paragraph 6 below), as well as the
known controls and the evidence of such controls.

3. The Legal Team identifies new legal trends and developments through its

Regulatory Developments Tracker (Horizon Scanning). Any new or proposed
material changes to laws and regulation is communicated to the relevant parts of
the business as well as being communicated through the cross functional Law and
Trends Forum. Working groups are then set up to further assess the impact of the
new or material changes and implement those changes within the business.

4. Further refinements to Appendix 1 and 2 will be made incorporating the feedback

from the RCC specifically any clarifications over which parts of the business are
responsible or accountable from a first line of defence perspective.

The Report

What are the material and most frequently encountered laws?
5. There are hundreds of pieces of legislation and regulation that apply to Post Office.
Appendix 1 and 2 sets out the most material and most frequently encountered
laws at Post Office.
6. A RAG status has been adopted to differentiate materiality on the following basis:
« Red - where there is potential individual criminal sanctions and or personal
liability for Board / GE;

« Amber - where there is significant sanctions including corporate criminal offence
or significant penalty (without individual sanctions);

« Green - where there is typical sanctions (e.g fines)

Who is responsible for ensuring compliance with legislation and regulation?

7. As set out in the Appendices, we have allocated ‘Accountability’ for each piece of
legislation to key GE sponsors, and indicated who else is ‘responsible’ for
compliance at an operating level.

8. As Post Office’s risk management framework matures, we will be able to address
this more fully through the 3 lines of defence risk management model. In
summary:

¢ first line - functions that own and manage risk

« second line - functions that oversee or specialise in risk management,
compliance (ie Legal, Compliance, Risk, etc)

«third line - functions that provide independent assurance e.g internal audit.

15t Line of Defence Se _ I

9. Post Office’ second line capability is still relatively immature and the distinction
between first and second line responsibilities needs further articulation.

Nevertheless as the ‘placemat’ control effectiveness self-assessment work is rolled
out across Post Office, this will facilitate a greater awareness of first line
responsibilities, as well as enable the development of more mature 2" line
oversight capability.
10.Accordingly, Appendix 1 provides an overview matrix which seeks to delineate
accountability (ownership of risk) and responsibility (those who need to comply
with requirements or follow direction from the accountable owner within their area
of responsibility). For example, it is proposed that Jane MacLeod (Group Legal,
Risk & Governance Director) is accountable for the Bribery & Corruption Act (as the
Financial Crime team specify the controls to be operated to best prevent bribery).
However, all areas of the business are responsible for ensuring its compliance
through enforcing internal controls such as the Gifts & Entertainment Policy in
respect of their areas within the business).
.It is also proposed that, by way of example, Al Cameron (Chief Finance &
Operations Officer) is accountable for public procurement but all areas of the
business are responsible for ensuring that they comply with the internal controls
set out by him through the Procurement Director, Barbara Brannon. In the
overview matrix, R denotes responsibility and A denotes accountability.
12.Appendix 2 provides more detailed descriptions of those pieces of legislation rated
as ‘red’ or ‘amber’. Details of green rated legislation have also been prepared, and
are available from the legal team on request.

How are new legal trends and developments relevant to Post Office managed?

13.The Legal Team is responsible for identifying new and emerging areas of legal risk.
On a monthly basis it identifies new legal trends and developments through its
Regulatory Developments Tracker (Horizon Scanning). Some areas of the business
also maintain horizon scanning specific to their area. Any new or proposed material
changes to laws and regulation is communicated to the relevant parts of the
business as well as being communicated through the Law and Trends Forum which
has representatives across the business. The Law and Trends Forum enables
alignment across the business. Working groups are then established in relation to
material new pieces of legislation, consisting of relevant stakeholder, to further
assess the impact and provide recommendations in respect of any changes to
existing internal or management controls.

What do we need to do next to progress?

14.Following the feedback from the RCC, Appendix 1 and 2 will be updated and be
sent to the Strategy Team who are working on the broader issues of
accountabilities within the organisation. These documents may also serve as a
useful tool for those involved in SMCR project.

Executive Summary

Context

As a business in receipt of public funds POL is bound by the Public Contract
Regulations (2015). PCR 2015 oblige POL to behave in a fair, objective & transparent
way when contracting with 3™ party suppliers. Additionally, set procedures must be
followed for spend above £25k and £164,500k (total contract value).

Failure to abide by the legislation or “slicing and dicing” contracts exposes POL to risk,
both as far the commercial outcomes of the contracts as well as the reputational
damage, legal remedies, censure & fines that can follow the discovery of a breach.
Our compliance to PCR can be requested under a Freedom of Information request at
any time.

The PCR Compliance Register allows for the tracking of breaches to PCR regulations at
the Post Office and internal governance processes. One aim of collating this
information is to drive improvement in awareness and compliance behaviour across
the organisation. The second and primary aim is to work with GE and Business Units
to commence commercial reviews in a more timely way ensuring POL obtains value,
commercial and contractual flexibility fitting the requirements and business strategy
of the organisation.

Questions addressed in this paper

1. How many and what types of procurement non-compliance have occurred in the
past quarter?
Since January 2017 there have been a total of 28 non-compliant incidents, 23
of which are direct awards in breach of PCR regulations documented by the
Procurement Team. The remaining 5 are in breach of internal governance but
not of PCR regulations. Minor breaches are often captured after an external
commitment is made when invoices are presented for payment but in the main,
these tend to be of low value and risk and are reducing in frequency.

6.2. Procurement Compliance Reporting

One non-compliant incident in particular skews these numbers, jess! [revenue]
against a 12 month extension of the Global Payments contract.

Global Payments has become non-compliant on a technicality of PCR, in that
the value of the contract now exceeds that which was advertised during a fully
compliant process. A legal review has deemed the remaining 24 month contract
extension period to be low risk and Procurement and Retail are actively working

on the strategy for re-Procurement in due course. represents the
expected revenue for the next period and a furthe forecast for the
final period of the contract as we go through the award process for the new
contract.

2. What are the potential consequences?

a. Pre-contractual remedies overview: During a Procurement, an aggrieved
party can seek an interim injunction suspending the tender or the
implementation until the court decides on an outcome.

b. Post-contractual remedies: The court can order an ‘ineffectiveness order’
rendering the contract void &/or can award damages.

3. Why are these incidents occurring, and what can be done about it?
Non-compliant awards are made for a variety of reasons at the Post Office.

a) Low value, time constrained or highly sensitive/specialist engagements
are common. For example, the Board have requested a number of
expedited reviews since the New Year on a short turn-around time.
Large commercial arrangements cannot often be easily competed or
unravelled without operational impact, and re-procurement may be
subject to a pending evolution of a supporting Business Strategy.

c) The contractual arrangements may pre-date PCR 2015 regulations or the
contract novated during separation from RMG, automatically becoming
non-compliant at the renewal point. Non-compliant awards are frequently
made on a tactical basis to extend contractual services while public
tender processes are executed.

Delays to public sector panels of suppliers becoming available. The Post
office makes extensive use of this low cost route to market and
new/refreshed panels are subject to frequent delays from Crown
Commercial Services. Interim extensions [of periods under 12 months]
while tender processes are run are considered to be low risk legally.
Changes in scope or value over the term of a contract may render the
extension or renewal of services non-compliant. Material changes to the
scope of a contract may render the whole contract non-compliant.

f) Disregard for, or lack of understanding of the regulations.

6.2. Procurement Compliance Reporting

4. Why are we receiving this report now?
A decision to collate this information into a single location was taken in the
Autumn of 2016. The aim is to track and improve our overall compliance and
commercial results as an organisation, while also ensuring perceptions are
accurate. However it should be noted that it will facilitate timely responses to
Freedom of Information requests which adds risk to the Post Office commercial
landscape.

Conclusion

Non-compliant awards of contracts are already subject to extensive internal
governance, legal and risk review, explicit GE and Board approval where value/risks
reach a minimum threshold.

The YTD non-compliance value is potentially very high at "I due to the Bank
of Ireland and the Global Payments.extensions. A more realistic figure illustrating a
typical run rate however is VANT:. Individually, all large value non-compliant
contracts have been reviewed by appropriate Post Office governance forums with
agreement on next steps and actions towards remediation allocated where appropriate.

Executive support towards moving POL towards a more compliant footing is very strong,
but equally as important there is extensive support towards the cultural change required
to ensure that Procurement activities and outcomes will support longer term business
strategies and we reduce commercial risk making our 3" party arrangements fit for
purpose.

Input Sought

Review and note content only. Please advise of any suggested improvements or
additional information required for the next quarter and whether this forum is an
appropriate one to receive a forward “look ahead” of 3" party contracts with pending
PCR issues.

6.2. Procurement Compliance Reporting

The Report

1. Are any of these breaches arguable on regulatory grounds or are they all
breaches?

A full explanation of the individual compliance breaches is attached in Appendix 1.
Each entry details the nature of, and the value of the breach.

The Procurement Compliance Register does not at present give an indicative risk
level attached to the award. This information is provided to the accountable
executives under internal governance processes in the form of a PCR risk note before
a contract above threshold is entered into, and if necessary under Legal Privilege.
In addition, all signatories to a contract have sight of the Risk note as part of the
Contract Authorisation Form [CAF].

All entries are compliance breaches. A period of challenge applies to each PCR breach
once an aggrieved party becomes aware or ought to have become aware. This risk
finally expires at 6 years from the date of breach. The defensibility of a legal
challenge is outlined within a Risk Note.

2. How many of the breaches were approved in advance and how many
retrospectively?
Nine contracts were entered into during this period without compliance to internal

governance processes on contract and commercial review. All were for awards of
between £0 and £50,000.

3. Why were the approvals given?
The rationale for approval is relevant to the individual service and is detailed within
Appendix 1.

4. What were the unapproved, material breaches?
There were no unapproved, material breaches during this period.

5. Describe the causes of non-compliance to PCR regulations
Non-compliant awards of contract are made for a variety of reasons at the Post
Office:

a) Low value, time constrained or highly sensitive/specialist engagements are
common. For example, the Board have requested a number of expedited
reviews since the New Year on a short turn-around time.

b) Large commercial arrangements cannot often be easily competed or
unravelled without operational impact, and re-procurement may be subject
to a pending evolution of a supporting Business Strategy.

c) The contractual arrangements may pre-date PCR 2015 regulations or the
contract novated during separation from RMG, automatically becoming non-
compliant at the renewal point. Non-compliant awards are frequently made

6. Describe what you are doing about the breaches. Where we are in breach, do we
have a plan to come back into compliance and over what time period will that
plan take effect?

a) A forward view of material contracts falling under each Business Unit is
currently prepared by the relevant Procurement Manager for discussions with
their key stakeholders. The maturity of this look ahead view does vary
currently and is a high priority activity within the team.

Sourcing options papers are prepared for review by contract managers and

key stakeholders [risk, legal, security] with routes to market agreed. In many

cases these are dependent on evolving business and operating model
strategies and the Procurement team are now actively involved with some
units helping to advise as thinking evolves.

c) Where a non-compliant award is proposed due to time pressure, Procurement

are actively working on long term mitigation with awards made on an interim

basis where possible.

Each RCC member will now receive a regular report on compliance within

their business unit[s].

A new Risk & Governance process requires a Risk Exception report to be

created for non-compliant direct awards with SLT or GE sign off.

f) All Professional Services engagements must be approved in writing in
advance by the COO. A compliant panel of preferred consulting partners has
been appointed and proposed engagements outside of this panel are subject
to additional review and challenge.

g) Procurement will now provide training as part of the revised Induction process
for new staff. Training packs are being updated for existing staff and made
available on the Intranet and ad hoc training sessions for interested Business
Units are being run.

h) A new Intranet site has been launched for Procurement to improve visibility of
process, regulation, and the panels of approved compliant suppliers available
to POL business units.

i) A revised POL Procurement Policy is being drafted giving more granular
guidance.

j) Panels of Preferred Suppliers are being refreshed and updated across a wide
range of spend categories to reduce time to market, improve compliance and
greatly improve commercial outcomes and legal risk.

k) A planned change to operational systems will, once Live, give Procurement
earlier visibility of potential compliance issues eg: contractual value
thresholds.

RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE INFORMATION
PAPER

6.3 Criminal Finances Act
Update

Author: Ben Foat Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The Criminal Finances Act 2017 (Act) comes into force on 30 September 2017 and
introduces a new corporate offence of failing to prevent the facilitation of UK and
foreign criminal tax evasion. The penalty for non-compliance is a criminal corporate
offence and potentially unlimited fine.

Post Office Limited (Post Office) applies a zero tolerance policy to criminal tax evasion
and the criminal facilitation of criminal tax evasion as set out in its Financial Crime
Policy. It is committed to preventing such facilitation within all parts of the business.

This Act was identified by the Legal Team via the Regulatory Developments Tracker
and communicated to the business through the Law & Trends Forum. A cross

functional working group was consequently set up to manage the new obligations
imposed by the Act.

Questions addressed in this report

1. What does the Act stipulate and what are the consequences of non-compliance?
. How does it apply to Post Office?

. What have we done?

. Who is accountable?

. What do we need to do next to progress?

UBWN

Conclusion

1. The Act provides that it is a criminal offence where a relevant body, such as Post
Office, fails to prevent an associated person from criminally facilitating criminal tax
evasion of another. Consequently, Post Office must implement reasonable and
proportionate procedures to prevent its associated persons from criminally
facilitating criminal tax evasion of another person. The penalty of non-compliance
is a criminal corporate offence as well as a potentially unlimited fine.

2. It has a broad application to Post Office as the Act applies to all associated persons
including employees, postmasters/agents, suppliers, contractors and consultants.

3. A working group has been set up to advise the business of the enhancements
needed to existing systems and implementations necessary (to prevent criminal
tax evasion and its facilitation) to ensure that Post Office can avail itself of the
“reasonable procedures” defence. For example, Post Office has introduced new
obligations on our postmaster agents, contractors and suppliers to ensure that
they (and their associated persons) comply with the requirements of the Act.

4. The relevant business areas are responsible for implementing the recommended
reasonable precautions (from a first line of defence). Legal and Financial Crime
together with the working group are responsible for second line of defence risk
management.

5. The working group will continue to progress its implementation plan including
assessing due diligence processes, support with communication as well as
providing recommendations regarding ongoing monitoring and review to ensure
Post Office complies with the Act.

The Report
What does the Act require?

Post Office applies a zero tolerance policy to criminal tax evasion and the criminal
facilitation of criminal tax evasion as set out in its Financial Crime Policy. It is
committed to preventing such facilitation within all parts of the business.

Purpose of the Act

The Act is intended to tackle money laundering and corruption, recover the proceeds
of crime and counter terrorist financing. The Act introduces two new corporate
offences of failure to prevent facilitation of tax evasion (criminal UK tax evasion and
foreign tax evasion) and amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and anti-terrorism
legislation. This Report focuses on the new “failure to prevent” offence.

Offence

In summary, a relevant body (Post Office) may be prosecuted for the “failure to
prevent” offence if an associated person (employees, postmasters/agents, suppliers,
contractors or any other person acting for or on behalf of Post Office) criminally
facilitates either a UK or foreign criminal tax evasion committed by another person.
The aim of these offences is to hold relevant bodies (companies and partnerships) to
account for its associated persons where criminal facilitation is committed in respect
of criminal tax evasion offence by another.

There must be both criminal tax evasion by a third party and criminal facilitation by
the associated person. If the associated person only accidentally, ignorantly or
negligently facilitated tax evasion, or tax evasion had only arisen accidentally,
ignorantly, negligently or there is no criminal tax evasion but instead tax avoidance,
then the “failure to prevent” offence is not committed by the relevant body.

Reasonable Procedures Defence

It will be a defence for Post Office to show that it had reasonable procedures in place
to prevent such facilitation, or that it was not reasonable to expect it to have such
procedures. The HMRC Draft Guidance of October 2016 notes that the Act does not
hold relevant bodies to account for their customers’ tax crimes or require the relevant
body to prevent customers from committing tax evasion. Its purpose is to encourage
businesses not to turn a blind eye to instances where their associated persons have
deliberately assisted another person to evade tax.

The question of reasonableness is to be determined by the context or surrounding
circumstances. The draft HMRC Guidance also recognises that the “reasonable
procedures” defence is both risk-based and proportionate and so the regime cannot
be a zero failure regime. It suggests that businesses follow a similar approach under
the Bribery Act:

1. Risk assessment

Sriminal Finances Act
POST OFFICE PAGE 4 OF 6
2. Proportionality of risk-based prevention procedures
3. Top-level commitment
4. Due Diligence
5. Communication (including training)

6. Monitoring and Review
Whilst there is no previous case law on this new offence, the tone of the Guidance and
the experience to date of prosecution and deferred prosecutions under the Bribery Act
underline that its aim is to target those who deliberately turn a blind eye to
wrongdoings and ignore what is happening within their businesses.

How does it apply to Post Office?

The working group identified 3 areas which present the highest risk to Post Office:

1. Agent/postmaster network
2. Contractors
3. Suppliers

Example -

If a postmaster deliberately and dishonestly facilitated (e.g. aided and abetted by
being actively involved) in deliberate and dishonest tax evasion of a UK tax by a UK
tax payer (e.g. postmaster assistants, staff, customer) and both are proven beyond
reasonable doubt where Post Office cannot show that it had put in place reasonable
procedures (or that these would not have been reasonable to have) to prevent such
facilitation by its agents/postmasters then Post Office will be liable and subject to a
criminal corporate offence with a financial penalty.

Employees, such as those in procurement, may also present a risk because of the
nature of their job and the pressures that will undoubtedly often arise on timing and
cost of procuring services.

What have we done?

A cross functional working group consisting of Legal, Financial Crime, HR, Finance &
Ops, Procurement and Retail is working through how Post Office can avoid failure to
prevent criminal facilitation of criminal tax evasion by ensuring that it implements
proportionate and reasonable procedures as follows:

Key Areas of Risk Reasonable Procedures
Agent/Postmaster Network 1. Existing postmasters will receive Guidance
(imposing contractual terms) into their
contracts to ensure that they comply with
requirements of the Act and Post Office’s
obligations regarding the prevention and
detection of tax evasion and preventing the
facilitation of tax evasion (including an

obligation to report any suspicion of criminal
facilitation or criminal tax evasion).

. Standard postmaster contracts used for new

postmasters to be updated to reflect new
obligations.

. Payments Policy for all postmasters has been

revised to ensure ongoing checks of bank
accounts matching postmaster’s bank details in
the contract.

. Review of postmaster on-boarding process is

planned.

. Any failure to comply with the new contractual

terms and/or the Criminal Finances Act could
result in immediate termination of the contract.

Contractors

. Deed of Variation to the contract with Sopra

Steria (Post Office’s supplier of contractors) has

individual contractors) comply with the
requirements of the Act and Post Office’s
obligations regarding the prevention and

Who is accountable?

All business areas are accountable for ensuring compliance with the Act in
respect of their own activities:

e Retail is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act in
respect of the agent network.

e Finance & Ops is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act
in respect of suppliers.

e HR is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act in respect of
employee.

The Legal and Financial Crime Team together with the working group provide
2"4 line of defence risk management.

What do we need to do next?

The working group continues to progress the implementation plan, working with
different parts of the business to implement the recommended enhancements to
ensure Post Office can avail itself of the reasonable procedures defence.

This work will include:

1. further examination of the due diligence conducted within the organisation
(including the on-boarding of those that could be categorised as associated
persons);

2. implementation of reasonable procedures;

3. roll out of communication across the organisation (including the agency
network) and to targeted groups of Post Office’s zero tolerance approach to
criminal tax evasion and criminal facilitation; and

4. recommendations on how Post Office will conduct ongoing monitoring and

Author: Johann Appel Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 13 September 2017

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to update the Committee on the PO Internal Audit activity
and key outcomes. This includes details of the work completed since the last Risk and
Compliance Committee (RCC) in July and progress on the 2017/18 Internal Audit Plan.

Questions this paper addresses

e Is the Internal Audit Plan on track? What progress has been made since the July
RCC meeting?

« What progress is being made with completion of audit actions?

« Have any significant issues arisen that the committee should be aware of?

Conclusion
1. Progress against plan:

Delivery of the 2017/18 audit plan is well underway. We have finalised two reviews,
with a further four currently in draft report stage and three audits in fieldwork.
Particular emphasis is placed on timely audit planning and as a consequence 12 reviews
are currently being scoped for delivery between September and January. Early
engagement with the business in the planning phase is proving to result in a more
effective audit process. Current progress against plan is as follows:

The Report

4. Changes to Plan since July RCC meeting

We have made one change to the audit schedule. We have agreed with management
that it would be premature to review the Cyber Security controls given that the
Security Transformation project is still ongoing and there are still actions outstanding
from the 2016 Information Security review. The Cyber Security (Phase 1) review
planned for August was therefore replaced with a follow-up of the 2016 Information
Security review. An audit of Cyber Security will be considered in Q4.

The remainder of the 2017/18 plan will be refreshed during October to ensure that it
is aligned with Post Office’s changing risk profile and that the remaining audits on the
plan are still relevant. Information obtained from the ongoing work on the risk
‘placemat’ will be a key consideration during the refresh of the audit plan.

5. Internal Audit Reviews Completed

Since the May ARC meeting we have completed an audit of the VAT Process as well as
an advisory review of the IT Controls Framework. Our findings and observations are
summarised below:

Audit Key Messages

VAT Process & Controls

(Reported at July RCC, but still to be reported to ARC.)
(Ref. 2017/18-02)

This audit has found that generally POL manages its VAT affairs
effectively. The tax team are consulted on a regular basis and
are involved in the decision making process to ensure that VAT
is applied and managed correctly. VAT risk is managed
proactively and the controls in place operate effectively. POL
has a good relationship with HMRC as evidenced through
transparent communication and documentation.

The following control weaknesses were reported:

« There was no documented tax strategy, governance and

Audit actions: control framework. Incomplete documentation of tax

processes was identified by HMRC prior to this internal audit

La 3 - this was disclosed to the ARC and remedial actions are

P2 3 underway.

P3 4 « VAT processes and controls are not well documented and is

Total 7 to a large extent reliant on the knowledge and experience
of the two individuals in the VAT team, both who are
leaving the business imminently. The delay in finding a
suitable replacement may adversely impact the proper
handover of the process and transfer of knowledge.
Update: A replacement VAT manager was appointed and
handover has taken place.

* Some known system and process issues require ongoing
manual intervention to ensure compliant VAT treatment.
The manual adjustments are generally low in value,
however, makes for an inefficient process.

Advisory —

Highlight Report

As agreed with the ARC and with management, Internal Audit
participated in the ITCF project in an advisory role, contributing
expertise of IT risk, IT controls and COBIT 5 knowledge to ensure
the outcome of the programme is fit for purpose.

Overall IA observed that for the 11 processes in scope, progress
has been made in benchmarking the processes against COBIT
and identifying controls and process steps which need to be in
place to ensure operational risks stay within the risk appetite.
However, there is some risk to the project and further work to
be done before the ITCF will be ready to be implemented and
rolled out for self-assessment:

« Based on the current status of the programme we believe the
original timeline will not be met. Phase 3 (remediation) is still
ongoing, having slipped from its June deadline. Management
need to revisit the overall project timeline.

« Further improvements have been suggested to ensure control
descriptions and remediation plans are clear and mitigate
identified risks.

7.2 Camelot Audit Lessons Learned
Author: Keith Maple Sponsor: Kevin Gilliland Meeting date: 13 September 17

Overview

This describes the background to an issue identified with the reporting of the Lottery prize
audit, summarises lessons learnt and the actions taken to prevent reoccurrence.

Questions

1. What is the background?

2. What was the issue?

3. What lessons have we learnt?

4. What actions have been taken to prevent a repeat?

Conclusions

1. Background

As part of the Post Office/ Camelot National Lottery Retailer Agreement prize monies are
paid out by branches for winning tickets. POL hold a unique position in that outside of
Camelot they are the only entity that can pay out lottery winning prizes of up to £50,000.

The Gambling Commission have increased pressure on Camelot over the past 12 months
to improve compliance with the rules governing the payment of lottery prizes. Camelot
have in turn trialled a series of KPIs/Service measures focused on the accuracy of the
payment process, monitored via an audit process and with a view to eventually making
them contractual obligations. These audits were trialled over a 6 month period from the
final quarter of 2016.

Camelot randomly select 100 winning tickets a quarter for POL to check, ostensibly by
desk audit, that each element of the required payment process has been completed. The
audit covers various elements of the payment process including obtaining the name and
address of the winner, reconciliation of the payment to Horizon and whether the ticket
had been voided in line with Camelot requirements. Audit results are then given to
Camelot.

2. What was the issue?

After a change in the management of the Retail team and a review of the audit operation,
it was discovered that POL had been mis-declaring the ‘true’ results of the audits to
Camelot. This was immediately brought to the attention of the RCC.

POL00423693

Damelot Lessons Learned

POST OFFICE PAGE 2 OF 2

It must be emphasised that there was no contractual obligation to undertake these
audits or to report their results to Camelot.

The audit of the winning tickets reviews whether the prize values are recorded
accurately, that the claimant’s name and address are recorded in full and match the
Horizon receipt and that a signature has been obtained. There should also be evidence
of confirmation that the receiver was over 16, and that each winning ticket was
effectively voided, as paid, in the designated area.

The audit of February 2017 indicated that only 23% of the winning tickets met all of
the audit’s requirements. If the results of the audit excluded tickets that had only
failed by not being voided correctly, the success rate increased to 81%.

Members of the previous Retail team (who are no longer with the business) chose to
declare audit results that excluded tickets where the only criteria they failed on was a
failure to void. Camelot were never made aware of this omission and as such the
success rate of the audit was falsified.

3. What lessons have been learnt?

The audit of the winning tickets was carried out in the manner agreed by POL and
Camelot. The audit results were manipulated to inflate the level of success and an
express direction given to send them to Camelot. This occurred because of a possible
integrity issue rather than a failure of the controls that are in place. There was no
need for sign off at a higher level within POL before they were sent to Camelot. A
programme in branch to re-emphasise the process of winning ticket payments has
been introduced with visual aids, communications and a pending change to the
Horizon screen to promote the requirement to void winning tickets.

4. What action has been taken to prevent a repeat?

Two courses of action were immediately initiated. The current Retail team identified
the root cause/control failures and at same time the Internal Audit team were
engaged.

It was considered by the latter that the Retail team appeared to have established the
facts of the matter and identified the root cause / control failures. It was their belief
that Internal Audit would not add any more value by reviewing the facts pertinent to
this issue but will assess the design effectiveness of the remedial controls
implemented. The internal audit is currently in progress and results will be reported at
the November RCC and ARC meetings. Other actions:

1. The results of future quarterly audits will be signed off by the relevant Product
Manager and the Head of Retail propositions. An additional ‘independent’ sign
off will be undertaken by Finance or Internal Audit

2. Camelot also reserve the right to undertake their own audits of the POL audit
process/results and these will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.

The Report

Why do we need to review this policy?
1. The policy was last reviewed and approved by the R&CC in July 2016. The terms
of the policy require it be reviewed annually

What changes to the policy do we propose and why?
What are the key features that we propose and why?

2. The policy template and format has been redesigned. This helps ensure that the
purpose, core principles and impacts are understood. It sets out clear minimum
control standards and responsibilities for application of those standards, and has
been updated to reflect the new money laundering regulations.

3. Key changes include:

« We have included updates to reflect recent changes in regulations and laws
that are applicable. We have also included the sources of industry guidance
available in order to provide greater clarity.

« We have updated the policy framework and the key linked and associated
policies to provide greater clarity to individuals and stakeholders.

« In line with regulatory requirements we have placed the completion and
maintenance of financial crime risk assessments at the heart of the policy.

« A new section has been included setting out the key offences under the
regulations and their potential consequences to both the group and members
of staff.

« The General Counsel is now responsible for oversight of the MLRO and the
group’s compliance with regulatory obligations.

« We have highlighted the regulatory requirements in relation to data retention.
4. Risk Assessment methodology and Product Information Packs that have been
developed over the last 12 months are now referenced for the first time.

5. A new section has been included clearly mapping minimum control standards,
responsibilities and timescales.

How did we develop these recommendations?

6. The policy has been developed by reviewing recent legislation changes including
the Criminal Finance Act 2017 and the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and
Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 and the Criminal
Finances Act 2017.

7. Policy queries and issues that have arisen over the previous 12 months have been
reviewed to ensure that these concerns are addressed, including risk assessment
work undertaken since July 2016 and the HMRC supervisory audit undertaken
since February 2016.

AML & CTF

What are the implications of these changes?

What will we need to do and by when, to implement and embed these policy changes?

8. Internal communications and training - once the policy has been approved, there
will be a One communication to advise all employees of the changes and provide a
link to the updated document on the Post Office Intranet.

9. Over the past few months the following communications have been issued to the
network provide further support and guidance on the following issues: Gift Card
Fraud (June), Completion of SARs (June), AML/CTF Training (July), recording ID
numbers correctly for bureau transactions (August). We are scheduled to issue
further guidance on the completion and submission of SARs in September. If any
instances of non-conformance are identified additional training or communications
will be issued on a risk sensitive basis.

10.Via EUM, the Financial Crime Team will be able to ensure that only those agents
and staff who have completed their initial or annual renewal training will be
allowed access to Horizon systems. Any customer facing or back office staff or
agents who fail to complete their training within the first 30 days of joining or at
annual renewal will be reported to relevant management for their review and
escalation as required. The Financial Crime Team will undertake periodic
compliance testing and report on conformance to the R&CC.

11.As part of the wider Product Manager training (being provided by Cranfield School
of Management), a series of workshops for product managers in Financial Services
& Telecoms and Retail will be run by the Financial Crime Team during the second
half of 2017/18 to provide training on ‘business as usual’ risk assessment
methodology and use of the Product Information Pack and Risk Assessment Tool.

12.The Risk Assessment Tool for new products and services currently available on the
Post Office Intranet is being enhanced, and when completed during Q3 2017/18, a
communication will be sent to product managers with revised guidelines. It is not
anticipated that any additional training will be required as this is an existing tool,
but will be offered if required.

13.The Financial Crime team will monitor adherence to the minimum control
standards set out in the policy on an on-going basis through their review of risk
assessments, project business readiness and incidents. Any control gaps identified
will be reported to the R&CC as required.

14.As part of our annual training obligations, AML/CTF training will be updated to
reflect the new policy and regulatory requirements.

What will the impact be on our wider business?

15.While significant progress has been made over the last 18 months, and a number
of high risk products and services have been formally assessed and documented,
the identification through documented risk assessment of potential or inherent and
residual Financial Crime risks is not yet mature across the business and more
needs to be done culturally to embed the methodology. The introduction of the
Product Manager workshops will enhance compliance with this area.

16.As part of the roll out of the ‘placemat’ control self-assessment methodology, all
business units will be required to ensure that they consider financial crime risks in
their area when developing their own Risk and Controls Matrix. It is expected that
the roll out of the ‘placemat’ methodology will be complete by end 2017/18.

What ¥ 1@ impact be of di a al?

17. Post Office Limited is required to maintain up to date policies to support
contractual requirements with clients and suppliers (e.g. MoneyGram and the
Partner Banking Framework) and failure to do so may result in a breach of
contract, and whilst not material, could have commercial and reputational impacts.

18.Post Office Limited is required to maintain up to date policies under its regulatory
obligations, and failure to do so may lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.

19.Post Office Limited provides Post Office Management Services with its policies suite
in the form of “Group Policies”. POMS is required under its regulatory responsibility
to the Financial Conduct Authority to have up to date policies and failure to do so
may lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.

products for money laundering or terrorist financing is prevented, and the
highest standards of financial crime prevention, detection and management
are maintained.

Risk & Compliance Committee meeting-13/09/17

POL-BSFF-0238511_0139
1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the design and
monitoring of controls to prevent or deter Financial Crime which includes Anti Money
Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF). Financial Crime is an agenda
item for the Audit and Risk committees and the Post Office Board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
design and implementation of controls to prevent or deter Money Laundering and Terrorist
Financing throughout the Group!. It is one of a set of policies which provide a clear risk
and governance framework and an effective system of internal control for the mitigation
of risk across the Group. Compliance with these policies supports the Group in meeting
its business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders, employees? and other
stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing are criminal offences and everyone working in
the business has a personal obligation to prevent them taking place. The governance
arrangements described in this Policy are based upon the following core principles:

« Post Office has devised a robust Policy and associated procedures (set out in this
document) which are proportionate to the risks and complexity of the Group;

« The Group ensures that its policies reflect the principles of the AML and CTF
regulations and legislation;

* The Group's overall and ongoing risk management process includes a risk based
assessment of the financial crime risks to which the Group and its business are
exposed, and the quality of its AML and CTF controls and monitoring;

«The Group undertakes a training and awareness program to ensure employees are
aware of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, what they should
do if they are suspicious, and the consequences should they fail to comply with the
law;

« The Group promotes ethical and professional standards to prevent it from being
used, intentionally or unintentionally by criminals;

« Decisions taken by management are consistent with the Board’s approved strategic
objectives and Risk Appetite;

« Every member of staff is responsible for understanding and managing the risks
they take on behalf of the Group;

“In this policy “Post Office” and “Group” mean Post Office Limited and Post Office Management Services Ltd
In this policy “employee” means permanent staff, temporary including agency staf, contractors, consultants and anyone else

working for or on behalf of Post Office.

8.1. AML & CTF

e Clear accountabilities are delegated by management to staff who have the right
level of skill, competency and experience;

« All employees are required to comply with Group Policies.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all areas within the Group and defines the minimum standards
to control financial loss, customer impact, regulatory breaches and reputational damage
in line with the Group’s Risk Appetite.

In exceptional circumstances, where risk sits outside of the Group’s accepted Risk
Appetite, a Risk Exception can be granted. For further information in relation to the risk
exception process please see the Risk Exception process found here.

While Post Office does not tolerate events that are criminal in nature and which may give
rise to unacceptable and illegal behaviour, it recognises that despite its many endeavours,
it is not possible to eliminate all risk of Post Office being used to facilitate Money
Laundering or Terrorist Financing activities, and therefore takes a risk based approach.

Failure to comply with the requirements of this policy by any employee will be regarded
as a significant breach impacting on the Group’s risk and control environment and may
lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and possible prosecution.

The risk to the Group in relation to Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is reviewed
by the Board as part of its wider commitment to Financial Crime on a regular basis.

1.5. The Risk of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

Money Laundering
Money laundering is the process criminals use to hide, disguise and dispose of cash and
assets obtained from criminal activity. Criminals want to disguise the source of their money
and remove any link to the original crime. This allows them to avoid prosecution and
confiscation of funds.

Terrorist Financing

Terrorist financing involves dealing with money or property that may be used to fund
terrorism. The funds and property may be from legitimate sources (e.g. personal funds,
charities, sponsored trips, etc.) or criminal sources.

Failure to manage the these risks can result in financial loss, customer impact, terrorism,
regulatory breaches, fines, prosecution, prevention from selling a particular product, loss
of existing or future contracts/relationships and damage to reputation.

1.6. Legislation

There are a number of relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements which are applicable
including (but not limited to):

*® The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the
Payer) Regulations 2017 (known as Money Laundering Regulations 2017)

* The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

* The Criminal Finances Act 2017

* Policing and Crime Act 2017

* The Terrorism Act 2000

« Counter-Terrorism Act 2008

142 of 227 Risk & Compliance Committee meeting-13/09/17

POL-BSFF-0238511_0141
The Group monitors and takes into consideration guidance and other assistance offered
by regulatory, industry and other specialist bodies, for example the Joint Money
Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG), UK Finance (which incorporates BBA, UK Payments
and Financial Fraud Action UL), Link, etc. publish trends and analysis on current threats
and issues.

Oversight of compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations by the Group is
undertaken by HMRC in the case of Post Office Limited and the Financial Conduct Authority
(FCA) is the case of Post Office Management Services Limited (POMS).

Post Office Limited is an Appointed Representative of the Bank of Ireland and POMS and
is contractually required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As such the
Group as a whole is obliged to ensure there are adequate systems and controls are in
place to mitigate risks.

1.7. Offences

The Money Laundering regulations set out five offences for which the Group or a member
of its staff can be prosecuted under:

1. Concealing - where an employee conceals, disguises, converts or transfers criminal
proceeds, or removes them from the UK

2. Arrangement - where an employee allows the Group to enter into or become involved
in an arrangement where an employee knows or suspects that it involves the proceeds
of crime.

3. Acquisition, use or possession - where an employee acquires, uses or takes
possession of criminal proceeds.

If found guilty of these offences an individual can be given an unlimited fine or up to
14 years in prison or both. The only defence is that an employee had completed and
submitted a Suspicious Activity Report to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer
(MLRO), apart from ‘acquisition’ where the Group or a relevant individual would need
to evidence that the proceeds had been acquired at fair market price and that they
were not aware that they were criminal proceeds.

4. Failure to disclose - where an employee fails to report to the MLRO their suspicions
or knowledge that someone is involved in Financial Crime.

If found guilty of this offence an individual can be given an unlimited fine or up to five
years in prison or both. There are two defences to this offence; training did not cover
how to complete a SAR or “a reasonable excuse” such as that an employee was rushed
to hospital just prior to completing the report. The reasonableness of the excuse will
be tested in court.

5. Tipping Off - an offence will be committed if information which prejudices an
investigation into Financial Crime is shared by an employee - for examples if an
employee informs a suspect that they are under investigation.

If found guilty of this offence an individual can be given an unlimited fine or up to two
years in prison or both. The only defence is if an employee did not know or suspect
that what was said would prejudice the investigation

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

A Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group is willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has?:

* Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

« Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

* Averse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

« Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organisation

« Averse risk appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however, that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented, a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed Risk
Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required (See section 1.4 for
further details).

2.2, Risk Assessment

The Money Laundering regulations require that Post Office completes Group wide risk
assessments with a clear rationale to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist
financing.

Risk assessment must include:

e Identifying the inherent money laundering risks that are relevant to the Group,
product and/or service

« Assessing customer type, customer behaviour, normal product/service activity,
delivery channels, etc.

e Assessing controls to manage and reduce the impact of inherent risks

« Assessing how the Group will monitor controls and improve their efficiency

« Keeping records of key decisions

The Group requires risk assessments to be completed for individual products and services
to ensure that sufficient controls are in place to detect and prevent money laundering or
terrorist financing, and for these risk assessments to be refreshed annually.

5 The Risk appetite was agreed by the Groups Board January 2015

INTERNAL. Page 6 of 19 Paper 8.1.2 AML CTF Policy v3.1

POL00423693
POL00423693

POL-BSFF-0238511_0143
2.3. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of financial crime policies and procedures, on a risk
sensitive approach which are subject to annual review. The policy suite is designed to
combat money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, fraud and ensure
adherence to relevant sanctions regimes.

The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Policy is a key Policy under
the Financial Crime Policy framework and should be considered and read in conjunction
with the overarching Financial Crime Policy where relevant.

2.4, Who must comply?

Compliance with this Policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees and applies
wherever in the world the Group’s business is undertaken. All third parties who do business
with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and business and franchise partners, will
be required to agree contractually to this Policy or to have their own equivalent Policy.

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the MLRO (currently
the Head of Financial Crime). Any investigations will be carried out in accordance with the
Investigations Policy. Where an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful
disregard or negligence, this will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

2.5. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the
risks so they remain within the defined Risk Appetite statements. There must be
mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum
control standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective
and preventive which are required to ensure risks are managed to an acceptable level and
within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required

minimum control standards in consideration of the stated risk appetite. The subsequent
pages define the terms used in greater detail

2.6. Product and Service Risk Tools

Risk Assessment Tool

The Risk Assessment Tool has been created by the Financial Crime Team to assist Product Managers to determine the level of risk exposure
and engagement required for new products and services. The Risk Assessment Tool takes into account inherent risks (e.g. payment method,
channel, customer demographic etc.), UK regulations and legislation and industry best practice.

The Risk Assessment Tool can be found here.

Product Information Pack

The purpose of the Product Information Pack (PIP) is to provide an overview of the product or service, including customer/transactional
journey, parties involved, any contractual responsibilities, monitoring and control requirements. It should consider the inherent risks the
product is exposed to from a Group and customer perspective and the framework for the effective risk mitigation of the product.

The existence of detailed operating policies, procedures and processes may be referred to throughout this document and is to be used to
illustrate how the risks associated with the product are reduced.

The Product Information Pack can be found here.

8.2. Whistleblowing

The Report

Why do we need to review this Policy?

1. The Policy was last reviewed and approved by the R&CC in July 2016. The terms of
the Policy require it be reviewed annually.

What changes to the Policy do we propose and why?
What are the key features that we propose and why?

2. We have redesigned the Policy template and format but the substance and
obligations have not changed. The new format helps ensure that the purpose, core
principles and impacts are understood. It sets out clear minimum control standards
and responsibilities for application of those standards.

3. Key changes include:

e Updating contact details and help line numbers

e Ensuring that all teams across the business that may receive whistleblowing
reports ensure that these are passed onto the Whistleblowing Officer and handled
confidentially

e A new section has been included clearly mapping minimum control standards,
responsibilities and timescales.
How did we develop these recommendations?

4. Policy queries and issues that have arisen over the previous 12 months have been
reviewed to ensure that these concerns are addressed.

What are the implications of these changes?

What will we need to do and by when, to implement and embed these Policy changes?

5. No material changes are required to comply with this updated Policy.

6. Internal communications and training - once the Policy has been approved, there
will be a One communication to advise all employees of the changes and provide a
link to the updated document on the Post Office Intranet.

What will the impact be on our wider business?

7. Transparency of Post Office’s adherence and commitment to the Employment Rights
Act 1996 and the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998

What would the impact be of delaying approval?

8. Risk that the group breaches the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Public
Interest Disclosure Act 1998 by not having up to date policies and procedures to
provide protections to whistleblowers.

9. Post Office Limited is required to maintain up to date policies to support contractual
requirements with clients and suppliers (e.g. MoneyGram and the Partner Banking
Framework) and failure to do so may result in a breach of contract, and whilst not
material, could have commercial and reputational impacts.

10.Post Office Limited provides Post Office Management Services (POMS) with its
policies suite in the form of “Group Policies”. POMS is required under its regulatory
responsibility to the Financial Conduct Authority to have up to date policies and
failure to do so may lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.

1 « Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the
implementation of controls ensuring Post Office meets it Whistleblowing obligations.
Whistleblowing is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post Office
board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
management of Whistleblowing throughout the Group!. It is one of a set of policies which
provide a clear risk and governance framework and an effective system of internal control
for the management of risk across the Group. Compliance with these policies supports the
Group in meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders,
employees? and other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing and/or dangerous practices
within Post Office. This would include serious accidents, fraud, regulatory breaches,
financial impropriety and/or reputational damage.

In order to encourage Whistleblowing and provide appropriate protections to
whistleblowers, the governance arrangements described in this Policy are based upon the
following core principles:

* To encourage the reporting of any concerns as soon as possible in the knowledge that

all concerns will be taken seriously and investigated, and that confidentiality will be
respected;

« To provide guidance as to how to raise those concerns;

« To provide whistleblowers reassurance that all concerns are raised without fear of
reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken;

« Post Office is committed to and oversees the implementation of a Policy in line with
the Group’s risk appetite. The Policy and associated procedures (set out or referred to
in this document) are proportionate to the risks and complexity of the Group;

« Post Office undertakes a training and awareness program to ensure employees are
aware of the Whistleblowing policy and procedure.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all employees within the Group and outlines the protections
provided for whistleblowers by law. In order to encourage reporting of wrongdoing, Post
Office will, where appropriate, extend equivalent protection to Postmasters, Agent
Assistants, and members of the public.

“In this Policy "Post Office” and “Group” mean Post Office Limited and Post Office Management Services Limited,
? In this Policy “employee” means permanent staff, temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else
working for or on behalf of Post Office.

POL00423693

1.5. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements
including (but not limited to) the following legislation as amended or supplemented from
time to time:

« Employment Rights Act 1996
« Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998

1.6. What is Whistleblowing

“Whistleblowing” refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing and/or
dangerous practices by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or to an
external party. A whistleblower is a person who raises a genuine concern in relation to any
wrongdoing, this includes criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, dangers to health and
safety and the deliberate attempt to conceal it.

Individuals? should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing which
affects others (e.g. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the Post Office). The
following lists some examples (this is a non-exhaustive list) of situations where an
individual may raise a concern:

e Financial Crime including Fraud, Money Laundering and financing of terrorism,
Giving, offering or taking of bribes,
Financial mismanagement,
Misreporting,
Practices that could put individuals or the environment at risk,
Breach of Post Office internal policies and procedures (including the Code of
Business Standards),
Concerns about slavery or human trafficking, and
Any conduct likely to damage Post Office’s reputation

eee ee

Grievances and matters such as bullying and harassment are addressed under Post Office’s
HR policies and concerns in relation to such matters should be raised in accordance with
the procedures set out in the appropriate HR policy.

If an individual is uncertain about whether something is within the scope of this Policy they
should seek advice from the Whistleblowing Officer, whose contact details are set out in
this Policy.

1.7. Protecting the whistleblower

Post Office has a statutory obligation to protect whistleblowers and will support any
individual who raises genuine concerns under this Policy, even if they turn out to be
mistaken. Post Office are committed to respecting the confidentiality of all
whistleblowers, and including those who wish to remain anonymous.

Post Office will make every effort to protect the whistleblower’s identity, however, it may
be necessary in the course of an investigation to share this information with a relevant
stakeholder (e.g. an investigator). There is no requirement for a whistleblower to provide
personal contact information. However, not providing this information may reduce Post
Office's ability to undertake a thorough investigation into the concerns raised.

+ In this Policy “individuals” means Postmasters, Agent Assistants, members of the public and employees (permanent staf,
temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else working for or on behalf of Post Office). The
statutory protections offered under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 only apply to employees, however Post Office
Limited will consider extending these protections to other individuals where they have acted in good faith in raising concerns.

Internal Page 4 of 15 Paper 8.2.2 Whistleblowing Policy v.1.5

POL-BSFF-0238511_0162
164 of 227

Post Office will take all reasonable steps to ensure that whistleblowers do not suffer any
detrimental treatment as a result of raising a concern. Detrimental treatment includes
disciplinary action, dismissal, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with
raising a concern. Serious action will be taken against any individual who threatens or
retaliates against whistleblowers in any way.

If an individual believes that they have suffered any such treatment, they should inform
the Whistleblowing Officer immediately. The Whistleblowing Officer should take steps to
address any victimisation, which may include working with the HR team to put
appropriate measures in place. If the matter is not addressed the whistleblower should
raise it formally using Post Office’s Grievance procedure.

In all cases the individual’s concerns will be treated sensitively and in confidence.

1.8. Whistleblowing Officer and ‘Speak Up’

Post Office has a appointed the General Counsel as the Whistleblowing Officer who can
be contacted on whistleblowing 7

The Whistleblowing Officer will review concerns raised and determine the best course of
action, if any. They may ask for further information in order to make this decision.

It is recognised that sometimes raising a concern directly with the business may not be
possible. In such instances individuals should contact the “Speak Up” line, a confidential
reporting service which is run by an independent company InTouch MCS Ltd.

Contact details for the
.f

° = fttp:

Speak Up line are:

WWW. intouchfeedback.com/postoffice which is a secure on-line web portal:

All reports to the Speak Up line will be acknowledged within five working days and will
be passed to the Whistleblowing Officer.

It is also possible that individuals may whistleblow via a complaint to a front line team,
e.g. Customer complaints, NBSC and Grapevine. These may be verbal or written
communications.

In all instances any whistleblowing reports, regardless of reporting method, will be
passed onto the Whistleblowing Officer. The whistleblower may be kept informed of any
action taken, however, this information may be limited if it is required to keep the
confidence of other people.

1.9. External Disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating
and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases individuals should not
find it necessary to alert anyone externally.

However, the law recognises that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for
individuals to report their concerns to an external body such as a regulator. The
independent Whistleblowing charity, Public Concern at Work have a list of prescribed
regulators for reporting certain types of concerns. Their contact details are as follows:

2 « Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has*:

« Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

« Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

« Averse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

« Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organisation

« Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented an action may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite.

2.2, Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of policies and procedures, on a risk sensitive approach
which are subject to an annual review. The policy suite is designed to comply with
applicable legislation and regulation. The Whistleblowing Policy should be considered and
read in conjunction with other policies where relevant. These may include the Financial
Crime Policy, the Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, Health & Safety Policies and HR Policies
where relevant.

2.3. Who Must Comply?

All third parties who do business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and
business and franchise partners, will be required to agree contractually to this policy or
have their own equivalent policy.

Any investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy which is
available on the Post Office Intranet

“The Risk appetite was agreed by the Groups Board January 2015

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for ensuring that
the requirements of this Policy are maintained, for introducing any change programs that
may be required as a result of this Policy and ensuring ongoing compliance programs are
managed appropriately.

1.2. Purpose

Trust is at the heart of the Post Office brand and protecting the Personal Data we use is
fundamental to maintaining that reputation. Data Protection legislation protects the
fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, in relation to the use of their Personal
Data.

As such, this Policy sets out the expected behavior of Post Office Employees and Third
Parties in relation to the collection, use, retention, transfer, disclosure and destruction of
Personal Data.

1.3. Core Principles

Post Office has adopted the following principles to govern its collection, use, retention,
transfer, disclosure and destruction of Personal Data:

1. Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency

Post Office must Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.
« Post Office must tell the Data Subject what Processing will occur (transparency),
« Processing must match the description given to the Data Subject (fairness), and

« Processing must be for one of the purposes specified in the applicable Data
Protection regulation and associated legislation (lawfulness).

2. Purpose Limitation

Post Office can only use Personal Data for the purpose that it was originally collected and
limit any further Processing of that Personal Data according to the purposes notified to the
Data Subject.

3. Data Minimisation

The Personal Data Post Office collects must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is
necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are Processed.

This means Post Office must not collect or store any Personal Data beyond what is strictly
required.

INTERNAL. Page 3 of 14 Protecting Personal Data Policy V1.1

POL00423693
POL00423693

POL-BSFF-0238511_0178
4. Accuracy
The Personal Data Post Office collects must be accurate and, kept up to date.

Post Office must ensure that processes for identifying and addressing out-of-date,
incorrect and redundant Personal Data are introduced and maintained. This will ultimately
have a business benefit by removing contacts that are no longer using Post Office products
or services.

5. Storage Limitation

Personal Data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is Processed.

Post Office must, wherever possible, introduce mechanisms and procedures into their
systems and processes that limits or prevents identification of the Data Subject (eg
Anonymisation).

6. Integrity & Confidentiality

Post Office must Process Personal Data in a manner that ensures appropriate security
including:

« Protection against unauthorised or unlawful Processing,
« Protection against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

We must use appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the integrity
and confidentiality of Personal Data is maintained at all times.

7. Accountability

Post Office must demonstrate these Data Protection Principles are met for all Personal
Data for which it is responsible.

It shall be the responsibility of the GE to ensure that all processes for which they are
responsible, are conducted in a manner which can be subject to either internal audit or
external regulatory scrutiny, and can demonstrate their compliance with this Policy, its
corresponding standards and guidance and legal requirements.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all areas within the Group and defines the minimum standards
to control the risks associated with non-compliance of Data Protection regulations.

All Third Parties engaged to process Personal Data on behalf of Post Office (Data
Processors) must be aware of and comply with the contents of this policy. Assurance of
such compliance must be obtained from all Third Parties, prior to granting them access to
Personal Data controlled by Post Office.

The risk to the Group in relation to breaches of Data Protection regulations are reviewed
by the board on a regular basis.

Any non-compliance may expose Post Office to complaints, regulatory action, fines and/or
reputational damage. Therefore any breach of this policy will be taken seriously and may
result in disciplinary action or business sanctions being applied.

INTERNAL. Page 4 of 14 Protecting Personal Data Policy V1.1

POL00423693
POL00423693

POL-BSFF-0238511_0179
1.5. Data Protection Risk

Failure to appropriately manage risks and incidents relating to Data Protection could result
in punitive penalties, regulatory breaches, fines, prosecution, and prevention from
processing personal data and damage to reputation.

The GE must ensure that all Data Protection risks are identified and addressed when
designing new systems or processes and/or when reviewing or expanding existing systems
or processes.

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be conducted, in cooperation with the
Data Protection Function for all new, and/or revised systems or processes.

Where applicable, Information Protection and Assurance (IPA) and IT Security, will
cooperate with the Data Protection Function to assess the impact of any new technology
uses on the security of Personal Data.

All investigations into breaches of this Policy, will be managed and controlled by the Data
Protection Function. All investigations will be conducted in conjunction with the Security
Operations Centre.

1.6. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements
including (but not limited to):

« Data Protection Act 1998

« Privacy & Electronic Communications Regulations 2003
* Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
* Human Rights Act 1998

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

A Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsivities seriously and consequently has:

«¢ Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

* Adverse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

« Adverse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business conduct standards

« Adverse risk appetite for data loss/leakage that can lead to customer, commercial
or reputational damage

e Adverse risk appetite for inaccurate and unreliable processing of data

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed Risk
Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

. Policy Framework

Post Office will establish and maintain a suite of Data Protection policies and standard
operating procedures (SoPs) and guidance, which are subject to annual review. The policy
suite is designed to set out how the business aims to comply with Data Protection
regulations.

The suite of documents mandated by this Policy covers the following:
e The identification through documented risk assessment of potential or inherent

Data Protection risks and mitigating actions (Data Privacy Impact Assessments)

« Documentation of operating procedures to allow the exercise of individual rights,
including:

© Information access.

© Objection to Processing.

© Objection to automated decision-making and profiling.
c Restriction of Processing.

c Data portability.

o Data rectification.

o Data erasure.

e On arisk sensitive basis, performing due diligence upon our employees, agents and
third parties,

« Data Breach escalation and management plans

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all Post Office Employees. All third parties
who do business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and business will be
required to agree contractually to this policy or have their own equivalent policy.

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the Policy Owner and
the Data Protection Function. Where is it identified that an instance of non-compliance is
caused through wilful disregard or negligence, this will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks within the defined Risk Appetite statements
contained within the table below. To comply with this, mechanisms must be in place within each business unit or product to demonstrate
compliance. The minimum control standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which
are required to ensure risks are managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

POL00423693

Forward by our Chief Executive
Dear Post Office Colleagues,
Post Office is unique - a commercial business delivering an important social purpose. We
believe in the importance of connecting communities and enhancing the powerful role
they play in all our lives. We stay true to this commitment by meeting customer needs
through carefully designed, high quality products, and maintaining an unrivalled local
presence across the UK.
Generations of hard work and honest achievement have made Post Office a name that
elicits trust. This is due in no small part to an unwavering commitment to ethical
behaviour and doing the right things in the right way. This commitment and integrity is
critical to achieving great business performance.
Our Code of Business Standards sets out our enduring commitment to ethical behaviour
and ensures our policies and processes are relevant and appropriate to today’s dynamic
operating and regulatory environment. Regardless of the challenges that arise in
achieving our ambitions, our commitment to how we do business is unwavering.
I expect everyone at Post Office to read this document carefully and to think about how
it applies to their work. Consider how your behaviours, actions and decisions may affect
others, including customers and colleagues.
The way that we conduct business has never been more important.
Thank you for your trust in the Post Office. And, most importantly, thank you for your
commitment to ensure our customers and the communities we serve, continue to place
their trust in us.

Our Heritage and Values

The Post Office has thrived at the heart of communities across the UK for over 370
years. We are one of the country’s most trusted brands and we take our commitment
to provide essential services very seriously. We are the UK’s largest retail network and
provide unrivalled access to banking and financial services, with more branches than all
the UK’s banks and building societies put together.

We are committed to doing business the right way. That means we act lawfully. It also
means that how we conduct ourselves is more than just a matter of policy and law; it’s
a reflection of our core values: Care, Challenge and Commit. By aligning our
behaviours to our core values, we help maintain the trust and support of our
customers, shareholders, communities and others with whom we work.

Introducing the Code
Our Code of Business Standards defines how we operate.

In developing the Code of Business Standards, we have drawn inspiration from our
heritage and values as well as the law. It is intended to guide the way we behave and
give us standards to measure ourselves. It sets out what people can expect when
working for and with the Post Office. It is designed to provide guidance and support in
making decisions and carrying out work in a way that is compatible with our values,
policies and processes and the law. As the legal and regulatory environments evolve,
the Code will adapt to accommodate such changes.

By consistently adhering to this Code we will continue to foster and strengthen a
culture that will help us to continue to be a business to be proud of - a ‘Great place to
work’ that is ‘Simpler to run’ and ‘Better for customers’.

Observing the Code

Everyone employed by, acting on behalf of, or representing, Post Office (including
contractors, consultants, and other service providers) is required to adhere to the Code;
they are expected to operate in line with it and the corresponding Group Policies.

As a Post Office colleague, you are required to:

- Read and understand the Code of Business Standards and work-related policies and
incorporate them into your work and behaviours;

- Complete all mandatory training on time;

- Report potential unlawful behaviour or breaches of the Code or company policies;

- Cooperate fully with company investigations;

- Never victimise colleagues for ‘calling it out’;

- Ask questions when you’re unsure.

If you are a manager, you have additional responsibilities to:

« Promote the Code of Business Standards and work-related policies, incorporating
them into the work of your direct reports;

« Set a fitting example for others though your own behaviour;

e Ensure that your team members know they can come to you with questions or
concerns and that you'll listen to them and respond appropriately;

« Never make promises or make commitments to partners, suppliers or your direct

the same. More information can be found on the intranet.

team management queries. Visit www.myhrhelp.co.uk.

Our Brand

Our brand experience, for employees, customers, partners and stakeholders is shaped
by our core values of Care, Challenge and Commit.

We make that happen by having a set of straightforward business behaviours which
inform the way we do things, and we use them as a guide to improve our people
processes including recruitment, learning and development, talent and performance
management.

In short, it’s how we do things to deliver our brand commitment to customers.
Customer Excellence

Our customers are at the heart of everything we do.

We all know what it feels like to experience good and poor customer service. We need to
ensure that we deliver great service for all customers, every time they interact with us.
The more we understand our customers and their expectations, and put ourselves in
their shoes, the easier it will be to provide consistently great service.

How do we demonstrate our commitment to customer excellence?

«by listening to them and understanding their needs and expectations

* by communicating respectfully, leaving out the jargon, providing them with the
best service and products that meets their needs

« by always thinking about them and not the process

« by keeping it simple and straightforward to reach us - in branch, online, mobile

We expect high standards of personal behaviour at work

Behaviour which damages service to customers, or the reputation or efficiency of Post
Office, is unacceptable. This extends to poor attendance, lateness, dishonesty,
drunkenness, use of illegal substances, and violent or disorderly behaviour or abusive
language.

Maintaining our standards means we:

- Conduct ourselves appropriately and professionally

- Act as an ambassador for the company

- Operate within the law

- Do not bring Post Office into disrepute

- Do not claim money for hours you did not work, a journey you did not make or an
expense you did not incur

- Do not use inside information about a company transaction for personal profit

We should all demonstrate:

- Honesty and integrity

- Efficiency and reliability

- Punctuality and good attendance

- Asmart and clean appearance - and where uniform is provided by Post Office, it
should be worn as intended

- Acredible image to the public

Valuing Diversity and Inclusion

We want our people to reflect the diversity of the communities in which we live and
work, and the customers we serve.

We celebrate the diversity of our workforce and the communities we serve by embracing
diversity and inclusion and creating policies which actively promote working without fear
of discrimination.

Everyone working for Post Office has a responsibility to:

* Promote a professional and positive work environment

+ Promote a culture of inclusivity where differences are accepted, valued and
celebrated

« Inform their line manager of any instances of apparent discrimination or any

perceived problem in relation to employment
« Comply with, and promote Post Office policy and procedures with regard to
diversity and inclusion. You can view our Valuing Diversity Policy, here.

We actively support:

- Flexible working practices, which you can read more about here

- Women in Leadership Programme to support and nurture female talent.

- Post Office Prism: a network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)
colleagues and their allies. The group supports and celebrates Post Office’s LGBT
community and provides advice and guidance to our business on inclusivity and
diversity.

- Disability Confident Group: a network of Post Office colleagues with disabilities
and colleagues who want to support them. The group provides, support, advice
and helps the business to do the very best it can for employees with disabilities.

Language:

The common language of business should be English (English or Welsh in Wales). However,
so long as it doesn’t jeopardise the job or health and safety of colleagues or members of
the public and doesn’t deliberately exclude people, colleagues should be able to
communicate in their own language within reason.

Creating and Maintaining a Safe and Healthy Place of Work
We strive to work as safely as possible.

Everybody has the right to work in a safe and healthy environment. We will fulfil our
promises without compromising the safety of our customers, colleagues, suppliers and
all those affected by our activities.

Pursuing this aim reflects the high value we place on our employees and all those
touched by our business activities:

- We comply fully with relevant legislation

- Weensure that the health and safety responsibilities of our employees, including
managers, are clearly defined, allocated and understood

- We encourage and help all managers and employees to carry out their
responsibilities through effective health and safety management systems, with
safe premises, equipment and processes

— We improve our employees’ capability to manage and work safely, through
coaching and training

- Wesupport and encourage our people and unions to get involved in the health and
safety performance of our business

— We support and encourage our people and unions to get involved in pursuing a
healthy and safe way of living and working

- We monitor and review how well we put our health and safety policies into
practice

We are all responsible for health and safety. Every manager is accountable for the health
and safety of their people. A full copy of the Health and Safety policy, and all associated
policies, can be found on the Health and Safety intranet site.

and policies have an impact on the environment and we are committed to taking account

Use of computers, internet, phones and email

The security of our information and IT systems is critical.

Many colleagues will have access to Post Office systems, information and devices such as
laptops and mobile phones. It’s really important that anyone who accesses them knows
how to keep them secure by following the requirements in the ‘Acceptable Use policy’.
For example, these devices must not be left unattended in public areas, screens must
always be locked when not in use and the use of privacy screens should be adopted
when working in public areas.

To help protect our systems and information, you should:

- Classify information in line with our classification standard, as set out in our
Information Security Handbook.

- Use complex passwords to protect your access, as set out in our Information
Security Handbook.

- Only open emails when you know who they are from and don’t click on unknown
links or open unexpected attachments.

- Don’t use your Post Office email address or password for accessing 3 party
services such as LinkedIn. Use a different password.

- Only use approved data storage areas, such as onedrive. Don’t sign up for
cloud storage services such as Dropbox.

- Never click on links to go to a website where you expect to log on - always
go to the website directly.

- Don’t store Post Office data directly onto your personal devices

- Don’t become a victim: if you think an offer is too good, it probably is!

If you become aware of any information security issue or incident you should always
report it to the IT Helpdesk ot r email postofficeservicedeski

Failure to comply with the Acceptable Use policy can carry profound consequences for
Post Office and individuals. Breaches of the policy or the law may lead to disciplinary
action up to and including dismissal.

Social Media

Digital and social media is a key part of modern life.

New digital technologies can help us engage actively with our customers. We can
promote what we do and draw on innovative ideas. However, with these benefits comes
greater responsibility.

As more colleagues can access the internet at work both on personal and official devices,
it is important that we maintain the highest levels of propriety at all times. We must
always act in a way that does not compromise the trust and confidence of our customers
or the standards of behaviour expected of us.

Colleagues are free to use social and other digital media in their own time. Social media
is a public forum and the boundaries between professional and personal can become
blurred — so it’s important that we exercise particular care to ensure:

- Post Office brands or logos are not used or altered without prior permission

8.4. Code of Business Standards

- Copyright and fair usage laws and restrictions are respected and observed

= Social media is not used to offend, harass or bully people

- We must not disclose official information relating to clients, partners or suppliers
without the prior authority of the business

- You must not appear to be endorsing any product or service (including retweeting
comments)

The simple rule to remember is that the principles covering the use of social and other
digital media in both work and in a personal capacity are the same as those contained in
this Code of Business Standards and company policies that apply for any other activity.

Engaging with the Media

Where a colleague is asked to make a comment about Post Office in a published form

external to the business, such as a newspaper, magazine, journal, radio, television or a
ite, they must direct thi Press Office. They can be contacted oni.

GRO} or pressofficef

Political Activity
Colleagues have the right to participate as an individual in political activities.

However, these activities are conducted as an individual and not as a representative of
Post Office. The Post Office is a politically neutral organisation and our reputation must
not be compromised by your interest, affiliation or activities to political party’s pressure
groups or other causes.

No matter what your own political beliefs are, you must not act or behave at work ina
way that is determined by party political considerations, or use Post Office resources for
party political purposes; or allow your personal political views to determine any advice
you give or your actions.

Conflicts of Interest

We ensure that information received during our business dealings is not used
inappropriately for corporate or personal gain or any other purpose except that for which
it is given.

If you feel that you might have a potential conflict of interest, inform your line manager
and seek their advice if you are unsure. Be open and frank about any outside activity or
business you are involved in which may conflict with Post Office or your duties as an
employee.

The essential principles are:

« You must not do anything which conflicts with your duty as an employee or
agent of the company, or use your official position for private advantage

* You must declare any outside employment, directorship or material shareholding
and these must not be contrary to the company’s commercial interest or bring it
into disrepute

« Your actions as an employee or agent at work must not be improperly influenced by
any relationship (e.g. with relatives, friends, marriage, partners or membership of
any social, religious or political association) or by any personal or financial
consideration

* No one should exploit their personal or family relationship with any colleague for any
gain including to themselves or others

e If you receive a fee from an outside source for performing a service which forms
part of your official duties or takes place in business time, e.g. giving an interview
or lecture, you must report it to your manager. You will normally be expected to
pay the money to Post Office or to a charity connected with it.

e If the service arises from your work but is not directly connected with it and is
given in your own time, you must still report it to your manager

Gifts and Sponsorship

In general, the giving and receiving of gifts is not permitted except for low value
promotional items, such as pens, calendars, diaries, notepads and paperweights. You
can find out more by reading the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policy.

« You must not accept any gift, payment or inducement that might influence (or
seek to influence) your action as a Post Office employee. If any such offer is made
to you, you must report it to your manager.

e Equally, you must not offer any bribe or inducement to anyone else.

« You must not ask for or accept sporting or charitable sponsorship from an
organisation that has (or is seeking) a contract to supply the company, or is in
competition with it. You must declare to your manager any plan to accept
sponsorship and ask if there is any conflict.

The Risk and Compliance team maintain a Register of all gifts given and received.

Hospitality and Entertainment

Hospitality may only be given and accepted where it has a clear and demonstrable link
with a legitimate business purpose, e.g. an organised event or a meal at which business
is to be discussed. In relation to offers of hospitality, numbers on both sides should be
limited to those whose presence is necessary to progress the business in hand.

Maintaining our standards means the giving and receiving of hospitality and
entertainment is subject to the following rules

« You must obtain prior permission from your line manager before accepting or giving
hospitality
«The hospitality must be reasonable (not lavish or extravagant), proportionate to its
purpose and must ordinarily be below £100 per person in value
« You must send details of all hospitality offered and accepted, along with written
approval from your line manager, to the Risk and Compliance team at
rm so they can maintain a Register of all

“Hospitality given and received.

You should be aware of the risk that accepting any hospitality and entertainment could
compromise your performance of official business, or might reasonably appear to have
improperly influenced a business decision.

Use sound judgement and exercise restraint. If you are still unsure about the standards
required of you consult your manager or view the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policy.

Fraud and Financial Crime

We seek to comply fully with relevant legislation.

forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking,

for personal or commercial gain.

« Post Office is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business

controls set out in our Modern Slavery Statement with the aim of ensuring that

Consequences of Non-Compliance for the Code of Business Standards

Compliance to Post Office Code and policies is not optional.

It is everyone’s responsibility to follow our Code of Business Standards and the various
related policies.

«Failure to comply with company policies and the law can carry profound
consequences for Post Office and potentially for you.

* Where non-compliance with the Code, company policies or the law has been identified in
accordance with established company investigatory procedures, we will take swift and
decisive action against an offending party, up to and including, the termination of individual
and or third party contracts as appropriate.

Post Office does not tolerate any form of retaliation against colleagues or third parties
who have made reports, in good faith, of threatened, ongoing, past or suspected
breaches of this Code of Business Standards.

Making Proper Decisions and Seeking Help

At Post Office, we set ourselves exacting standards. All our stakeholders, and others with
whom we work, have an expectation that they will be treated professionally.

should help and encourage their teams to understand and observe it.

appropriate course of action to take. The Code, along with our other company policies, is
designed to help us make proper decisions.

If you are faced with a dilemma, after reviewing the relevant parts of the Code, ask
yourself a few questions to help make the right decision:
« Am I adhering to the Code, other policies and procedures?
Am I being honest?
What would others think of my actions?
How might my decision affect others?
Would I feel comfortable if my actions were reported in the media?
How would my decision impact on Post Office reputation?

If you are still unsure as to the right thing to do, you should talk with your manager and
discuss your questions and concerns.

We all share a responsibility to report concerns of actual or potential breaches of the
Code of Business Standards, company policies and the law.

If you witness or otherwise learn about the company’s standards and reputation being
put at risk by unethical or even criminal behaviour, you must immediately, and without
investigating, report it.

RCC Noting Paper

9.1 Corporate Governance Reforms

Author: Natasha Wilson Sponsor: Martin Kirke Meeting date: 13 September

Context

This paper is to note a recent publication by the Government on Executive
Remuneration and Corporate Governance intended to raise the public’s trust in
business.

In November 2016, BEIS issued a Green Paper on Corporate Governance and
Executive Pay. The Green Paper recommended reform in the following areas:
« Executive pay;

« Strengthening the employee, customer and wider stakeholder voice; and

* Corporate governance in large privately held businesses.

The document published on 29 August contains the Government’s response to the
Green Paper consultation and a number of firm proposals.

Questions

1. What is the timing of the proposals?
2. What are the key proposals affecting Post Office?

Conclusions

POL00423693
POL00423693

17

1. Implementing the reform proposals will require a combination of changes to the
UK Corporate Governance Code, voluntary industry action and secondary

legislation.

2. The FRC intends to consult on amendments to the Code in late Autumn; the
Government intends to lay draft legislation before Parliament before March 2018.
3. The Government's current intention is to bring the reforms into effect by June

2018 to apply to company reporting years commencing on or after that date.
4. The key proposals affecting Post Office:

a. CEO: Employee pay ratio - the Government response confirms that the
disclosure regulations will be amended to improve transparency with
regard to directors’ remuneration. The requirement will be to disclose the
ratio of CEO pay to the average pay of a company’s UK workforce, along
with a narrative explaining changes to that ratio from year to year and

how the ratio relates to pay and conditions across the wider workforce.

This work is currently being looked at and will be discussed by the GE and

Remuneration Committee.

b. Strengthening of the employee, customer and wider stakeholder voice -
the response states that the Government will introduce secondary

legislation to require all companies of a significant size (private as well
public) to explain how their directors comply with the requirements

as
of

section 172 (Companies Act 2006) to have regard to employee interests

and to fostering relationships with suppliers, customers and others.

POST OFFICE PAGE 2 OF 2

This work is currently being looked at by members of the GE and other
senior leaders to understand how we can incorporate this proposal within
our current and future forums.

c. Other proposals relating to Remuneration Committees and pay will be
discussed by the Remuneration Committee.

Input Sought

The Committee is asked to note the contents of this paper.

The Report

On 29 August, the government published a package of corporate governance reforms
intended to raise the public’s trust in business. Whilst executive remuneration forms
much of the response, it does extend beyond pay and into broader considerations
around wider stakeholder involvement and corporate governance in large private
businesses.

The press and TUC have criticised the government of what they see as a watered-
down set of proposals, however, I believe this a good opportunity for Post Office and
we can address the requirements in a positive and pragmatic way.

In summary:
« Disclosure of the ratio of CEO pay to the average pay of the company’s worker,
along with a narrative explaining the changes to the ratio from year to year and
how the ratio relates to pay and conditions across the wider workforce.

Whilst the Government will give further consideration to the methodology for
calculating the ratio, at present, it proposes that it should be calculated based
on the CEO’s total annual remuneration (ie as we disclose in the ARA) relative
to the average total remuneration of the UK workforce.

« Strengthening the employee and wider stakeholder voice — the initial proposal
back in April to require an employee representative on the Remuneration
Committee or Board is not being taken forward. The FRC is to consult upon on
different mechanisms (NED representation, employee advisory councils...).

« Corporate governance: The FRC will work with IoD and others to develop a
voluntary set of corporate government principles which is likely to apply to
companies with more than 2,000 employees.

« Boardroom diversity — the FRC is expected to take forward the BEIS Select
Committee recommendations that from May 2020, at least half of all new
appointments to senior and executive managements positions in the FTSE 350
and all listed companies are women.

There are other proposals that are specifically related to pay and these will be discussed
by the Remuneration Committee.

1% LINE COMPLIANCE REPORT

RT discussed the operational issues encountered in Webhelp. The QA
results for May were reported at 40% and so far for June at 42%. There
are issues with the volume of new agents, level of competence and
oversight. The error are also shown in the 2" line compliance and the
complaints handling. It had been decided to implement Project Calibre to
deal with the issues. This project will be overseen by Head of Operations
Nichola Hazard. Actions include looking at recruitment processes and
training programmes and taking significant steps to step in to the
management of WH and control of the QA/Complaints team. Need to
understand and improve operations quickly. This will mean a focus for
the POMS team based in Glasgow to ensure solutions are imbedded
quickly. RT is now receiving a data feed from WH as there were concerns
over the transparency of the MI provided.

BT reported that the CLUK claims project for Home is now live however
only with one insurer so far and only one claim. More information will be
provided at the next meeting.

Travel claims are reporting higher in number due to seasonality but levels
of repudiations are consistent

Complaints — It was noted that no MI had been received from WH this
month for complaints and concerns were mounting over the handling and
reporting of complaints as discussed earlier.

MB discussed the emerging trend in the Collinsons complaints relating to
errors and customer services in branch. MB confirmed that the complaints
are consistent with branch feedback in complaints. MB agreed to monitor
and discuss with CISL

MB noted that there had been a disparity in the POMS lapsed curve and
the RL dashboard. There appears to be a significant gap in cancellations
report. MB also noted that the dashboard appears to be more consistent
with the cancellation data from Royal London. MB will discuss with David
Williamson which MI to use.

to chase.

RT presented a report on the Upheld Complaint Deep Dive. Currently the
business upheld rate is 20%. However, this has not been achieved and
the rate has been 32% on a 12 month average with travel being the
highest in volume and upheld rate. It was also noted that POMS as a
business is performing within average industry levels. It was agreed in
the meeting to increase the upheld rate tolerance level in the scorecard to
35% with a 10% tolerance for Amber.

2" Line Compliance Monitoring

EMM provided a report on the 2" line compliance monitoring undertaken
at Webhelp. There were 87 variances for Travel and 36 for Life with 4
instances of potential detriment. These are reflective of the new QA
agents and the lack of training and guidance, this will be picked up as part
of Project Calibre. EMM also confirmed that she had undertaken training
and calibration session with the new QA personnel. EMM noted that the
new agents are undertaking their training in Falkirk and losing valuable
hours in traveling with no compliance included in the training.

in the branches and noted that there had been an increase in calls
available for review. Subsequently, the number of calls reviewed for the
2™ line compliance monitoring had also been increased SH noted that
the VMS process is currently out for tender and advised that the amount
VMS calls for insurance should be representative of the business written.
It was also noted that due to the tendering process there had been no
Non-Video VMS visits to review during April or May.

SG confirmed that the financial promotions approved first time continues
to improve with the remainder achieving approval on the second attempt.
SG also advised that there had been a review of the Financial Promotions
process and confirmed a decision to remove the withdrawal forms had
been undertaken.

SH advised that Thistle has also completed two reviews, Anti money
Laundering and Anti bribery and corruption. There were a few minor
issues to address but both reported low risk.

SH discussed the issue with the JCC and the unwillingness of the POL
management to address the items raised during the monitoring reviews.
Progress will be made by tackling issues and putting action plans in place.

SH discussed the EUM project. The roll-out had been scheduled for June,
but due to operational issues, including issues with access to Success
Factors. The pilot is now scheduled for 26 July. This will involve 25
branches over a period of 3 weeks. Full rollout of 500 branches selected
by POMS will commence 11 September for 6 weeks. A further rollout of
another 500 branches is expected by February 2018. These rollouts will
cover 75% of the top performing branches within the network. SH also
advised that Michelle Downs will now look after the EUM project.

RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE DECISION PAPER

9.3 Post Office Insurance
renewal

Author: Mark Dixon Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron Meeting date: 13 Sept 2017

Executive Summary

Context
The business has a series of insurance policies due for renewal on 1 October 2017.

Question addressed in this report
1. What level of cover is proposed and how has this changed from last year?

2. Are RCC members aware of any claims bought in respect of risks under our
Professional Indemnity or Directors & Officers Liability insurance or of regulatory
investigations that should be disclosed to insurers?

Conclusion

A summary of the policies and cover can be found in the Broker’s Pre-renewal Update
Report, attached.

Insurances to be purchased are the same as last year. No significant changes are
proposed. Coverage levels, with the exception of the extension to the Cyber policy
coverage, have been kept in line with last year and all policy limits and deductibles for
the current renewal are as per expiry.

These cover the business for most major risks albeit with high deductibles. We
consider these levels of insurance to be reasonable and appropriate for the POL
business.

POL has not made any claims against its insurers over the last year largely due to the
significant levels of self-insurance (via deductibles).

The annual cost of insurance in 2016/17 was circa £1,230k, excluding IPT. We are
finalising the cost for 2017/18 and expect small cost savings to be achieved, reflecting
the reduction in size of our vehicle fleet and workforce, resulting in a total spend of

The Report

What level of cover is proposed and how has this changed from last year?

ere appointed as insurance broker to the Post Office in 2015 and have
now worked with POL on its 2015, 2016 and 2017 renewals. They have helped
achieve premium reductions of! in in 2016 as well as various
improvements to our policies.

During 2016/17 we have re-aligned all expiry dates to ensure that all policies renew
on 1 October.

2. POL purchases insurances expected for a business of its size and complexity. These
comprise cover for: Crime; Motor; Combined Liability (Employers Liability and
Public/Products Liability); Property Damage and Business Interruption; Directors and
Officers Liability; Terrorism; Personal Accident/Business Travel; Professional
Indemnity; and Cyber.

POL seeks to manage the cost of its insurance premiums through the size of the
deductibles it takes (i.e. the amount that POL must pay before a claim can be made
against the insurance provider). This effectively means that POL is “self-insured” for a
portion of its risk. For example, under our Crime policy, which provides protection for
POL against theft, fraud, and dishonesty committed by employees and third parties, in
particular in relation to risks related to our cash centres, i is set at
This implies that any individual loss would need to be i before a
can be made against our insurers. The level of deductibles varies according to the
class of insurance purchased. POL takes advice from its broker when deciding the
level of these deductibles.

A summary of the policies and cover proposed for renewal, including details of
deductibles and sums insured, can be found in the Broker’s Pre-renewal Update
Report, attached. A full Renewal Report will be provided by the Broker after renewal
is concluded.

3. Insurances purchased are the same as last year. No significant changes are
proposed. Coverage levels, with the exception of our Cyber insurance (see 7. below),

have been kept in line with last year and all policy deductibles for the current renewal
are as per expiry.

These cover the business for most major risks albeit with high deductibles. We
consider these levels of insurance to be reasonable and appropriate for the POL
business.

4, POL has not made any claims against its insurers over the last year largely due to
the significant levels of self-insurance (via deductibles).

Cyber insurance from the current coverage in relation to two specific contracts to
cover the whole business (see 7. below).

6. Motor, Combined Liability and Property Damage cover are all on multi-year
agreements put in place last year to achieve cost savings.

In connection with the; ender we explored extending coverage to a third
contract. It was concluded that this was not possible in the market and that to satisfy
the tender requirements we would need to extend coverage from the existing two
contracts to the whole business.

Given that the need for Cyber insurance is increasingly likely to become a requirement
under future tender processes, this seems a sensible approach.

9.3. Insurance Renewal

POST OFFICE PAGE 5 OF 6

We therefore propose that for the 2017 renewal we extend coverage to the whole POL
business. We estimate that the additional cost of the Cyber coverage will be met from
savings under other policies (see 5. above). We are obtaining quotes on this basis.

Are RCC members aware of any claims in respect of risks under our
Professional Indemnity or Directors & Officers Liability insurance or of
regulatory investigations that should be disclosed to insurers?

8. In connection with the renewal of POL’s Professional Indemnity insurance we must
make the following statement to insurers:

Following enquiry, we are not aware of any claims in respect of the risks to which this
insurance relates ever been made against the business or any of the Principals,
Partners or Directors. Furthermore, the Principals Partners or Directors, after full
enquiry, are not aware of any circumstance which might give raise to any such claims.

The cover

From our enquiries we do not believe that there is anything that is required to be
disclosed to insurers. RCC members are asked to consider whether or not they are
aware of anything that POL needs to disclose to the insurers as part of this process.

9. In connection with the renewal of POL’s Directors & Officers Liability insurance we
must make the following statement to insurers:

During the last 12 months, have any claims been bought against any insured persons
or have there been any regulatory investigations into the company where an insured
person has been required to attend?

Directors & Officers Liability insurance covers the cost of compensation made against
POL’s directors and key managers for alleged wrongful acts. Wrongful acts include:
breach of trust; breach of duty; neglect; error; misleading statements; and wrongful
trading.
We have already identified the following regulatory investigations:

Executive Summary

Background

This paper sets out a high level summary of outcome of the renewal of the Post Office
insurances due for renewal on October 1% 2017. The key points to note include:

* This year we currently estimate to achieve like for like premium
isexeva, adjusted to reflect reductions in the size of your business, again with some

vements to your policies.

«All policy cover, limits and deductibles remain unchanged from 2016/17.

«Post Office has not made any claims against its insurances in the past year, largely due to the
significant levels of self-insurance (via deductibles) that you take*.

* Claims Commentary — Post Office has not had a claim that has breached the policy deductibles
in recent years. You have relatively high deductibles which help the reduce premium spend -
but you also have a low frequency of incidents below the deductibles for a company of your
size. This might be regarded as a reflection on the quality of your risk management. Full
details of your claims experience are available if required.
