POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this Post Office Account major incident procedural document is solely to supplement the
major incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident
Procedure with any Post Office Limited specific requirements or requests.

This document outlines the management guidelines to be used for Major Incidents impacting the live
estate in communicating with Post Office Limited.

1.2 Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

2 Guidelines and Interfacing to Post Office

2.1 Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major

2.2. Interfacing to Post Office

« During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Post Office Service Desk. The SMC are responsible for
escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may
initiate communications with the Post Office OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x 7x
365 basis.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

e The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as possible.
This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than Business as
Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate the potential
incident, to the POL IT Service Desk for awareness and monitoring-This is usually done via the
MAC team in core hours.

e The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 9.3) to their counterpart in Post Office.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of the incident, priority, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

e The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘POASeniors' using the trigger **POA** in hours
by the MAC team and ‘POA Seniors out of hours by the SMC and amongst others includes the
appropriate members of the POA Operations Management Team

3 Post Office Account defining a Major Incident

3.1. Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in the
following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- A series of connected lower priority incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as priority 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the priority levels do not always
reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is unable to
trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a priority 1 incident.

For incident classification on Post Office Account refer to the POA Incident Enquiry Matrix
SVM/SDM/SD/0023.

3.2 Horizon Defect Review (HDR) Configuration Items

As a result, of the POA Improvements Incident and Problem Meetings new configuration items related to
the Horizon Defect Review have been added to TfSNow, so that Incidents and Problems related to these
types of defects can be reported against. The new configuration items that have been added are:

eHDR-EXP
e@HDR-FIN
eHDR — OTHER

Once these have added to incidents and problems, reports or Dashboards in TfSNow can be created in
order to aid in tracking such issues through to resolution and provide updates when requested.

Additionally, this will allow for reporting to be produced and provided to the customer with regards to
incidents or problems that have had the HDR configuration item added, thus deeming there is a
requirement to highlight them. These will be discussed in such forums as the Horizon Defect Review
Forum

3.3 Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

3.4.8 Recognising a data breach and collecting evidence

How do you decide if it is a suspected data breach? There is a set of criteria defined by the Working
Party 29.

As per the Working Party 29 (Independent European working party that deals with issues related to
protection of privacy and personal data) Guidelines on personal data breach notification, a security
incident falling within one or more of the following categories should be considered a personal
data breach:

1. unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data (a “Confidentiality
Breach”)

2. unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data (an “Integrity Breach”);

3. accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data (an “Availability
Breach”).

As above the Working Party 29 is now known as the European Data Protection Board.
NB: Please refer to the SVM/SEC/MAN/3807 GDPR Directory (Post Office HNG-X Account GDPR

Directory) held in Dimensions, for details of the Working Party 29 Guidelines. Please refer to sections
2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of the GDPR directory.

subjects (since Horizon is transaction based it may be difficult to supply the number and
category of data subjects but by inspection of data, where available, a best guess should
be attempted. This may involve ATOS where the data has been collected via AP-ADC at

breach. Prior to notifying POL and passing POL the evidence POA and EMEIA DPO will analyse the
evidence to determine if a breach has occurred.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

It is the Post Office's responsibility to collate the three Post Office approvals and clearly state the
requirements being requested of Fujitsu. This may be relevant to an incident or change, the requirements
can be updated on the tracking incident call and the relevant performed. This is usually the responsibility
of the Post Office IT Digital Service Desk, but on some occasions the Post Office MIM or Service
Manager on the technical bridge will arrange for these approvals to be given prior to Fujitsu proceeding
with any actions requested of them.

It is the responsibility of the POA Duty Manager or the Senior Service Delivery Manager to check what
data is being requested to be modified or deleted and that the three POL approvals detail the
requirements unambiguously to allow Fujitsu to perform and complete the request Following this review
authorisation to the relevant support teams needs to be given by the either the Senior Service Delivery
Manager or above in order to safeguard the POA Duty Manager. If approval can't be given and
clarification is required from Post Office then there may be a requirement for the three Post Office
approvals to be requested again.

On some occasions the modifying or deleting of data may come via the Ad-Hoc Report Request or OBC
process, which again requires the three Post Office Approvals. Additionally, this needs to be checked by
the Senior Service Delivery Manager or above to safeguard the POA Duty Manager and approval to
proceed needs to be provided before any works commence.

Also, whichever support team such as the SSC, UNIX or Security team who are performing the activity
will need to conduct an internal impact assessment and then provide confirmation that the actions to be
undertaken will not cause an adverse impact on the relevant environment i.e. LIVE. Additionally, there
might be a requirement for the relevant Development or Architectural resource to review the impact and
provide a statement prior to commencement of any works requested by Post Office.

Validation checks following the deletion or amending of data will need to be clearly defined by the
Support, Development or Architectural resources before the POA Duty Manager or Senior Service
Delivery Manager provides approval to proceed.

If the App Support permission is required then there is a process in place whereby the MAC team raise a
PEAK (raised from the bonded Incident) into the Security team, so it is clear audit that this permission is
being requested, rejected, approved and then removed once the works are completed. For this process
please refer to SVM/SDM/WKI/3670 (HORIZON DATA CHANGES PROCESS WORK INSTRUCTIONS —
Section 2 — Process)

If the App Support permission is not required then there is a process in place whereby the MAC team
raise a C-TASK. For this process please refer to SVM/SDM/WKI/3670 (HORIZON DATA CHANGES
PROCESS WORK INSTRUCTIONS - Section 2 — Process)The MAC team use the document HORIZON
DATA CHANGES PROCESS WORK INSTRUCTION for the process that is required by them in regards
to the three Post Office Approval process. Please refer to SVM/SDM/PRO/4293 (HORIZON DATA
CHANGES PROCESS WORK INSTRUCTION)

The POA Security Operations team have a local work instruction for the processing of App Supp access.
Please refer to SVM/SEC/PRO/0012 (Post Office Account User Access Work Instructions - section 4.2.3)

Out of Hours the normal 3 POL approval process does not apply and the Fujitsu OOH Duty Manager will
only require the POL OOH Duty Manager and Fujitsu Senior Service Delivery Manager approvals to
proceed with the required data modifications.

3.5 Major Business Continuity Incidents (MBCI)

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Service Lead or Senior SDM and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 8 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 8.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

5 Process Flow

As stated in section 1.2 Purpose, this Post Office Account Major Incident Procedural document is solely
to supplement the major incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure so please refer to the EMEIA procedure and utilise the templates
provided within that procedure. These include the Major Incident Report and e-mail templates.

Section 6.3 of this Post Office Account process details the normal Major Incident Communication Flow
agreed with Post Office

When initiating the Major Incident Report, as required by the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure, take into consideration the Post Office specific reporting requirements
detailed in the Post Office Major Incident Report Requirements contained in section 6.4 below.

6 Communications

6.1 Technical Bridge

This is a Fujitsu technical conference for Technical experts and SDU's to discuss and analyse the
incident and to formulate an action plan to restore the service to POL without delay. It should enable the
Technical Recovery Manager to baseline the anticipated response, covering resolution, time and
resources required. This will also include the appropriate owning SDU of the service affected by the
Major Incident.

The Technical Bridge will be set up as required by the Major Incident Manager.

Invitations to the Technical Bridge will be via SMS, email or voice. The SMS will be sent to the distribution
list titled “SMS Technical Bridge’. The SMS text will be sent to technical experts on the POA and will
include outline details of the Major Incident. Also dial in details and the start time will be provided as part
of the meeting invitation.

The Technical Bridge will be started at T + 15 from the trigger, and reconvened at regular intervals during
the Major Incident; the exact scheduling will be discussed and agreed at each preceding Major Incident
Call. The timing of “T+15” for calling a Tech Bridge is for IN Hours only. For OOH the Duty Manager will
be contacted (1 hour reasonable endeavours for response).

The Technical Bridge is chaired by the Major Incident Manager with the recovery managed by the
Technical Recovery Manager.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The Major Incident Communications Manager (MICM) is responsible for ensuring that updates, e.g.,
internal POA or SMS messages to a wider audience are provided at regular intervals, ideally every 30
minutes or longer if an appropriate ETA for the next update relevant to the recovery actions is given.

The MICNM is also responsible for ensuring that the Major Incident within TfSNOW is updated at regular
intervals throughout the major incident, including relevant Technical Bridge updates, for audit trail and
report writing purposes.

A request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate Service Delivery Unit
or Development Leads, who will appoint the appropriate resource to be the TRM. Ideally this nomination
is made at the start of the Technical Bridge and will be a SME and a person who is expected to drive to
the resolution. Throughout the Technical Bridge and resolution of the incident, the individual may change
during the bridge and evolvement. Also, there is a possibility that the role could be reassigned to different
individuals.

Following each Technical Bridge, it is the responsibility of the TRM to agree any actions as follows
-Recovery / restoration actions (which should normally include the TfSNow Change numbers),
-Service Improvement Plan recommendations
-Risk Register recommendations
-Recommendations for any improvements to KB/ Alerting / Configuration changes

The above will be documented in the Major Incident Report which is produced using the MIR Report
template contained within the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident Procedure

6.2 Service Bridge

This is a service focussed call for Service Management (including the Technical Recovery Manager if
appropriate) and POL to discuss the service impact of the Major Incident and to receive updates on the
progress towards resolution. Post Office Major Incident Management may also be the initiators of a
Service Bridge.

The purpose of the Service Bridge is to provide a focussed area from which strategic decisions can be
made regarding a Major Incident.

As a guide the attendance could be made up of the following or their designated representative
depending upon if the incident occurs IN/OOH:

e Post Office (Personnel as instructed by Post Office Major Incident Management or Live Systems
Service Manager)

e The Senior SDM (Chair Person)
* POA Duty Manager IN/OOH
« POA other Service Leads or Senior SDMs
e POALead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
e POA Security Operations Manager (If required)
e POASDM owning the affected service
e Third Party Executives (if appropriate)
Service Bridge responsibilities include:
e Agreement of a containment plan
e Documentation of all agreed actions and timescales with owners

e Consistent management of the Major Incident across all the locations involved

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

6.5 Escalation Communication Protocol

The primary principle:

“Up and Across”

Example:

The Major Incident Manager would escalate up to POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
Management, and across to the Post Office Service Desk.

6.6 Requests to Disable/Re-Enable Training Controls

Training Controls have been added to the HNG-A/X Applications, which control the roles that Counter
Users are able to logon with and the products that they can trade when logged on. Training Controls
manage access in accordance with training curricula data provided by POL's identity management
system. POL have expressed concerns that the training curricula data that they provide could be mis-
entered or corrupted by the systems providing it (supplied by Accenture) so as to cause a
catastrophic/wide-spread loss of access to HNG-A/X Users.

One approach to resolving such a situation would be for POL to Request that POA disabled Training
Controls, completely, and then re-enable the Controls once the training curricula data had been
corrected. Should such a situation arise, it is likely that it would be recognised during a Major Incident
Service Bridge call. Similarly, it would be during a Major Incident Service Bridge call that POL would
decide on Training Controls disablement, over any other courses of action to resolve (e.g. correcting the
data in their identity management system or continuing with limited trading).

N.B. POL requesting us to disable Training Controls during a Major Incident Service Bridge call is NOT
sufficient authorisation to action that request (see below)

6.6.1 Handling Requests to Disable Training Controls

Whilst discussions for requesting disablement of Training Controls might have occurred during a Major
Incident Service Bridge, disablement should not be carried out until a formal authorised request has been
received.

During the Major Incident service bridge call, should the decision be made to disable Training Controls,
the Post Office signatory who will issue the request to disable Training Controls will be identified to
Fujitsu Services. To enable the Post Office signatory to make the request, after the Service Bridge call
POA Duty Manager will send an email to the identified Post Office signatory requiring Post Office to issue
Fujitsu Services with instructions to make a Request to Disable Training Controls and subsequently a
Request to Re-Enable Training Controls.

The email will contain the text below:

7.3 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as

detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu to agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage
(rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the Day Time Duty Manager or OOH Duty
Manager (hours shown in 9.3). However a separate member of the Service Management team may be
appointed as the MIM depending on the situation. The primary role of the MIM in a Major Incident is to
facilitate the management of the Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim
of making the process as efficient and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has
been called, a request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate POA
Service Lead or Senior SDM who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident
Manager acts as the central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the
TRM to focus on the technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is
also responsible for creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be
effective, all updates and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the
timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
*e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in section9.1
and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
Report.

e Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the Post Office IT
Service Desk and the MAC team — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).
e Assists with communication internally within the POA
e Track time lines

e Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions

« Following the resolution of the Incident, schedules and chairs the PIR.

8.3 Role of the Technical Recovery Manager

The primary functions of the Technical Recovery Manager are to co-ordinate and manage the restoration
of service, manage the technical teams, and act as the communication point for the technical teams and
third parties. The function will also include managing all longer term technical corrective actions, e.g.
recommendations for improvements to KBs, eventing and configuration.

The Technical Recovery Manager:
« Manages the technical recovery of the Incident — liaising with SDUs and third parties.

e Provides updates on the recovery, when technicians / representatives of technical teams are
unable to attend the Technical Bridge

e Is the only person to liaise directly with the technical teams, including technical third parties.

« Provides summarised actions from Technical Bridge to the Major Incident Manager, including:
o Current status including impact and risk
o Advising on potential workarounds.

o Planned recovery activities including timelines

o Root Cause Analysis*, corrective actions, and their corresponding action owners and
timelines (where known)

The TRM will be responsible for attending any meetings and providing appropriate root cause analysis
and corrective action detail. This will also include managing any longer term technical corrective actions
that are documented in the Major Incident Report and will include where appropriate:

e Any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

8.4 Role of the Problem Manager

The Problem Manager ensures that corrective actions / investigations are tracked and completed
following the major incident.

and also a Problem Record if appropriate, and tracked with POL through to completion. The updates will
be distributed to Post Office as required, and in the case of a Security Major Incident associated with PCI
failures, the POL Security team will also receive a copy of the report.

As Fujitsu have interfaces with 3° parties such as American Express, then liaising with Post Office
representatives from Service and support teams such as the Payments team as well as 3% party
representatives will be required, in order to contain, remove data etc, so the potential PCI(GDPR data
breaches are resolved in a timely manner and with the required authorisations.

8.5 Role of the Communications Manager

The Major Incident Communications Manager (MICM) will attend the Technical Bridge and produce each
update as agreed during the bridge, where possible trying to ensure that updates are provided on time
and following the agreed Major Incident Progress Template. This will reduce any miscommunication and
ensure all parties follow process.

e Will ensure that updates are provided within the agreed times
e Updates will adhere to the agreed Major Incident Progress Template
e Update the master TfSNow incident with all updates
