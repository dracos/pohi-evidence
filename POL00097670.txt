Subject:Notés for James Arbuthnot / Alice Perkins Pre-meeting

Alice,

Notes for your meeting with James below. Unfortunately, I have not yet been unable to retrieve any more information
on Michael Rudkin.

Regards, Simon

Key Points:
1. The problem areas that Second Sight will highlight on the 25" are not new allegations

2. No information regarding these allegations has been provided to the Post Office — so we will are not able to
respond to the allegations at the meeting

3. The investigation is significantly delayed (now expecting to end in Autumn 2013) and over budget (from £120k
to £300K) — with concerns it could slip further

Questions — areas for discussion:
1. Does the timing of the meeting still make sense?

a. Should we delay it to a time when Post Office has had an opportunity to review the information and able
to respond to MP’s questions?

2. Does it still make sense for a Post Office representative to attend?
a. Weare happy to have someone attend - because we want to support James
b. The Post Office representative will only be attending to listen
c. Does James agree that it does not make sense for it to be Alice or Paula?
3. Can James help us prevent further timescale slippage and budget overruns?
a. Weare concerned about the overrunning timescales and increasing costs (public money)

b. To ensure investigative independence, Post Office has not enforced budgetary or time constraints on
the investigation — we feel these type of boundaries might be better coming from James.

c. We acknowledge the importance for bringing the JFSA along with us — but at what cost?

d. Is there a fit for purpose argument? Should we consider if we can get the same results sooner and for

less?

e. Consider asking Second Sight to complete the investigation before summer recess?

As a Heads up to James

1. So James is clear, these allegations aren’t all from unbiased people. We know at least some of the allegations
are from people who have a history of making allegations against the Post Office
