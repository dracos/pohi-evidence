Tom Beezer notes

Lord Grabiner QC conf’

@ OEC 18 March 2019

2pm — 3.20pm
AGQC
DCQC
Gideon C

- Draft J'ment

- notes

- Agree Neuberger view
- Procedural structure:

- procedure presupposes no arg’ by way
appeal. relationship contracts.
20+ implied terms
danger — serious errors
want to go to CT' appeal
BUT 2" contract underway
Findings impact 2" Trial
Really poor case management

«Case mgnt' barking

* Supposed to be Trial CIT
To determine what contract was
AND implied terms — if any
BUT what he has done >
trespassed into matters for later
stages.
not been able to restrain himself
from straying into later matters.

Finding breaches
Finding facts

Judge investigates these extra matters
despite strike out applic’.

Judge regards extra stuff as relevant he is
investigating. Gone too far.

Judge reaches conclusions w/o POL
evidence.

Judge take leave of senses
Judge forming facts & concluded views
in this mind.

won't be able to shift him from concluded
views. Will be tied to Judgment 1.

is a dogs breakfast

But now sequence of trials

- But have to ask him to recuse

Strong advice to do it = recuse
Strong arguments to support complaint
you have to do it.

1) recusal
2) Adjourn current trial
3) permission CofA

Recusal to be done deal urgency

APPEAL:
Implied term analysis is rubbish
shocking
"relational" contract = codswallop
implication of good faith is developing
but gone too far
BIG important issues

- First point recusal + adjournment
application.
- make ASAP. But prepare.
- Gideon doing schedule:
- what CIT issues are
- Implied terms
Then how J'ment proceeded — how
matters in J'ment by topic went beyond
into later trial areas. (Breach/damages)

Then quotes which reveal concluded

view on POL behaviour.
List it all out.

Jane:

Appeal on law

recusal. Hugely sensitive.
Sensitive given our ownership.
UKGI will not be involved in
overseeing BEIS — Greg Clarke

UKG Investment holds the shares
— They have oversight of POL

POL has been criticised - harsh & oppressive

Number of time
Board worried that look aggressive.

If don't take action will lose.

AGQC

- Board has no choice

- Strong view right course action

- Ithink you have a strong case.

- Ido think serious prospect of success
Judge has done unbelievable nonsense
Judge has apparent bias
Have no choice

Appeal on law w/o recusal goes back
to him. Hopeless.

If no recusal — appeal on law
Court may ask why not ask recusal
DCQC
Real issue is decisions in Horizon trial
are happening now — expert view —
has to decide between — once done
we are stuck with that for all time
for a breach trial.
So if not seek recusal H trial
rolls on. w/o recusal CofA
not urgent — so H trial
finishes and we are stuck with
facts found.
Lord G:
- reputable lawyers say get on with it
do duty to company.
They have obligation to get on with it.
Apparent bias — not actual bias
seems he has reached a concluded view
AGQC — apt no choice. Got v. case to make
applic.
