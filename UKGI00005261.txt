Subject: RE: Sparrow catch up

Mark — sure, happy to chat, probably best first thing (i.e. before 0930, I have a call to do then for an hour). Let me
know what works (I’m in from about 0745 usually).
Avene —I could do 1115-1130 if that works?

Hi Richard

I’ve added Jane to the copy list for this: it would be good to catch up on this: we are meeting with Paula tomorrow to
discuss the meeting so if it isn’t possible for you and Paula to speak before then, can we (myself or Jane) grab a word?

Subject: Sparrow catch up

Hi Avene — we had a catch up with Lady Neville Rolfe today about Sparrow. Paula is seeing her on Thursday morning
first thing(ish) and I thought it might be worthwhile me having a chat with Paula for five minutes over the phone
tomorrow if there is time —I appreciate its her first day back but grateful if we could find a slot, its worth her being
aware of LNR’s mood and position (not that there’s too much to worry about).

Do let me know if there’s a suitable slot. Karen is away tomorrow so please liaise with me directly.
Thanks
R
