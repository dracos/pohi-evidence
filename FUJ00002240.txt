3.2 Derivation and Use of Data

The messages listed in section 3.1 are generally exchanged as a result of a transaction initiated either by a
clerk at a Post Office outlet or by CAPO.

The following table shows the derivation and use of each message exchanged between Horizon NBS and
CAPO in terms of the received message that causes each NBS - CAPO message to be exchanged, and the
transmitted message resulting from the NBS - CAPO message exchange:

Message Sequence
Horizon Horizon CAPO

<[A3] € 0110/0210 [A1]
[Co] > 0420/0421 [E1] >
< 0430 [E2]

The messages exchanged over this interface relating to reconciliation and settlement are initiated by the NBS.

Security key exchange messages are initiated by the NBS and acknowledged by CAPO. The NBS will send a
new working key, for each of its Pls, to CAPO at least once in every 24-hour period. The business processes
with respect to these messages are addressed in section 6.4. The following table shows a high-level
description of the security messages exchanged between CAPO and the NBS. The full list of 0800 messages
initiated by the NBS, and acknowledged by a 0810 response from CAPO, can be found in section 4.2.12.

or when a message fails syntax checking, in order to initiate manual investigation of a problem by either
CAPO or the NBS. CAPO will not generate Administration Advice messages, but NBS will correctly handle
their receipt. The following table shows the possible message flows.

4 Data Items

4.1 Data Item List

4.1.1. General Message Element Definitions and Abbreviations

The following section summarises the list of CAPO Message Elements for each group of transactions, together
with which message(s) they are present in. Each message is classified and identified using the RAC (Request

/ Authorise / Confirm) model. Each message element references the corresponding ISO 8583 bitmap position.

The ISO 8583 bit map reference has been included for ease of reference.

The abbreviations used to describe the format and attribute of each data element (DE) and Data Sub-
elements are shown in the following table (taken from ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1]):

Ih hexadecimal representation of the data
iz track 2 data as defined by ISO 7811 and ISO 7813
x Sign — C (credit) or D (debit)
The Field Size column gives the number of characters (octets) required for the data item, as shown in the
table below.
Abbreviation I Description
3 Fixed Length field. Numeric fixed length fields are right justified and zero
padded. Fixed length string fields are left justified and space padded.
10 Variable length field (up to a maximum of 10 characters in this example).

Notes:
e Fixed length numeric fields are unpacked, right justified and zero filled.
e Fixed length alphanumeric fields are left justified and space filled.
The “Required” column indicates whether the field is Mandatory or Conditional for the messages defined in this

AIS. For conditional fields, the field description should indicate under what circumstances the data for the field
should be populated or omitted from the message.

The “Description” column contains a brief description of the field, as used in the messages defined in this AIS,
together with any additional comments.

CAPO will operate in Mixed case, and will not validate the Alphabetic characters for case in any field.
However, where data is echoed or copied in messages, the echoed/copied fields should be in the same case
as the original field.

The POCA Servers and the NBS Servers both use the ASCII English character set (CCSID = 437).

4.2 Data Interpretations

This section contains the definition of each message type to be sent over this interface. The Message
Element column lists those elements required for the message, and relate to the list in Section 4.1.2.

The Required column in the message definition tables within this section contain the following codes:

Code Meaning

M The element is mandatory and must be present in this message

c The element is conditional for this message, and the condition to be applied is
stated in the Conditions column. If the condition is true, the element must be
present in the message; otherwise the element must not be present in the
message. It should be noted that the receiving system may not be able to
assess whether the condition has been met, in which case it must be able to
interpret the presence or non-presence of the element according to appropriate
business rules.

The Conditions column lists the conditions for inclusion of a conditional message element; inclusion of the
element may depend on details of the transaction type, or simply whether the data is available to the sending
system.

Where Message Elements exist in the ISO8583 standard (1987 Version), [Ref. 1] as either Mandatory or
Conditional, but are not required for the CAPO interface, they have been included in the message definition
tables, but have been shaded out and labelled as “Not required”.

It is essential that developers of this interface also refer to ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1] and the Horizon - Card
Account Mapping, [Ref. 3] for further details of data derivation and use. The message definitions do not
explicitly show the bitmaps as individual message elements, because they are an essential part of the ISO
8583 (1987) transfer structure. However, all messages passed over this interface will include bitmap 1.
Bitmaps will be formatted as binary.

4.2.3.1 Overview

This message is sent by the NBS to CAPO. The message requests a cash deposit transaction —
known at the counter as Withdrawal Correction. It is intended for use as a correction of a previous
withdrawal, but no dependencies are imposed on the interface with respect to the ordering of such
transactions. Entry of the PIN by the customer is required.

The [R3] Financial Transaction Request message maps to the following ISO message:
e 0200 - Financial Transaction Request.
Note, however, the processing code specifies deposit, but with non-standard source and destination

accounts. Both are selected as 09, which is “default - reserved for private use” per ISO 8583-1:2003;

4.2.9 [E41] - Reversal Request

4.2.9.1 Overview

This message is sent by the NBS to CAPO when a financial transaction that has been processed by
the issuer needs to be reversed.

The [E1] message maps to the following ISO messages:
e 0420 - Reversal Request
e 0421 - Reversal Repeat.

Reversal [E1] messages are generated by the NBS. These are only sent to the Fl to reverse a previously
authorised Accept transaction (i.e. [A1]) according to the following conditions:

e The Authorisation [A‘] is late (i.e. is received after the Agent timeout period has been exceeded)

e The transaction outcome at the counter is different to the Authorisation response received at the
counter ([A3]) (e.g. clerk declines to proceed due to suspected fraud)

e The transaction outcome at the counter is indeterminate (e.g. counter has timed out waiting for
response, or ICC failed to complete any script processing)

Reversals [E1] can only be generated when the [A1] message to be reversed can be matched against a
[R3] request.

The NBS prevents duplicate 0420 messages being sent to the Fl.

Reversal Requests may be sent up to a period, which shall be configurable and shall be set initially to
5 days, after the original transaction to which it refers.

Note that partial reversals are not supported over this interface. PIN Change reversals are also not
supported.

Figure 1 - CAPO Message Flows in the Network Banking Environment

A 0620 message may be issued by the NBS in response to all messages from CAPO (for simplicity, only one
such flow is shown on the diagram). Note also that CAPO will not send 0620 messages to NBS; however, the
diagram shows that NBS will correctly process any that it receives.

Reversals (0420 messages) are not sent from NBS to CAPO unless and until an approved response (0210
message) has been received from CAPO.

In the event that NBS does not receive a reversal response within the allotted time interval then the NBS may
send EBT repeat reversals (0421 messages). CAPO will ensure that a reversal is not applied to an account
more than once.

The interface should be resilient to the transfer of duplicate messages; in practice, however, this should only
happen after failure and recovery of either end of the interface.

CAPO will not validate transmission date and time in messages against the date and time that messages are
received.

The interface details are also described in the NBS — POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 10].

5.2 Transfer Structure

The messages defined in this AIS will be exchanged in accordance with ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1], which
describes the use of Message Type Identifier, Bit Map and Data Elements in the message structure. Note that
the messages exchanged over this interface do not use the third bit map or any of its supported data
elements. Note also that the Bit Maps are transferred in binary.

6 Security of Transmitted Data

The security standards for the NBS — CAPO interface are described in the NBS — POCA Technical Interface
Specification, [Ref. 10].

6.1 Protected Data

PIN blocks that pass across the interface from NBS to CAPO are encrypted under an Acquirer Working Key
(AWK). This key is used in the NBS - CAPO shared security zone. PIN Blocks encryption is translated from
the other security zone keys to protection under this shared key using a hardware encryption module. The PIN
blocks are never rendered in clear outside the hardware module.

Acquirer Working Keys (AWKs) are exchanged electronically encrypted under an Acquirer Zone Master Key
(AZMk) shared between NBS and CAPO. To facilitate import of the AWK into the CAPO systems, the AWK
is encrypted using Atalla variant 1 as defined in [ATCRM]. The AZMK is generated and owned by CAPO. The
AWK is owned and generated by the NBS.

6.2 Encryption and Decryption Methods

PIN Block and Acquirer Working Key transmission is protected by Triple DES double length keys, 112bit plus
key check data.

All data transmitted on communication lines between the NBS and CAPO as described in the NBS - POCA
Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 10].

6.3 Session Establishment

Session Establishment will be initiated by the NBS. Initial Logon message exchanges are followed by
transmission of a new AWK by the NBS to CAPO, with a key check value protected by encryption under the
shared current AZMK.

CAPO verifies the key and acknowledges it to NBS. All PIN Block data is protected by this AWK until the
session ends or the AWK is renewed.

The only messages categorised as “must deliver” are Reversal Request (0420/0421).

6.4 Key Management

Key ownership is described in section 10 of the document Horizon - EDS Operational Level Agreement, [Ref.
6]. See also section 6.7 of the document NBX - POCA TIS, [Ref. 10]. NBS - CAPO Zone Management Keys
are managed in NBS.

NBS:

e Manages secure logon of key holders & the key manager

e Accepts entry of key components & verifies component check digits

e Generates the AZMK from the key components & verifies the key check digits

Keys component documents must be stored and transported separately and securely.

The CAPO — NBS AZMK is renewed every six months by the process described above. The AZMK, having
been produced as described above, is securely transported to the NBS. The NBS and CAPO operations will
agree a time for key promotion. Promotion by both parties will be preceded by telephone coordination. After
promotion of the new AZMK the NBS operator will initiate an AWK exchange under the new AZMK using the
AWK Key Change sequence. This will provide online key verification of the AZMK. If this online key
verification procedure is successful the promoted AZMK will be confirmed as the current AZMK. If the AWK
exchange is unsuccessful manual procedures initiated by NBS and CAPO operators will revert to the old
AZMK.

CAPO requires more than one Processor Interface (PI) to support the transaction throughput for the NBS. For
this configuration each PI will be configured to support two TCP/IP socket connections. A logical session will
be initiated by a logon, and data for that session will flow over both socket connections belonging to that PI
(see the NBS - POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 10] for further details). Each PI generates a
NBS — CAPO Acquirer Working Key (AWK) which it sends to CAPO for validation. This AWK, if validated by
CAPO, is used by both socket connections between CAPO and the NBS PI that generated it. Logical sessions
for a different PI will use the AWK generated by that PI. All NBS Pls will protect their AWK in transit to CAPO
by encryption using the same AZMK, during its six months of currency. The AWKs are changed under the
following conditions (note that it is not necessary to change the AWKs as soon as the AZMK is changed).

e Every 24 hours where the session remains active (an AWK may be changed at a set (configurable) clock
time and will remain valid until it is changed)

e At-session initiation by NBS
*  Onreceipt by CAPO of a 6" invalid PIN block on a session
e When an NBS operator requests a key change.

Work Load Distribution between the Pls will be performed by the NBS at the application level. To ensure that
the correct AWK is used, PIN block translation must occur after PI selection.

The Acquirer Zone Master Key is verified electronically after it has been transferred manually in component
form. The Acquirer Working Keys are exchanged and verified electronically. The network management
(0800/0810) messages used to perform these functions are described in detail in the following sections:

7 Operational Procedures

7.1 Processing Cycles

This interface relates to online and batch message exchange to support real time financial transactions, and to
the daily transmission to CAPO of the REC file.

Stale messages are logged and discarded before transmission or on receipt, as appropriate and no further
processing takes place.

The timeout associated with each message type is addressed in NBX Business Parameters, [Ref. 7].

“Must deliver” messages are retransmitted at parameter intervals until delivery is successful, as described in
NBX Business Parameters, [Ref. 7].

Transfer Initiation

All transfers defined in this AIS are automatic.

7.2 Security Procedures

Manual Procedures are required to support the above key management protocol, as described in Section 6
above.

7.3 Fallback Procedures

Fallback procedures are described in the NBX — POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 10]. Each
system is responsible for its own recovery after failure. Restoration of the interface and the disposal of stale
messages (other than “must deliver” messages) is expected to be automatic. 0100, 0200, 0110 and 0210 ([R]
and [A]), 0620, 0800 and 0810 messages awaiting transmission at the time of failure can safely be discarded,
as the integrity of the transaction is protected by timeouts. However, 0420 and 0421 ([E]) messages are to be
treated as “must deliver” and therefore must be transmitted on recovery.

7.4 Control

The interface must be resilient to duplicate messages, which may occur after recovery of any element in the
system, but are not otherwise expected to occur.

Lost or discarded messages are handled by timeout processing at every stage of the message sequence, to
ensure that incomplete transactions are declined if unauthorised or reversed if authorised.

The NBS will log events affecting this interface (e.g. response indicating receipt by CAPO of an invalid PIN
block) to an Event Log. These events will be managed by Tivoli for escalation to the relevant Help Desk, as
appropriate to the code associated with the event.

NBS-EBT Interface — ICC Data Field
Field 055 - ICC Data
Format

h.. 510
LLLVAR

Des

n

ICC Data (Field 055) is used to transport chip-specific data over the network. It will be present in all
authorisation requests, if POS Entry Mode (Field 022) indicates that the transaction was chip-initiated (value
05’).

Structure

Field 055 has its own generic structure and may contain one or more Private Data Sub-elements (PDSs), as
shown in the figure below.

‘LLL’ 'VAR' - up to 510 bytes
one or more PDS occurrences
3 bytes 2 or 4 bytes 2 bytes variable length
Data PDS Tag PDS Length PDS Data
Element
Length
Length Data Zone

Data Element Length specifies the total number of bytes in the Data Zone immediately following it.

Data Zone contains the ASCII representation of each hexadecimal digit (i.e. nibble) of the chip data to be
transferred; this comprises one or more PDS occurrences.

Each PDS corresponds to an EMV data element/object and comprises the following sub-fields.

PDS Tag 2 or 4 byte ‘tag' value (ASCII hexadecimal), identifying the EMV data object contained in
the PDS. The second two bytes are present only if the first byte is odd (‘1’, ‘3’,.....’B’, ‘D’,
‘F’) and the second byte is 'F’.

PDS Length 2 bytes, specifying the length (in bytes) of the PDS Data immediately following it,
expressed as an ASCII representation of a decimal number (e.g. ‘12’ means the integer 12)
in the range 1 to 99.

PDS Data Variable between 1 and 99 bytes, containing the actual data from the corresponding EMV

data object (as identified by the PDS Tag).
The PDS structure is referred to as Tag-Length-Value (TLV), as defined in the EMV standards.

Note that PDS's may appear in any order in Data Zone. The order shown in the table below corresponds to
that in which the relevant fields are input to the ARQC verification algorithm.

PDS's for Card Account
The PDS's required for Card Account transactions (passed in the NBS-EBT On-line Interface) are listed in the

following table. Note that the lengths shown in the table assume that all PDS Data is ASCII representation of
either hexadecimal digits, or decimal digits.

PDS Tag I Length I Comments
(Bytes)
Application Cryptogram 9F26 16 Contains an ARQC (ASCII hexadecimal)
Cryptogram Information Data 9F27 2 ASCII hexadecimal
Transaction Amount 9FO2 12 Format n12 (ASCII numeric), set as follows:
e Requested Amount for Withdrawal with
Balance, Withdrawal Correction and
Deposit
e — Product Limit for Withdraw Limit
e ‘000000000000’ for Balance Enquiry and
PIN Change
Terminal Country Code 9F1A 4 Format n4 (ASCII numeric, set to ‘0826’)
Terminal Verification Results (TVR) 95 10 ASCII hexadecimal
Transaction Currency Code 5F2A 4 Format n4 (ASCII numeric. 1* character
always ‘0’)
Transaction Date 9A 6 Format n6 (ASCII numeric YYMMDD)
Transaction Type 9c 2 Format n2 (ASCII numeric)
Unpredictable Number 9F37 8 (ASCII hexadecimal)
Application Interchange Profile (AIP) 82 4 (ASCII hexadecimal)
Application Transaction Counter (ATC) I 9F36 4 (ASCII hexadecimal)
Issuer Application Data (IAD) 9F10 12 This PDS comprises the following:
e Derivation Key Index (2 bytes) (ASCII
numeric)
e  Cryptogram Version Number (2 bytes)
(ASCII hexadecimal)
e Card Verification Results (CVR) (8
bytes) (ASCII hexadecimal)
Maximum Total PDS Data length 84

The total length of Field 055 is 151 bytes, calculated as follows:

Field 055 Data Element Length 3
PDS Tags 40
PDS Lengths 24
PDS Data 84
Total 151
