                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT ENQUIRY




             FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JONATHAN LONGMAN




I, Jonathan Longman, will say as follows —


 1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the

    "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 13 October 2023

    (the "Request"). The Request contains 64 questions, which I have addressed

    below.    I would like to make the Inquiry aware that I have received legal

    assistance to produce this statement from my solicitor, Mr Ian Manners of

    Ashfords LLP. When seeking to obtain assistance from Ashfords LLP, I was

    assisted by the Post Office with the initial stage of confirming the availability of

    insurance coverage, to cover the associated legal costs.



 2. The Request relates to matters that occurred many years ago and some of the

    documents provided to me are over 20 years old. As such, I have sometimes

    found it difficult to recall precise details. However, everything that I include in this

                                       Page 1 of 58

                                                                                    WI TN04670100




    statement is to the best of my recollection and where I cannot recall something or

    I have had to rely on a document provided, I have ensured to state this clearly.




Background


 3. I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd (POL) and I worked within the business

    for approximately 36 years. I first began working for POL in 1980 and I left in

    2016. During this period I held a variety of roles. My first role was as a counter

    clerk at a local Crown Office for around 2 to 3 years. I then transferred to the

    local Head Office in Watford where I carried out a variety of roles in different POL

    departments which included accounts work, processing wages, postcodes and

    TV Licensing. I then joined the POL Security Team in 2000 as an Investigator

    where I remained until around late 2012 or early 2013. I deal with what my

    Investigator role entailed further below. I then worked in the POL Network

    Transformation Team until I left the business in October 2016. This role involved

    meeting subpostmasters (SPMs) who wanted to leave the business to discuss

    their leaving package, as well as meeting SPMs who wished to stay in the

    business to discuss how we would reinvest government funding POL had

    received into the branch.



 4. 1 confirm that the qualifications I hold are all those listed in my CV at

    [POL00126360]. With specific reference to my Certificate in Management

    Studies, Diploma in Management Studies and membership of the Association of

    Accounting Technicians, I believe that I obtained these at some point between

    1983 and 1990.

                                                                                       WITNO4670100
                                                                                     WI TN04670100




5. I recall that at some point in the year 2000 POL advertised vacant roles for Post

   Office Investigators in the Security Team. I cannot recall if the job listing required

   any necessary qualifications to apply for the role, but I imagine some experience

   working within the business was desired. I applied for the role internally, sat an

   interview and was successful. I recall that I had to travel up to Birmingham for the

   interview and stayed overnight. I believe it was a type of assessment day but

   cannot recall what I did other than there was an interview during the process.



6. When I first started as an Investigator in the Security Team I remember being

   given various work books to complete as part of my training for the role. I cannot

   remember all the specific areas that these workbooks covered, but I think they

   covered obligations under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE),

   interviewing, conducting searches on premises, giving evidence in court,

   disclosure and what our role entailed in general, including the duty placed on

   Investigators to follow all lines of enquiry during an investigation.




7. I also attended a course very early on in the role which ran for about 5 weeks,

   which again covered the areas I have mentioned above. I believe that I also went

   on a separate searching course. Unfortunately I cannot remember the exact dates

   that this would have been. There were two trainers running the course, one was

   Mick Matthews but I cannot recall the other trainer. I don't recall any formal exams

   at the end of the training. We were being continually assessed and I think it was

   the trainers decision as to whether we passed or not. I recall that I did pass.

                                                                                      WI TN04670100




8. I also received further training as an Investigator in the Security Team by way of

   shadowing. When I first became an Investigator I did not run any investigations

   of my own. I would attend an investigation with a more experienced Investigator

   or my Team Leader to assist and observe them until I built up enough knowledge

   and experience to run an investigation myself. I cannot remember the point at

   which it was determined that I was experienced enough to run an investigation of

   my own. The Team Leader would have made the decision as to when I was ready

   to carry out my own investigation as they would allocate the cases. I have tried

   hard to recall how many weeks or months may have passed until I began my own

   investigations and which was my first investigation to help establish the potential

   timeframe, but unfortunately I cannot remember.



9. I provide further detail in relation to my training under the following section of this

   statement — "Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the

   Security team"



10. 1 have been asked to set out what I understood the role of an Investigator to

   involve. I always considered the role to be one where I would be required to carry

   out criminal investigations against any POL agents or staff who were involved in

   potential criminal or fraudulent activity against the Post Office, for example, in

   cases of theft of POL stock and money, false accounting, and pension benefit

   fraud. I would be required to obtain evidence during the investigation, put together

   a casefile and complete a suspect offenders report. Where I was a lead

   investigator on the case I would usually see the case through to the end of a

   prosecution if one was commenced.


                                      Page 4 of 58
                                                                                     WITNO4670100
                                                                                   WI TN04670100




11. During my time as an Investigator I generally worked within a team of around 6

   or 7 other Investigators who covered a geographical area and we would report to

   a specific Team Leader. Over the years the geographical areas I covered

   changed and I had various Team leaders during my time as an Investigator. The

   main Team Leaders I can remember are Paul Dawkins, Manish Patel, Lester

   Chine, Geoff Hall, David Posnett and Jason Collins.



12. 1 never had any concerns about the competence or professionalism of any of my

   managers or colleagues during my time working within POL. Some naturally had

   greater knowledge than others depending on their previous experience within the

   POL (for example, some were ex-branch managers and had very good general

   knowledge of Post Office processes and procedures) but overa►l I believe that all

   of my managers or colleagues were professional and competent.



13. My role as an Investigator in the Security Team had no involvement in disciplinary

   matters. I believe that disciplinary matters were dealt with by Contract Managers.

   On some occasions I may have spoken to a Contract Manager to get further

   background information on a matter I was investigating (although I cannot recall

   a specific example of this), but I would have no further involvement in any

   disciplinary matters that may be running alongside the investigation. I believe that

   it would be the relevant Contract Manager for the area who would initiate a

   suspension of an SPM following an incident involving potential criminal liability

   and then finding a replacement SPM to enable the branch to continue operating

                                                                                   WI TN04670100




   if required. I have no further knowledge of how disciplinary matters were

   progressed, managed or decided.



14. 1 also had no involvement as an Investigator in litigation case strategy. I believe

   it would have been the POL Legal Team who considered this.



15. 1 was regularly involved in interviewing individuals who were identified as

   potentially committing a criminal offence against POL during my role as an

   Investigator. I would always carry out those interviews in accordance with the

   duties set out in PACE.



16. I was also involved in assisting with the disclosure steps in criminal proceedings.

   For example, in cases that were being prosecuted and I was the Investigator in

   that matter, I would assist the POL Legal Team by compiling a committal bundle

   of all the evidence in the matter which I think was used and referred to in court

   hearings. I would also complete schedules of unused sensitive and non-sensitive

   material. I would then send the committal bundle and schedules over to the POL

   Legal Team for their review. Sometimes they would come back and make

   requests to move things around in the committal bundle or to notify that a

   document was on the wrong schedule. Unfortunately, I cannot recall any specific

   case examples of this but I do vaguely recall that happening on a couple of

   occasions. I believe that I only ever assisted with gathering disclosure in criminal

   proceedings — I never made any final decision as to what should be disclosed to

   the defence, and I do not recall ever disclosing anything to the defence directly.

   The solicitors in the Legal Team would have been responsible for this.

                                                                                    WI TN04670100




 17. In terms of liaising with other Post Office departments in respect of the progress

    of cases, I cannot recall a►l of the departments this may have included but I do

    believe that I would have liaised with the POL Legal Team to this regard. As

    explained above, on cases I investigated I would have been assisting the POL

    Legal Team with gathering documents for disclosure and sending disclosure

    schedules across to them. It was also not uncommon on cases being prosecuted

    for the Legal Team to request Investigators to obtain further evidence such as

    further witness statements, so I would sometimes liaise with them in these

    circumstances. Another department I may have liaised with to progress a case is

    Chesterfield (the Financial Division of POL). I would have liaised with Chesterfield

    to see if there were any transaction corrections that might mitigate a cash

    shortage. I would also contact the National Business Support Centre (NBSC) at

    Chesterfield to see what requests for assistance or problems the subpostmaster

    may have raised and whether it had any relevance to the loss under investigation.

19. I cannot remember any of these documents from direct memory and I note that

   some of them postdate my time working within the Security Team as an

   Investigator. For those that were produced within the period I was an Investigator,

   I imagine that I would have received them once circulated, but due to the passage

   of time I am unable to recall.



20. The organisational structure of the Security Team changed many times during my

   time as an Investigator. I cannot recall what all the changes were but I do recall

   that in my geographical team there were normally 6 or 7 Investigators and we all

   reported to a Team Leader (the names of which I have set out above). I believe

   that our Team Leader would have reported to a Senior Manager in charge of the

   Investigation/Fraud strand, who would in turn report to the Head of Security. I

   cannot pinpoint from memory who would of held these specific roles and at which

   point because those individuals also changed over the years. However I can

   confirm that it did include Dave Pardoe who was the Senior Security Manager of

   the Fraud strand who reported to John Scott who was the Head of Post Office

   Security and managed all the other Senior Team leaders from other strands

   relating to Post Office security.

                                                                                      WI TN04670100




21. As well as the Investigatory/Fraud strand, I think there were also 4 or 5 other

   strands in the Security Team. I cannot remember what all of these strands were

   but I know that one related to physical security which dealt with alarms, locks and

   security doors at branches. Later in my career a Financial Investigation Unit was

   also introduced within the Security Team and they would deal with the recovery

   of financial losses faced by POL when a crime was committed against the

   business. I cannot remember when the Financial Investigation Unit was

   introduced. I do also recall in my early days as an Investigator that there was a

   Case Management team who were based in Croydon who dealt with

   administrative matters, but they were later disbanded. Unfortunately I cannot

   recall when this occurred.



22. Although there were various changes to the organisational structure of the

   business, the crux of my role as a Criminal Investigator remained constant

   throughout and the changes did not affect me. The only major change to my role

   occurred around 2011 or 2012 when Criminal Investigators took on the additional

   work of physical security at branches.



23_ I cannot recall having any involvement in the development or management of

   any of the policies listed in paragraph 18 above. I believe it is likely that these

   policies would have been produced by someone more senior to me, but I do not

   know who.



24. I am unable to recall all of the legislation, policies and / or guidance that governed

   the conduct of investigations conducted by the Security Team during my time as


                                      Page 11 of 58
                                                                                   WI TN04670100

   an Investigator. The main legislation that I was trained to adhere to was PACE. I

   also have a vague recollection of being required to understand duties under the

   Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. I am sure that there were other Acts

   that I was made aware of but I cannot recall these in detail. In terms of internal

   POL policies, I imagine that those that were relevant to the role of Criminal

   Investigators (including those listed in paragraph 18 above) were circulated, but

   as explained above, I cannot directly remember when they were circulated. I

   believe there would have been updates to policies and guidance over the years

   but again, I am unable to recall when this would have been and what those

   updates were. What I can confirm is that any time a policy was circulated to me I

   would have read it and followed it.



25. I am unable to recall what the process was for dealing with complaints about the

   conduct of an investigation by the Security Team. I do not believe I ever received

   a complaint against me personally, and I do not remember ever being involved in

   any complaints that were raised against the Security Team as a whole. I note that

   there is document provided to me titled "Royal Mail Group Security - Procedures

   &   Standards -     Standards    of Behaviour     and   Complaints    Procedure"

   ([POL00104806])_ I cannot recall seeing this document. However, I can confirm

   that for every Court Case where I or my colleagues gave witness statements, a

   background check would always be made to see whether any individual had any

   convictions.



26. In terms of receiving supervision, Criminal Investigators in the Security Team

   could go to their Team Leaders for advice and support if they were unsure how


                                   Page 12 of 58

                                                                                   WI TN04670100




   to progress a matter or just needed to run something by them to ensure the

   correct steps were being taken. All of the suspect offender case files that were

   completed by Investigators would always be reviewed by our Team Leaders to

   make sure all necessary steps had been followed. Our casefiles would also

   undergo compliance checks to ensure that they were in order before they were

   passed over to the POL Legal Team. I cannot recall who carried out these

   compliance checks or who passed the casefiles on to the Legal Team. It may

   have been the Case Management Team and then when they were disbanded,

   our Team Leaders. However, I cannot say this for certain.



27. I do not ever recall having direct supervision from any of the individua►s who were

   Senior Management of the Investigation strand or the Head of Security Team

   during my time as an Investigator. I am not sure if our Team Leaders may have

   sought advice from these individuals when reviewing an Investigator's casefile.



28. I do not recall that there was any Post Office policy that meant that Crown Office

   employees who were investigated and/or prosecuted were treated any differently

   to SPM's, their managers or assistants. I think the policies and practices were the

   same for both throughout my time as an Investigator.




Audit and investigation



29. I confirm that I have considered the document "Condensed Guide for Audit

   Attendance" at [POL00104821]. There are two circumstances that I can recall

   where an Investigator would attend an audit. Firstly, if an ongoing investigation

                                    Page 13 of 58
                                                                                     WITNO4670100
                                                                                   WI TN04670100




   (for example, relating to suspected pension benefit fraud) had identified a fraud

   at a branch, then an Investigator would make a request for an auditor to attend a

   branch to carry out an audit. The investigation team would also attend in that

   scenario to inform the offender of the circumstances and to begin carrying out

   any necessary investigations in accordance with PACE. Secondly, Investigators

   would be called out to a branch if during a routine audit a large loss had been

   discovered by the audit team. I cannot recall what the figure was to trigger the

   need for Investigators to be called out to an audit shortage but I think it may have

   been losses over £1Ok.



30. Where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a Post Office branch I

   believe that it may have been Team Leaders for the geographic area that the

   branch was in who would make the decision as to whether a criminal investigation

   should be carried out and on what timescale. The reason I believe this is because

   whenever I attended a branch in this scenario, the instruction to do so would

   always come from my Team Leader, as did the allocation of the particular case. I

   don't think Team Leaders had to first receive authority from Senior Management

   or the Head of Security before allocating matters and instructing Investigators to

   attend the audit.




31. I believe it would have been the Financial Investigators who would be responsible

   for deciding whether a case was taken forward as a debt recovery matter. I do

   not know what the exact criteria was to take it forward for this purpose. I only

   know that it was the Financial Investigation Team who dealt with the recovery of

   losses faced by POL as a result of a crime committed against the business, and

                                    Page 14 of 58
                                                                                      WITNO4670100
                                                                                    WI TN04670100




   their involvement came after the conviction of the individual who committed such

   crime.



32. When an auditor discovered a discrepancy or large shortfall at a branch, I believe

   that the Contracts Manager for the area would also be informed alongside the

   Team Leader. I think it was common for Team Leaders to contact the Contract

   Manager in these circumstances in order to gather as much information about the

   Post Office branch in question and the SPM operating it. I do not think the

   Contract Manager played any role in deciding whether a criminal investigation

   should take place. As explained earlier in this statement, I believe that Contract

   Managers only dealt with disciplinary issues relating to whether a suspension was

   required and if a temporary SPM was needed to fill the role.



33. 1 cannot recall what the triggers were for raising a fraud case following the

   identification of a shortfall or discrepancy in a branch. I suspect that the amount

   of shortfall or whether there was any evidence of false accounting may have had

   some influence or formed part of the criteria. I cannot remember if the triggers

   were different for raising a theft or false accounting case either or if the criteria

   ever changed during my time as an Investigator.




34. In terms of the processes followed in an initial investigation, once an audit

   shortage had been discovered and a decision had been made to conduct a

   criminal investigation, generally the Lead Investigator would contact the Auditor

   on site to establish the facts and obtain any relevant information surrounding the

   shortage before attending. The Lead Investigator would then attend the branch

                                    Page 15 of 58
                                                                                   WITNO4670100
                                                                                 WI TN04670100




   with one or two other Investigators. Some of the Investigators would speak to the

   audit team about the information they had obtained and would review the

   printouts and balance sheets from the Horizon System_ The Lead Investigator

   would then speak with the identified suspect to inform them of the reason for the

   investigation, to caution them and to go through and sign off various paper work.

   I cannot remember what all the paperwork that we went through was but I do

   recall that some of the documents related to the suspect's legal rights, whether

   they wished to have a 'Post Office Friend' present, and seeking permission to

   carry out a search if consensual searches were required. Following this, a taped

   interview under caution would be conducted with the identified suspect in

   accordance with PACE, during which evidence such as the Horizon printouts and

   balance sheets would be referred to.



35. Following attendance at the branch the Lead Investigator would then be required

   to complete a suspect offender report in line with the template pro-forma used by

   the POL Security Team, and would put together a casefile with copies of all the

   evidence obtained. As explained above, casefiles would be sent to Team Leaders

   for review and eventually they would be passed over to the POL Legal Team. On

   some occasions the POL Legal Team would send casefiles back to our Team

   Leader if further information or enquiries were required, for example, extra

   witness statements. It would then be up to the Lead Investigator on that matter to

   obtain that extra evidence.

                                                                                    WI TN04670100




Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings




 36. Once a case file had been passed over to the POL Legal Team, I believe that the

    solicitor who was allocated the matter would review it and make a decision as to

    whether the SPM, their manager(s) and / or assistant(s) or a Crown Office

    employee could be prosecuted by the POL. The solicitor would also state what

    charges would be most appropriate to pursue. I do not know what considerations

    determined whether a prosecution was brought other than there had to be

    sufficient evidence and it had to be in the public interest. I believe the solicitor

    would set out this decision and their reasoning to the Senior Security Manager of

    the Investigation/Fraud strand for them to review the casefile and authorise the

    decision to prosecute or not. I think ultimately it was the Legal Team who would

    decide on the sufficiency of evidence in a case and draft charges, but it was the

    Senior Security Manager of the Investigation/Fraud strand who would decide

    whether a prosecution should be commenced. I believe this is how the decision

    making process was implemented throughout my career as an Investigator.



 37.I do not recall Contract Managers ever being involved in deciding whether a

    prosecution was brought or not. As explained earlier in this statement, Contract

    Managers dealt with any disciplinary matters running alongside an incident. They

    would deal with terminating the suspected individuals contract if deemed

    necessary and would organise bringing in a new temporary SPM in to the branch

    in question, so that services could continue.

                                                                                  WI TN04670100




38. I do not know what test was applied by those making prosecution and charging

   decisions and therefore I cannot comment on what factors were considered at the

   public interest stage.



39. I do not know what advice, legal or otherwise was given to those making

   decisions about charging and prosecution. In a suspect offender report

   Investigators could express an opinion as to whether they thought there was

   sufficient evidence for a prosecution or not (based on their findings), but these

   opinions did not dictate the next steps that were taken. As stated above, I believe

   it was the POL Legal Team who would decide whether there was sufficient

   evidence to pursue with a prosecution, with the Senior Security Manager of the

   Investigation/Fraud strand approving that decision. I do not think that the Head

   of Security would have got involved in this decision making process.



40. I do not know the circumstances in which steps to restrain a suspect's assets by

   criminal Enforcement methods such as confiscation proceedings were

   considered. This was dealt with by the Financial Investigation Unit. Criminal

   Investigators did not really overlap with this team as Financial Investigators

   tended to get involved after a conviction was obtained and the prosecution case

   had come to a close. I think sometimes Financial Investigators would contact

   Criminal/Fraud Investigators to simply get some background information about

   the case.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team



 41_ As set out earlier in this statement, when I first became an Investigator I had to

    complete various work books and attend a 5 week training course. In doing so I

    believe that I did receive training and guidance on :

          i) interviewing a SPM / SPM's assistant / Crown Office employee who

              was suspected of a criminal offence;

          ii) taking witness statements in the course of an investigation;

          iii) conducting searches in the course of an investigation;

          iv) the duty on an investigator to investigate a case fully;

          v) obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation;

          vi) an investigator's disclosure obligations;

          vii) drafting investigation reports to enable a decision to be made about the

              future conduct of a case.




 42. 1 also recall that I also attended Thames Valley Police HQ and carried out an

    additional search awareness course.



 43. In terms of obtaining third party evidence, I think I would have learnt about this as

    I undertook different case types and from shadowing more Senior Investigators.

    In terms of evidence from Fujitsu in particular, I cannot remember how training

    and guidance on this was given to Investigators. I must have received some sort

    of guidance on this as I do remember that if data from Fujitsu was required in an

    investigation then the onus was on the Investigator to obtain this through the


                                      Page 19 of 58
                                                                                       WITNO4670100
                                                                                     WI TN04670100




   correct process. I remember that I would have to fill out a form requesting the

   period of ARQ data that was required, and this would have to be signed off by a

   Senior Manager in the Security Team, before being submitted to Fujitsu. ARQ

   data (transaction log data) was very useful information to have for a variety of

   Investigations. This data could show which user was logged onto the Horizon

   system and what transactions they had conducted. Therefore, this data could

   help with many types of Post Office fraud such as Post Office Card Account

   Fraud, Postage Label Fraud, Green Giro Fraud, Benefit Fraud etc.



44. When it came to drafting investigation reports, as well as having initial training on

   this through the 5 weeks course, we also had a pro-forma template to follow which

   assisted Investigators with setting out their findings. The template was often

   tweaked during my time with the Investigation Department. As mentioned earlier

   in this statement, a completed report would be subject to review by compliance

   checks to identify any failings.



45. With obtaining evidence, I believe that we would have been taught in initial

   training about the general sort of evidence that would need to be acquired.

   However, the necessary evidence to obtain would be slightly different depending

   on the type of criminal investigation. For a new Investigator the evidence required

   would probably also be relayed by working closely with a more experienced

   Investigator and through advice from a Team Leader.



46. I confirm I have considered the following documents provided in relation to this

   subheading:

      i)     The Casework Management document at [POL00104747] (version

             1.0, March 2000) and [POL00104777] (version 4.0, October 2002);

      ii)    Dave Posnett's email dated 23 May 2011 at [POL00118096] and the

             documents contained within the attached compliance zip file at

             [POL00118108],[POL00118109], [POL00118101], [P0L00118102],

             [P0L00118103], [POL00118104], [POL00118105], [POL00118106]

             and [POL00118107].



47. I cannot recall whether I received the 2000 or 2002 version of the Casework

   Management document listed above. From my review, the guidance given in the

   second, third and fourth bullet points on page 2 of the 2000 version and the first,

   second and third bullet points on page 2 of the 2002 version suggest that any

   procedural failures relating to products should appear on a separate report to the

   suspect offender report in an investigation. I believe that if Horizon integrity was

   offered as a reason for a shortfall during an initial investigation then I would have

   thought that this this would have been included in the main suspect offender

   report. This is because I considered the Horizon IT system to be an independent

   operating system and not a POL product. I do not believe I ever experienced a

   scenario where Horizon integrity was offered as a reason for a shortfall during an

   initial suspect offender interview, but had I experienced this, I would have thought

   it was something that the POL Legal Team should be aware of so I think I would

   have included the information in the Suspect Offender report.

48. Compliance checks of investigations were introduced to ensure that Investigators

   were consistent in putting together their suspect offender file. I cannot recall who

   carried out these checks but I would have thought it was likely to be the Team

   Leader and early on possibly the Case Work Management department before

   they got disbanded. I recall at one point a new form was introduced with a

   compliance score system, so case files were critiqued. I cannot remember when

   this was.



49. I do not believe that I had any role in relation to the development, management

   and any amendment of the suite of compliance documents attached to the email

   from David Posnett dated 23 May 2011.



50. 1 have reviewed paragraph 2.15 of the document entitled "Guide to the

   Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports

   & Discipline reports" [POL00118101]. The instructions/guidance given suggests

   that any security, supervision, procedures and product integrity should be

   highlighted in the offender report in bold text. As mentioned previously, if Horizon

   Integrity issues were mentioned to me during the initial investigation I believe I

   would have recorded this in the offender report as a matter of course. However I

   don't think I would have done it under this particular instruction because I did not

   consider it to be a POL product. As stated above, I cannot recall any suspected

   individual saying to me during an initial investigation interview that the Horizon IT

   was at fault so it is difficult for me reflect on the relevance that paragraph 2.15

   had in relation to POL's disclosure relating to information about Horizon bugs,

   errors and defects.

51. I do not know who drafted the document entitled Identification Codes" at

   [POL00118104] and I do not recall ever seeing this form. I concur that it has been

   drafted in an entirely inappropriate manner. I do recall that at the end of a suspect

   offender interview an NPA form had to be completed which required the

   identification code of the offender to be entered, but it did not look like this. I recall

   there being references to ICI, IC2, IC3 etc, which I think related to a specific

   identification code. I think the reason why Investigators had to complete

   identification codes was so the suspect's details could be entered onto the police

   national database if a successful conviction ensued.



52.I have considered the email from Dave Pardoe, dated 30 August 2011 at

   [POL00121772] and the attachment at [POL00121773]_ I recall that `Project

   Golden' was a special investigation into our Financial Service Specialists (FSS)

   who operated out of Crown Office Branches. I believe there was a concern held

   that some of the FSS's were manipulating their sales figures by signing up friends

   and family to certain products and then cancelling those products. Investigators

   were asked to conduct interviews with FSS's and submit reports to the relevant

   Post Office stakeholders. I cannot recall what training was given on this at the

   time but I suspect it was to do with how FSS's carried out their role. During Project

   Golden I only carried out the interviews, completed the reports and issued the

   reports to whoever was dealing with the disciplinary side.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship with

Fujitsu




 53. When I was an Investigator I do not recall an SPM ever attributing a shortfall to

    a problem with the Horizon System at interview or during the rest of the initial

    investigation stages. In the Seema Misra case, this potential issue was not raised

    until around a year later. As such, it is hard for me to say what analysis of ARQ

    data would have been undertaking in such circumstances. As mentioned earlier

    in this statement, ARQ or Transaction Log data supplied by Fujitsu gives an

    Investigator information about who was logged onto the Horizon system and what

    transactions they had carried out. I can only comment from a hypothetical

    standpoint - had an SPM told me during an initial investigation that they thought

    a shortfall discovered was due to an error with Horizon, I believe that it is likely I

    would have asked the SPM when the discrepancies started to occur and whether

    there was a specific transaction that they made that had not been accounted for

    properly by the Horizon system. If a certain timeframe or specific transaction was

    identified then ARQ data could have been requested. Just for clarification ARQ

    data and transaction logs are one and the same. However, I think it would have

    had to be Fujitsu who undertook a thorough analysis of any ARQ and other data

    they may hold in this scenario as they were trained to understand the

    programming and how the IT operating system worked, so they would be in a

    much better position to understand where an error may have occurred and why.



 54. As I never experienced a situation where a SPM attributed a shortfall to problems

    with Horizon during the initial investigation stages, I do not know whether ARQ

   data was requested from Fujitsu as a matter of course in this situation, nor do I

   know if such data was provided to that SPM. I know that in the case of Seema

   Misra that the defence team were provided with ARQ data when a potential

   problem with the Horizon system was later raised during the trial, but I had never

   experienced a case previous to this where the integrity of Horizon was questioned

   and ARQ data being required for that reason. Previous to this case, the reason I

   would request ARQ data usually fell down to needing to know who logged on to

   the system at certain times to see who carried out a specific transaction. For

   example, with a suspected pension benefit fraud Investigators would want to look

   at the transaction log data.



55. Whenever I did need to request ARQ data from Fujitsu, my main contact was

   Penny Thomas. However, in the Seem Misra Case I also liaised with Andy Dunks

   at Fujitsu when it was raised at trial that there was a potential error with the

   Horizon IT system. I believe that Andy Dunks' role was to analyse fault logs

   where an SPM had reported issues with the Horizon system. I do not know if I

   ever liaised with Andy Dunks before this case. I also think that my only contact

   with Gareth Jenkins from Fujitsu was during the Seema Misra trial. Gareth

   Jenkins provided a witness statement for the trial and also attended to give live

   evidence. I comment further on the case of Seema Misra under the following

   section of this statement — "Prosecution of Seema Misra. "



56_ Following a review of the documents provided to me, I believe that I would have

   understood at the time that Gareth Jenkins was an expert witness from Fujitsu

   who would provide an expert opinion on the integrity of the Horizon IT system in

criminal proceedings. The reason I believe I would of held this understanding is

because of the language used in the email chain at [FUJ00152889]. In my email

to Jane Owen and Andy Dunks dated 1 December 2012 in that chain I state "I

attach a report from the defence expert where he has highlighted a number of

problems with the Horizon system. Our barrister, Warwick Tatford has asked that

the problems with Horizon that he has raised in his report are replied to in a

witness statement form. I presume that an employee of fujitsu would have to

produce the witness statement". As I used the words `defence expert,' in this

email I believe that it is likely that I would have thought that any witness statement

produced in response (as was being requested by POL's barrister Warwick

Tatford) would also be from an expert. The email illustrates that I presumed the

appropriate person to produce this witness statement in response was someone

from Fujitsu. I believe I would have said this because it needed to be someone

who could address the problems raised in the defence expert's report relating to

Horizon_ I would have thought that someone from Fujitsu would have been best

placed to do this, as they would understand the Horizon system and

programming. I note that later in the chain at [FUJ00152889] on 17 December

2012 Penny Thomas also refers to Gareth Jenkins as "our expert" to Jane Owen,

and Jane forwards that email to me later that day. Although I think I would have

understood Gareth to be an expert witness, I was not aware of any specific rules

governing independent expert advice and I cannot recall if I was given any advice

or was assisted in this regard.

Relationship with others


 57.I cannot recall any involvement that I may have had with Cartwright King

    Solicitors. I note that one of the documents provided to me mentions Cartwright

    King Solicitors, but this is dated 2013 and I had left the Security Team by then. I

    think that all my prosecution cases were dealt with by the Post Office Legal Team.




 Prosecution of Seema Misra


 58. Prior to receiving the Request I did have a good general recollection of the

    prosecution of Seema Misra, however, the documents provided to me in relation

    to this case have helped me to recall the more specific details. In terms of my

    involvement in the case, I was either asked by my Team Leader or the Lead

    Investigator to attend West Byfleet Post Office on the 14th August 2008 to assist

    with an audit shortage that had been reported. The Lead Investigator on the

    matter was Adrian Morris, I was the 2nd Investigator and a 3rd Investigator (Lisa

    Allen) also attended. From direct memory I could remember that the shortage was

    for an amount of around £77,000.



 59. I arrived at the branch the same time as Lisa Allen. Adrian Morris was already

    there, but I am not sure how long he had been there before we arrived. I believe

    that prior to Lisa and I attending, Adrian Morris had already spoken to the Audit

    Team to get background information on the shortage and had identified that the

    suspect offender was Ms Seema Misra. Once Lisa and I had arrived, Adrian

    Morris explained the amount of the shortage to Ms Misra, cautioned her and

    explained the steps of the investigation that would happen during the rest of that

                                                                                       WI TN04670100




   day. Ms Misra was then taken through the necessary forms to be completed, for

   example, the legal rights forms, search consent form, and the form relating to

   whether she wanted to have a Post Office Friend present.



60. Following this, a search of the flat upstairs was undertaken on a consensual basis.

   I then assisted Mr Morris with conducting a taped interview under caution with Ms

   Misra. After the interview I then left the Post Office and the suspect offender

   report and casefile was put together by Adrian Morris.



61. I cannot recall the date but following a long period of absence by Mr Morris I was

   asked to take over the casefile relating to Ms Seema Misra. I think the decision

   to charge Ms Misra had already been made by Post Office Legal Services by this

   point. My role from then on was to arrange for summonses to be issued and

   oversee the case through the court process. I recall that at the first hearing at

   Guildford Crown Court, Ms Misra and her defence team informed the Post Office

   Legal Team that a not guilty plea would be entered and that Ms Misra was

   attributing the audit shortage amount to issues with the Horizon system. Following

   this there were requests made by the defence for further documentation to be

   produced relating to the Horizon system data. I was tasked with requesting all

   the data that the defence were asking for from the relevant people and I made

   sure to do so. This did not always mean that all data was provided without further

   question, and I deal with this in further detail below. I also recall that I facilitated

   a visit to West Byfleet Post Office so that Ms Misra and her defence team could

   view the Horizon system and hardware at the branch.

64. As described above, I first became involved in the Seema Misra case on the 14th

   August 2008 when I was requested to attend West Byfleet Post Office to assist

   with an investigation following the discovery of a cash shortfall by Post Office

   Auditors. My initial involvement was to assist the Lead Investigator, Adrian

   Morris, with the suspect offender interview with Ms Seema Misra on the 14th

   August 2008     I remember that Ms Misra was very cooperative and pleasant

   during the interview. At one point she did get upset during the questions asked,

   but she confirmed that she was ok to carry on. I was also present when a search

   was carried out of the flat above West Byfleet Post Office. Again, Ms Misra was

   very pleasant and cooperative during this. The search was consensual and no

   items were seized. I cannot recall anything further about the search.



65. As the 2nd Investigator, I was only assisting Mr Morris as the Lead Investigator

   during the interview conducted with Ms Misra. It was Mr Morris who would have

   asked the majority of questions. My role was to ensure that Mr Morris completed

   all the required legal forms and that all relevant questions were asked.



66_ Unfortunately I cannot recall what pre-interview disclosure was provided to Ms

   Misra.



67.At the time of the interview there was no mention made by Mrs Misra that the

   Horizon IT system was responsible for the cash shortfall.

68. It is my understanding that it was Mr Jarnail Singh (the solicitor who was in the

   POL Legal Team dealing with the case of Ms Misra) in conjunction with the Senior

   Security Manager of the Fraud/Investigation strand who made the charging

   decision. This also seems to be indicated in the memo from Mr Singh at

   [POL00049658]. I note that the email chain at [POL00119335] indicates that I

   was spoken to by Warwick Tatford about whether the case for theft was strong

   enough. I can't remember that conversation but I believe it would have been

   simply a conversation whereby Warwick set out his thoughts to me on the matter

   and as per his email, asked me to make further enquiries into the individuals that

   the defence say committed the thefts. I cannot remember who those individuals

   were. I do vaguely recall that Dave Posnett said he lived near those individuals

   and he went to see if they still resided at the specific address to see if they would

   be contactable. However, they no longer lived there and no forwarding address

   was available for them. I believe Dave Posnett told me this verbally, but it may

   have been by email. The most recent email in the chain at [POL00119335] is

   from Philip Taylor to me and indicates that Mr Singh agreed to Mr Warwick's

   analysis that the case for theft was strong enough.



69. 1 have no direct recollection of who authorised the prosecution of Ms Seema

   Misra. However, I have reviewed the email chain at [POL00049716] and this

   appears to confirm that it was Dave Pardoe. Whilst it was the POL Legal Team

   who ultimately dealt with the prosecution, I believe it was standard practice to

   liaise with a Senior Security Manager of the Fraud/Investigation strand for his/her

   agreement to proceed with a prosecution.

71. As indicated by the schedules of material signed off by me at [POL00050750]

   and [POL00050751], it is clear that I gathered and organised the necessary

   disclosure schedules for the committal bundle in this matter, which I can only

   assume means that I was the Disclosure Officer. However, I would like to point

   out to the Inquiry that I did not realise at the time that I had this official title. I would

   have provided the committal bundle, copies of witness statements, copies of

   exhibits and disclosure schedules to the POL Legal Team to review and they

   would have dealt with providing disclosure to the defence team. I would not have

   had any involvement in providing disclosure to the defence team.

                                                                                WI TN04670100




72. Once the defence had attributed the shortfall discovered to a problem with the

   Horizon system, ARQ data was then requested in the case of Ms Seema Misra.

   The emails at [FUJ00153007] indicate that data for the period 1st December 2006

   to 31st December 2007 was retrieved from the Horizon system, and I made the

   request for this data based on advice from the POL Legal Team.



73. I believe I was the only person responsible for collating disclosure for the

   committal bundle in this matter and it was me who actioned all further disclosure

   request made by the defence to the relevant departments. The documents

   produced to me in relation to the case of Seema Misra confirm this. As explained

   above, some requested disclosure was provided and some was not. If requests

   were not forthcoming then I would have reported this back to the POL Legal Team

   for advice. I don't have a view on the merits of the disclosure requested.



74. It is my understanding that that the amount of ARQ requests that the defence

   wanted was deemed excessive as the defence wanted to see around 3 years'

   worth of data — I requested this data but as seen in the email from Dave Posnett

   in the chain at [POL00107662], there were concerns held in relation to how much

   of the POL's data request quota would be used up. I cannot recall my reaction to

   this email from Dave Posnett. From hindsight I imagine I would have thought it

   was a larger than usual request as I was aware that POL had a contract with

   Fujitsu where only a certain number of ARQ requests would be provided without

   further costs being incurred by POL. As you can see in the email chain, I simply

   referred to the Legal Team for advice.

75. I cannot recall how Penny Thomas' involvement came about in the case of

   Seema Misra, but I do recall that she provided ARQ data together with a witness

   statement. Gareth Jenkins became involved so that he could produce a witness

   statement in response to the defence expert's report and be called to give

   evidence in relation to the integrity of Horizon. My understanding is that Penny

   Thomas was more junior to Gareth Jenkins in that she carried out more of the

   administrative roles for Fujitsu. For example, she was the key point of contact to

   request ARQ data when required and her statements would provide an account

   about the provision of such data requests in cases. I believe that Gareth on the

   other hand would not have dealt with these administrative matters. I understood

   him to be a Senior Manager within Fujitsu as he provided more technical witness

   evidence on issues raised about the Horizon system. In the case of Seema Misra

   I was asked to go to the Fujitsu Head Office (which I believe was near

   Maidenhead) to take a witness statement from Gareth Jenkins. I cannot

   remember who asked me to go and take this statement — I imagine it was the

   Legal Team. When I arrived Gareth told me to leave it with him and that he would

   produce a written statement and send it over. I vaguely recall further down the

   line going to a meeting at Chambers. Document [FUJ00153368] suggests that

   the meeting took place on the 5t" October 2010 and that Gareth Jenkins, Jarnail

   Singh, Warwick Tatford and myself were the attendees. I cannot recall if anybody

   else was present.



76. I cannot recall giving any direct instructions to Mr Jenkins. I imagine his

   instructions came from the POL Legal Team and Counsel, Warwick Tatford. As

                                                                                   WI TN04670100




   stated above, I was asked to go and take a statement from Mr Jenkins, but in the

   end he produced it himself. I am sure that I probably read through Mr Jenkins'

   statement once provided, but I cannot recall having any views on it, nor providing

   any comments on it. I think it would have been Counsel who would have reviewed

   and critiqued Mr Jenkins' statement. The email chain at [FUJ00153371] seems

   to indicate this as it shows Warwick emailing Mr Jenkins on 7 October 2012 which

   says "Please find attached your draft with my comments in red." Mr Jenkins then

   replies to Warwick on the same day and says "Thanks for the feedback. I'll try

   and amend as suggested once I've finished my further analysis."



77. The emails produced to me in relation to this prosecution do refer to Mr Jenkins

   as being an expert witness in this case, examples being [FUJ00152871],

   [FUJ00152889], [FUJ 00152897] etc. As he was referred to by others as an

   expert then I would have considered him to be one. I am unaware of what the

   difference would have been between an expert or lay witness. I do not recall any

   information that was given to him by me in relation to the role of an expert witness

   and the duties he owed to the court if he was an expert witness. I don't think it

   would have been my role to give him this information. I am not sure who would

   have had that role.



78. I cannot recall anyone from Fujitsu or POL explaining to me that there were bugs,

   errors or defects in the Horizon system that would make the system unreliable,

   during the Seema Misra case or at any other time. I always thought the system

   functioned correctly. Had I been told otherwise I would have raised my concerns

   during an investigation.

79.I cannot recall whether Mr Jenkins expressed any views in relation to the

   disclosure being sought by the Defence and the relevance of the material sought

   to the case.



80. I confirm that I have considered the document [FUJ00153132] which refers to

   the duplication of the ARQ records found in this matter. I had no understanding

   about the duplication of the ARQ records other that it was said to have had no

   bearing on the accuracy of the Horizon data. As such, I do not think I would have

   held a view as to the impact of this had on the case.



81. I have reviewed the attendance note at [POL00053849] dated 27 January 2010

   and the comment within it that states "Jon Longman has been chased on Horizon

   but this has not been in hand at the moment". Unfortunately due to the passage

   of time I cannot recall what this is in reference to. I can only assume that I was

   still waiting for some information I had requested from Fujitsu, but I cannot say

   this for certain.



82. I cannot provide an account from direct memory of the requests for access made

   by the Defence on 22 July 2010 and the response provided by POL, Therefore I

   am relying entirely on the documents produced to me with the Request.

   Document [UKG100014898] illustrates that I requested the said information

   sought by the defence but this seems to have been deemed unnecessary by

   Chesterfield and the POL Legal Team. It appears that I was told that the Defence

   would have to make a Section 8 application to the court for this information. I do

   not think I was entirely sure what a section 8 application was, I was simply

   following the advice given to me.



83. I cannot recall what criminal enforcement proceedings were taken against Ms

   Seema Misra. As explained above, Recovery of losses faced by the POL as result

   of crime committed by an SPM was something that Financial Investigators in the

   Security Team dealt with



84. Other than my involvement described above, I had no further involvement in the

   prosecution of Ms Seem Misra. I believe that by the time sentencing took place,

   Adrian Morris had returned to work and he attended the sentencing hearing.



85. I have considered [POL00055759] and [POL00055590]. Unfortunately I cannot

   recall what my view of the outcome of this case was at the time.




86. I have reviewed the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton &

   Others v Post Office Limited [2021 EWCA Crim 577 at [POL00113278]. Upon

   reflection on this case, I do not think that I would have done anything differently.

   The initial investigation and interview under caution where I assisted was all

   carried out in accordance with PACE and I believe we acted in accordance with

   how we had been trained to conduct investigations. Following my review of the

   offender report completed by Mr Morris during the initial investigation, it all seems

   compliant.

 87. The record of interview with Ms Misra illustrates that she had admitted to entering

    incorrect data on to the Horizon system (which is false accounting) and she

    explains that there had been theft committed at the branch by past employees. A

    year had gone by before any issues were raised by Ms Misra's Defence team in

    relation to the integrity of the Horizon system — had any issues in relation to the

    reliability and integrity of the Horizon System been raised from the outset then I

    believe the direction of the investigation would have been different. I believe that

    it would have been a concern and a line of Inquiry that needed to be addressed

    before any decision in relation to charges and whether to prosecute was reached

    by the Legal Team.


Prosecution of Julian Wilson


 88. I confirm that I have reviewed the following documents in relation to this case:

          i) The audit report, dated 11 September 2008 at[POL00050062];

          ii) The record of the interview at [POL00044804] and [POL00050138];

    the criminal proceedings that followed against Mr Julian Wilson. From a review of

    the documents provided to me in, I can see that this matter was allocated to Gary

91_ It appears that after the conviction of Julian Wilson was already obtained, I was

   called to a meeting with solicitors dealing with the enforcement proceedings and

   I was asked if I could obtain ARQ data costings from Fujitsu where SPMs were

   not repaying money to POL for the loss suffered. I think that the reason they were

                                    Page 44 of 58
                                                                                     WI TN04670100
                                                                                   WI TN04670100




   not paying back the losses was because they were attributing the losses to issues

   with the Horizon IT system. I believe the ARQ data was requested by their

   defence teams. In total there were four Post Offices for which ARQ data costings

   were requested. They were, Alderley Edge, Astwood Bank, Hockley and Splott

   Road.



92. I cannot recall that I was aware of any allegations made by Mr Wilson about the

   reliability of the Horizon IT system until I was requested to deal with defence

   disclosure requests relating to ARQ data, as described above. I cannot recall who

   or why I was asked in particular to assist with obtaining these Defence data

   requests. All I can say is that the above emails illustrate me making those

   requests to Fujitsu, so I was clearly asked to do this



93. I cannot recall who was present at the meeting I had with solicitors, nor what was

   discussed. I can only rely on what I have included in my email at [FUJ00155051].

   I have been asked to explain what I meant when I said in this email that the feeling

   from the meeting was that a lot of the requests for information were unnecessary

   and should be challenged. I cannot recall directly what I meant by this and I do

   not know who raised this concern in particular. I can only assume that the concern

   related to the fact the requests being made by the Defence were large and as

   explained above, POL had a contract with Fujitsu where only a certain number of

   ARQ requests would be provided without further costs being incurred by POL.

94. I do not know who made the decision to request an undertaking from Defence

   solicitors to pay the costs of retrieving data from Fujitsu and cannot recall what

   my view was of this.



95. I confirm that I have reviewed [FUJ00225264]. It is clear from my emails in this

   chain that I was asked to obtain further horizon data, but I needed to get a costing

   estimate for such information_ I cannot recall being aware of any of the email

   discussions in the chain after my initial two. The remainder of the emails appear

   to be internal ones between Fujitsu employees.       I cannot recall if I was made

   aware by Fujitsu employees of the concerns being discussed in such emails.




96. Other than my minimal involvement post-conviction (as described above) I had

   no further involvement in the case of Julian Wilson.




General



97. At the time, I do not believe that I considered a challenge to the Horizon system

   in one case to be relevant to other cases. As explained earlier in this statement,

   it was never confirmed to me that there was a definite fault with the Horizon

   System. As such, I was under the impression that the system was operating as

   expected.



98. Other than the matters referred to above, I do not wish to bring any other matters
