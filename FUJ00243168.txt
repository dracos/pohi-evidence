Dear Cerian
Thank you for your message. I am well, thank you. I do hope that you are keeping well too.

In terms of a meeting in the coming weeks, would either of the weeks commencing 20 or 27 May 2024 work for you? I
am afraid I am travelling with work the week before that.

In the meantime, I recall from our last meeting that you or your colleague Ms Farragher were considering whether to
provide Fujitsu more information about the location and time-period of the matter you are investigating. We discussed

that this could assist in identifying records of potential relevance to your investigations. I will of course look at this
before our meeting if this is something that you are still minded to do.

Best regards

Good afternoon Chris,
Hope you are well,
Could you let me know your availability over the next few weeks to arrange a meeting,

I have spoken with Danny Saunders today in regards to the investigation and we have a few questions we would like to
ask you in relation to Fujitsu. We have been advised we need to go to you directly rather than through the Post Office.

Dear Cerian

I have been passed your message by the team within Fujitsu Services Limited that looks after the delivery of contractual

services to Post Office Limited in relation to the Horizon System.

lam a solicitor in Fujitsu’s legal team and thought it appropriate to reach out to you directly given the legal nature of
your request below. I should mention that I am a part of the legal team supporting Fujitsu Services Limited as a Core

Participant in the ongoing Post Office IT Horizon Inquiry.

Would it be possible to have a call by telephone or on teams to see if you are able to share with me more information
about the context for the request for a statement on the reliability of the current version of the Horizon system?
