Dear Mandy,
Thanks for your email of 8 January.

I have told Mr Castleton that we will let him cross examine Ruth Simpson and Anne
Chambers

again provided that costs be in the case (i.e whoever loses the trial in principle has
to pay the

assessed costs). He is not willing to agree that (see attached fax - I suspect he is
getting some

informal legal advice).

My view is that despite our concern that his questions will be irrelevant, we have
tried to

accommodate him by recalling these witnesses. Its almost as though he wants us to
oppose his

a pplication so that he can then say he didn't have a fair go.

I propose to ring him and say that unless he is willing to agree that costs be in the
case, then

we will oppose his application to resume the trial and will not have the witnesses

present on
Thursday. Do you agree?
Kind regards.

Subject: RE: Draft Skeleton for Approval
Thanks Richard.
J ust a few minor comments:

1. On p48 at D of the transcript for 13 Dec 06, Anne Chambers says that when she looked
at

the Tivoli log she saw "Nothing out of the Ordinary. I saw the event which gave rise to
that one

call that we decided is completely irrelevant..." I wonder if we should mention this in
your

skeleton? I'll leave it to your discretion.

2. Para 15, should we say we don't object either "subject to the question of costs", or

"subject

to costs being in the case"?

3. There's a typo in para 15 - hambers instead of Chambers
Kind regards.

Gear Sir

Post Offict Limited v Yourself

Claim number NQObxQ2Z706

Thank you for you' letter dated 5 January 2007 antl received today.

We do not accept that the Yivoli lag contradicts Mrs Bimpson's evidence with respect to
her adlons on i

A pril 2004, or that even iP IL* does, this has "a serious impact on the Integrity of
the system! and the

balances"(or indeed any impact at all). Tt is irrelevant to the outcome of this case
end In any even!, you

were Suspended on 23 March 200 ,

Similarly, Mrs Chambers previously stated in evidence that when she examined tho TIYo~(
Event log at the

me she savo "nothing ouC Gf the ordinary, only the event Chat gave rise to ehe one
thing'that Is

srelevant", We therefore doubt that you can reblly wise any new relevant polrts with

her,

It is not even clear that the Tivoli Log
should be disclosed

s within the category of documents that

pursuant to CPR 31.6. In the circumstances, we remain concerned about the cost,
proporti0~ality and

relevance of r~~alling witnesses that have already been released. However, we have
6poke~ to both Mrs

Simpson and Ms Chambers who state that they would be willing to attend Court on 11
Janu~ty 20p7.

P.cc~rdingly, we will ask them to be there and we will nOt oppose your application,
provided Chat iPthe

j~~dge gives permission for them to be cross examined again;

(a)

you complete their gross examination on the day; and

(b)

the costs of your application should be in the caée.

Pleasq confirm khat you agree to p~inte (a) and (b) above.

We are copying this Pax to the Court and look fgrward to hearing from you as soon as
pos~fble.

9TH January 2007.

Dear Stephen,

I am writing in reply to your letter dated 8~*
January 2007.

Thank you for not. opposing my application to re-open this case
with reference to the 'Tivoli Lod. Whilst I understand your co~lcern
with reference to cost and. proportionality, I am perplexed by your

issue with relevance. Ms. Chambers told the court that in her opinion
it was relevant, having now had sight ofthe document 1 believe that it
has relevance. I am of course glad. that both witnesses have indicated

there intentions to attend.

nally with respect la;

a,of your letter 8~' January 2007. I can of course confirm that

my questions to he put to each witness will last no longer than 45
minutes each witness.

b, As I'm sure you understand, I would not have had to make

this application had any document that your witness intended to use
in evidence been disclosed to all parties. Having considered your
request for "costs in the case".1 see no reason that the costs should
be in the case and believe that this should be a matter for the Court.

Yo

F "thfully

Lee Casdeton.
