+ LA opened the meeting by thanking the Minister for his time, and outlined the areas he believed the
Minister should prioritise, these included:

o Working closely with @Secretary of State DBT (DBT) and HMT.

© The issue of redress, with a view to cut down bureaucracy as there are still a large number of
those who have not put in claims.

© Appeals mechanism for the HSS for the non £75,000 claimants.

© A potential meeting with Kevin Hollinrake MP or sitting in with SoS. MT noted this will need to be
thought through given the leadership race.

© The issue of MoJ presumption of computer evidence.

© Litigation funding (PACCAR).

* MT agreed, noting that he would like to also meet with each member of the advisory board.
ACTION - @Minister THOMAS (DBT) Josh to set up in September.
