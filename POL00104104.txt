Dear Mark,

Thank you for the email. Please find attached, a revised version of the report. This (a) takes account of the typos etc
you identified; and (b) adds a new footnote at §118 to mention the latest information provided by Fujitsu. The reports
now re-dated with today’s date.

If there are any matters arising please give me or Chris a call.

Regards,

Jonathan
