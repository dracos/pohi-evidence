evidence is attached in the form of messagestore-dat files for both servers where the missing sequence numbers were found.

butput from RQuery has also been found in the form of Excel spreadsheets.

[fhe missing message numbers seem to have occurred on or about 8am on the 14th Oct 2005, for both servers but the gaps between
these message numbers seem to vary even though they occurred at the same time.

je need an investigation into the possible cause of the gaps happening at both servers at the same time on the same day. We will
Jalso need to know if there is any other possible way of getting the missing data from other audited sources.

[fhe last comment should have read:
"John has found that the data does NOT in fact exist in the message store.”

However the Me:

sage ID's missing from the message store exist in the retrieved TMS files. Then they appear to be missing once the
lgenerate messagestore process has completed.

[fhe Generate message store is created from "Agent_Load Audit _Data.exe" created by the Agents team. It takes the TMS files and
turns them into a messagestore.dat file for use by RQueryUK (an audit application).

[the TMS file mentioned above has been found to contain a record with some non-ascii characters in it. These characters are
treated as End-Of-File by Agent Load Audit Data causing the agent to stop processing that file and move on to the next - hence
the missing records in the reconstructed message store.

[the suspect record is for Group=5868, Id=3, Num=2242256 and the hex character '1A' occurs at the end of attributes
land RawData in the record. We think these characters may have come from a bar code reader.

Ite investigation ie continuing to discover:

h) where the offending hex '1A' character came from

2) whether the audit utilities can be amended to handle it

lHowever it should be possible to circumvent the problem by removing the offending record, which is not part of the audit data
that is needed from the audit file : FNO1 TMS Cluster2W W_5 20051013 18151400 V001.arc.

lit should then be possible to run the audit utilities and obtain the required data.
tt does not look as if the audit file contains any other records with a hex '1A' character.

[Start of Response]

[fhe immediate problem has been solved by providing an copy of the audit file with the offending record removed on a CD.

it is proposed that a complete solution should be provided by producing a version of Agent Load Audit Data which reads audit
files in binary mode.

such a version of the program will see the CR + LF pairs in the audit file and will have to remove the CR.

lan experiment has been run to prove this approach and load a message containing the hex'1A' character into Riposte.
