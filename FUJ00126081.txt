Subject: RE: HNGX update

Mike

Thanks for the update. I gave Mike Young my personal commitment to continue to resource the plan properly to
completion when I met him last Thursday.

Mike acknowledged that his team was now reporting progress to him but he and I agreed that it was still early days and
we need to jointly work hard to maintain progress. I would like you/Andy to arrange for me to take the key members of the
Programme Team out for a few dinks after work sometime before the end of July to thank them for their commitment over
recent weeks.

Regarding the change in MD of PSD, please do not discuss this with the PO team at Bracknell for now. Roger Gilbert has
a call scheduled with Mike Young on Tuesday afternoon to discuss this.

Thanks also for your commitment to continue working full time at Bracknell until October. It is much appreciated.

Regards

Peter

Subject: HNGX update

Peter,
Heads up on progress towards HNGX migration in October.
Key points

The Plan

Alan is doing an excellent Job in driving milestone completions; he is managing the expectations of Mark Burley very well
giving him verbal daily updates in advance of the progress reports to head off Mark's PO team giving potential misleading
information. Key milestone list for July enclosed.

Disaster Recovery

DR testing A was carried out in June with some remedial action to be addressed in the July DA test B run in July. The
importance of this is that DA test A was originally run in March of this year and was an unmitigated disaster. This has
given a level of confidence to the PO that we do have a robust plan that is capable of delivery.

PEAK Clearance

Major activity underway to review all PEAK’s. All A category PEAKs (60+) are presently being reviewed for inclusion in the
live release. The B category review is starting today, with up to 300 to be reviewed this will take time to complete. When
this exercise is complete we will then be in a position to start to develop our thinking around the go live release and future
maintenance release content.

Testing

The clearance of PEAKs down to a manageable level is one of the key drivers both in Development and Infrastructure but
it does create the inevitable bottleneck in testing. Debbie is focusing attention on PEAK testing, this is a concern but I'm
confident that with the addition management head in her team we will get this under control.

Commercial Acceptance
Work is underway on the commercial re-alignment of the final solution in readiness for the Acceptance Gateways. This is
no small task as we collate all the CP changes to enable the CCD to be updated so the PO clearly understands what they

are getting. The activity is being driven by Guy Wilkerson with all the engineering responses being co-ordinated through
Ravi in the Project Office.

Programme Head for the Account

I would like to understand the Post Office reaction to a new MD for the Business Unit before I progress with this action. I
have this on my “to do list” but it must be timed so as not to raise the concern of the customer and nothing will happen
without your involvement Peter. One observation I will make is that Alan D’Alvarez is definitely stepping up to the
challenge for HNGX.

My time on the Account

As discussed I will stay focused on the PO Account until Migration in October. Paul Goodge is fully aware of this and
accepts the situation. I will use Jon Grainger to address the urgent HoP activities in support of the other PSD Accounts as
required.

Overall I remain confident that we can achieve the migration in October subject to any major issue hitting us over the next
few weeks. One of the main reasons for this is the change of attitude of the delivery teams. There is a definite “we can do
this” attitude developing on site which is a combination of everyone being able to see the plan, the timescales and the
progress to date. To add to this Debbie now being full time on the Account and the introduction of a new team leader is
having a very positive impact on the test area which is key to the success of this programme.

Regards
Mike
