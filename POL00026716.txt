CHAIRMAN’S FOREWORD

Helping our customers meet
their needs - traditional and new

"We have made
good progress
in our ambitious
programme to
transform the
Post Office

Alce Perkins
Chairman

nt

In this second Annual Report since the

Post Office became an independent business,
we describe the progress we made in

the year 2013/14 towards our goal of
commercial sustainability.

We have taken significant steps forward in four

important areas

+ Publishing a new strategy through to 2020
and securing funding from our shareholder,
Government, through to March 2018

Increasing our operating profit (including

our Network Subsidy Payment) before
exceptional items

+ Making big strides in transforming our network
+ Working with the people who deliver our
business and with our external stakeholders

in new mutual ways to engage them directly in
how we improve the running of our organisation

“We have defined the unique role
of the Post Office as a commercial
business set apart by a fundamental
role in connecting communities and
helping them thrive and prosper.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 /14

These achievernents were secured in a challenging
commercial market and we were unable to achieve
the revenue growth to which we aspwed However,
by improving our effictency and taking more cost
out of the business we achieved the increase in
operating profit before exceptional items set out

in this report Thus includes a reduction of the
losses in our Crown branches

Our new strategy, Securing the Future (published
in Novernber 2013), sets out the path we will

take to achieving commercial sustainability while
remaining at the heart of communities and further
developing our digital presence We will continue
to be a trusted partner, helping our customers
meet their needs — traditional and new

The fact that Government has settled our funding
through to March 2018 1s most welcome This

gives us certainty against which to plan the
further investment needed to complete our
transformation of the network and the discipline,
which we welcome, of reducing our reliance on
taxpayer subsidies

The way most people will experience the
transformation of the Post Office 1s by going
into one of our modernised branches We have
now transformed around 2,000 of our agency
branches and almost a third of the Crown
network Over 1,000 branches are now trading
on a Sunday and we are now open for an
additional 50,000 hours a week
We are also working with our people and
stakeholders in new mutual ways, with the
aim of improving engagement, increasing
focus on customers and becoming an
organisation that truly listens and learns
from those with an interest in the business
We demonstrated this commitment to broad
engagement by establishing the Post Office
Advisory Council, chaired by Tim Franklin,
one of our non-executive directors The Advisory
Council, which met for the first time in March
2014, will play an important role by giving

us the benefit of a cross-section of views,
skills and experience from the diverse
communities that have a stake in the

Post Office in the 21st century

We also completed work to define our public
purpose as a business during 2013/14 This
important work 1s a further example of mutual
ways of working the statement was drawn

up following a comprehensive process of
consultation and engagement with customers,
staff, subpostmasters and stakeholders For

the first time it describes the unique role of the
Post Office as a commercial business set apart
by a fundamental role in connecting communities
and helping them thrive and prosper We will
continue to embed this purpose across our
business and mark our progress in future reports

I would hke to thank the Post Office Chief
Executive, Paula Vennells, her team and all
the people who work so hard to support the
business as we continue along the path to
commercial sustainability I would also like to
thank my colleagues on the Board for their
work in supporting and challenging the Post
Office as we undergo this period of change
We were sorry to lose Susannah Storey, our
first Shareholder Executive representative,
from the Board and look forward to working
with her successor, Richard Callard

the sustainability of the Post Office can take
comfort from the steps we have taken so

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW

A unique organisation with
a unique role in national life

"We need to
ensure that we
are putting the

customer first
every time

Paula Vennells
Chief Executive

The Post Office is changing, and the benefits
are becoming more evident

The 2013/14 financial year saw the number of
branches we have transformed exceed 2,000,
delivering longer opening hours and brighter
retail environments to customers across the

UK These branches, and our plans to drive the
transformation to every corner of the business,
underline to our cUstomers, subpostmasters and
colleagues the commitment of the Post Office to
remain at the heart of communities, connecting
people and providing access to key services into.
the future

nner

“Customer satisfaction is running at
over 95% in modernised outlets and
opening hours, which have increased
by over 62%, are proving popular,
with 9% of customers visiting
outside traditional opening hours.
Subpostmasters are benefitting

with increased retail sales.

‘Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013/14

But the maintenance and development of our
physical network 1s just part of how the Post
Office 1s developing as a business We have an
increased presence online and we are mvesting
1n technology to ensure that we are easier to
do business with

Our clear ambition as we make these changes
1s to ensure that we put the customer first every
tume and we are doing this by driving forward
with our modernisation and becoming a top
class retailer — fast, flexible and with a focus

on the detail

None of this 1s to cloud the reality of what was
a tough year In an increasingly competitive
market, our revenue was down by 4 5% with.
particular challenges in the mails market, and
itis clear that the Post Office must operate with
greater pace than ever before ~ and focus even
more on its customers and commercial realities
We demonstrated this clear-sighted approach
1n 2013/14 Delvery in our complex change
programmes was accelerated while we worked
hard with our partners to tackle the specific
issues faced in the mails market

Given this context it s pleasing therefore that
operating profit before exceptional items
increased again, up £13 mulhon from last year
This profit improvement was delivered through
greater cost control that more than offset the
decline in revenue At the same time we have
managed to prioritise investment in the key

transformation programmes as we work towards
future financial sustainability

In mails, telecoms and Government Services
we have put in place the fundamentals which

we believe will allow us to build and open up
new revenue streams in the future Meanwhile,
‘we are fast becoming a challenger brand in the
financial services market with 2 widening product
portfolio that now, significantly, includes a current
account offer

The decline in mails revenue was of course
disappointing but we remain confident that we
have the nght commercaal strategy in place and,
importantly, the right retail mindset to be able
to reverse this position

Strategy and funding

Its also important to reflect that 2013/14
was a momentous year in relation to our future
funding The planned £10 million fall in the
Network Subsidy Payment received from
Government underlines our increasing core
strength and ambition to achieve commercia
sustainability over the course of the next few
years Meanwhile we were also able to secure
the funding which wall allow the business to
continue its transformation and announce
the strategy that will defiver this change

To have done so while also making substantial
progress in transforming the agency network
was an achievement that stood out in 2013/14
We also took pleasing steps forward towards our
goal of transforming the Crown branch network,
those branches which are directly managed by
the Post Office More than 100 - almost a third
of the network ~ were modernised though the
year while the annual losses were reduced by
£11 million We are moving rapidly towards our
goal of financial breakeven in 2015 in this part
of our network

Pace and depth

These are major transformation programmes
in their own right but they sit within a larger
portfolio of structured transformation activities
which include mayor IT and business development
programmes 1am conscious of the risks and
complexities of running a number of large
multi-dimenstonal programmes in parallel, and
professional co-ordination structures have been
established to oversee implementation However,
1am also aware of the pace and depth of the
change required to sustain and build this company
for the future and there is 2 determination

within the Post Office to drive change forward
vyath confidence and vigour

‘As this demonstrates, the modernisation of the
Post Office reaches far beyond the changes to
‘our phystcal branch infrastructure Investment
in our mobile website, a Travel Money Card app
and the next generation of Post & Go automated
machines are just three examples of how we are
creating a digital and dynamic Post Office

POL00026716
POL00026716

We have also invested in a new e-commerce
platform that will give us the ability to improve
the quality and ease of use of our online
products and services This Common Digital
Platform represents a significant investment

in our digital future, enabling us to build our
emerging digital products and services on

a platform that will grow and flex with our
changing requirements over the coming years

Office means more, however, than
enhancing our physical branch
infrastructure. Investment in our
mobile website, a Travel Money Card
app and the next generation of Post &

of how we are creating a digital and

Pe

Change can however be difficult and the
industrial relations landscape proved testing

in 2013/14 Although we did experience strike
action, colleagues pulled together to ensure
that service disruptions were kept to a minimum
and the critical focus on customer service

was maintained

Alongside the work that has gone on to
transform the way we deliver our business

to customers the last year has also seen some
important developments in the way we work
as an organisation

We are commutted to the principle of developing
mutual ways of working This means providing
the opportunity for all involved in the Post Office
~ whether employees, subpostmasters and their
employees or wider stakeholders — to share
responsibility for building the business and
engaging in a two-way dialogue to get the

best for our customers

We launched in 2013/14 a Branch User Forum
and branch support programme to provide a
means through which our front line colleagues
can help shape the way the business works
‘More will follow on this track, while the new
Post Office Advisory Council is bringing us
crucial expertise and insight, which can only
benefit our business

‘Annual Report and Financall S:atements 2013/14

Core to this work was the unvetling of our public
purpose as a business We are proud of the
commitment to communities across the UK,
which lies at the heart of this The strategy,
which has been agreed wath Government,
ensures our commitment will be retained

and enhanced ~ for example, by establishing

a Community Investment Fund to support
subpostmasters in the ‘ast shop in the

village’ and help butld their businesses

We have since published four milestones that.
could point the way towards a mutualised Post
Office At the heart 1s the imperative of achieving
commercial sustainability ~ the key deliverable
without which mutualisation would not be
possible - alongside the work we are undertaking
to embed our public purpose within the business
and further build a culture of mutual two-way
engagement with all our people

‘our commitment to helping make the UK the

I would like to thank all those who have worked
$0 hard for the Post Office over the past year
‘Achieving our aims 1s not possible without the
commitment to customers and local communities,
as demonstrated by those working in branches
up and down the UK.

In February 2014 the Royal Saciety for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and
Commerce (RSA) issued a report that outlined
the potential of Post Offices in modern Britain ft
characterised the Post Office in the following way

“The Post Office 1s an organisation like no other
Local Post Offices contribute enormously to the
Iife and soul of their communities, are an
essential vehicle for delivering public services,
and provide the vital infrastructure that our
businesses need to prosper’

Within this Annual Report and Financial
Statements, this powerful view 1s shown in a
number of ways alongside the financial results
that illustrate the commercial underpinnings
necessary to support it

We made significant strides in the transformation
of the business in 2013/14 in testing market
conditions This has given us the confidence to
continue to dave the change that will ensure,

Background to the strategy

+ The economic downturn has impacted
margins across the high street

+ Our traditional markets are the scenes of
significant pressures as competitors assert
their presence

+ The volume and margins associated with
Government Services have reduced and new
business in this area has not materialised
as hoped

To stem the decline in traditional services, the

Post Office will bud on its established position

as a retailer of financial services and telecoms

products as well as introducing new services in
growing markets such as collections and returns

+ Our differentiator will be services that are
simple, fair and transparent and provide value
for money

+ Our breadth of offer will make our
propositions compelling to our customers

We will develop targeted product portfolios
that attract new customers The development
of our small business offering will be a key
focus in the short term

Secunng the Future not only sets the direction of
the Post Office through to 2020, but anticipates
us connecting communities across the UK by
serving the essential needs of our customers,
both individuals and small businesses The Post

Building our future

In its 2010 policy document, Securing the Post
Office Network in the Digital Age, Government
set out an ambition to create the opportunity
for a mutually owned Past Office

Significant progress was made towards this,

goal during 2013/14

With the Stakeholder Forum, we developed

a clear definition of the Post Office's unique
purpose as a commercial business, a crucial
pre-requisite of a successful mutual organisation
The Stakeholder Forum included representatives
from the National Federation of Subpostmasters,
the Communications Workers Union, Consumer
Futures, the BBC, Mutuo and the British Youth
Council The Forum commussioned a public
engagement campaign that ran throughout the
summer of 2013 We asked our customers,
colleagues, subpostmasters and the public for
their views on the purpose of the business

We believe in the importance of
connecting communities and enhancing
the powerful role they play in our lives.

[Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 / 14

This saw three key themes emerging trust,
access and community

A statement of purpose was then drawn up

and approved by the Post Office Board in

March 2014

“The Post Office 1s unique a commercial business
set apart by ts public purpose

‘We believe in the importance of connecting
communities and enhancing the powerful role
they play in all our lives

“We wall stay true to this commitment by meeting
customer needs through our unrivalled local
presence across the UK’

Work has now begun to embed this throughout
the business

We also made significant and successful steps to
embrace mutual ways of working These include
enhanced engagement surveys, the establishment
‘of a Branch User Forum, and the creation of the
Post Office Advisory Council
Post Office Advisory Council

The Advisory Council held its first meeting in
March 2014 following a national campaign to
recruit members from a range of backgrounds

The Advisory Council represents a unique mix
of people and skills from business, charities and
unions, which will help shape the future of the
Post Office

The Advisory Council will play an important role
an reflecting a cross-section of views, skills and.
experience from the diverse communities that
make up 21st century Britain it will help the
Post Office learn from those with an interest

in the business, enabling it to innovate and
support the transformation of the business

‘The Advisory Council 1s made up of 24 members
to allow a broad mux of people and interests
Members are appointed for a term of four years,
non-renewable, with the first appointments
mixed between two, three and four years to
maintain continuity Meetings will be held three
tumes a year

The Advisory Council will ensure the Post Office
remains at the heart of communities by providing
an innovative forum through which tdeas can be
shared and feedback sought

Milestones to mutualisation

Steps such as the creation of the Advsory Council
and the definition of our purpose have established
2 foundation upon which the Post Office and its
stakeholders can build a strong future In addition,
we have identified and published four key
milestones that will need to be met to create

the opportunity for mutualisation

POL00026716
POL00026716

+ Commercial sustainability must be achieved,
building on the successful delivery of our new
strategy This will mean developing a business
with a track record of revenue and profit
growth and positive cashflow generation,
which 1s able to operate wholly independently

Linked to this, a clear funding relationship with
Government will be defined and maintained
Such funding will be materially lower than
today and the relationship will need to provide
the Post Office with improved long-term
certainty and visibility as to its future

The Post Office will deliver measurable
success in embedding tts purpose statement
throughout the business and in meeting the
standards it sets

A culture of mutual engagement will be
further developed, demonstrated by strong
performance in key engagement measures
This will help to encourage new behaviours
that support a broad commitment across the
business to mutual ways of working, approaches
the business 1s adopting regardless of its
future ownership model

‘The Post Office will work closely with its
stakeholders to make progress towards these
milestones, reporting on progress annually

+ UK‘s largest collections and returns network launched

The respective markets for mails, retail products (such as packaging
and collectibles) and lottery are changing rapidly with the growth of
e-commerce, intensifying competition and increasing customer
demands for convenience, quality and value

These pressures increased during 2013/14
and combined with specific issues, including
mails pricing changes, reduced National Lottery
rollovers and the one-off prior year events such
as the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee, caused
overall revenues to return to 2011/12 levels

with Mails revenue declining by £16 million

and Retail and Lottery sales decreasing by

£3 million, a fall on the previous year of 4 6%
Actions were undertaken within the year to
address these factors and better position the
Post Office to take advantage of the underlying
e-commerce-driven market growth in packages
and parcels

tn the Mauls market the Post Office offers a
nationwide, accessible and trusted network
providing a full range of Royal Mail products and
services However, the year in which Royal Mat!
was privatised saw a rapidly changing marketplace
with growing competition There are increased
alternatives to Royal Mail postal products, while
networks of alternative retail locations for

‘Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 /16

posting or pick up are growing, particularly
in more heavily populated urban areas Online
shoppers also increasingly expect competitive
prices and convenience when it comes to delivery
These factors, combined with short-term market
adjustments to postal pricing changes, created
tough trading conditions for the Post Office
Year-on-year revenues fell back and reversed

the growth of the previous year But despite
these pressures, the Post Office made significant
progress in realigning its offer to both meet

the competitive challenge and harness the
underlying growth fundamentals within the
parcels market

These measures included the development of
value added services as Drop & Go for small
business customers, by the year end more than
21,000 priority services customers were signed
up with strong future growth projected Working
closely with Royal Mail, the Post Office has :
expanded its small parcels category It has
introduced new approaches that enable
consumers and businesses to post a greater
range of items through the format delivering
better value and convenience These changes
were well received and helped turn around the
more pronounced volume declines in the first
half of the year

In partnership with Royal Mat! we also
announced our Click and Collect initiative in

May 2013 This allows Post Office branches

across the network to be used as convenient
parcel delivery option for online retailers We

are continuing to extend this service and are
confident that it targets a growing sector that
requires the trust, convenience and accessibility
that Post Offices offer

Improvements have also been also been made to
the Post & Go vending estate, thereby improving
the self-service options avatlable, and improved
equipment 1s now being rolled out into our
larger offices

Other retail sales include packaging and National
Lottery products (where the Post Office 1s one

of the largest distributors, with 6,000 outlets
offering the service) Sales were slightly down
year-on-year, impacted by fewer rollovers

The modernisation of the Post Office network,
with longer opening hours, improved retait
environments and enhanced sales skills, 1s well
underway and continues into 2014/15 It will
both ensure the size of the network 1s maintained
and enhance capabilities in Mails and Retail,
thereby meeting the changing needs and
requirements of consumers and small businesses
Steps include improving facilities for collecting
and returning items, greater ease in sending
mails and packages, and creating the conditions
for enhanced Retail and Lottery sales

BUSINESS IN DETAIL

Government Services

unann

£1 46 million revenue

2012-2013 £164 million -11 0%

+ Seven year contract signed with HMPO
+ Growth in driving licence renewals

Performance in Government Services was impacted by lower margins
in Driver Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) services and the decline
1n traditional branch-based services This was offset to a degree by
higher volumes in the Passport Check & Send service, however, and
the decrease in revenue was in line with expectations

‘The Post Office offers a range of services for
Government departments, mcluding pensions and
benefits payments on behalf of the Department
for Work and Pensions (DWP), Passport Check

& Send for Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO),
driving-related services for DVLA and photograph
and fingerprint capture service for UK Visa

and Immigration

Revenue from Government Services fel! 11% from
£164 million to £146 million While revenue from
Passport Check & Send increased by £2 million,
revenue from the DVLA decreased by £14 million.
This was mainly due to lower fees per transaction
under a new contract that became effective from
Apnl 2013 Revenue from the payment of benefits
through the Post Office Card Account was £6
million lower, impacted by customer attrition

‘The DVLA framework contract for Front Office
Counter services which we secured in 2012
helped us win further Government business in
2013/14 We signed a seven-year contract for
Passport Check & Send, which 1s proving very

technology 1s used to support a variety of
transactions including biometric residence permits
applications and the 10-year renewal of driving
licences Following a joint marketing campaign
with the DVLA, which included radio adverts,

we saw growth in the renewal of 10-year

driving licence renewal applications

During the course of the year the Post Office
and DWP held discussions about the future
of the Post Office Card Account ahead of
the current contract expiring in 2015 An
announcement 1s expected in the coming

will be a key priontty in 2014/15 The Cabinet
Office's Government Digital Service (GDS) is on
target to deliver 25 exemplar services by 2015.
We believe this will present opportunities to the
Post Office supporting customers who need to
establish their identity online or who require
face-by-face support and may not have the skills
needed to transact online or who require some
form of face-by-face guidance

‘The Post Office 1s a significant player in the telecoms market with
around 450,000 customers in HomePhone and Broadband and the
largest network of mobile top-up terminals in the UK This places
usin a strong position for future development, although 2013/14
presented some significant challenges

Revenue in Telecoms fell 39%, from £129 million

significant progress in buniding our infrastructure

the future

Our competitive residential phone and broadband

provider in the UK We are particularly competitive
in the HomePhone-only market, where we offer
market leading prices, and recent changes to our
broadband pricing have enhanced our competitive
positioning However, the market continues to be
dominated by the big four telecoms providers

September 2013 saw the transition of our

services from BT Wholesale to a managed service
provided by Fuyttsu This was a large project,

which upgraded our physical infrastructure as well
as our billing and customer management systems
There were some difficulties during the transition
that negatively impacted customer experience but
Post Office and its partners worked closely to fix
the issues

By making use of the TalkTalk network, the Post
Office can now provide our customers with access
to higher speed broadband services The move to
‘new billing and customer management systems
will enable us to deliver innovative sotutions to
meet the changing needs of our customers in

increasingly supported by digital and telephone
services in line with our ambitions to be a
muitichannel retailer

Customer service

The Post Office 1s creating modern, commercially
sustainable branches that improve the customer
expenence

A highlight of 2013/14 was the pace at which

this modernisation programme increased, with
around 2,000 branches converted so far and
another 1,200 branches awaiting transformation
Improved customer service 1s fundamental to the
success of new style modernised branches and
this is being delivered by our subpostmasters

Longer hours and improved retatl environments
are benefitting millions of customers Over
50,000 extra opening hours have been created
each week with an average increase in opening
hours of 62% On average 9% of customers are
also visiting new style branches outside of
traditional hours and customer satisfaction is
consistently above 95% In addition, more than
1,000 branches are open on a Sunday, meeting
the demand for accessible services every day
of the week

Average waiting times are just 1 minute and
33 seconds in the smaller modernised branches
and 1 minute and 39 seconds in larger ones

Subpostmasters are also benefitting from more

efficient ways of working and an increase in
revenue, both from their Post Office activities,

‘Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 /14

and their accompanying retail business Operator
satisfaction with main and local branches 1s
more than 85%,

The transformation of our network has received
the support of many MPs, with more than 300
officially opening a new branch in their constituency
In the past 18 months

Community focus

As part of Securing the Future, the Post Office
announced a £20 million Community Branch
Fund to support around 3,400 Post Office
branches that are effectively the ‘last shop in
the village’ In addition to providing Post Office
services, these branches operate the only retail
outlet in a community

The fund represents a significant investment into.
these subpostmasters’ businesses and their local
communities These branches will continue as
they currently operate to ensure our network
reach Is maintained and they will be able to
access funding to improve their service for
customers

Crown transformation programme

Work to modernise around 300 Crown branches
the Post Office directly manages - normally
larger branches in city and town centres -
continues at pace

Losses in the Crown network reduced to

£26 million from £37 milhon in because of a
transformation programme that aims to increase
revenue, enhance customer experience and
control costs

A total of 122 branches were modernised during
2013/14 and all branch transformations will be
complete by the end of 2014

Customers also have the choice to use new and
improved self-service facilities at many branches,

items, with staff on hand to help when needed

Growing Financial Services 1s a key part of

the Post Office's strategy and many of our
modernised Crown branches now feature private
consultation rooms, where customers can talk to
specialists about our range of financial products
and services

Increasing customer service and reducing our
operating costs is a significant part of our plans
to achieve break-even by 2015 Excellent
customer service will remain at the forefront,
however, and future staffing levels will be
matched to customer needs

Plans to find retail partners to operate up to

70 of our Crown branches continued and by
March 2014, 22 branches had been transferred
to new stores run by WH Smith and independent
retailers Reaction from customers and
colleagues has been extremely postive

Ina small number of locations, we are taking
the opportunity to relocate branches or
consolidate services from two branches into

fone focation This means we can offer improved
facilities for customers and reduce property
costs while ensuring the branches remain

at the heart of communities

Industnal action was called by the Communication
Workers Union (CWU) on a number of occastons
during 2013/14 in a dispute over pay and the
future of the Crown network While the Crown
estate accounts for less than 39 of the Post
Office network, we regret any inconvenience this
caused for customers Throughout the dispute,
many colleagues chose not to go on stake and,
supported by central staff and managers, the
vast majority of Crown branches remained open
as normal The Post Office and CWU agreed to
intensive talks in December 2013 to find a way
forward and an agreement was reached in April

IT infrastructure

To meet the evolving needs of our customers
the Post Office 1s investing in new capabilities,
conlene as well as within branches, and in the
right skills to support the technology This year
we have engaged ATOS as our service integrator
This 1s a vital part of our modernisation plans,
to ensure we have the right capabilities, systems
and processes in place to allow customers to
access services when and where they want

Our branch network currently has over 230

Post & Go machines that allow customers to
undertake transactions without the need to go
to a counter During 2014/15 we will roll out
more than 500 self-service kiosks to some of
our biggest branches These enable customers
to access a greater range of services, including
priority mail services and mobile phone top-ups

The Post Office has also led the way in payment
technology and we have installed contactless
payment terminals across 30,000 counter
positions This makes the Post Office the biggest
user of contactless technology in Europe, allowing
customers to pay for transactions of up to £20
using contactless cards and smart phones with

a simple tap of their card or mobile phone

Over the past year we made further progress
in making the Post Office a truly integrated
multichannel business Our digital capability has
improved significantly and it is now possible to
make mortgage applications and use financial
services account management tools online We
also launched a Post Office Travel Money Card
mobile app, which was well received, it is the
first of a number of apps designed to help
customers navigate our product offerings

more easily

The recently launched Post Office mobile website
has received more than 25 million hits, proving
that our customers are keen to interact with the
business across a range of channels We have
also invested in a new e-commerce platform

that will give us the ability to improve the

OUR PEOPLE

Engaged people are vital to the growth
of any commercial organisation

INTRODUCTION

The Post Office has set a clear strategy to
transform the business by 2020 and the success
of this is predicated on the contribution and

engagement of our people.

Engaging with our people

Having engaged teams is important to the

Post Office and 1s essential to the growth of any
commercial organisation To meet the aims in our
strategy we need all of our colleagues to deliver
on the promises that we make to customers,
communities, our partners and to Government
We value the opinions and ideas of our colleagues
Our annual employee engagement survey helps
us to gather views, to listen to our people and

to take action to make improvements It 1s a key
lever in supporting the shift that we need to
make to more mutual ways of working This

year we have partnered with Hay Group as an
independent research agency for our annual
survey We have also introduced an intenm Pulse
survey, recognising the importance of monitonng
engagement levels and gathering the views of
‘our people more regularly

‘Our overall engagement increased from 55%

to 57% Loyalty remains high with 74% of
employees saying they would hike to still be in
the business in two years’ time Our people are
also proud of Post Office products and services
with over three quarters (78%) willing to
recommend them to friends and family and
‘84% saying they understand what customers
want from Post Office

‘Annwal Report and Financial Statements 2013 / 14

While these figures are encouraging, we
recogruse that the significant transformation
Post Office 1s going through may have an impact
on the way people fee! We will be working hard
over the next 12 months to histen to and engage
with our people to address the key findings

This year also saw the introduction of the
Branch User Forum This group 1s made up of
subpostmasters and Crown branch colleagues,
giving them the opportunity to contribute to the
direction of the business The Forum means we
are in a better position to get things right first
time, for our people and our customers

This year we also conducted an engagement
survey with subpostmasters We recognise that
we need to have high levels of engagement
across the whole arganisation for us to deliver
our long-term strategy and to meet customer
needs It helped us to understand subpostmaster
advocacy in relation to the Post Office brand,
support the business strategy and to get a

better understanding of engagement, particularly
tn relation to how we could improve the business
in ways that have a clear commercial benefit

One of the core measures showed that
subpostmasters see the Post Office as important
for the future growth of their wider business
(85% positeve)

We wili be rolling out similar feedback surveys
with our subpostmasters in 2014/15

POL00026716
POL00026716

Our recent work with the National Federation
of Subpostmasters in developing our current
proposals for the network transformation
programme has been a great example of where
better engagement has resulted in a better
outcome Through sharing, trusting and
recognising that a stakeholder can add real value
to the business, together we have helped secure
an approach to developing our network which,
backed by additional Government funding, has
ensured that many more subpostmasters can
take advantage of investment in the network

We have also initiated a programme looking
at the training and support we provide to our
subpostmasters The purpose of this s to review
every touch point with our subpostmasters

and ensure we provide the right tools and
information ensuring a posttive experience for
our customers We have listened to and taken
feedback from our people in our agency branch
network and will continue to do so into next year
as the programme progresses

Investing in capability

We are committed to supporting the
development of our people night across the
organisation and have continued to look at

how we do this in new and innovative ways

We recognise that to improve the performance
of our business while changing the way we do
things, we need to build our leadership capability
We therefore launched a development programme
for senior leaders that burlds commercial acumen
and develops a collaborative approach to leading
the business

The Crown Leadership Development Programme
has also been introduced to help our Crown
managers deliver a strong retail offer and
enhanced customer experience So far more
than 300 managers have joined the scheme

In addition we have introduced a number of
workshops for line managers to drive and
enhance performance in their teams

We have also designed specific development
programmes for our Commercial and Financial
Services teams Our people's ability to develop
relationships with key clients and ensure we
comply with our responsibilities

Safety, health and wellbeing

The Post Office intends to make healthy and
safe working a way of life

‘We continue to support and encourage
colleagues and unions to get involved by
providing free health checks, so far more

than 3,600 people have had one, or 46% of
‘employees The scheme also provides access
toan online wellbeing zone that allows them to
track progress on improving health and welfare
During 2014 we will use anonymous data from
the health checks to butld bespoke support

for staff

Last year was the fourth running that workplace
accidents were reduced, by 11% We also saw a
significant reduction in the seriousness of those
accidents, which was reflected in a further
reduction of accidents that resulted in absence
(30%), coupled with a reduction m the length
of absences (54%) There ts still more to do, but
the figures represent a significant improvement
on 2012/13

Looking ahead

Diversity, talent and engagement will continue
to be a key focus and play an integral part in
securing the future of the Post Office Developing
enutual ways of working, investing in the capability
of our people and putting the customer first will
ensure we have a commercully sustainable
business with a public purpose

CASE STUDY

Rita Patel
Subpostmaster, Royal Wootton Bassett,
Wiltshire

Gary Shorland
Mortgage Specialist, St Albans,
Hertfordshire

The Community Enterprise Fund was
introduced to encourage ideas that support
the community, including mentoring for
business start-ups, digital access and traming

Rita came up with WithIT, a drop-in class
for residents where they are taught how

to use tablet devices which was backed by
the Fund

“I thought 1t'd be a brillant idea to bring the
community together and I know many of my
‘customers have been keen to learn how to
use tablets

“The launch took place at the local library
and the turnout was fantastic 39 people
registered to attend regular ciasses and many
more have dropped into the branch since I
want to create a community hub where they
can make friends and learn something new
that they can then share

“The Community Enterprise Fund is a
fantastic idea”

Gary joined the Post Office in 2010

as a Financial Specialist and was one
of a team of seven who worked on the
Post Office mortgage trial

“I'd worked in the banking sector previously so
when I saw the role in Post Office advertised
and started to do some research into the
products and services, I was really surpnsed
by the scale of the product offering There
was obviously a lot of potential to grow

“Im really encouraged by the way things are
going The branch refurbishment will make us
more modern, exciting and professional and
will encourage more customers to come in
A key part for customers is that they can
come into a branch and speak to you
face-to-face That's so important when
making big financial decisions”

Mails and Retail

The Mauls and Retail pillar includes all the
services provided for Royal Mail and Parcelforce
It also includes Lottery and retatl services such
as sales of collectibles as well as packaging

and stationery

Mails and Retail revenue of £390 million
decreased by £19 million (2013 £409 mitlion)

Of this, turnover in relation to Royal Mail
products decreased by £16 million, driven
primanily by a reduction in consumer parcel
volumes and lower stamp sales In addition,
retail turnover decreased by £2 million due

to the one-off increase in the prior year for
collectibles relating to the Diamond Jubilee
and the Olympics memorabiha Revenue from
sales of Lottery tickets declined marginally

by £1 million

Financial Services.

The Financial Services pillar includes Post Office
branded personal financial services products,
ATMs and travel services as well as traditional
services such as bill payment and over-the-
counter banking transactions

‘Across Financial Services in aggregate, revenue
decreased in 2014 by £2 milion to £279 million
{2013 £281 million)

Personal Financial Services revenue increased
by £15 million (15 2%) driven by strong growth
in savings commissions (partrcularly Growth
Bonds, Reward Saver and ISAs), insurance

and new mortgage products Revenue from
traditional financial services products, including
bill payment services, business banking services
and Postal Orders, declined This was due to

the increasing shift from paper-based to
electronically-delivered products and the
increasing use of alternative payment methods
In addition, the cessation of the Department of
Work and Penstons contract for cash cheques
(Green Giros) and the continued migration

of NS&l products through their own direct
channel have resulted m revenue decline

Government Services

The Government Services pillar covers services
provided under contract to Government
departments This includes services in relation

to the work of the Department for Work and
Pensions (DWP), the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency (DVLA), Her Majesty's Passport Office
{HMPO} and UK Visas and Immigration (UKV))
Government Services revenue of £146 million
decreased by £18 million (2013 £164 million)
Revenue from the Passport Check & Send service
increased by £2 million in line with growth in

the overall market Revenue from the DVLA
decreased by £14 million mainly due to lower
fees per transaction under the new contract
effective from 1 April 2013 Revenue from the
payment of benefits through the Post Office
Card Account was £6 million lower, impacted

by customer attrition

Telecoms

The Telecoms pillar includes the Post Office
HomePhone and Broadband services as well
as e-top up services and phonecards

Telecoms revenue of £124 millon (2013 £129
million) decreased by £5 million During the year
the HomePhone and Broadband service was
transitioned to a new provider and experienced
operational issues initially, which both the
provider and Post Office resolved as quickly

as possible The revenue from HomePhone and
Broadband decreased by £4 million, pimanily
due to a reduction in customer numbers driven
by reduced sales and marketing actwity following
the transition to the new supplier Revenue from
e-top ups was £1 million below prior year as
more customers moved away from pre-pay

and mobile networks reduced their transaction
fees However, the Post Office continues to be a
significant provider in the top-up market and its
share of the retail market has been maintained i
at approximately 5%

Other income

Other income 1s generated primaniy from

the Supply Chain business that manages and
distributes cash for Post Offices and for third
parties It also offers warehousing services,
mainly to Royal Mail Other income decreased
by £1 million to £40 million (2013 £41 million)

Network Subsidy Payment

The Network Subsidy Payment is Government
Grant revenue put towards the costs of
maintaining the Post Office network The
payment decreased by £10 million in the
year to £200 million, this will continue to
reduce as set out in the current funding
agreement with Government

Costs

Total costs decreased by £67 million to £1,105
milhon (2013 £1,172 million)

People costs

Pdople costs of £255 million (2013 £259
million) decreased by £4 milion reflecting
efficiency savings, particularly in the Crown
network driven by the Crown transformation
programme, and lower performance-related
bonuses, partly offset by some pay increases
and higher pension costs

Other operating costs

Other operating costs decreased by £63 million
to £850 million (2013 £913 million}, driven
largely by lower sales volumes resulting in tower
subpostmasters’ costs and cost of sales There
was also a decrease in investment in new
products and services which had been
particularly high during 2012/13

Joint venture and associate

Share of operating profit from the joint venture
(First Rate Exchange Services Holdings Limited)
was £33 million (2013 £32 million), £1 million
higher than in 2013 when the result also included
the associate, Midasgrange Ltd, until its sale

‘on 1 September 2012 First Rate Exchange
Services Holdings Limited results improved
mainly through delivering efficiencies in

Executives’ Pension Plan (RMSEPP) and Post
Office Limited 1s a participating employer within
RMSEPP RMPP and RMSEPP are both defined

On 1 April 2012 ~ after the granting of state ard
by the European Commission on 21 March 2012
~ almost all of the pension lrabilities and pension
assets of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP),
built up until 31 March 2012, were transferred
to HM Government On this date, the RMPP was
also sectionalised, with Roya! Mail pic and Post,
Office Limited each responsible for their own
sections in future This pensions transfer left
the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis in
respect of historic habilities at this date During
2013/14 there was a consultation exercise with
members of the defined benefit Royal Mail Pension
Plan on proposed changes to the terms These
changes were agreed on 15 October 2013 and
effective from 1 April 2014 The key change

1s to the definition of pensionable pay, which
broadly will increase in line with RPI (capped

at 5%) in future regardless of actual pay growth
‘The changes resulted in a one-off exceptional
gain of £102 million

The balance sheet pension position moved
from an asset of £97 million at March 2013

to an asset of £148 million at March 2014

The improvement in position is primarily due
to the change tn terms noted above offset by
an actuarial loss mainly arising from lower than
expected asset values

Both defined benefit plans closed to new members
in March 2008, and RMSEPP closed to future
accrual on 31 December 2012 New employees

enable its processes to operate independently of
those of Royal Mai! These include the network,
Crown and IT transformation programmes The
success of the Post Office strategic plan depends
‘on the successful reahsation of benefits from
these programmes

Engagement risk

The support of our staff and subpostmasters and
‘engagement with them dung this significant time.
‘of change 1s key to the successful delivery of our
strategy Withdrawal or lack of support from our
staff or subpostmasters, whether driven by
concems over existing programmes and initiates
‘or historic cases, could cause delays in the Post
Office transformation programmes and limit our
ability to meet business objectives

Regulatory & comphance

There 1s a isk of non-compliance with the
changing regulatory environment

The Post Office operates under an extensive
regulatory environment, including areas such
as financial and postal services, procurement,
competition law and data security

Business continuity

The Post Office has particular operational risks
relating to disruption of its services This includes
adverse weather conditions, industrial action,
systems breakdown and the failure of a

critical supplier

Impact

‘The Post Office might
not be able to reduce
its reliance on.

Government subsidy

Failure to implement
the modernisation
programme would
teave the Post Office
with an unsustainable
cost base and a
continued reliance
on significant
Government subsidy

Lack of support from
our staff and
subpostmasters would
Jeopardise our ability
to meet our strategie
goals of growth,
profitability and
reduced reliance on
Government subsidy

Fatlure to comply with
regulation could result
sn fines, adverse
outcomes for our
customers and
significant damage to
the Post Office brand

Breakdowns in the
network would reduce
quality of service,
increase costs and
damage the Post
Office's reputation

Mitigation

We have introduced new services in growth areas
and continue to refine and develop these product
offerings There 1s an active programme in place
to deliver the growth trajectory Progress 15
monitored rigorously and «isks to the programme
are actively managed

There are detailed plans in place to manage the
transformation and ensure it 1s delivered within
budget and on time The 2013/14 objectives
have been met Delivery 1s tracked monthly by
a Transformation Board made up of Executive
Committee members which provides direction
and oversight over the programmes’ delivery

We maintain a fluid and comprehensive engagement
programme with unions, staff and subpostmasters
These indude regular meetings with the National
Federation of Subpostmasters, the Communication
Workers Union and Unite, senior management
briefings to staff and subpostmasters, and events
to engage our people in our vision and strategy
We have a people plan aimed at addressing

staff motivation and skill needs This cludes
development of new leadership and reward
frameworks and increased focus on recruitment
and training We have created a Branch User
Forum and a branch support programme and

plan further initiatives

‘Our legal and compliance team works closely with
the relevant business owners in identifying new
requirements and monitoring compliance

Regular compliance tests are conducted across
the entire branch network, covenng a broad
range of regulatory requirements The results

are closely monitored and corrective action taken
where required

The Post Office brings together a wide range
of business continuity arrangements under

‘one central policy and governance framework

to ensure that the business is capable of
withstanding any significant threat to its ongoing
operations This inchudes contingency planning
and training in the event of disruption, such as
industnial action or IT failure The ability of key
suppliers to meet the Post Office's requirements
1s closely monitored

reporting on corporate governance

The Post Office's corporate governance structure
follows the spinit of the provisions of the Code in

Statement by the Chair of the
Remuneration Committee

1 welcome the opportunity to outline our progress.
on Executive Remuneration during our second
year as an independent business This year has
been tough although significant progress has
been made towards our strategic objectives We
continue to operate ina challenging environment
and our remuneration framework reflects

these conditions

The Post Office has set a clear strategy for the
remainder of this decade to create a thnving
business with a strong purpose The strategy

will reduce our reliance on the taxpayer, thus
leading the business to financial sustainability
and a network used and accessed by ali sectors
of the population

When setting the performance criteria for the
2013/14 incentive schemes, the targets were
deliberately made significantly more stretching
than previously and as a result, bonuses paid
this year are less than the preceding year

“’This year has been tough although
significant progress has been made
towards our strategic objectives.
We continue to operate ina
challenging environment and our
remuneration framework reflects
these tough conditions.

‘Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 /14

The remuneration framework for 2014/15
maintains the broad principles set in 2012/13 of
stretching measures and targets The measures
in the short-term incentive plan have been
reviewed and slightly adjusted to align with our
business objectives The performance measures
in the long-term incentwe plan remain the same
to ensure continuity and focus on achieving the
long-term business strategy

The Executive Duectors have not received

an increase to base pay for three years An
extensive benchmarking exercise was carried
‘out during 2012/13 which showed that the
levels of the Executive Directors’ fixed
remuneration 1s below the lower quartile of

the market median We recognise that this
means a growing gap between the business
and the market median may become difficult

in the future

We have throughout the year reviewed policies
and have, with the advice of our remuneration
consultants, reviewed the clawback clause in
relation to both the short-term and long-term
incentive schemes to align with market and
best practice

The Post Office 1s owned by Government

and we have regular dialogue with our Speciat
Shareholder on all matters related to the
remuneration of our Executive Directors

The Remuneration Committee is comfortable
that the current policy provides the strong link
between reward and performance to continue
the transformational journey I commend this
report to our stakeholders

The Remuneration Report

This report has been prepared in accordance
with the provisions of the Large and Medium-
sized Compantes and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended 1n 2013,
to the extent that they are applicable for Post
Office in its capacity as an unlisted company

In line with the recent changes to Government
legistation for reporting pay, the remuneration
report has been spht into two sections The
Remuneration Policy Report sets out the
Committee's policy for remuneration and its

link to the business strategy The Annual Report
on Remuneration sets out how this policy was
apphied during the year under review, the
remuneration received by directors in the year
under review and how the Committee intends to
implement the policy in the current financial year

Both sections of the report (pages 58 to 66} have
been approved by the Remuneration Committee
and the Board

Notes to the policy table
The framework ts approved by the Special Shareholder

Differences in remuneration policy for the Executive

Duectors and employees generally

+ The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors
inevitably takes account of their level of responsibility
and their influence over the Company's performance
Accordingly, a higher proportion of their total remuneration
package 1s at risk and subject to performance (under the
STIP and LIP}, with the incidence and potential amounts
payable under such incentives across the workforce being
determined by role and grade within the organisation

Choice of performance measures and approach to target
setting under the STIP and LTIP

+ Under the STIP, performance 1s based on achievement
against a balanced scorecard and personal performance
The balanced scorecard measures achievement of the
Company's key operational objectives and includes
metrics for financial performance, customer, people and
modernisation The Committee reviews the components
of the scorecard each year and vanes them as appropriate
to reflect the pnonties for the business in the year ahead
Under the balanced scorecard, a sliding scale of targets is
set for each metric to encourage continuous improvement
and challenge the delivery of stretch performance

Under the LTIP, a minimum level of operating profit

must always be met in order for any payment to be

made The metrics were carefully chosen to align with

the Company's long-term strategic plan, as agreed with
the Special Shareholder

Performance scenarios 2014/2015

The chart below shows the quantum and
composition of the current remuneration

policy for the Executive Directors under three
performance scenarios These are scenarios
showing potential remuneration assuming there
1s no STIP or LTIP payout, (fixed pay only),
on-target performance (STIP and LTIP paying
out at a target level) and maximum performance
(full payout of STIP and LTIP)

Approach to recruitment remuneration

The remuneration package for a new Executive
Director would normally be set in accordance
with the terms of the Company's remuneration
policy in force at the tme of appointment

The salary for a new Executive Director may
be set below the normal market rate, with
phased increases over the first few years as

the Executive Director gains experience in
their new role

Sometimes, to facilitate an external recruitment,
it may be necessary to consider reasonable
compensation for remuneration relinquished at
a former employer {buyout award) Should this
be the case, the terms of any buyout award
would reflect (as far as 1s reasonably possible}
the nature, performance conditions and time
horizons attaching to the remuneration foregone
with the overall package tailored to the individual
‘Any such award would require approval by the
Special Shareholder

For an internal appointment, any variable pay
element awarded in respect of thei previous
role will be allowed to pay out according to its,
terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account
their appointment

Statement of pay considerations
elsewhere in the Post Office

The Committee takes into account the pay and
employment conditions of employees elsewhere
in the Post Office when setting the remuneration
policy for the Executive Directors The balanced
scorecard used for the STIP for Executive
Directors 1s also used to assess performance

in the annuat bonus for Post Office managers,
providing alignment between performance

and reward for all employees at manager

level and above

Contracts and loss of office

payment policy

Each of the Executive Directors has a signed
contract with the Post Office

Service contracts normally continue until the
Executive Director's agreed retuement date or
such other date as the parties agree The service
contracts contain provisions for early termination
In summary, the contractual provisions are

as follows

Other than for certain events
such as gross misconduct

(in which no notice must be
provided by the Company),
twelve months to be given by
the Post Office and six months
by the director

Payments in lieu of notice of
salary and benefits including
health cover, a company car or
car allowance, life and health
insurance and cash allowance
1 lieu of pension equivalent
to 25% of base salary
Payments in tieu of notice

are not pensionable

There are no enhanced
provisions on a change

In some circumstances, the Commuttee may also,
at its discretion, pay a bonus to the Executive
Director equivalent to the amount that they would
have been entitled to and earned under the STIP
and LTIP, pro-rated over the portion of the year
that they were in service The Committee will take
into account the reason for the Executive Director
leaving the company and the contnibution made
to the performance conditions

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Accounting Policies

Financial year

The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and for
this reason these financial statements are made up to the
52 weeks ended 30 March 2014 (2013 - 53 weeks ended

31 March 2013)

Basis of preparation

The financial statements on pages 72 to 100 have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and

with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to.
compantes reporting under IFRS Unless otherwise stated in
the accounting policies below, the financial statements have
been prepared under the histoncal cost accounting convention

The Company 1s incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom The Group consolidated financial statements are
presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the
nearest £m except where otherwise indicated

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements compnise the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition,
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and
continue to be consolidated until the date when such control
ceases The financial statements of the subsidiaries are
prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company,
using consistent accounting policies All intra-group balances,
transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from
intra-group transactions are eliminated in full

Changes tn accounting policy and disclosures

The Group applies, for the first time, IAS 19 (Revised 2011)
Employee Benefits This has not required restatements of
previous financaal statements as the effect of the application
Of IAS 19R 1s not material in the opinion of the Directors IAS
19R includes a number of amendments to the accounting for
defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that
are recognised in other comprehensive income (OC!) and
permanently excluded from profit and loss which 1s consistent
with the existing policy of the Group, expected returns on
plan assets that are no longer recognised in profit or loss,
instead, there 1s a requirement to recognise interest on the
net defined benefit asset in profit or loss, calculated using the
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit surplus
Other amendments include new disclosures, such as,
quantitative sensitivity disclosures

In the case of the Group, the transition to IAS 19R and the
difference in accounting for interest on plan assets and
unvested past service costs has not had a maternal impact
on the net defined benefit plan surplus The Group has
not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or
amendment that has been issued but 1s not yet effective

Accounting standards issued but not yet applied
The following new and revised accounting standards are
relevant to the Group and are in issue but were not effective
{and in some instances have not yet been adopted by the EU)
at the balance sheet date

+ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement
+ IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements

+ IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements

IFRS 12 Disclosure of involvement with Other Entities

1AS 27 Separate Financial Statements

IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

+ IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
- Amendments to IAS 32

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the
standards listed above will have a material impact on
the financial statements of the Group in future periods

Fundamental accounting concept — going concern
After careful consideration of the plans for the coming years,
the Directors continue to believe that Post Office Limited

will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the
foreseeable future Accordingly, on that basis, the Directors
consider that it 1s appropriate that these financial statements,
have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Group has net assets at 30 March 2014 and has
operated at a profit before exceptional tems during
2013-14 for the sixth year running A funding agreement
with Government was announced on 27 October 2010
which provided for

+ Funding of £410 million for 2012-13

+ Funding of £415 million for 2013-14

+ Funding of £330 millon for 2014-15
Extension of the extsting working capital facility with the
Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) of £115
billion up to 31 March 2016

State Aid approval for the funding for 2012-13 to 2014-15,
was received on 28 March 2012 and it was also recognised
that the working capital facility was no longer deemed State
Aid £410 million was received on 2 April 2012 and £415
million was received on 2 Apri! 2013

An additional funding agreement with Government was
announced on 27 November 2013 which provided for

Funding of £280 million for 2015-16

Funding of £220 million for 2016-17

Funding of £140 million for 2017-18

Extension of the existing working capital facility with the
Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) amended
with a limit of £950 millon from 31 March 2015 up to

31 March 2018

State Aid approval for the funding for 2015-16 to 2017-18
has not yet been received

This investment takes the form of a Government Grant and
enables the Group to modernise the branch network and the
continuation of the Network Subsidy Payment recognises the
major social value that Post Offices provide to communities
New main and local branches are currently being rolled out
across the United Kingdom Customers are beginning to
benefit from a much better retail experience including
extended opening hours This programme ts designed to
make the Post Office network more self-sustaining and,

over time, less dependent on direct subsidy This will not
involve a branch closure programme

The Directors are satished with the continued progress made
towards modernisation during 2013-14 and that the plans in
place and the substantial investment secured will enable the
Group to continue to modernise and to secure its future
However, they note that the scale of change required remains
significant so not without risk

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In applying accounting policies

‘The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding
the future Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated
‘based on histoncal expenence and other factors In the future,
actual experience may differ from these estimates and
assumptions In addition the Group has to make yudgements.

in applying its accounting policies which affect the amounts
recognised in the accounts The most significant areas where
judgements and estimates are made are discussed below

Pension assumptions

The costs, assets and labilities of the pensions operated by
the Group are determined using methods relying on actuarial
estimates and assumptions These pension figures are
particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions for discount
rates, mortality and inflation rates The Group exercises its
judgement in determining the assumptions to be adopted,
after discussion with its Actuary Details of the key
assumptions are set out in note 18

Pension habilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent
to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond
of equivalent currency and term Judgement has been applied
in determining that for these purposes a high quality corporate
bond constitutes AA rated or equivalent status bonds

The prior year pension deficit transfer to HM Government

‘on 1 April 2012 was taken directly through equity, as in
management's judgement this transaction was undertaken
with HM Government in its capacity as the owner of Royal
Mail Holdings pic, the Company's former parent company,
rather than in its capacity as Government

Provisions
The Group has recognised provisions where a present legal
or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event,
where it is probable that an outflow of resources wall be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of
the amount can be made Provisions are detailed in note 16
Due to the nature of provisions the future amount settled
may be different from the amount that has been provided

Impairment of non-current assets.
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of
impairment for all non-currents assets at each reporting
date Due to ongoing operational losses (excluding the
Network Subsidy Payment) the carrying value of intangible
assets and all property plant and equipment other than
freehold and long leasehold property has been impaired
to the recoverable amount

Revenue

Turnover from Government, financial, mails and telephony
services comprises the value of services provided Turnover
from all other products comprises the commission received
excluding VAT, from the Group's principal actwaties in providing
access to a wide range of financial and retail services through
Its network of Post Office branches across the UK and other
channels Turnover relating to line rental for telephony
services 1s recognised evenly over the period to which the
charges relate and revenue from calls is recognised at the
time the call 1s made Turnover from all other transactions

1s recognused when the transaction is completed All turnover
1s derived wholly from within the United Kingdom

are initially recognised at cost and are reviewed for impairment
An impairment loss 1s recognised in the income statement for
the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds

realisable value and its value in use

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives ts charged
annually to the income statement on a straight-line basis

as follows

Software 1 to 6 years

Where intangible assets are impaired to their recoverable
amount on acquisition the above range of asset lives 1s
not applied

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment 1s recognised at cost, including
attnbutable costs in bringing the asset into working condition
for its intended use

impaired The Group assesses at each reporting date whether
such indications exist Where appropriate, an impairment
loss is recognised in the mcome statement for the amount
by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating
unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, which 1s the higher of
an asset’s net realtsable value and its value in use

Incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to
the Group are capitalised at the inception of the lease with
a corresponding lability recognised for the fair value of the
leased stem or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments Lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so

as to achteve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the habrlity

Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter
of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are

future, and

+ deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it
4s probable that taxable profit will be available against which
they can be utilised

the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate

Financtal instruments

The classification of financial instruments included on the
balance sheet 1s set out below

Financial assets

Financial assets are classified into the following categories

at fair value through the income statement, loans and
receivables, and available for sale as appropriate based on the
purpose for which they were required Financial liabilities are
classified as either fair value through the income statement
or as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

Financial habilities - interest-bearing loans
and borrowings

All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost

Financial habilities - obligations under
finance leases

All obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts
are classified as financial habilities measured at amortised cost

Derivative financial instruments

The Group uses denvative financial instruments to manage
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates Such
derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value
Hedge accounting has not been claimed for foreign exchange
derivative instruments

Fair value measurement of financial instruments
The fair value of quoted investments is determined by
reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance
sheet date

Where there 1s no active market, fair value 1s determined
using valuation techniques These include using recent arm's
length market transactions, reference to the current market
value of another instrument which 1s substantially the same,

‘Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 / 14

POL00026716

POL00026716

and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models
Specifically, m the absence of quoted market prices, derivatives
are valued by using quoted forward prices for the underlying
currency and discounted using quoted interest rates Hence
denvative assets and liabilities are within Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 7

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments
held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of
‘quoted market prices, fair values are calculated by discounting
the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted
‘equivalent interest rates as at close of business on the
balance sheet date

Derecognition of financial instruments

A financial asset or liability 15 derecognised when the contract
that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash
at bank and in hand and short-term deposits (cash
equivalents) with an original matuntty date of three months
or less In addition the Group uses Money Market funds as

2 readily available source of cash, and these funds are also
categorised as cash equivalents

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined
above, net of bank overdrafts Cash equivalents are classified
as loans and receivables financial instruments

2 Segmental reporting

In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments, an operating
segment is defined as a business activity whose operating
results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker
((CODM’) and for which discrete information 1s available

The Group's CODM 1s the Executive Committee as defined

in the Corporate Governance section on page 56

The CODM has determined the operating segments based
in the information reviewed by them for the purposes of
allocating resources and assessing performance Operating
segments have not been aggregated in order to present
reportable segments All segmental activities are located
wholly within the United Kingdom

The CODM assesses the performance of the operating
segments based on net revenue This 1s calculated using
segmental revenue tess the directly attributable costs of
delivering the service or product The net revenue measure
excludes the effect of indirect costs and the effects of
non-recurring expenditure such as redundancy costs and
asset impairment Interest income and expenditure 1s not
allocated to segments as this type of activity 1s driven by
the central treasury function

Assets and liabilities as recognised on the Group balance
sheet are not considered to be segmental assets or liabilities
but rather are managed by the Group's central functions The
information reviewed by the CODM does not include assets
or liabilities split by segment A description of the activities
of the business segments 1s included from page 18 of the
Business review

Revenue from a major customer represents approximately
30% of the Group's total revenue in 2014 This revenue was
reported within the Mails & Retail segment

The disclosures in this note relating to the year ended

30 March 2014 and the comparatives for the year ended

RMPP scheme which 1s independently operated by the Group
and the approximate 7% share of the RMSEPP scheme Royal
Mail Group Limited 1s the principal employer in Royal Mail
Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) and Post Office
Limited became a participating employer with effect from

1 Apnit 2012

‘During the year there was a consultation exercise with
members of the defined benefit Royal Mail Pension Plan on
proposed changes to the terms These changes were agreed
15 October 2013 and effective from 1 Apri! 2014 The key
change was to the definition of pensionable pay which broadly

93

will increase in line with RPI {capped at 5%) in future
regardless of actual pay growth The changes have resulted
In a one-off exceptional gain of £102 million

IAS 19 has been applied retrospectively from 26 March
2012 Expected returns on plan assets of defined benefit
plans are not recognised in profit or loss interest on net
defined benefit surplus 1s recognised in profit or loss,
calculated using the discount rate used to measure the

net pension surplus The impact of transition to 1AS 19R
retrospectively 1s not material to the Group, and therefore
no restatement has been required

out as at 1 April 2012 using the projected unit method For
RMPP, this valuation was concluded at £135 million surplus
The latest full actuarial funding valuation of RMSEPP was
carried out as at 31 March 2012 using the projected unit

+ RMSEPP was closed to future accruals on 31 December 2012

Payment of £21 millon (2013 £23 million) was made by the
Group during the year in respect of regular future service
contributions, nearly all relating to RMPP The regular future .
service contributions for RMPP, expressed as a percentage

of pensionable pay, has remained at 171% (2013 171%),

effective from April 2010 This rate 1s not expected to change

materially during 2014-15 For RMSEPP, these contributions

have remained at 35 9% (2013 35 9%) until its closure

The Group pays 7% of the total deficit payment required
to fund the deficit in RMSEPP and a payment of £1 million

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a) Major long-term assumptions

The size of the RMPP pension surplus, which is large inthe \
context of the Group and its finances, 1s materially sensitive to

POL00026716

POL00026716

the assumptions adopted Small changes in these assumptions
could have a significant impact on the surplus and overall
income statement charge The major long-term assumptions

In June 2010, Government announced that it was intending
to change the inflation measure used to determine statutory
minimum indexation in deferment and in payment from RPI
to CPI from April 2011 Where relevant, the inflation
assumption has changed from RPI to CPI

The ultimate cost of the RMPP plan to the company will
depend upon future events rather than the assumptions
made The assumptions made may not be borne out in
practice and as such the cost of the plan may be higher
(or lower) than disclosed

In common with other defined benefit schemes, the main
isk in relation to the arrangements is the value of the
assets does not keep pace with the increase in the value
of the llabilities This can arise for many reasons, but the
most significant risks are as follows

Investment risk

If the assets of the arrangements fall short of expectations,
this will lead to a decrease in the funded status

Asset volatility

The arrangements hold return seeking assets (including
equities and property) which are expected to outperform
corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to
volatility and risk in the short term RMPP does, however,
invest in liability driven investment (LD!) assets which
mitigates the impact of terest rate and inflation volatility
on the funded status

‘Annual Report and Financial Starements 2013/14

Inflation risk

Higher inflation rates than expected will act to increase the
plan abilities as benefits will increase to a higher level than
assumed The arrangements have a maximum pension
increase (generally 5% per annum) written into the rules
which limits the increase for many benefits, so limiting the
impact of high inflation This includes pensionable pay in
RMPP, which was amended with effect from 1 April 2014

In addition, the arrangement holds assets that increase in
value as price inflation expectations rise, so mitigating the
Impact of rising inflation expectations These assets include
LDI assets in respect of RMPP

Changes in bond yrelds,

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the plan
habihties, although this wal be partially offset by an increase
tn the value of the bond holdings and, to some extent, the
LDI assets

Pensioner longevity
if members live longer than expected, the liabilities would
increase because pensions would be paid for a longer time
Liabilities accrued in the Royal Matt Pension Plan to 31 March
2012 were transferred to the Royal Mail Statutory Pension
Scheme These liabilities are no longer an obligation of the
company and consequently the transfer resulted ina
significant removal of pension risk from the company

The sensstivity analysis has been prepared using projected

the plan The same method was applied as at the previous
reporting date The accuracy of this method 1s limited by
the extent to which the profiles of the plan cash flows have
changed since those valuations although any change is
not expected to be material in the context of the above
sensitivity analysis

Mortality
The mortality assumptions for the RMPP sectionalised
scheme are based on the latest self administered pension
scheme (SAPS) mortality tables with appropriate scaling
factors (106% for male pensioners and 101% for female
pensioners} For future improvements the assumptions

In making an assessment of the Company's ability to continue
25.2 going concern, the Directors have considered the going
concern assessments made in relation to the Group (see note
1 on page 77) and are of the view that itis appropriate that
these financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

in applying accounting policies

The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions
regarding the future Estimates and assumptions are
continually evaluated based on historical experience and other
factors In the future, actual expertence may differ from these
estimates and assumptions In addition the Company has to
make judgements in applying its accounting policies which
affect the amounts recognised in the accounts The most
significant areas where judgements and estimates are made
are discussed below.

Penston assumptions

The costs, assets and fiabilittes of the pensions operated
by the Company are determined using methods relying on
actuarial estimates and assumptions These pension figures
are particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions for
discount rates, mortality and inflation rates The Group
exercises its judgement in determining the assumptions

to be adopted, after discussion with its Actuary Details

of the key assumptions are set out in note 13 of the
Company financial statements

Pension liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using
the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent currency and term Judgement
has been applied in determining that for these purposes @
high quality corporate bond constitutes AA rated or equivalent
status bonds

‘The prior year pension deficit transfer to HM Government
‘on 1 Apnl 2012 was taken directly through equity, as in
management's judgement this transaction was undertaken
with HM Government in its capacity as the owner of Royal
Mail Holdings plc, the Company's former parent company,
rather than in its capacity as Government

Provisions

‘The Company has recognised provisions where a present legal
or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event,
where it 1s probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the
amount can be made Provisions are detailed in note 12 Due
to the nature of provisions the future amount settled may be
different from the amount that has been provided

Impairment of non-current assets

The Company assesses whether there are any indicators of
impairment for all non-currents assets at each reporting date

Due to ongoing operational losses (excluding the Network Subsidy
Payment) the carrying value of intangible assets and all property
plant and equipment other than freehold and long leasehold
property has been impaired to the recoverable amount

Intangible fixed assets

Intangible assets acquired separately or generated internally
are initially recognised at cost and are reviewed for
impairment An impairment loss 1s recognised in the profit
and loss account for the amount by which the carrying value

POL00026716

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which 1s the
higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use
Amortisation of intangible assets with finite fives 1s charged
annually to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis
as follows

Software 1 to 6 years

Where intangible fixed assets are imparred to their
recoverable amount on acquisition the above range of asset
lives ts not applied

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost, including
attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition
for its intended use

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets 1s provided on a straight-
line basis by reference to net book value and to the remaining
useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual
values The lives assigned to major categories of tangible fixed
assets are

Range of asset lives

Not depreciated
Up to 50 years

The shorter of the period of
the lease, 50 years or the
estimated remaining useful life

amounts on acquisition the above ranges of asset lives are
not applied This 1s currently the case for plant and machinery,
motor vehicles and trailers and fixtures and equipment

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, fixed
assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired
‘The Company assesses at each reporting date whether such
indications exist Where appropriate, an impairment loss 15
recognised in the profit and loss account for the amount by
which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which 15 the higher of an
asset's net realisable value and its value in use

Finance jeases, where substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership of the leased ttem have passed to the
Company are capitalised at the inception of the lease with

a corresponding habality recognised for the fair value of the
leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments Lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charges and reduction of the lease lability so

as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability

Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter
of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of

ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are
Classified as operating leases and rentals are charged to the
profit and loss account over the tease term The aggregate

replacement assets,

‘on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates
where there is no commitment to remit those earnings, and
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that

in relation to the arrangements 1s the value of the assets does
not keep pace with the mcrease in the value of the labilmes
This can anise for many reasons, but the most significant risks
are as follows

Investment risk
If the assets of the arrangements fall short of expectations,
this will lead to a decrease in the funded status

Asset volatility
The arrangements hold return seeking assets (including
equities and property) which are expected to outperform
corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to
volatility and nsk in the short term RMPP does, however,
invest in lability dnven investment (LDI) assets which
mutigates the impact of interest rate and inflation volatility
on the funded status

Higher inflation rates than expected will act to increase the
plan habilities as benefits will increase to a higher level than
assumed The arrangements have a maximum pension
increase (generally 5% per annum) written into the rules
which limits the increase for many benefits, so limiting the
impact of high inflation This includes pensionable pay n
RMPP, which was amended with effect from 1 April 2014

In addition, the arrangement holds assets that icrease in
value as price inflation expectations rise, so mitigating the
impact of rising inflation expectauons These assets include
LDI assets in respect of RMPP*

Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the plan
habilties, although this will be partially offset by an increase
1n the value of the bond holdings and, to some extent, the
LOI assets

Pensioner longevity

if members tive longer than expected, the liabilities would
increase because pensions would be paid for a longer time
Liabilities accrued in the Royal Mail Pension Pian to 31 March
2012 were transferred to the Royal Mail Statutory Pension
Scheme These liabilities are no longer an obligation of the
Company and consequently the transfer resulted in a
significant removal of pension nsk from the Company

The following table shows the potential impact on the RMPP
assets and pension surplus of changes in key assumptions.

the plan The same method was applied as at the previous scheme are based on the latest self administered pension
reporting date The accuracy of this method 1s limited by scheme (SAPS) mortality tables with appropriate scaling
the extent to which the profiles of the plan cash flows have factors (106% for male pensioners and 101% for female

22 Transition to FRS 101

For all periods up to and including the year ended
31 March 2013, the Company prepared tts financial
statements in accordance with the previously extant
United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice
{UK GAAP) These financial statements, for the year ended
30 March 2014 are the first the Company has prepared

in accordance with FRS 101

Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial
‘statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods
beginning on or after 26 March 2012 and the significant
accounting policies meeting those requirements are described
in the relevant notes

In preparing these financial statements, the Company has
started from an opening balance sheet as at 26 March 2012,

the Company's date of transition to FRS 101, and made those
changes in accounting policies and other restatements required
for the first-time adoption of FRS 101 As such, this note
explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in
restating its previously published UK GAAP financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2013 No restatements are
required in relation to the Company balance sheet for the

year ended 25 March 2012

On transitron to FRS 101, the Company has applied the
requirements of paragraphs 6-33 of IFRS 1 ‘First time
adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’

IERS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from
the general requirements to apply IFRSs as effective for
March 2014 year ends retrospectively The Company has
taken advantage of the following exemptions

Cumulative actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other
post employment benefits are recognised in full in equity on
the date of transition to IFRS This 1s the same treatment as
under UK GAAP

1 Under IFRS the retirement benefit surplus as at 31 March
2013 was assessed under IFRIC 14 which requires the
maximum asset to be recognised using appropriate recovery
methods An element of the defined benefit surplus on the
balance sheet was recoverable through a reduction in future
pension contributions which created a separate deferred tax
ability The remainder was recoverable through a refund
from the pension scheme which was subject to a tax deduction
at 35% which was shown net against the pension surplus
Under UK GAAP no retirement benefit surplus ts recognised
based on refunds, and the surplus as at 31 March 2013

was recoverable fully through a reduction in future pension
contributions and therefore created a larger deferred

tax lability

The impact of transition to FRS 101 has been to decrease the
retirement benefit surplus as at 31 March 2013 by £3 million
in order to recognise the tax deduction on the element of
the surplus recoverable through a refund from the pension
scheme This also had the effect of reducing the actuarial
gain recognised through reserves from £17 million under

UK GAAP, to £14 mifhion under FRS 101

The effect of the transition on reported profit of the Company
for the year ended 31 March 2013 1s as follows

fm
Profit for the year ended 31 March 2013
under UK GAAP 76
Deferred tax asset @
Profit for the year ended 31 March 2013
under IFRS 74

The corresponding movement in the deferred tax hability
1s taken through the Company statement of comprehensive
income, and therefore has no overall effect on equity

2 The use of FRS 101 requires preparation of a balance
sheet in accordance with ‘The Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations
2008" which requires presentation of debtors falling due
after more than one year within current assets
