Tam aware that I have not been in touch for quite some time regarding the SubPostmaster
matter. Is it time, I wonder, for a short discussion on where things stand, I wonder? I am
very sorry, but my diary is horrendously full, and I am rather hoping you might agree to a
conversation with one of my staff about this. Would that be OK?

I don’t know if you saw the programme Inside Out South, which aired a week ago. I think it
included material on your firm. The format of the programme covers three separate stories,
and one addressed the problem of the SubPostmasters accused of fraud. It was a very
strong piece of current affairs, and presented our case rather well. The journalist is keen to
follow this story, which is very good news.

I wonder if you might bring Janet Walker, who works for me, up to speed with where things
are at your end. We might then discuss what I ought to do next.
