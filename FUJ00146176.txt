By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 13:12:00 Category 40 - Incident Under Investigation KEL quoted is irrelevant - if the audit log had been checked, it would
have shown a different error message. The event was part of a storm which occurred over the estate that night as a result of a faulty software fix, and has
nothing to do with the discrepancies.

NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT DATE AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004
15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and guidance given I have checked various things on the system. All the internal reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are
being handled correctly (except for 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they
usually use drawer id 11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should beI
avoided. But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions on the system against the declarations shows that they are not working
particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day the cash they declare in the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has been
recorded on the system). It is possible that they are not accurately recording all transactions on the system. There is no evidence whatsoever of any system
problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer Services) who will try to get POL to follow it up, but in the meantime please tell the PM that we
have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the difference between the transactions they have recorded on the system and the cash they have
declared, and are not being caused by the software or hardware
