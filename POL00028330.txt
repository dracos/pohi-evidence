Dear Sarah
SARAH GRAHAM'S LETTER

Having just had sight of Sarah Graham's paper with its attachment from
George McCorkell I have a number of comments to make:

MAIN TEXT PARA 3

Sarah has suggested some wording on Alternative Options. I support the

broad thrust of the statement with the exception of the last sentence. I

believe it would be misleading Ministers to suggest the possibility of a better
VEM case for Options 2 and 3. POCL has already outlined its position

formally to Ministers on Option 2. On Option3, POCL has made it clear that
this is not a realistic option as currently defined. We have no means of

knowing if KPMG numbers will be borne out in reality both in terms of

stability of the network or the costs of automation, profits from Banking etc. --

It is also quite possible that in achieving VFM, the NPV effect on one or other
(ie, BA or POCL) could be significantly improved/ worsened eg by deferring
ACT or the impact of interim Banking on POCL's profits. I suggest therefore
the last sentence should read:-

"However all parties are committed to working together in a pro-active
manner against a clearly defined set of objectives to fully maximise the value
for money from alternative options to Horizon".

ATTACHMENT ON DSS REACTION TO ICL PROPOSAL OF 9 DECEMBER

Re: para 3, I had an action point from The Horizon Progress Tracking Group
to clarify this point with Hambros.

I raised this issue at a meeting yesterday afternoon with James Stewart of SG.
He confirmed that Fujitsu were prepared to stand behind the whole project, ie
up to whatever funding is required. The reference to £600m in Keith Todd's
letter to the Chief Secretary was meant to emphasise the scale of investment -
not set a cap on it.

He also confirmed that Fujitsu's support for this programme would be similar
to that provided for DTI project Elgar - but made the point that the letter of
support for that project (provided at preferred bidder status) had yet to be
converted into legal terms. I believe this covers the point made by George
McCorkell at the meeting yesterday. James Stewart also advised that Adrian
Montague has been fully briefed by ICL on the nature of Fujitsu's support.

Clearly BA and POCL would need to ensure that Fujitsu's support for
Horizon was expressed in legally enforceable terms as part of any agreed way
” forward. 7

(ij) Commercial
Para 4.1 should read: On 9th November 1998, ICL were seeking price
increases which would increase the NPV provided under Corbett from
£116m to £237m +£80 contingency to be funded by the public sector.
They are now seeking price increases to increase the NPV from £116m
to £229m and the contingency fund has been removed. Conclusion:
they have moved £88m from their 9 November proposal.

(ii) Acceptance
The Acceptance tests do not relate solely to system tests. There are
tests which will involve live running. However, POCL do share BA's
view that a full live trial is necessary.

(ii). I EFFECT OF LATEST ICL PROPOSAL ON DSS COSTINGS FOR
OPTION 1
Para 3: I note George's estimate of the impact on BA of the revised
programme timescales.

As a counter balancing effect I think it is worth pointing out that in
view of revised BA volumes and ICL's latest pricing proposals BA's
charges from Pathway are significantly lower than originally
envisaged when the programme was tendered for. (I believe Keith
Todd has suggested a figure of £107m lower in his letter to the Chief

Secretary).

In the interests of speed I have made some manuscript amendments to

George's table to reflect a more rounded position on ICL's latest proposal.

If you have any queries please give me a call.

Yours sincerely
