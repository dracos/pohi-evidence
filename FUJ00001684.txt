2.0 Scope

The architecture of TMS is described in 7MS Architecture Specification. This document
describes the hardware components, other than counter hardware components, that support
the Transaction Management Service (TMS).

2.1 Components
The components described are as follows:
© Correspondence servers

There are eight correspondence servers at each Data Centre, four of which are
Compaq ProLiant DL380G2 servers with EMC disks that provide disk mirroring and
backup facilities. The other four are Compaq ProLiant DL360G2 servers and have
Compaq disk arrays. They run under Windows NT Server V4.0. The main software on
these servers is the Riposte Message Service.

© Generic agent servers

There are four generic agent servers at each Data Centre; they are Compaq ProLiant
DL360G2 Agent servers and run under Windows NT Server 4.0. They support Riposte
Client software and any client software such as Oracle that is required, and form the
interface between the host central servers and the correspondence servers. The agent
applications act as clients to both, by ‘pulling’ information from one and ‘pushing’ it to the
other. This occurs in both directions.

«¢ NBS agent servers

There are eight NBS agent servers, four at each Data Centre. Each cluster has one NBS
agent server running the NBS Authorisation Agent. They are Compaq ML350 servers, run
under Windows NT Server 4.0 and support Riposte Client software. They provide
hardware support for the encryption of data to and from the NBE and form the interface
between the NBE and the correspondence servers for real-time transactions.

* Network components

Network components include connections between counters in the outlets, connections
from the outlets to the Data Centres, connections within the Data Centres that carry data
from the correspondence servers to the agent servers, and connections between the Data
Centres.

2.2. External Certification

All hardware used on the Horizon project is certified by the suppliers to be conformant to
EN54014 as indicated by the presence of a “CE” mark. All platforms used are specified as
validated to meet the requirement of Microsoft, and listed in Microsoft’s HCL.

3.0 Correspondence Servers

There are currently sixteen correspondence servers. They are Compaq ProLiant DL380G2
(eight) and DL360G2 (eight) arranged in four clusters of four, each cluster having two servers
in each of the two Data Centres, one in each location with an EMC disk array and one with a
Compaq disk array.

The servers support the Riposte Message Store (RMS) and its replication and form the main
interface between the agent applications and the counter. Communication to the counters is
over an ISDN or satellite proxy. For ISDN outages, ISDN sites may use PSTN via laptop and
ISDN emulator. Communication to the agent servers is via the Data Centre Local Area
Network (LAN).

Each server has a mirrored set of hard disks configured as drive C: for the operating system,
swap file and application software. D: Drive is used for temporary storage of audit data before
it is transferred to the Audit Server. In addition to the system disk there is a set of ten 18GB
drives that hold the Riposte Message volumes.

3.1 Correspondence Servers: EMC-connected

Four Compaq ProLiant DL380G2 servers in each Data Centre are configured as shown in the
following sections. Their node IDs are listed in Table 3-1.

3.1.2 Configuration
The hardware is configured as follows:

e — The system disk (C:) is 83GB. The remainder of the system drive (64GB) is configured as a
single data partition (D:).

© The system and data partitions are mirrored in RAID.

e The Riposte Message Store disks are arranged as ten partitions (logical drives P: Q: and
S:to Z:). The disks are presented as twenty 9GB disks by EMC and are then set up in
Disk Administration as 18 GB Stripe Sets.

In addition to the Riposte message store, the EMC array holds ten volumes Business
Continuity Volumes (BCV) for message store backup, and two hot-swap disks. If a disk fails,
data from its mirror is automatically copied to a warm standby disk that then becomes the
second plex. The failed disk is then replaced, and the replacement becomes the new warm
standby disk.

3.3 Clusters

There are four correspondence servers per cluster, two in each Data Centre. The associated
node ID of each server is listed in Table 3-1. All the correspondence servers are active, but if
one fails, its load is serviced by the remaining servers.

The main characteristics of this configuration are as follows
e There are four correspondence servers in a Riposte cluster, each sharing the outlet load
equally. They are defined as neighbours in a ‘fully meshed’ configuration.

e In each cluster, one server at each Data Centre uses EMC disks, the other uses Compaq
Disks.

e The audit workload is run on the correspondence server at each Data Centre that is
connected to the EMC disks.

e There are four generic agent servers per site, with two connected to one correspondence
server and two connected to the other correspondence server at each site.

e There are four NBS agent servers per site, connected to both correspondence servers at
each site.

5.0 Network Components

The network components that support the Transaction Management Service are as follows:
* Connections between the counters in outlets

* Connections from the outlets to the Data Centres

© Connections within the Data Centres

* Connections between the Data Centres

5.1. Connections between Counters in Outlets

Each gateway PC has two network cards (one for WAN use, one for LAN use). The
AutoConfig process allocates every outlet a WAN IP address (ISDN, Frame Relay or satellite)
and a LAN IP address. (It is necessary to allocate both for every outlet, since an outlet may
change from being a single counter outlet to having more than one counter.)

Counters in outlets are linked via a LAN using UDP over IP. System management software
uses TCP/IP. Counters on the local LAN within an outlet employ VPN for all traffic between
counters and the Gateway PC.

5.2. Connections between Outlets and the Data Centres

One counter in each outlet (the gateway PC) acts as the connection to the Data Centres and is
responsible for the communication with the Data Centre. It supports a mechanism known as a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) in which all communication with the Data Centre is encrypted
with a key that is unique to that outlet. As well as protecting the data passed to and from the
outlet, this provides authentication of the outlet to the Data Centre (and vice versa). (Other
counter PCs within the outlet are linked to the gateway PC via LAN cards. These connections
are also encrypted but use a key that is different from the key used between the gateway PC
and the Data Centre.)

Figure 5-1 shows the Wide Area Network (WAN) connections from the outlets to the Data
Centres and the connections to the Network Banking Engines (NBEs) located at IBM
premises in Warwick and Greenford.

5.2.1 FRIACO Service

The FRIACO service enables outlets to connect via ISDN (or PSTN) to the local BT digital
exchange (DLE); the call is then forwarded via the Internet to the Data Centre, as determined
by the ‘destination’ number being called by the outlet’s Gateway PC.

5.2.1.1 Connection types

5.2.1.1.1 ‘Silver’ outlets

A ‘silver’ outlet is one that requires a permanent connection to the Data Centre during the
normal Post Office business day, and in some instances a 24-hour connection. A silver outlet
will, in the majority of cases, be connected via the FRIACO service. If it is not possible to
provide a FRIACO connection to an office that requires this class of service, the Energis
RemoteConnect service is used instead. This is a metered call that uses the Energis Data
Network with call termination on the LNS routers as with the FRIACO service.

A separate range of telephone numbers is used for the FRIACO and RemoteConnect services.
If a silver outlet is to be for business hours only, outside the defined hours of usage, the outlet
is switched from permanent connection use a dial on-demand connection. The Counter
Network Information Monitor (CNIM) program switches the ISDN telephone number to be
called for the FRIACO service to that of the RemoteConnect dial on-demand service. The
ISDN number for the Eicon card on the Gateway PC, is switched via an API call, which
instigates an Eicon card reset in the process.

5.2.1.1.2 ‘Bronze’ and ‘silver part time’ outlets

A ‘bronze’ outlet is one that does not require to be permanently connected or to have a
permanently connected RemoteConnect service, but utilises the dial on-demand
RemoteConnect service. However, these outlets can be switched to silver connections for
pre-defined times of the day on pre-defined days of the week. Sites that utilise this capability
are defined as silver part time with the capability of switching to silver via the CNIM at the
appropriate time of day.

5.2.2 ISDN dial-out

Three Cisco 5350 Routers per Data Centre supply the ISDN dial-out capability that is
required for support and for System Management functions. On receipt of a call, the CNIM
causes the outlet to drop the connection and dial the Data Centre back utilising the less
expensive FRIACO or RemoteConnect service.

5.2.3 Satellite connection

Some outlets, in areas where ISDN is not available, communicate with the Data Centres via
satellite links to a ground station that is then linked via the network to the Data Centres.

5.2.4 PSTN dial-in

A PSTN connection can be used for outlets whose normal connection has been disrupted. The
PSTN connection connects the outlet, via a laptop, to the Access server. It can then use a
FRIACO connection (see section 5.2.1).

The network provider’s Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authenticates
the call and ascertains where the target Home Gateway Router (also known as the L2TP
Network Server Router (LNS)) resides and the route to use. The LNS Router connects to the
target site’s LAN and presents the data IP packets in the form in which they were transmitted
by the counter PC in the outlet.

5.3 Connections within the Data Centres
Figure 5-2 shows the network infrastructure within each Data Centre.
The following features have been introduced within the Data Centres to support NBS:

e New routers route traffic from the Energis Data Network to the VPN layer within the
Data Centres. This in-bound traffic to the Data Centres may be metered or unmetered
(FRIACO).

e A Firewall Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which encompasses the Network Banking Agents.
The firewall DMZ incorporates a firewall farm, consisting of multiple firewalls, which
provide security and resilience of access to the NBS Agents and beyond to the Network
Banking Engines (NBE).

5.4 Connections between the Data Centres

The links between the Data Centres consist of two OC-3 circuits (155Mbps) utilising
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Switches at each end allow for traffic separation via
Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs), each with pre-defined bandwidth.

Figure 5-3 shows the network infrastructure at both Data Centres and the connections
between them.
